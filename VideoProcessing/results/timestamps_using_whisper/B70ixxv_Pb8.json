  "text": "On behalf of Ilri and Adventure 37, I'd like to welcome everyone to the second part of our webinar series. This one on One Health, the critical crossroads of animal, human and environmental health. How do we really scale up One Health? My name is Michael Victor. I'm the head of communications and knowledge management at Ilri. And just wanted to mention that this is the second in the series. The first one was focused on leveraging livestock to combat malnutrition. And I did put the link to the webinar in the chat so you can view it there. So just as we get started, it'd be great to if everyone could put their full name and organization on their name. So you just go to your name, click on more and you can then click on rename. So you should be able to rename and put your full name and your organization helps everyone identify who is here. You can also add your country if you want. We will be enabling closed captioning, which seems to help a little bit, but there's always often mistakes. So, but it does sometimes help. Remember to keep your microphones off when not speaking. I think most of the people we have as a webinar so you won't have to worry about that. If you can't see or hear, please close and restart the Zoom sometimes things get stuck. Again, we are going to be using the chat a lot so it'd be great if everybody could post questions or comments into the chat will have a moderator who will be able to feed questions to the panel when we have that. If you have questions to each of the speakers please put them into the chat and they can answer directly during the webinar. And just remember that the session is recorded. And any private chats are often often often visible to us as well. We will also be live tweeting. So please, you know, please recognize that and we'll be tweeting so you can also tweet. I use the hashtag please why livestock matter, which helps a lot maybe Susan can put that into the chat. Okay, great. So with that, I'd like to introduce Mark Mitchell to to kick us off and take us through the rest of the webinar. Thanks a lot and over to you, Mark. Alright, thank you, Michael. And I'm Mark Mitchell on the director of livestock and dairy activities with venture 37. And we're going to set the context for today's discussion with this short film. It concerns land use policies. And while at times they can be unenquanted and intended consequences, often at the expense of the ecosystems. This video is on the privatization of land and around the Mara Serengeti and Kenyan Tanzania and demonstrates how diseases can spread when wildlife, livestock and humans cross over into each other's spaces. It's an integrated approach and we take it away. Please start. It's a classic example of what happens when you're in a situation in Kenya. The Masaima Restitution in Kenya is a classic example of what happens when landscape policies are developed without a one health approach. This is because one health supports integrated management of landscapes that enhance sustainable coexistence of agriculture and wildlife. Many experts, such as ecologists, vets, public health professionals and others need to be involved in government and private sector decision making and planning processes. We're not going to be involved in the work of the land and the land of the people. We're going to be involved in the work of the land and the land of the people. Rebis, the threat to the community is a matter of pride. So, I put my hand on the ground. He okay's and report immediately to the office. This area is where they have been vaccinated. And he was with Rebis. He was with my husband. He was with the family. I risked my life to get him to be with me. He was with the family and the health department. He took the\ubc88p\u00e9 to the hospital and went to the hospital. Rebis is a virus and he's a grouch. And he also takes the N multifunctional insecticide which is NCF. The only thing he takes the N if not the insecticide is the N multifunctional insecticide. He's like a little baby. That's it. The choices we make about ecosystems have important consequences, sometimes unintended ones on human and animal health. A one-health approach helps reduce further destruction and fragmentation of wild repopulates, incorporating biodiversity values, while at the same time considering the health and nutrition needs of people. Okay, thank you. Now I'd like to introduce Christina Roselle. She is a scientist in the animal and human health program at Ilri. Christina holds a diploma of veterinary medicine and a PhD in biomedical sciences. She has led a number of projects on One Health and now leads a new Ilri-led BMZ investment on improving animal and human health in Uganda and helps conceptualize the BMZ-funded Ilri One Health Center for Africa, which we'll hear about more in our panel discussion. Her particular interests include research on the epidemiology of diseases in the interface of livestock, wildlife, and human health, parasitology, working with students well in the north-south and the south-south technology, and the knowledge transfer. And we welcome you here today, Christina. Thank you. Thank you for the introduction and sorry to everyone. We've selected Delia here today. I'm stepping in for her today. And yes, I want to talk about the role of livestock research at the One Health interface today, just to set the scene for the following panelists. And coming from Ilri, of course, our core business is livestock research, and we are working based on a number of opportunities and challenges that have been identified over the years. And one of the biggest challenges probably how to feed the global population in the future, because population growth is one of the biggest issues pressuring our planet. And we see that there's disparity between current meat or animal-sourced food consumption between high-income and low- and middle-income countries. And a majority of the population growth will happen in the global south in the future. That's also where a lot of the potential is for growth of the sector, for opportunities to reduce poverty, increase equity, and livelihoods. However, all these things come with a lot of challenges, and not only at a local level, but also regional and global level. That is, of course, the emergence of asymptotic diseases. We know that more than two-thirds of the pathogens, they originate in animals, and at some point in time, have a spillover event to humans. Also, increased livestock production comes with an increase of ox antimicrobials, or the livestock healthy, which comes with a lot of pressure on the environment and microbes, and increasing the risk for antimicrobial resistance. More livestock also means more methane, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions, and of course global warming, which needs to be limited. And of course, the more mammals for food or for eating that food live on this planet, the more we have environmental pollution, land and water degradation, which again increases the risk for spillover. So, some of the key one health elements that we focus on are to be prepared, to detect, and to respond. And all of them, just like in the one health Venn diagram, where all these three different circles overlap. Also, these three components, preparedness, detection, and response, they also overlap. They cannot seem independently. And I'll give a few examples today, and I think the following speakers, they will then go more into the details and give more examples from their work. So, to be prepared, we need to know where to put our money. That's always a big question by investors. We want to solve all problems at the same time. We don't know where to target investments. Often we come too late and try and solve problems when they're already there. So, data is one of the biggest issues we face in the global south. We don't have data to prioritize, we don't have data for surveillance and monitoring, and therefore we also lack data to target our interventions and limited resources. So, that is one of the major contributions that livestock research can make. On top of that, we have to utilize what we have. And that is a lot of local capacity. We don't have to take interventions that have worked in the north and implement them in the south and expect the same results. We have to utilize local knowledge, we have to localize local resources, local capacity, and try and build this capacity, improve this capacity, instead of trying to reinvent the wheel. And I think Bernard will talk more about this later. And by being prepared and investing early enough in data generation and building local capacity, we can actually save a lot of money. As these two examples show, investment in yellow in the right figure, investment in vaccinating poultry against avian influenza can really reduce the economic burden on affected countries. The second component is detection. And that's where biomedical sciences come in, of course, but also social sciences. And of course, we need to understand these different zoonotic pathogens. We need to understand where they come from, where they live, how they survive in the environment. Is it mosquitoes? Is it waters? Is it wildlife reservoirs? Is it livestock reservoirs? We need to understand the process from infection of humans and animals to the host immune response. So we can also be able to develop diagnostic tools and vaccines. And then we need to consolidate all this information that we have and develop strategies to target those. And one example is shown here on the right. That work is mostly generated by Bernard and Tim. We look at data on rift valley fever. We do entomological studies. We know animal reservoirs for rift valley fever. We know precipitation patterns. We know altitude. We have all this data. It's out there and we are trying to fill data gaps with our field surveys. But then this data needs to be consolidated. So that decision makers know, okay, we have a vaccine for livestock. Let's go to the high risk areas. And these are the ones in red. And we need this for many of the health subjects. And this is a good transition to the response. And the response is not just about having a vaccine ready. It's also about getting the vaccine to those people who need it. And COVID is one of these examples in a global effort and miracle. We have a vaccine already. But in East Africa and other parts of Africa and Southeast Asia, many people have not yet benefited from the vaccine. It's very difficult to get it to people, to have people accept the vaccine, to have access to governments are struggling with buying vaccines. And therefore, yeah, the vaccine is not available. And which leads again to a global problem of not having herd immunity through vaccination. COVID is just one example. This happens with a number of the health interventions we are researching. So these components, acceptability, accessibility, affordability, availability, and incentives are quite crucial in getting interventions or research into use. And that is also just as the way we're trying to generate data, getting interventions out requires participation by the end users communities. And I guess we'll hear a bit more about this, about rangeland land management in a bit. Finally, I wanted to highlight again, two of the recent publications that give very constructive advice to investors on where to invest. What research gaps do we still have? Where are the data needs and how we can intervene in preventing not only the next pandemic, but also preventing other health problems at the human-animal environment interface. These are also the neglected zoonotic diseases such as tapeworms, brucellosis, sleeping sickness, diseases that usually affect low and middle income countries. We also have a silent pandemic, antimicrobial resistance. So we're not just talking about the big scares. We give, yeah, an investment advice to a challenge, major anthropogenic drivers of zoonotic disease emergence. So this is my little presentation to set the scene. And now I can take questions if that is in the agenda, Mark. And otherwise, I'll hand back to you. All right. Thank you, ma'am. We're going to switch quickly to, let's see, Bernard. And I'm going to skip through this quickly so that Bernard gains a little time back. And if you are ready to go, Bernard, you can start talking to us about the policy process and the scaling out at your level. Thank you. Thanks, Mark. My name is Bernard Bet. I work with Ilri as a senior scientist, currently heading the One Health Center, which Christina mentioned. So I'm presenting this, focusing on how we are planning to scale up, scale out One Health practices and policies in sub-Saharan Africa. And I'm working with a big team of people, including Leigh Ann, Christina, Ashne, Delia, and Hung. This is a project which is funded currently by BMZ. So let's go to the next slide. Yes. So this is first of all to clarify or to set up the terminologies that we are using. When we talk about scaling, we really mean an ambitious process to expand the coverage of One Health. Eighth, through institutionalization, that's making sure that policy makers right at the national, sub-national levels are able to apply One Health principles. But also there's a component on horizontal expansion. This is involving many other players within the same levels of application. But in the process of scaling up, we are not just thinking of spreading out, we are only thinking of refining these institutions, these practices. Realizing that, we are not really here to start off from the beginning, but many other players have originally set up platforms and processes much earlier. So we're just helping to improve on the quality. The main issue though is to really identify what's that scalable unit. Because you know One Health is quite broad. We really need to identify what's the key component of One Health that can be scaled. So let's go to the next slide. And I give examples of vertical scaling. And this again, that's what I meant institutionalization. And currently we are looking at the platforms which were developed by countries, regional economic blocks, the tripartite, and many other players in the region. And trying to ask ourselves, what are the competencies? How are these platforms working? So we are using an evaluation tool that's called Network for Evaluation of One Health, which is classical, published, and it's being used in many places to identify those gaps in planning, thinking, working, sharing, One Health activities. And the main aim here is to identify which areas can we specifically implement interventions to make these platforms work much more effectively. The second issue though would be research for development. And this is where we're thinking of we want to demonstrate how new evidence can be used to inform decision making, but also to inform networking partnerships, so that it can really come out so clearly on which areas would those partnerships work better for disease control. So on the next slide, I give a small example on horizontal scaling. What we do here is basically about building graduate fellowship programs so that we can get more leaders, more students, more technical expertise being used in the region. And it involves training students within here at ILRI, but also helping local universities in developing new curricula on One Health. Through our research partnerships also with governments, NGOs, private sectors, we hope that in the process of us implementing research with them, those One Health competencies come out strongly and they get recognized as ways of doing business. But lastly also is we are really launching community outreach activities which aim to build capacities at the local levels, but also there's a frontline staff here, including community-based animal health workers or community health volunteers who are working in the public health sector. So all those people are brought on board to work together in the local levels. I think I have the second last slide which talks about the opportunities that we have to build all these activities. And one of them is the huge interests locally on building One Health platforms. And I think that interest would really help us to move on from there. There's also One Health platforms which have been developed, as I said earlier on, and the huge skilled manpower in mainstream government departments, which can be brought on board in building all these initiatives. But of course, as you know, there are many challenges and the main one of course is being funding levels are low. The other thing is conceptualization of One Health. One Health is quite broad and many people may not really define what we mean by a scalable unit. That needs to be determined for us to know where we begin from and where we reach in terms of taking it forward. The one thing that I also find very useful is to identify reliable tools for assessment. We keep doing, there are many tools which are being used currently for assessing scaling in many interventions in veterinary, even public health. But those ones have not really been fine-tuned to capture One Health, and those are the limitations that we still face up to now. Lastly, of course, One Health, as we know it, is very much on prevention of diseases. Of course, it can be used for management of diseases, but most of the time we want to use them for prevention. But we know communities and many people on the ground are really very much tailored towards using curative services and not preventive services. And that's this need for a change in mindset in terms of how those services are used. So I think I have only the two slides. One is on acknowledging partners, and we have many partners in this region. But the last one, which I want to emphasize, is we have had huge support from a CGI research program called FONH, just led by IFPRIP for the last 10 years. They have been helping us to do One Health, and it's coming to an end in December this year. So very much like to acknowledge the support that we have gotten from them. So thanks, Mark. That's the end of my presentation. Okay, thank you, Bernard. We're going to quickly switch over to a USDA-funded project and hear from Lasha and the situation they're facing in Georgia. Please, Lasha. Thank you, Mark. Greetings. Let me present Safety and Quality Investment Livestock, or simply Skill, Activities Under the One Health Principles. Skill-Predeced Project is financed by the USDA and implemented by the Land O'Lakes Ventures 37 in Georgia, with our local partner Georgian Farmers Association. Following Farm to Fork Principles project aims to support food safety and quality improvement, increase productivity and trade within the Georgian, Daerian, Beef Market Systems value chain. Next slide, please. As I mentioned, Skill, Major Task is to support market systems development. So I would like to focus on how the skill operates in the strengthening One Health approach in the market systems development context. System includes value-in-chair lectors starting from the input suppliers, farmers, processors, distributors, all the way to the financial consumers. But also on top of it, the market systems don't have that we say, we have a role to develop supporting functions, such as strengthening education centers, sectoral trainers, service providers, etc. And let me give you an example here. Recently, Skill trained call center operators of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Agriculture of Georgia in Animal Health and Food Safety Matters. And it was first for them ever such technical training. On the other hand, we try to strengthen local rules and regulations through capacity building of the related state authorities, development, market-led, safety, quality systems and mediating public, private partnership. As an additional example, we conducted the workshop regarding newly adopted regulation and animal byproducts. There is an disposal. Next slide, please. So what are our tools in the toolbox? As knowledge and awareness of the local sectoral actors was identified as one of the biggest challenges, we conducted set of the trainings in different wild house related topics. And let me give you some examples from this list. Food safety and hygiene principles that included HASAP system for data and preprocessors. We also trained all state and private slaughterhouse veterinarians in meat inspection. And as you see on the right in the pictures, the environment of the trainings varies from the actual practice in the processing plant or more in kind of community-based interactions. Next slide, please. Also, we tried to cover gap of developing education materials, such as for our case, manuals and booklets and guidebooks. For that activity, we had a small motivator, like 120 nanometer small motivator. It's basically all kind of people, large gatherings is still restricted for more than a year now. So we have to adapt. Materials will print in the distributed through our partners as well as electronic brochures are uploaded in the local farmers platform. One of our partners, let's say, was the National Food Agency and they disseminated these manuals to cattle farmers through their state animal vaccination campaigns. And here on the right, you can see example of one of our education materials regarding veterinary medicine products, which explains the health, one health and general health principles, as well as veterinary medicines, residues flow from animals to humans to environment. This manual also contains the information regarding antimicrobial resistance, but on more like a simple farmer's understandable language. Next slide, please. And here I have a list of the other materials, as you can see in the content of them. And I would highlight practical manual for the slaughterhouse veterinarians how to protect farm from the chronic disease, as well as manual or my vector disease prevention is also pending. Next slide, please. In order to promote those education materials, skill developed animated videos that you can see. These videos are simple way reflecting the key messages of the education materials. These videos were disseminated through the social media and popular regional traditions. And I believe that the strength of this concept was to provide awareness regarding the main highlights of that very subject, but also at the same time, aware target groups regarding existence of these materials to be either downloaded from the web platform or gained through the skill partners. So with this approach, we are able to educate target beneficiaries through the combined method of the videos plus manuals that do not actually require the gathering of further people. And it's also a cost effective as a challenge that we identified in the process, access of the electronic platform by the farmers is quite limited. But on the other hand, on the opportunity side, we think we're planning to translate those education materials into English, which are currently in Georgian to share amongst other venture 37 projects. Next slide, please. And basically that's the final slide. So we try to adopt to the to the existing pandemic situation by providing and disseminating knowledge regarding one health principles and related actions in livestock sector market systems. That's the way it is. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you, Lysha. And the last of our speak talks here, it will come from Medesa and the Illry Hill program. If you could please start that discussion. My name is Badasa Iba, work for International Livestock Research Institute, I'm a regular scientist. The topic I'm going to talk on is linking regular management to one health in Ethiopia. A regular is important for one health because this range land is a vast land area that cover the world service. And also it is a port millions of people's pastoralist who are depending on the range land is a rating of livestock production. And also it is good for ecosystem service functioning well. So that one health bring is this three components by including a range land health to improve the livelihood and ecosystem service for the community who are living there. One of the projects which is integrating the environmental aspect is HEAL. This project is actually the constant rule led by VCFs along with CCM and the Illry with the objective of to enhance the vulnerable community to have a sustainable well-being that the project is conducted in three countries, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, with an approach of bringing these three components, animal, human, environmentalists to have a good delivery service of one health service at the ground level for the pastoralist. And this project also engage different community levels including women, men to have to accommodate their need that to have a one health service delivery and also to have a cost effective approach for this one health service delivery. And as the end of the day, this should be a model or a solution of silver and silver service delivery that should be recognized by different stock and like a policymaker for the pastoralist as a whole. Most of the initiative of one health is lacking this environmental health. So HEAL make unique because of including this one health environmental through an approach of passport to the arrangement management. This passport to the arrangement have three stage and a different eight of different steps. So this actually a process that maintains a community management plan and improving the institution of this community a regular management management from this from Regland, there is a livestock disease distribution and also there are different Regland condition. So the disease and Regland condition are highly integrated or correlated. They are function together. So this PRM is bringing into the process of animal disease to be integrated well from, for example, if we take from our one site, which is for the Moeale district, how one health and the grazing are really linked together show us movement through concentration of livestock and high degradation of Regland shows us how one health is integrated. From this institutional role to bring together a different institution which are to act for one health center to learn from each other. HEAL developed MSIP for stakeholders to discuss a learning because of environmental health is broader so that to understand what Regland health means. So MSIP is a much like a stakeholder innovation platform where many stakeholders are really from each other to avoid the challenges of not understanding the whole environment from this Regland health. So the service delivery is to improve the Regland which are highly degraded or to maintain the Regland size as it is to have an educated posture. As a sum up, Regland health is a key improving the whole system of the ecosystem and the productivity of the whole area that improve the livelihood and the community as well so that bringing of animal, human, Regland health is a good to link to Regland management to have a wider impact of the livelihood of communities. So thank you for your question. Welcome. Thank you, Podessa. We've now heard from three different programs and how they are scaling one health in policy, training, public and private sector activities and environmental pathways. And we're going to change over to some questions now and I'd like to lead off by asking Bernard how they've been able to reconcile the different interests between their state code holders. We naturally find that there's a little bit of difference between what donors want, what local governments want and what last the owners want. And I'd like to hear your views on this process. Thanks, Mark for that question. So yes, you are right. Most of the donors or most of the development agencies usually fund those challenges or those issues which address epidemics, pandemics with international concern. Usually they look at risks which transcend countries and regions. But we find that the stakeholders or the people we deal with at the community level are very much interested in managing day to day challenges in terms of endemic diseases or things which we call production which may not really attract external interest. So but I think there is a win-win this room for win-win situation there because the support we get from external development partners which address pandemics and epidemics can still help in building universal surveillance systems or build capacity which might be used to manage multiple challenges at the same time. So in that way I think you can still find a common ground where that external support can still be used to build capacity even to manage local problems. Thank you, sir. Lasham will turn to you next to kind of follow the order of the speakers there. And curious how you're building capacity at the farm level to prevent the spread of zodanic disease. What are producers, the livestock owners' knowledge and awareness of one health challenges? How are they facing this? Well, Mark, as I mentioned during my presentation, one of the skill-developed education material was manual for main chronic diseases of cattle. And for Georgia that would be a brucellosis, tuberculosis and locus. So we developed the manual that contains the practical examples of the clinical science, disease prevention, also diagnostic practices. Manual also explains kind of existing regulations and also explains that this is very important, the primary actions to be taken in case of the disease suspicious before even the veterinarian's engagement. Also we put sticky posters of the disease clinical science and also key messages that are attached to the manual. And these owners of these farms that have been delivered could stick them on the walls of what the employees think around. So they will have always the major information in front of them, the abortion and other clinical science and also clinical science in humans as well. So they would understand that they might be exposed. So in my opinion that's the practical example how to aware farmers on one health issues and try to get them on our L.A.s. Thank you. And Badesso, we're looking at the environmental part of our tripartite and we diagram one health. Why is it challenging to incorporate one health into the environmental issues? Thank you Mark. Yes, it is. If you see many of the one health initiatives, the environmental health is lacking. It's neglected many initiatives. This may be because of this environmental research list, finding to have to integrate this and also it is not taken as like seriously as other disciplines like medical and also even to the maternal issue. And there are also these environmental health also have different theories which is not taken as to different areas. Like if we take a series of indigenous pastoralist which is sometimes they are conflict each other in some areas. So as this is the main point why environment is not as others. Okay. Thank you for that interesting bit of information. You know we labeled this as a hard talk session and so the hardest question I'm going to pose back to Christina where she led us off today. And as a thought leader in this field where does the focus on one health and livestock provide the greatest impact? Well there's not a silver bullet answer to that because the context of any health problem is different in each country. So I think the focus should be on the local context actually in which the animal diseases navigate and the pathogens navigate. And the reason why I'm saying this in South-East Asia for example where you have a much higher pig population, pigs as a livestock species would be of much more importance than cattle and small Romanians in East Africa for example. And maybe I would like to pass this on to my colleague Bernard who is more of a local leader in one health than I am. Thanks. Sure Bernard if you would like to follow up please. No I think Christina managed it well by saying you know it varies from one place to another. Maybe one thing that jumped into mind because I can see in your question there's a labeling of livestock and since we are thinking of one health you know livestock usually is considered to be under resourced in many places. And so I guess bringing in one health in that perspective might actually help to enhance service delivery not just looking at disease per se but also managing multiple facets of livestock service delivery. In this region for example you know many many remote locations there's a big challenge on that and so I see one health can really help us to reach into the those people who are considered to be left behind by previous interventions. Okay thank you. We have a couple of extra minutes is there are specific questions from the chat box that anyone would like to draw my attention to. Otherwise I'm going to jump to one of our other questions here. What I'd like to ask is each of you just quickly to give me a quick answer to say if which part of one health changes or the program implementation that you've dealt with has been the most difficult has it been with the local governments the private sector the veterinarians or the community animal health workers or the farmers themselves and Bernard if I could start with you which of those partners in all of this has been the the slowest to make change. That's a difficult question I would say government because you know if you look at the other actors which you have in the list if an intervention is really beneficial to them they'll adjust immediately you know a private sector farmers but for government you know you really need to put in place policies rules before everybody else come to the same table so I think for me it will be government. Okay and Lasha how would you talk about this question? That's tough Mark but probably for us it's the engagement of the farmers because to let them understand that something which is not always linked to their income sometimes opposite that matters for instance antimicrobial resistance, a proper use of the veterinary medicine products, a proposed waste of byproducts etc that could I mean this process is a slow process and needs more and more engagement from all the partners. Okay and the same question to you Bedessa what part of the partnership has been difficult for you? It's hard actually it is from a perspective of like because I've seen this environmental analysis because it is an understanding of a health aspect is somewhat different from Rangeland because it is a government and if you are low like we see from a pastoralist point of different organizations are there so in some of them also say government. Okay thank you and we have one question that's come in from Abdel Fatha and what are your thoughts on selecting for poultry or livestock that are genetically predisposed or resistant to any of the avian influences or other diseases and what's work is being done on the cross spreads for that process? I'm not quite sure who is best to answer that question if you'd like to speak up. Do we have someone who's been handling the selection of poultry and livestock for genetic and avian influenza? We already had a discussion on that in the chat this is Christina and I mean not speaking for ilry we are not working on on selecting breeds resistant to avian influenza we do that kind of work feeding and cross breeding disease resistant animals even genetic engineering to generate disease resistant animals but yeah it can work in the lab you still need to get it to the community so one of the examples I brought up was the damocatol from West Africa which is very small but resistant to trivanozoma infections and the mazai herders in East Africa really didn't like it because it was too small not considered a real cow so even though that that cattle breed was resistant to disease they opted for the disease so and we have other examples where we are trying to cross breed sheep that are resistant to worm infections and it's definitely a good biomedical or genetical approach to disease control and but it's others working on avian influenza breeding thanks I hope that helps a bit yeah thank you it looks like a good question has come up for looks like Bernard or Bedessa and the question is do non-confections form the bulk of reemerging or emerging disease burden that could benefit the attention of one health and management? What is being done to actually manage the introductions from wildlife? So I think that might be closer to uh uh Bedessa? Yeah uh in my perspective view because that's why we put participatory rangeland management bring to this one health approach to this rangeland management if we have integrated integrated management plan this all things should be at minimized to absorb this issue of health health for management actually the wildfire so now we are like if we take the pastoral area there is a wildlife there is a climate change there is a land health so these are under the umbrella of environment so we are doing a this year project by combining together having a strong integrated management plan to be integrated into one health. And I've noticed that LaShia would like to speak on that as well as we think through the question on this crossover from from wildlife. LaShia please. Thank you Mark so actually one of the materials that we also developed is regarding how to build the cattle farm and that also includes how to select the place a lot of about biosecurity measures and all the threats that come to the farm from the wildlife from the imported animals and other sources but and that's I believe is part of the answer as well how to separate or how to protect the livestock and therefore humans later on. Okay we're going to squeeze in one last question and um anyone can pop in on this answer okay what is the one thing that we could do today that would improve or motivate buy-in from one health around the world is it you know the livestock the livestock owners the funding the people were involved or is it the markets that we need to put pressure on how how would you guys discuss this topic who would like to go first how about Bernard you've been quick on the answers today. Oh well yeah that's that's really a big question so I would I would say I think if we get a stronger consumer demand on on on healthy and you know healthy landscapes and healthy food I think they can drive much more than just you know a supply side of things so I think the demand can really shape how more healthy value chains can be developed and I'm hoping that would really also force the private sector to come into into into the picture much more. Okay Lysin let's build on that private sector notion how would you answer the question? Well actually Mark now we're on the way of developing the market like the food safety and quality standard on primary production model and I agree with Bernard that yes they indeed the consumers awareness demand from the consumers needs to be there but also we should support the the production and primary production processing level to to meet up the standards the standards that sets the government but also especially the market like standards that motivates the the processors to to move on. Thank you sir well we've heard from our panelists now and I want to give time for a wrap up here from Christine Yost she is the Global Health Security Initiative Senior Livestock Advisor with USAID's Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance. She provides technical support on saving lives and livelihoods of livestock keepers and fisher folks. She liais with global humanitarian and resilience communities on issues regarding food security and food systems, animal health, emerging and transpiring diseases. She has over 30 years of experience and working in over 40 countries and so we'd like to use her expertise to put a final note on today's webinar. Christine please. Thank you Mark and thank you to all the speakers today I've really learned a lot. I want to highlight a few things I liked how the speakers were kind of organized in research policy and then really looking at practice. From Christina we learned about the importance of preparing, detecting and responding in one health approaches, preparing in terms of particularly focusing on localization, detection in both both the importance of the biomedical and the social sciences. You know it's important to remember that disease isn't simply a biological problem it's a social economic problem requiring one health approaches and then responding in terms of coordination and targeting at all levels. One of our main lessons from responding to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa that ended in 2016 was the need for improved coordination and it's a lesson we are learning again in the COVID-19 pandemic. From Bernard we were introduced to the One Health Regional Center for Africa with its focusing on policy and scaling and it was good to hear Bernard recognize the challenge of conceptualizing one health and the need to integrate that into scaling approaches both in public efforts such as the national One Health platforms as well as graduate programs and community outreach. And then from Lasha and Badessa we really had a nice look into examples of putting One Health into practice both in market systems as well as in terms of linking rangeland health to One Health. What came out from the discussion and the contribution of the participants for me is that One Health is not just an approach to research it's also an approach to practice, policy, capacity building that recognizes and supports the inextricable linkages between environmental animal and human health. As livestock experts we need to continually challenge ourselves to think about and address what livestock research and development means for the health and well-being of people and the environments in which we live and how often we should be asking ourselves are we collaborating with the ecological and human health communities. Thanks Mark. Thank you I'm going to hand back over to Michael now and he'll take walk us through our ending points. Thank you all for attending. Hi thanks a lot Mark and thanks a lot Christine that was really interesting. With that it would just be really great to hear from everybody if they can put into the chat just what were your main messages that came out of the webinar. Be really good to see what people want. And as people are as you're typing that in please type it in and we'll take a look at what you have. We will be having another webinar hopefully before the end of the year we'll let you know. All the presentation and the recording we will send out to everybody as well. So let's see, does anybody have any key comments? Andres had something about where can they find more reading about One Health? Maybe Christina could put some links there. We have a One Health page on the Illry website as well. The Georgia Steel Program has a Facebook page that will direct you to a lot of materials there as well and also to the Georgia Farmers Association, GFA. Excellent. Okay let's see if there's anything else. If not I think we've come to the end and perfect timing. Good job Mark. I'd like to really thank everyone behind the scenes. We had Madeline Botless from Venture 37. We had Tessa Martin from Venture 37. Morey from Illry. We had Susan and we have Jeffrey as well all kind of helping out and really helping to make this webinar series go. I'd also like again to thank Christina for really jumping in and fortunately Delia couldn't come today as well. But really this was a nice conversation and thank you everyone for attending.",
