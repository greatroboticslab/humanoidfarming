  "text": "Excellent. We'll get started here in just a moment. I want to take a look at our map so far for those that have been participating in the poll. So I think if we advance to the next slide, you can see that we have participants from all over the world. So please continue to send your responses into the poll and we'll actually use it for a few more questions throughout today's session. Now that we've given everybody a chance to join, I want to note that this session is being recorded and there is access to close captioning. You can find the menu for that on the bottom of your screen. And with that, we will get started here in about 30 seconds. Good morning. Good morning, everyone. Greetings from the World Food Prize in Des Moines, Iowa. I'm Mike Michener, Deputy Assistant Administrator of the Bureau for Resilience and Food Security at the U.S. Agency for International Development. I'm delighted to welcome everyone to this World Food Prize side event, Agricultural Innovation for African Sustainability and Resilience, hosted by the Board for International Food and Agricultural Development. I'm originally from Southeast Iowa and I am so pleased to be speaking to you in person from my home state where I've been attending World Food Prize side events in person this week. I can't tell you how proud it makes me as an Iowa to see the entire state embrace the legacy and promise of Norman Borlaug's life's work. I would like to thank Barbara Stinson and her team at the World Food Prize for hosting the Borlaug dialogues this week. I would also like to honor and offer congratulations to this year's laureate, Dr. Shakuntala Park Singh Philstead. We are so excited to celebrate her accomplishments together this week. USCID Bureau for Resilience and Food Security Chief Scientist Rob Bertram and I had the pleasure of interviewing Dr. Tilstead and last year's laureate, Dr. Ratan Law, yesterday in another side event. I'd also like to give thanks to Bifad for hosting this event. For those of you who may not be familiar with it, Bifad is a seven member U.S. Presidentially Appointed Federal Advisory Committee to USAID. Bifad was established under the U.S. Foreign Assistance Act and aims to help USAID bring the assets of U.S. universities to bear on critical challenges in food and agricultural development. I personally witnessed these contributions from the university community in visits to Feed the Future Innovation Labs at Purdue University and the University of Illinois last week on my road trip from Washington DC to Des Moines. I'd like to recognize and thank Bifad Chair Dr. Mark Keenum, President of Mississippi State University for his leadership of the board and I'm very pleased that Bifad member Dr. Pamela Anderson is with us today. Also in the audience are Bifad members Jim Ash and Mark McDaniel. We are glad to have you all with us today. Bifad's program of work includes advising USAID on the implementation of our global food security strategy. Given promising trends of sustained accelerated economic transformation in sub-Saharan Africa, Bifad wanted to better understand what is driving the sustained agricultural growth. They wanted to know if economic transformation in Africa was similar to Latin America and Asia and what role agricultural production and growth were playing in this transformation. So Bifad commissioned a study to explore the current evidence for linkages among agricultural growth, economic transformation and resilience to shocks, to distill lessons learned from country case studies, to examine the relationships to gender equality and women's economic empowerment, and to consider the implications for USAID programming priorities. We were extremely lucky that the best talent in this area agreed to support the study. We are pleased to welcome the study co-authors led by Dr. Tom Jane at Michigan State University who are here with us today to kick off a discussion that builds on other presentations at the UN Food System Summit Science Days and the Agra Forum. As you know, the Borlaug Dialogues this week are coming on the heels of the UN Food System Summit which emphasized the need for system level change to achieve the sustainable development goals. At the UN Food System Summit, USDA Secretary Tom Bilsack and USAID Administrator Samantha Power reinforced the US commitment to work with domestic and international partners to tackle hunger and poverty and build more sustainable, equitable and resilient food systems at home and abroad. The US government committed 10 billion dollars in multi-year initiatives to strengthen food security and nutrition for all, accelerate climate change mitigation and adaptation, and expand inclusive food systems at home and abroad especially for the most vulnerable. The summit highlighted the ongoing threats of COVID-19 conflict and climate change that have already increased poverty, hunger, and malnutrition across the globe with a disproportionate impact on women and girls. At the summit there was a recognition of the critical need for investments in science and innovation to achieve the SDGs and that's why the thematic focus area of research and innovation is so very timely and resonant in this year's Borlaug Dialogues. What brings us together today is compelling evidence of a strong linkage between agricultural productivity growth, poverty reduction, and food security. It's well established that countries with higher level productivity growth see reductions in poverty and have more resilient food systems. We also know that two types of investments are underlying drivers of agricultural productivity. First is an enabling environment of inclusive regulatory policies, infrastructure, roads, and power. Second is investments in research and innovation. What we hope to achieve today is a deeper understanding of how governments, donors, and private sector can influence these drivers of productivity growth. The questions we should ask are what is working well, what are some of the constraints, how do we achieve greater political commitments to these kinds of decisions and investments, and how do we foster great capacity coordination, communication, and connection to promote innovation? To lead us through these ideas, I'm delighted to introduce and welcome our moderator for today, Ms. Lulama Nidibungo-Traub. Ms. Traub serves as the chair of the technical committee for the Regional Network of Agricultural Policy Research Institutes, or RENAPRI. RENAPRI is an African-led, African-driven group of National Agricultural Policy Research Institutes. The vision of RENAPRI is to support National Agricultural Policy Research Institutes in Africa to be centers of excellence that guide and inform national and regional agricultural and food security policy issues. Ms. Traub also lectures at the University of Stelenvosh and conducts research with the South African Bureau of Food and Agricultural Policy, where her research interests include capacity building programs in collaboration with Southern African universities and government agencies, mainly focusing on staple food marketing and trade policies. Lulama, welcome and over to you. Great, thank you, Michael, and thank you for providing the context for today's conversation. As a representative of the RENAPRI network, it's really a great privilege to be on this virtual platform and join in such a critical conversation. What's equally exciting for me is to see the global audience that has joined us today. Based on the responses from the earlier poll and our registration list, we have participants tuning in from the far corners of the globe. Beyond the US, we have attendees from Cameroon, China, DRC, Ethiopia, Germany, France, Italy, Kenya, Lebanon, to name but a few. I myself, as you mentioned, Michael, am joining you from the beautiful wine country of Stelenvosh, South Africa. Welcome to everyone. Not only is our virtual room global in scope, but we also have a dearth of stakeholders representing national governments, nonprofit organizations, private sector, and academia. Beyond the insights of our presenters and panelists today, we aim to really tap into the deep expertise of our virtual audience. In this way, through the diversity of the collective, we aim to arrive at innovative and concrete recommendations on how to, number one, improve the capacity of African government ministries and agencies to promote technical innovation. Secondly, to achieve a balance, how do we achieve this balance in research partnerships between international research institutions and national agricultural research systems? And last and thirdly, but not least, is how can we then effectively communicate our research results back to policymakers in order to influence policy change and investments? So to begin, I would like to share today's program. Next slide, please. Great. Now that we've well and truly been welcomed, we want to start by setting the scene. And to do this, the authors of the BiFed report will present the evidence of the catalytic role of agriculture research and development in really driving food system transformation in Africa. This then will be followed by a panel discussion where our panel of experts will identify concrete actions that national governments and regional organizations, international partners and private sector can undertake. Through all of this, we want to strongly encourage audience contribution to the conversation. Through the interactive polling questions and the audience Q&A session, we really want to garner that collective thinking on this issues. And to do this, next slide, please. We would like to ask our virtual attendees to really use that Q&A function to post questions for the presenters or the panelists, use the chat function to share your ideas, answers to the questions that we're posing to the panelists, and or share any additional resources that you have that can contribute to the conversation that we're having today. And finally, to move this conversation beyond just this webinar, we really do welcome the audience to share your thoughts on Twitter using the handler food hashtag food prize 2021. Next slide, please. So to begin, I would like to now hand over to Professor Tom Jane, the lead author, as Michael had mentioned, on the by fed report. Tom, who besides being my advisor and mentor, is the University Foundation Professor of Agriculture, Food and Resource Economics at Michigan State University. He is also adjunct professor at the Indaba Agricultural Policy Research Institute in Lasaka, Zambia, a board member of Rene Apri, and was the founding, it was the founding co director of the Alliance for African Partnerships at Michigan State University. And in 2019, Tom was seconded to the African Development Bank to serve as the special advisor to the president. Tom, over to you. Thank you so much, Lulama. Thanks. Nice to see you and everyone. Mike Michener, thanks so much for your introduction. We're very grateful to the by fed and USA team for inviting us to share our results with this group. I was one of four authors of this report that we're going to summarize, and I'd like to just quickly introduce my colleagues who were, you know, really a pleasure to work with in this by fed report. First, let me introduce Louise Fox, who is with Brookings Institute and also UC Berkeley. Louise, welcome. Keith Fuglie, who is at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and my colleague at Michigan State University, Soji Adilajah. It's been a, so I'm going to turn over to them in just one second. I just wanted to say if I could boil down in one sentence what the main message of our report would be. It would be that one of the most crucial necessary conditions, not sufficient, but necessary conditions for promoting resilience and sustainable food systems and economic transformation in Africa. If you could boil it down to that one necessary condition, it would be technical innovation throughout the entire food system, you know, in African agricultural systems, but especially on African farms. And that is obviously easier said than done about how to get there because yield growth in Africa has really lagged behind the rest of the world. So I'd like to turn over to my colleague Louise to go into sort of the beginnings of our of our results. Louise, floor chairs. Thank you. Thank you. Could I have the next slide please? Okay, so what we're going to do in this presentation is really highlight two of the key messages from the report. And we will also summarize some of the priority actions that governments need to take to move forward in our view. Next slide. So we start with the macroeconomic high level evidence. We're looking back. And what we think is really important here is that our finding is that there is very strong evidence of two decades, in other words, up to the COVID period of economic growth, of poverty reduction, and of transformation of the economy that led to real improvements in material welfare in the region. And we think that this success was underpinned by two things, which we want to highlight today. One was strong agricultural growth. And the second one was measures that were taken within the economic policy, including measures for macroeconomic stability, and also measures at the micro level to increase productivity in sectors, and that created a much more resilient growth in Africa in the past two decades than Africa had had before. And this is what contributed to the improvements in material welfare. And so our bottom line, as Tom said, is that Africa needs to get back on this track in a post COVID year, and that agriculture and agriculture innovation are key to that. Next slide. So here's the first piece of evidence that you may or may not know, which is that during the period 2000 to 2018, sub-Saharan Africa was the growth leader in terms of agricultural production growth. Okay. Next slide. And what happened is that growth really supported and underpinned total economic growth in the economy. And you can see that in the slide on the left-hand side, where you have growth in the agricultural sector, which is in orange, and growth in the overall economy, GDP, which is in blue. And they track each other quite closely. We've done this analysis with different periods of moving average, a five-year moving average, and with the economy, with no moving average, no smoothing. And we see the same thing. And we think this pattern is really important because it says that agricultural growth can really support the economy. We also, on the right-hand side, show that agricultural growth supported a decline in the extreme poverty rate. I should note that these projections were made before COVID. Maybe they're not going to be so optimistic now. But what you see is that starting in around 2000, you see a major change in the slope of poverty reduction, an increase in poverty reduction, which is related to the increase in agricultural growth and GDP that you see on the left-hand side. Next slide. Now, we think that the increased resilience of African growth and is what contributed substantially to that upward trend, which we just saw. What you see in this slide is the standard deviations in growth. And this is in 10-year periods. So there's a 10-year moving average between 1990 and 2020. And what you see is that both GDP growth and agricultural growth had a lot of volatility, a lot of ups and downs. And these ups and downs were really harmful to the economy and to agricultural families and urban families, non-agricultural families, in terms of their ability to improve their material welfare. Because, of course, the downturn slowed down growth a lot. So what you see is starting around 2000, the volatility started to drop because of this improved management that we spoke about, including support for the agricultural sector. And so you see the volatility dropped a whole lot and stayed low, which allowed this growth performance that you saw in the previous slide until 2020. What's interesting in 2020 is, of course, you had a major decline in GDP. So you do see an increase in volatility in this graph on the blue line. But agriculture did not show an increase in volatility. The agricultural sector helped again support economies through the COVID period and continues. Okay. Over to you, Keith, please. Thanks, Louise. So I would like to take a few minutes to just zero in on some of the growth performance in the agricultural sector specifically in agriculture in Africa and highlight a second major finding from the Bifad report is that agricultural growth in sub-Saharan Africa, despite its improved performance, still relies heavily on simply bringing more cropland into production. And that in order to sustain this growth over the long term and really move economies toward economic transformation, agricultural growth will need to transition from this resource dependent growth to productivity led agricultural growth. Carol, next slide, please. So just to review some of this history and looking at not only total growth, but where that growth is coming from and compare Africa with the experience of developing countries as a whole, we do see so these two bars for each of these graphs show total growth for two periods in agriculture. So this is average annual growth rate in the three decades prior to 1990 and the three decades since 1990. And you can see that across all developing countries, agriculture was growing on average at about 3% per year in real terms. But in most developing countries, there was a major transition in where that growth came from. In other words, instead of coming from bringing more land or intensifying inputs on existing land, more and more of that growth came from raising what we call total factor productivity. In other words, if we look at the total output for relative to the amount of total land labor and capital inputs, developing countries were getting that increase and that growth out of raising total productivity. And a lot of that is coming from technical innovation, improved efficiency and the use of inputs, adoption of new technology. Sub-Saharan Africa, now we see did increase growth performance from a very low 2% to over 3% and as Louise pointed out in the last two decades to almost 4% in agricultural value added terms. But that growth relies heavily on resource expansion, especially bringing in more crop land rather than raising yields on that crop land or rather than raising that total productivity, that green part of those bars. Now, what do we know about the growth process is that to get an agricultural sector that's productivity led requires sustained investments in innovation. At a core of this innovation system are public investments in agricultural research and development. And this is a way that agriculture really differs from other sectors of the economy in that we need this locally adapted technology suitable for local farming systems, local agri-logical conditions and you can't simply import technology directly. So we need this local or national capacity in agricultural research to do that adaptation. In addition, as Mike mentioned in his opening remarks, very important is this enabling environment so that new technologies once they're developed can rapidly disseminate and be adopted by farmers. And that enabling environment includes extension services as well as market reform so that prices can signal resource allocation. And of course, we need that market infrastructure, rural roads so that farmers when they increase surpluses, you know, can bring their produce at low cost to market. Next slide please, Carol. So despite this sort of lagging performance and productivity, well, first I'd like to just highlight the underinvestment in agricultural R&D that has been pervasive in Africa for several decades. And in these figures, I show four measures of agricultural research in Africa relative to other developing regions, Latin America, West Asia, North Africa, and Asia here refers to South and East Asia. So whether you look at total public investment by all the countries in the region in agricultural R&D, whether you look at R&D as a percentage of agricultural GDP or R&D per farm worker or R&D per hectare of cropped land, Africa has lagged behind other developing regions. And this, you know, as Tom mentioned, is one of the key criterion, a necessary condition to sustain productivity growth in agriculture. Next slide please, Carol. Now, despite this sort of lagging performance in productivity led growth, we do see and we highlight in this report, some countries that appear to be making a successful transition and we and we delve down a little bit into what those countries are doing in terms of policies that appear to be causing that transition to a productivity led growth. And one of these emergent success stories is Ethiopia. Now, Ethiopia is a very poor country, had decades of political instability within the country and conflict. But in the early 1990s was able to re-establish peace and macroeconomic stability within their country. And they embarked explicitly on a policy of what they called agriculturally led industrialization. Investing in the agricultural sector, they were able to accelerate growth and sustain growth at over 5% per year since the early 1990s. Now, a lot of that growth has come from resource expansion, more land and labor and production. But we also see movement toward raising productivity of those resources and we see evidence of adoption of improved crop varieties, better use of fertilizers and so forth, by farmers, by smallholder farmers in Ethiopia. And this period of accelerated agricultural and economic growth was associated with substantial improvements in welfare indicators, reductions in poverty, reductions in child stunting, and a fall, a significant fall in the proportion of the population that were food insecure. And that's basically the proportion of the population not getting even 2000 calories a day for consumption. A second case story, next slide please, Carol. Another important success story, emerging success story is Ghana. Now, this Ghana is in a very different part of Africa. So now we're moving from the highlands of East Africa to the lowlands Guinea-Soviet of Ghana. Now, in the 1980s, Ghana too was able to enact a series of political and economic reforms that established stability and good conditions for growth. And they were able to accelerate agricultural growth to almost 4% per year in the decades since then. And especially over the last decade, we see agricultural growth really coming from raising total productivity of those agricultural resources. And we see evidence again of adoption of improved crop varieties and farming practices and even sometimes the spread of new crops in Ghana. And in the report, we focus especially on what's been going on in northern Ghana, the Guinea-Soviet area, historically the most impoverished part of the country. And there we also see this strong correlation between increased agricultural growth and productivity and declining rates of poverty and child stunting. And in just one decade, the incidents of extreme poverty and child stunting were cut in half in northern Ghana. Next slide please, Carol. So what did these countries do that enabled them to move toward this growth path and moving toward a productivity-led growth path for agriculture? Well, critical were investments in innovation. Both countries essentially doubled their spending in agricultural R&D early in this growth process. And Ethiopia in particular built Africa's largest agricultural extension service. Both countries also liberalized markets, letting prices for agricultural products float to equate supply and demand and help guide resource allocation in the economy. Both countries invested in rural infrastructure to connect smallholder farmers to markets. And as I mentioned, and Louise mentioned macroeconomic and political stability were very important in stimulating that enabling environment for growth in these economies. So we see in Africa, when these sets of policies are implemented and sustained, that it is certainly possible to move, to accelerate agricultural growth among smallholder growers and get these kinds of inclusive economic growth processes that are so important for successful economic transformation. Well, thank you very much. I'd now like to turn over the presentation to my colleague, Soji Adilaja. Soji, over to you. Thank you, Kias. Louise made a very strong point that Africa went through significant economic growth and agricultural growth simultaneously pre-COVID and that the growth was consistent with the principles of economic transformation. And I think Kias made the point that there's a need to transition to productivity-led growth. What I want to do is to highlight the importance of resilience to shocks and stressors, which seem to have emerged strong as seeing to have the potential to really, really negatively affect the future of not only agriculture, but the overall economies of Africa. If you go back and look over the last 10 years, you see that the incidence of both conflict, and I'm talking about things like terrorism, and talking about things like pastoral violence, and things like that. The incidence of those things have really stepped up in recent years. Also, there's a growing incidence of things like droughts that really directly affect agriculture and food security. The evidence is very strong on those two grounds. So how does one deal with the fact that the incidence of these things continue to rise? I think it's all about building resilience. African economies have to step up their capacity to mitigate the effects of these negative shocks, not only from climate and conflict, but also economic shocks which threaten stability, livelihoods, and create poverty and also affect food security. Now, we need to understand that these things are also root causes, if you sort of mean for conflict in the first place. In other words, the absence of food security, limited livelihoods, poverty, these things create kind of a feedback loop or a virtual cycle which erodes the process of economic transformation. There's evidence that African countries, while they may be resilient, or have been building up their resilience, also their resilience levels are not high enough, and this may explain why some of the countries are in fact fragile. So the point, the big point that I'm trying to make is that resilience thinking, resilience strategies, principles of resilience need to be considered as we talk about this transformation and this transition toward productivity-led agriculture in Africa. And that's it. Thank you. Thank you, Soji. Carol, next slide, please. Okay. This is our last slide, ladies and gentlemen, before we hand back to Lama. So we're just trying to focus on the way forward and give some ideas of both for African governments as well as development partners about the way forward. So we stress that these five bullet points here are not sufficient conditions, but they are necessary and that there really has been under provision of these aspects for a long time and that will really need to change. So the first one is strengthening national R&D systems, agricultural R&D systems. The second one is improving the coordination between the national and the international R&D systems. The international R&D system has a lot of good technologies and practices that can be brought into different environments in Africa, but they need to be adapted. And given all of the diversity of farming systems in Africa, this adaptive R&D system can't really be done by international systems. It has to be done by the national R&D systems. And so this coordination aspect is crucial. John Lineman, I think, is going to be talking a lot more about this when he when he comes. Third issue is strengthening extension systems, both public and private. Keith showed how Ethiopia has made great progress in promoting total factor productivity growth in agriculture. It's not a coincidence that Ethiopia has half of all of sub-Saharan Africa's extension workers that one country. Fourth issue is policy. I think we all agree that in order to get the incentives for African farmers to adopt new technologies and new practices, the policies need to be in place that allow the private sector to bring these technologies closer to farmers and to promote adoption. And then lastly is this point about capacity. Good R&D systems and good extension systems don't just come out of nowhere. We have to have well-trained local people to man and provide the person power for these institutions to function well. And this brings in questions about how to develop the capacity locally to enable these institutions to benefit from good staff. So these are not new recommendations. They've been around for a long time, but they are important ones. And our hope is that we can get a kind of a coalition of support around mobilizing support for these interventions. Chair, thank you so much for allowing us to talk about these issues. Give the floor back to you. All the best. Thank you. Thank you, Tom, Louise, Keith, and Sergey for really setting the scene well. What strikes me from your presentation is the key message of agricultural central role in really driving economic transformation in sub-Saharan Africa and this need for the region to transition from resource dependent to productivity-led growth. This evidence that you presented has really set us up nicely to now really turn our attention to addressing the how. How does sub-Saharan Africa make that transition? Where should we be focusing our investments? And I know, Tom, you and your team, you've alluded to the necessary condition of technical innovation, but what types of partnerships are needed to effectively develop the necessary local adaptive technologies? And to really help us tease this out a bit, we have a distinguished panel of experts with us today. Starting with Dr. Aparejita Goyal, a senior economist in the office of the chief economist, Africa Region of the World Bank. Aparejita's work focuses on microeconomic issues of development with a particular emphasis on agriculture productivity, poverty, shared prosperity, technological innovations, and digital economies. Also joining us today, we have Professor Kevin Yurama, the senior director of the African Development Institutes and formally senior advisor to the president of the African Development Bank. Kevin has served as the inaugural managing director of the Quantum Global Research Lab. He was the executive director of the African Technology Policy Studies Network and also the inaugural presidents of the African Society for Ecological Economics. Welcome Kevin. And finally, we have Dr. John Lynum, emeritus scientist at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture. Dr. Lynum has over 30 years experience in tropical agriculture, research in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. He has served as the economist in the CASAVA program at CIAT from 1977 to 1988, and he then joined the Food Security Division of the Rockefeller Foundation based in Nairobi, Kenya, where he worked till 2004. So a warm welcome to you all, and I'm really looking forward to a rich discussion this afternoon, this morning. So to begin, I would like to invite Aparajita to please share with us some further evidence, and in so doing, address our first question on what can African governments and international development partners do to rapidly and sustainably improve the capacities of government ministries and agencies to promote that technical innovation, that critical condition or that necessary condition of technical innovation on African farms in order to then effectively respond to major shocks and stressors affecting Africa's food system. Aparajita, welcome and over to you. Thank you, Alama. And first of all, thank you so much for inviting me. I wanted to bring together policy lessons from two recent reports that very much placed some of these questions at the heart of the analysis. The first book here looks at public spending priorities for boosting agriculture productivity growth in Africa, really sort of asking the question, how much African governments are spending on agriculture? What do they spend on, and how can we improve the efficiency of scarce public resources? The second book looks into the science, technology and innovation agenda, really sort of providing practical recommendations for boosting both the generation and adoption of new technologies. So the main messages are really kind of clustered around three broad themes. Next slide. We all know that African governments have politically signed up to certain target targets, such as allocating 10% of total public spending to ag and raising the agriculture growth rate to 6% at the country level. And so we show that, first of all, not only are most of the African governments not spending enough on agriculture, their budgets also tend to have a pretty narrow scope. Next slide. Input subsidy programs, for example, dominate public spending in many countries in Africa, and there's a real need to kind of reprioritize the composition of spending towards high return public good investments. The one category of spending that consistently leads to high returns is investments in ag and ag. Next slide. We find that benefit cost ratios are in the range of three and four, and even in small countries, the benefits are high enough to justify some sort of investment around adaptive research. And more importantly, national and international systems are very much seen as complementary. So when you have stronger national ag research systems, there's greater impact from technologies that emanate from the international system due to greater diffusion. And yet, if you look at what's happening to spending on ag R&D, next slide, it's actually going in the opposite direction, right? It's actually shrinking in absolute terms. So there's this innovation paradox, if you will, in the agriculture sector, where the activities and the investments that have been consistently shown to have high returns are not the ones that are necessarily being prioritized by African governments in their budgets. Second, we go into ways or modalities to discuss or improve the functioning of national ag systems. Next slide. And here there are sort of three elements that we particularly focus on. The first is around stable and diversified sources of financing. The second is around incentives to scientists, right? Both in terms of recruiting and retaining talent. And the third is making research aligned towards user needs. I mean, the good news is that, you know, not all the burden needs to fall on the public sector. So the private sector is actually becoming increasingly active in this space. And we really need sort of need to think creatively about public-private partnerships that can address some of these key elements in terms of, you know, improving the functioning of national ag systems. The third is, you know, very often, and we all agree that sustainable you know, ag productivity growth requires the steady supply of new technologies. But, you know, farmers need to be willing and able to adopt them. Next slide. And so the demand side of this innovation equation is critically important. And we, you know, look at sort of on the ground constraints that prevent farmers from adopting some of these, you know, great technologies. So for example, you know, information asymmetries or credit market constraints or tenure insecurity are just some of the constraints that farmers face on the ground that might prevent them from adopting these new technologies. And so again, we kind of, you know, provide practical interventions, recommendations that can help alleviate some of these on the ground constraints, you know, be it through digital technologies in improving extension services, you know, land rights or human capital investments. Again, I'm happy to, you know, discuss more in detail as the program advances. But I do want to also thank Keith Fugli and Tom Jane for collaborating on both of these books. And just want to, you know, say that both of these books are available freely on the World Bank website. And they sort of really kind of put together some of the state-of-the-art empirical evidence around these issues, but also practical recommendations around, you know, policy reform. Let me stop here. Back to you. Thanks. Thank you, Aparajita, for really clearly demonstrating this need for increased investments in agriculture R&D. You know, as Tom mentioned earlier that this is not a new message, but given the evidence you've just presented, this message really bears repeating. And as you showed us, you know, investments in knowledge generation are shrinking in sub-Saharan Africa, and that's a worrying trend. And so to that end, Kevin, I'd like to turn to you and ask you, given your experience, what do you think African governments and international development partners can do to improve the capacity of our national government ministries and agencies to promote technical innovation? Kevin, over your thoughts. Thank you, Lulama, and thanks to all the panelists and also the delegates. I think a lot of the points have already been raised in the presentations and by the immediate speaker just before me. We've all heard now how agricultural productivity is heavily dependent on technical innovations in that sector. But when you look at Africa, we find that Africans are not investing. African governments are not investing quite enough in technical innovations and in the agricultural sector in general. We do have, you know, continental agreements that has been reached, like in the Maputo Declaration to invest 10% of GDP in the agricultural sector. But this is not happening. African governments are still investing less than 1% of agricultural GDP on agricultural R&D. And we all know that research and innovation, research and development drives innovation, drives the technology that we haven't all talking about. So the summaries that Tom gave are basically not new messages, but key messages that we seem to have been missing out, especially endogenizing that message. And African governments stepping up to invest in making R&D work for Africa, agricultural extension work for Africa, building agricultural policy research institutions so that we can have home-led, homegrown policies that are addressing the agroecological systems and peculiarities of the continent. So my first recommendation would be for the African governments to demonstrate political commitment by investing in natural agricultural R&D, extension and technology development. It's not all the time that technologies developed from outside are adapted to different agroecological systems. And the points we have seen now with regard to low technology adoption is all a clear testimony that we need to invest more in building local capacity to be able to develop our own technologies. And to do that, we need the right policies, the right regulatory frameworks, the right incentives, local content policies that will prioritize technologies that are homegrown and developed in Africa, for Africa to ensure that that sector can grow. Another major thing that needs to be done by governments is to focus on building national agricultural innovation systems. If we don't have the systems and the framework conditions, the education system, the research systems, the technology development and the innovation incubation systems, there are several things within national systems of innovation that Africa still needs to do quite a lot in order to be able to grow that technological capacity within the continent. And Tom and Co have already raised the issue about prioritizing demand-driven and adaptive agricultural research and innovation and technology capacity development on the continent. Given COVID-19, one of the other things we've seen is that IT systems, digital systems, actually help to spur innovation, especially amongst youths and women of Africa. They've risen to the challenge in many other sectors, and agriculture is a sector that you find a lot of social innovations happening. So governments need to prioritize that digitization, creating the infrastructure that allows digital innovations to happen. The information technology infrastructure that's required, these are rules that governments need to play in order to allow the private sector, the African youths and women and global partners to come in and play in this sector. And then of course, this cannot not happen without active participation of the private sector. So governments also need to focus a lot more on creating enabling policies that allow the private sector to come in. And de-risking investments in this sector, in technology development, in technology transfer into the continent will be another key thing that needs to be done. And the final point I'd like to make is what I've already talked about. Let's focus on the greatest asset for Africa, the Africa's youths and women. African youths make up to 60% of the African population, 45% of them are below 25 years of age, are very innovative and are always pushing the frontiers, trying to create social innovations to happen. So we need to change our land use systems. We need to have targeted policies and public investment platforms that will allow this kind of innovation and unleash the innovative capacity of the African youths and women to be able to drive the systems forward. Thank you. Great. Thank you, Kevin. Thank you. I always appreciate the points that you raised in these conversations. I especially liked as an African, I have to say, this notion of endogenizing this message. And it really does put the onus on us as Africans and our national governments to really drive this agenda and these points that you raised. So now that we've heard from both Aparejita and Kevin, what we would like to do now is to turn it over to our audience by going through a polling question. So as you guys can see on the screen, the question that we're asking is given the conversation that we are having so far and the evidence that's been presented, in your opinion, which factors are the most important in contributing to high performance public agricultural research institutes in Africa? Is it A, institutional autonomy, performance incentives for scientists, stable and diversified funding, public private partnerships, international R&D linkages, management accountability or human or organizational capacity? Please select three. So the poll is open. And we would like to watch in real time. What does our audience think? Okay, it's looking as stable and diversified funding is coming out as top. We see performance incentives for scientists, public partnerships, private partnerships, human and organizational capacity. So while these responses are coming in, Kevin, I'd like to turn it over to you and say as you're watching these results come in, which would be the three that you would have chosen? Thank you very much. I think there's a high level of agreement from what I've just said and what I'm here seeing from the poll. Having stable and diversified funding for Africa is definitely number one in my own categorization. And that stable and diversified funding is for me a larger share of it needs to come from Africa, the African private sector and the African governments. The second one of course is public private partnerships because without a private sector playing in the sector, it would be very difficult for governments given the limited fiscal space in Africa to fund the whole innovation systems that I've been talking about. And finally, human organizational capacity, building institutions, building organizational capacity is definitely, for me it will have a tie with the number one because even if you have all the funding and you don't have the institutional capacity, you can't endogenize the innovations I will continue to have to struggle with innovation diffusion on the continent. Thank you. Great. Thank you for that. Parajita, your thoughts on this. Is this how, given where our audience is polling, is this how you would have chosen? Yes, I think this is a pretty good reflection of my preferences as well. And you know, I think the question about prioritization is a good one. Like we all know, I think, what needs to be done. And I think the how is important. And I think the focus on implementation of some of these recommendations is important. Great. Thank you. And thank you to the audience for providing us your insights and your thoughts on this. And this is going to get recorded and stored. So thank you for participating. Now, what I'd like us to do now is to move on. And in doing this, I would like to invite our next panelists, Dr. John Lynam, to our virtual podium to address the second question that we're asking our panelists. So Dr. Lynam, it's widely understood that the international and national agricultural research systems play an important and highly complementary role in promoting productivity and enhancing technical innovation on African farms. Given your experience, do we have the right balance in support in our support to international research and national agricultural research and development and extension systems? And related to that question, in your opinion, how can we achieve greater coordination between the international and African national agricultural research systems so that these systems result in greater technical innovation on African farms and in the wider food system? John, welcome and over to you. Yeah. So it's good to unmute. First awarding, my wi-fi seems to be a bit unstable, but it comes back after about 10 or 15 seconds. And what I want to focus on is essentially Tom's last slide of how to think about an R&D institutional architecture in sub-Saharan Africa. And I have quite limited time, so I'll just focus on one or two comments for each of the slides, but you should read the rest of the slide. So this first slide simply draws on Carl Eicher, and I will focus on these three institutions for a functioning R&D system in sub-Saharan Africa. Eicher basically argues that there must be a balanced capacity in each leg of this three-legged stool, and there must be functional horizontal interaction between all three. Next slide, please. But currently, as has been stressed, currently each institution faces quite different capacity constraints as discussed here for the three. Next slide, please. As Amparajita sort of emphasized in her slide, capacity development in sub-Saharan Africa faces the small country problem. And this is argued in the past for regional approaches to particularly capacity development on the continent. Next slide, please. Over time, there's been a continuous search for vertical integration between the CGIR and national programs. The closest to a functional integration was a brief period at the turn of the century with SROs as key coordinators in this integration between the CG and national systems. Next slide, please. Next slide. Okay, it says my case a bit unstable. There are a number of drivers in this loss of an integrated architecture, particularly the move of donors away from regional approaches, and the move of the CGIR downstream, forcing a disarticulation between the CG and particularly NARs from the continent. Next slide, please. The back of the slide, yes. The argument is for a coordinated change agenda involving NARs, CGIR, and aid agencies. This agenda, as expressed here in the slide, focuses on capacity development in all three legs of the R&D stool, a return to regional approaches and dedicated capacity development programs, but with a central question of whether there can be a coordinated shift to system research in African R&D, particularly as expressed in the new reform strategy of the CGIR, and as well in donor strategies. Okay, let me leave it there. Great. Thank you, John, for your insights. I particularly because I went through your slides earlier and what I particularly appreciated was your point on the need for regional approaches and networks to address what you were calling the small country problem. And so with that, I'd like to also invite Parajita, just in one or two minutes, to answer that question that John was responding to, do you believe we have the right balance in our support to international and national agriculture research and development extension systems? And how do you think we can achieve greater coordination between international and African national agricultural research systems? Parajita, your thoughts? Yes. So, I mean, we don't have the right balance, but and by that I sort of am referring to investments because as we've now seen from both the, you know, earlier authors as well as the other panelists, you know, there is that gap in sort of investments around Agar and D and whether those are for national systems or for international systems, you know, I think that there is a severe investment gap. So, so to that extent, you know, if I'm referring to the balance in terms of funding, we don't have it, and I think that there's hope for doing much more in terms of, you know, bolstering up the national research systems. I think the important point is the complementarity that when you have strong national systems, you have greater impact from the technologies that emanate from international systems. And I think that's sort of a key point to make. And there are, of course, lessons that we can learn from Brazil's and Rapa, for example, you know, India's experience and so on. So I think that there are success stories out there that we can draw some lessons from over. Great. Thank you, Parajita. Kevin, would you agree with Parajita that we do not have this balance? And if not, how can we achieve it? Yeah, thank you very much. Definitely, I do agree with her. We don't have the right balance, because for decades now, we have seen significant amounts of investments going into the agricultural systems. But we still see that the national systems, agricultural systems are heavily underfunded and quite often spend a lot of time trying to seek for the funding. So for me, the current model of financing we have mostly favor international organizations as primary grantees. And then the African institutions maybe are secondary grantees or even researchers, for the researchers that have been given the grants to do the research. So the investments in locally and adaptive and national agricultural systems is very, very key. And I have already highlighted in my first intervention the need for Africa to invest in that quite a lot. But there are challenges for African countries even to make that investment, because you find that the cost of capital is very high. The interest rates on loans because of the ratings of countries, the cost of capital is high. And then that makes it difficult for African governments to even invest as much as they should. So for me, I think it's not either or there needs to be collaboration, but there needs to be a rethinking of the global financing architecture to help African governments to be able to balance the investments as opposed to the investment that goes into the CGIR systems and so on. So that's one thing. And then for me, there was a need to establish agricultural science technology and innovation trust fund for Africa that needs to be centrally managed by agencies like the ABB or the EU or whichever one we choose, so that it will reduce the bottlenecks of people trying to get funding and running around to get funding to be able to, I mean, the local institutions to do this. So it's a balance, but we need to find ways of trying to bring the two together in order to address the challenges that we're all facing. Thank you. Great. Thank you, Kevin. And just before we move on to the final question, John, do you have any further comments on this question? John, over to you. You're muted if you're answering. John, it appears we might have lost John. So in the interest of time then, we'll go ahead and move on to our third and final question that I will be posing to our panelists. So before we wrap up, this final question that I would like to ask is really near and dear to my heart, right? As a representative of a network of African-based agricultural policy research institutes, I'm really keen to hear the insights to this question. So the question that I'm asking our panelists in these one or two minutes, I would like each panelist to share their thoughts on how can international development partners, for example, USAID, FCDO, promote effective coordination between international and African-based policy research institutes so as to enable policy analysis to translate more effectively into policy action and implementation. So starting with Kevin, what are your thoughts in this regard? Thank you, Lulama. I think my thoughts just continues from what we've said and addressed in the first and second question. First for me, these agencies have been doing quite a lot. We need to, they need to encourage African governments to formulate their own agendas and encourage them to implement them. So basically, bilateral agencies, donor agencies, development finance institutions should be going to implement agendas that are already set, national agricultural action plans that are developed by the countries themselves. That creates a rallying point where everyone has an objective instead of setting agendas that we think that they need will be addressing the development goals of countries. The second one is what I've said already before, which is refocusing our funding models to benefit longer term institutional capacity development and agricultural science and technology systems that are locally owned and locally groomed. Once that is set up in that national agenda, we need to support that and then everybody again rallies around that to help bringing together so that we can achieve scale. Because what is happening now is that everyone is doing so much for so little in different dispersed ways and we're not able to achieve the scale that is needed. So then the final one for me on this point, given I have only two minutes, is that going back to having a centrally organized and implemented trust fund or multi-donor trust fund, whichever type of trust fund that we would want to consider, where all the big agencies come together, set agendas with the African governments and have intermediary institutions, uncle institutions within Africa implement those agendas and then the funding can achieve the scale that I have been talking about. Thank you. Thank you Kevin. Same question for you John. In your opinion, how can international development partners really promote effective coordination between the international and African based policy research institutes to enable effective policy analysis that will translate into effective policy actions and implementation because this is us trying to really deal with that implementation issue. John, over to you. Okay, let me just focus on the case of IFPRE. I did a review and impact study of their work in science and technology and the conclusion since policy impact is essentially conditioned on country level capacity and analysis and flow through to government decision makers. The real effectiveness of the programs was when they introduced country level programs that provided a sort of a back stopping to local policy research capacity and basically sort of filled in the cracks. So, you know, and these were primarily supported by USAID. So the question I think going forward is that the role of IFPRE in the new reform process of the CJIR is uncertain and how policy research will be structured. So that linkage I think is now under review and with possible changes going forward but how is the question. Thank you. Thank you for that and thank you for posing these questions. You've got me thinking. This is a very good interesting question. Parajita, your thoughts on this? Yeah, I'm not going to repeat because I agree with Kevin and John. So I'm not going to repeat the points that they've made but I think one more thing that the multilateral organizations would I think add value in is trying to serve as a broker between the governments and the private companies in really fostering that public-private partnership. Right? Like what is that joint venture for example going to look like, you know, what are some of the elements of that partnership, you know, and sort of gets back to the implementation and the how question because you know, I mean, there's no silver bullet. We all know that and institutional capacity building takes a long time but we just have to, you know, keep at it. Right? So we know the elements, we have to keep at it and I think another key piece that we miss, I think in this conversation is the private sector. So bringing that in. Thanks for that and I think a lot of our conversation has been weighted heavily towards, you know, governments and what can governments do but I agree with you. I think we need to also be bringing in that private sector element as well because they can in a way facilitate some of this implementation that we need. All right. Thank you guys. I thank you to the panelists. I thank you for fielding these questions but in the interest of time what I would like us to do is to wrap up the panel discussion section with one more polling question for the audience. Right. Next slide, please. All right. In this question, this is an open-ended question and what we're doing is asking the audience how can we and by we, I'm talking about the collective week, donors, national governments, private sector, more effectively promote technical innovation on African farms and the broader food systems. And I'm starting to see some of the answers already coming in. So I see here better coordination and providing platforms, use local partners, public, private sector to scale out and promote, remove barriers for adoption and scaling through policies, build human and institutional capacity. This is brilliant. This is exactly what our panelists have been sharing with us. All right. Thank you for that. I see direct delivery for farmers, processors, marketers through extension and private industry-led education and training. Great. Please keep those responses coming in because the BIFED team will be collating this information that you're sharing with us. All right. Thank you for that. Now, just in the last few minutes, I would like us to transition to the open Q&A session. I believe questions have been curated for the panelists and we'll use the last few minutes just to kind of go through some of those questions. Sorry. I'm just closing out my screen here to see. Okay. So we've got a couple of questions. One question for John, from John La Borde, for Keith. First question is, do you have any insights into the categories of R&D? Which categories of R&D had the largest impact on productivity increases? Breeding programs, agronomy cropping systems, mechanical systems, under the broad umbrella of R&D, where should funding be targeted? Keith, if you would like to answer that question. Yes. Sure. Thank you for that question. I think the evidence on impact of research so far has really favored the crop improvement research, which includes breeding as a major component, but also agronomy that goes along with making, you know, getting the best, you know, the management practices to get the best potential out of crop varieties. So that's what the impact evidence really favors, is that, you know, we're getting very high returns from crop improvement research. Now, part of that is because it tends to be a little easier to measure impact of research in crops, particularly if you compare, you know, measuring impact of research on policy is much more difficult, or even on nutrition. So there is some bias there, but at least what we can say is, is that the investments that are being made in crop improvement have generated and are generating high returns for African agriculture. Okay. Or apologies, I was muted. We have time for just one more question. This is a question from Patricia Rosenfield for anyone that's on the study team and or Aparejita. The question is, what is the role of farmers and local communities in leading and sustaining agricultural transformation? Are these lessons from earlier discussions of the signal role of agricultural development in leading growth from work by Clifford Walton, Vernon Runtan, Francis, Ada Chaba and others in the 1960s, 70s and 80s? So either Aparejita or anyone on the study team, if you would like to feel that question. I think it is important in African countries that the voice of farmers and rural people be strengthened. It's very difficult for national government or government in general to be accountable if you don't have a very strong agricultural community to have voice. So I think investments of even public funds in all the names and farmers so that they can help to build some of these accountability structures is very, very, very important. The tendency is to see agricultural voice as a detraction from good governance by governments that are not so honest. But I think it has to be within the purview of government to strengthen the voice of the agricultural community. Relatively speaking, in many of the countries, farmers themselves are not very wealthy and there's people that tend to be wealthy, tend to be the ones that have the greatest voice. So deliberately strengthening the voice of agriculture is important. Great. Thank you, Soji. All right. So there's going to be one last question and I'm going to be a bit cheeky as a moderator. I'm not supposed to facilitate conversation, not necessarily add to the conversation. But there was a question from an Emmanuel Irandi and the question he asked was how can collaboration between research institutes, universities and African governments be strengthened and backed with policies that would translate into innovative research findings into action to improve food security in Africa? And I'm going to answer this question just because working in an African based agricultural policy research institute, this is the question we do wrestle with on a daily basis. And we have to, as as a nationally based institute, I feel that the onus is on us really to develop that relationship with our national governments to and we do this by ensuring that the research output that we're developing is world class. We do this by ensuring that the research we develop and engage in is relevant and answers the questions that our policymakers have. And it can demonstrate the impact of the various decisions that they have to make. So that's my short and brief answer to that. Emmanuel, I'd love to follow up with you maybe offline on this question. So feel free to email me this. All right. So with that now, I would really like us to turn this over to Pamela for our, to make our final closing remarks. But before I do that, I'd really like to just thank the panelists and the presenters for, you know, the wonderful work and the wonderful conversation. So to introduce Pamela, Dr. Pamela Anderson is a member of the by fed by fed and previously served as the director general of the CGI AR international potato center in Lima, Peru. Dr. Anderson has also served as a senior entomologist and coordinator of the tropical white fly IPM program at the international center for tropical agriculture in Cali, Colombia. Prior to joining the CGI AR system, Dr. Anderson spent two decades working with national programs in Latin America, including at the national agriculture university in the Nicaragua upon returning to the US, Dr. Anderson served as the director for the agricultural development program of the bill and Melinda Gates foundation. Dr. Anderson over to you. Thank you. Thank you, Lulama. And good morning, everyone. I want to start out by once more thanking the authors of this wonderful report. Tom Jane, Louise Fox, Keith Foogley and Adesoji Adela. If you haven't had a chance to read the report yet, I would urge you to go do so. It's timely. It's important. It is extremely rich in data evidence and analysis, and it is very clear. The authors have left us with two key messages. The first one, which Louise really went over this morning, is that indeed, there is an agricultural led economic transformation going on in Sub-Saharan Africa. Between 2000 and 2018, as she explained, Africa had the highest agricultural growth in the world. That growth was widespread across the continent. It was resilient and it was highly correlated with economic development in Sub-Saharan Africa. That's the good news. The second message that they have left us with, however, is that the agricultural growth that's going on in its current form in Africa is not sustainable. In that same period from 2000 to 2018, 74% of that growth, as Keith explained to us, came from area expansion, more land under cultivation, and only 26%, only a quarter, came from agricultural productivity growth. Going forward, that is not sustainable if we want to continue to see economic transformation in the continent. The overarching implication of this is that Sub-Saharan Africa needs to quickly transition to an agricultural growth model that is based in agricultural productivity growth. We need to see farmers continually taking up a constant stream of improved agricultural practices and innovative technologies. That's going to be driven by a stronger enabling environment, infrastructure, but most particularly policy reform. For most of the countries in the continent, this agricultural productivity agenda is going to require a much, much stronger research, development, and extension system. John Lyman has said to us that as we go to the conversation about these implications, there's nothing new. We've been talking about these things for decades. We've been talking about strengthening the national system's capacity development policy reform. But I think what this study has laid out anew for us is why these issues are so critically important today in the urgency that we get back to them. Over the last year, the study team has done an incredible job in coordination with our executive director and support team in rolling out and discussing around this report. Essentially, the discussion has focused on this last key message and the implications and the challenges that are around that. We've gotten to the how-to questions. These are the conversations that we need to drive now. It's what we've taken up again this morning. The how-to questions on how do we convince governments and development partners to increase political and financial commitment for our D&E systems, including political institutions and capacity development? How do we get better linkages and connectivity between our international and our national R&D systems? How do we turn the policy research into actions on the ground? We had a wonderful set of panelists and a rich discussion. The messages that they were giving to us this morning, Kevin and Apaita said, we absolutely need to increase the public investment, the political commitment to strengthening the R&D systems in country. We actually are going in the wrong direction. The investments are falling. We need to see them reversed and increase. We need to lean more creatively and effectively on the private sector. We need to get incentives to draw talent into these programs. John, in talking about the linkages, in addition to saying that, yes, strengthening the R&D and E system is a precursor to getting this balance. We need to have strong partners on both sides. He gave us a caution about the small countries that we've been putting too much of our attention to some of the larger countries in Africa. We probably need to go back to the regional organizations that were strong around 2000 and build R&D systems in those regional areas. Kevin has told us in response to development partners that we really would benefit from setting up a multi-trust for the African RD and E efforts, that this is going to increase efficiency and scale. I think a lot of the conversation that we need to have now going forward, because the study is very clear and compelling, but we need to get to the how to, how are we going to compel these governments to commit politically and to increase investment. What is our role as international development partners in supporting our African colleagues as Lou Llama and Kevin said in these indigenous efforts that they need to work on in their country. There is a rich set of how to questions, and that's what we would like to see table and going forward as we continue to talk about the outcomes of this report. I want to thank the panelists for the very, very rich discussion and Lou Llama for the excellent job that you did in moderating this interesting session. For the last couple of minutes, I do want to go back and contextualize this study in the broader food systems conversation that is all around us. As we go forward into this food systems paradigm, which is necessarily and appropriately more complex and complicated, we need to make sure that we do not leave this important focus on agricultural productivity growth behind. There are many colleagues in our community who truly feel that the productivity agenda is passe. That's what we did last century. We need to get onto the new business now. I think what this study has done in a very compelling way is argued that is absolutely not true. The agriculture productivity agenda is key and critical. It's the cornerstone to our food systems. As we move forward, we can't afford to leave it behind. We need to double down. All of us need to at the same time be asking more of our productivity research agenda. We cannot anymore just look at the linkages between poverty reduction and economic transformation. We need to be demanding that the productivity agenda be contributing directly and driving progress in our other goals, improve nutrition, improve resilience, improve sustainability, more equity. We need to drill down and constantly be asking these questions. Are these practices and these technologies that we're generating through the productivity agenda, including and empowering women and youth? Are they regenerating our natural resource base? Are they improving resilience? Are we drawing sufficiently on agroecology intensification? In terms of nutrition, what are the opportunities for increasing productivity, not just for the staples, but for the critical nutrient dense foods that we need in our food systems? Do we understand the linkages between productivity and increased food affordability? I think at this point, all of us have heard this horrific statistic that today, well actually pre-COVID, three billion people on this planet cannot afford a minimal healthy diet. This is unconscionable. So how do we understand and guarantee that as we increase productivity, we're understanding the pathways for how that links in to increased food affordability? So we have huge challenges in front of us and even many more opportunities. So again, I want to thank the study team. I want to thank all the panelists and the moderator. I'd like to thank Deputy Assistant Missioner for joining us, the World Food Prize Foundation for hosting us, Clara Cohen, our Executive Director has conceptualized this session and our BIFAD support team led by Carmen Benson has organized it. And mostly we want to thank all of you who have joined us today. Thank you for your engagement through the polls, the questions, the comments, and I can see from the chat box that this conversation is going to keep going on on the sidelines, which is exactly what we wanted. So you're going to get one more email with a survey. We're asking you to please take two to three more minutes to give us feedback on this session so we can continue to improve how we're putting these forward to you and organizing. But thank you everyone for joining us today and for this wonderful, rich session. Thank you. Thank you Pamela. Thanks everyone. Bye. Bye bye everyone. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Bye. Thank you.",
