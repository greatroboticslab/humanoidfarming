  "text": "What's up guys? Just wanted to show you the stump grinder that I've rented About a month ago. I rented this thing and Granted I think around a hundred stumps in nine hours. So this thing is an absolute workhorse It's made by Beretto. It's the 30-sg model I rented this at Central rental in Russellville is around $250 for eight hours You can pick it up at two o'clock on Friday and it doesn't have to be back in until eight o'clock Monday morning. So basically From two o'clock until however late I want to work on Fridays and all day Saturday all day Sunday And then take it back Monday morning. Now you can go over the eight hours. It's all prorated So say for example, I go sixteen hours, then that'll be five hundred dollars You guys can do the math on what it would cost you if you went over an hour or two hours or whatever It's got a pretty good size motor. It's a 31 horsepower Vanguard you can see the key and the choke and everything's right there all your other controls are gonna be right here On the handle and it's all pretty much one-handed stuff. So I can right here where the The wheel is that cuts the stuff That's what this is gonna be right here So I can push it down or raise it up and then this joystick is back to back So it'll start cutting and then you just go back and forth on the stump This button right here engages the blades This right here is gonna be your forward and your reverse and of course it's on tracks So you can turn with one hand however you want to do it on that right there It's got a pretty good size tank on it I believe I went through two tanks of gas when I use this thing for nine hours now You do get it on full and you do take it back full. It's got some pretty good teeth on it There's three stages to the teeth So even though the teeth look completely round you can undo this bolt right here Put it down a little bit turn it go back up and tighten it back up Then you got a whole new side right here So once you start rounding the top down then you've got another Third here and then another third here So basically it's got three notches to where you've got you can cut for a long time on this thing But anyway, this thing's a pretty good size unit It'll haul it'll fit in any trailer and I hauled it with a half ton truck on my trailer Didn't even know it was back there. Here's a couple. That's a stump. I just did There's another stump that I just did so you can see it leaves a pretty good pile of shavings behind Anyway guys, that's it. Like I said get down to central rental if you're looking for a stump grinder my neighbor lady paid a guy $400 for two hours worth of work, and I think he might have done 20 stumps So you can do a lot of work with this thing Anyway, we're clearing out this piece of property right here for a shop and some of these trees that are cut down this thing Here's just making easy work of these stumps But I'm gonna do a video of that stump right there after I get done talking to you So if you want to sit around and watch me chew that stump up you're more than welcome to but if not guys I'll catch you on the next one.
