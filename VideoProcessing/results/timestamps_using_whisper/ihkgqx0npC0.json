  "text": "Good evening. Welcome to the farming podcast brought to you by private property. My name is Mbali Wonga and welcome for joining us this Tuesday evening I almost forgot I was about to say Thursday evening clearly. I'm rushing into quarter two already But welcome for joining us this Tuesday evening today show is a bit interesting because we get to speak to someone who's Build their career within the agricultural sector But doing something slightly different not being a farmer not being a marketer but we are speaking to an Agri journalist slash photographer who's also had an agribusiness within the agri valley chain So we're gonna get some insights into the different or alternative farming methods that are available To ensure that our beautiful sector that we all dearly love Which is the agricultural sector remains sustainable for the long term I think it's important to contributing towards food security, but at the same time being sustainable But I'd like to introduce our guest today Her name is Marinda. No and she is like I said an agri journalist slash photographer Let's get to know about who she is and her role to the agricultural sector. Marinda. How are you doing? Great. Thanks for having me and thank you to all your listeners and viewers great to be here. Thank you Thank you. I'm sure this is going to be interesting conversation So I really can't wait but before we get into the nitty-gritty Marinda Please just give us a short introduction what you've done in the agri industry Especially with your compost making business etc and what you do now as an agri journalist etc Great question. Thank you very much My composting or my agri career actually started as a packaging technologist It was a export table grape company um exporting grapes to to the eu and to europe and beyond and They wanted to convert from conventional farming to organic farming So the farm Was very sandy soil. So what needed to be done and Especially in organic farming is that you need to build the soil structure and organic matter The best way to do that is composting So I was sent on a composting course to austria And I completed the composting course there and then I started um with edli relinges. We started reliance compost, which is now a national Composting company providing organic compost to quite a few farms and Landscapers and so on. So that basically was the base also of of organic farming and sustainable farming is the compost and then I actually started writing about composting and organic farming and that led to a career in in journalism took me to media 24 to new magazine and house genoet and then pre-lensing and event writing agricultural articles on anything ranging from Kinoa farming to goat farming and alternative farming systems in south africa Wow, so but what is the what does alternative farming systems mean? Are we talking about changing soil and rather farming and compost or You know the the the new term or kid on the block is hydroponically Etc using growing medium, etc This is regarding into crop production, but maybe moving on to livestock. What are some of the alternative farming methods? But if you could just explain that concept broadly so we could understand I think alternative farming is is looking at historical conventional farming But looking at it from a different angle or farming better or smarter And it can also mean alternative farming systems such as vertical farming If you live in high density areas and you don't have land surface that you farm vertically you Rooftop farming we see that beehives are being kept on top of skyscrapers so people farming in water acroponics hydroponics People farming oysters avalon and seawater kelp and then also freshwater farming so Alternative farming is not only looking at conventional farming and doing it differently in terms of organic But it could also be totally different Farming systems, you know What are some of the upsides and downsides of having to explore alternative farming systems? You mentioned for example Instead of farming like the old traditional ways people can now farm vertically It sounds very fancy and technical. Does it come at a high price? Etc. You spoke about bees being kept in skyscrapers You know what type of infrastructure and Investment is required in that and who looks after the bees at the top of the skyscrapers You know what I mean so what are the pros and cons of alternative farming systems? um well The reason for alternative farming is that the old or historical ways of farming Is not working anymore. You see that conventional farming is they need to to add more chemicals they need to increase the dosages but also um our export markets are are starting to demand less and less chemical sprays and The standards are very very high in terms of what for example fruit farmers are allowed to use and spray On the apples and pears and citrus that goes to international markets So from one hand, there's a demand from customers to reduce chemical and other input and also it becomes costly but also um We need to look at our resources our waters are water and soils being diminished So from that point of view, we also need to look differently or look for alternative ways of farming um So there's pressure from both sides both from the nature and the resources we have available and then the markets itself That demands that we look the demand that we look differently to to how we farm um And then also we need to develop new markets. We we want to start farming different products um We need more bees to pollinate the more Almond trees and blueberries that that are being planted in south africa. So you find that from one industry Another industry grows and you also find that farmers need to diversify even more in terms of the product range that they have available So, um, I don't know if that answers your question Yeah, I mean you spoke about From your answer, you've also just alluded to, you know, the reason why alternative farming methods are critical Is that they help us preserve our natural resources, you know And that being water and soil which is such big components into the farming industry And if I think mentioned that you've just done a bit of work or research around water and soil Can you share something something about those two elements for us? I think the two the two is very inter interrelated to each other. Um The example that I mentioned was the That when you put nutrients when you give nutrients to the plant and water and if there's not a good soil structure Your water will and your nutrients will leach out So what you need to do and what certainly what what south africa needs to do is build the organic matter content in the soil what that means basically is adding A composting in the soil or on top of the soil mulching That not only helps with the evaporation of moisture from the soil It prevents weeds growing in terms of the mulch that you put on top Um, but it also helps to create a soil structure It creates aggregates if that's the word I've used that help to maintain soil in The moisture in the water so your soil quality and soil structure goes hand in hand with the top and the amount of water that you use um, and then Yes, but it depends on which soil type you use and also which crop and how you are you water Are you manage your water and what type of irrigation? So there's many other parameters in terms of water usage that one can look at to reduce the amount of water that one uses Yeah going back to uh compost merinda because you ran a business Within the composting and I suppose some of the key insights that you're sharing as well Are you know real life or lived experiences within your compost business? Um, and you mentioned that you know, you saw the compost two farmers as well as private individuals in the home gardens um And i'm just thinking I mean as as a farmer who's just farming on fast stretches of land Um, you know that once you farm more sustainably, I'm sure compost Might not work for him or her. Um, you know, unless they try different methods to preserve soil, etc But um, do you think for professionals who are uh farming? You know in the backyard gardens or sorry individuals who are growing food systems in their backyard gardens, etc How how can they preserve their compost time and time again because sometimes as a farmer myself? I get queries from individuals saying oh my crops died What happened and then you know, that's in their picture Um, or someone would say I just bought a new house My you know, I can never grow anything in this in this backyard garden. What's wrong with the soil? You know, is the soil too red or yellow or whatever the case is and people sometimes need advice so um You know for people then maybe who are not sure about their soil compositions and want to go into compost and maybe just Do the two uh or mix the two in their in their private spaces? Um, how can they preserve compost? How can they ensure that you know, they can grow healthy food? Um for the for their for their own individual or family consumption Sure, it's uh, it's a lot of questions in in one. Um in I'll try and give you lots of answers as well. Um Um Composting and using compost is just one way of adding organic matter in the soil or adding plant matter back into the soil Because you need to feed the microbes and the soil life that's inside the soil You don't necessarily only have to use compost. You don't have to buy compost if you don't have it, but if you've got Leaves or grass or weeds Um, you can you can use that all all of those are organic matter that you can put back in the soil something else in terms of crops dying and Using companion planting or making use of a system or method called companion planting Um is also beneficial companion Companion planting means that you plant certain plants next to each other The one is the natural repellent of pests of the other So it means that they that attract certain insects that will That are predators of pests and it also means some some Plants actually secrete stuff in the roots that actually help Manage soil health. So companion planting is planting different plants together that are beneficial for the other ones growth or protection um So composting is one aspect of of farming or soil health But there's also other aspects such as using mulch mulch is a layer of organic matter Whether it's old leaves or grass or cuttings or whatever So using that on top of the soil to prevent weed growth That is for example, that's another way of of preventing moisture loss and preventing weed growth using a mulch um And then um companion planting uh as I've mentioned it also attracts insects. That's important to reduce your insecticide inputs What are the There's so many questions in one but composting you don't need and and composting is not always practical or viable in terms of cost For you Of a huge price. Yes. I'm commercial scale Ah, thank you before I move on to the next question. I just want to Encourage any of you watching at home this evening. We are joined by marinda low. Who's an agri-journalist? slash photographer And I suppose in trip in the composting space Our agri-paneer should I say and today we're talking about alternative farming methods and earlier on if you missed some critical points that you mentioned is that um, she highlighted a few of Examples of what alternative farming methods are so If you missed the first part of the show, you could definitely catch it On our youtube channel, but please comment. Um, ask any questions that you have to marinda Let's you want her to clarify specifically on farming sustainably on alternative farming methods conventional farming or organic compost Yeah, this show is for you marinda. I just want to find out With your and I'm just thinking with the farmer's heads Yeah With the composting business and for people that are listening to you and maybe would want to try Being in the composting industry or start their own compost business And you mentioned the word organic in some examples that you explained is every single Compost in the composting business is it is it is it a hundred percent organic? So when you're going into the business, do you have to be certified organic because I know to be organically certified requires some um Someone to go through what a certification process of some sort I think we need to distinguish between organic farming and sustainable farming organic farming is um It's when when you go through a certification process to get a label that you can put in your product That gets sold as organic and organic product in a retailer So the retailer might have some standards and they might be organic body that might have standards and then your product is certified organic so it's to farm organically More linked to a certification system to farm sustainably is to look after the resources that you put in whether it's Looking at the chemical inputs. It's not necessarily an organic that you're not allowed to use sprays or insecticides or weed killers or so But it's the sustainable use of all your inputs um Something else I just want to mention we we focusing on on organic farming and and composting and soil based but We alternative farming systems could also involve Farming in and with water and that that is aquaculture, which means your plant is is physically in that in a liquid medium It's physically hanging in water. So the the roots are suspended in in the water um, but um and aquaponics is um aquaculture actually sorry i'm wrong way other way around is that you you farm Um, you farm fish or you farm crustacea or corals or something. So it's it's water animals water plants that's being It's being farmed or often in combination with plants so that the nutrient rich water of fish Let's say use that example is then fed through two herbs and other plants Which then purify the water and use the nutrients and then the purified water filtered back to the the animals that the Fish so it's a closed loop system not always closed loop, but it's it's a water based system so Alternative farming systems could intel farming on land, but it can also intel farming with or in water Wow, so moving on to something else I think maybe could also that could also come much closer to home for our audience this evening is that Also, you have like a non-conventional career, right? It's not a traditional um line that one would pick up based on the The skill set that you have like photography and you started writing first and then you moved into Journalism, etc What are what are some of the non-farming? opportunities that exist in the agricultural sector You know based on your experience and looking at you how your career has also turned Excellent question. Um in terms of photography. What is interesting when I was researching Writing articles for south africa dot co dot z a I wrote about farming and and agricultural commodities in South Africa and that was translated into all 11 South African languages It was a huge project But the absence of good photos of South African farmers and South African products and South African Commodities that I realized is also a huge opportunity that there's not a lot of images available, you know of Trout cages, you know, we try to being bred and Things like millet in South Africa, you know In terms of non-agricultural opportunities in within the agricultural sector Um Sure, there's a lot. I'm thinking of venues, you know, if you wedding venues training venues If you want to train farm workers, um You know, how to prune how to How to trim the hooves of your goats, you know that kind of training venues I'm thinking of restaurants coffee shops And farm stores Uh, something else that's probably non Non farming but definitely related to agricultural commodities is processing I mean if you've got a huge tomato farmer and your market is satisfied with Saturated with tomatoes and you sitting with tomatoes then preserving those products is secondary secondary industry Whether you jam it dry it pickle it Um, you know, they you know further processing of agricultural products Um, certainly agritourism is is huge and I think that that's also in terms of people wanting to buy property I think that could also be an option to look at is is how can I use this property also? Not only to farm but as a destination a probably a tourism destination It could be people wanting to take part and see what happens on the working farm But it might also be people wanting to escape the city and just experience fresh farm air so there's so many aspects of of Agriculture, um that doesn't us. No, that doesn't necessarily involve getting your hands dirty. Um",
