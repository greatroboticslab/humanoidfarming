  "text": "This is the Genesis No-Till Drill. Let's cover why it might be the better solution for a lot of you trying to plant food plots or gardens or switchgrass as you work on your habitat for deer or wildflower pollinator mix so you can attract butterflies and bees and birds for your property to be healthy. Scenario one, cultivate your land. You're going to buy a tiller or a disc and you're going to turn that earth and you're probably going to make more than one pass to get the soil ready for seed. Step two, plant the seed. Step three, run a cultivator so you get that right seed to soil contact. At least three attachments, at least three passes if not four or five, a lot of money, a lot of time. Scenario two, take the Genesis No-Till Drill, put it on your three-point, fill it for the seed, go plant, one pass. That's it, one step. I want to say it's harder but it's that's it. You just take a No-Till Drill and go right into the ground and you're done. So you decide if you'd rather use more attachments or fewer, spend more time or less time but let's talk about this No-Till Drill. The discs are seven and a half inches apart so that's your spacing for your rows. Of course you can skip one to make it wider. You've got four models in the nominal widths of three foot, five foot, eight foot and ten foot. There's a weight rack that you can add suitcase weights to to really penetrate through hard pan. There's a towing kit. There's quite a few options as you look at the listing. Whether you think you want a No-Till Drill or not, check out all of the plant-thing attachments we have at GoodWorksTractors.com. There's free shipping to 36 states. There's a no worry guarantee if you just email ahead of time and tell us what you need. We'll give you our recommendation. GoodWorksTractors.com. Thanks for watching.",
