  "text": "This is the science of improving crop yields and assisting management decisions using high technology sensor and analysis tools. Welcome to agro-adventure channel. This video is on one of the agricultural trend, Precision Agriculture. Precision agriculture, as the name implies, means application of precise and correct amount of inputs like water, fertilizer, pesticides etc at the correct time to the crop for increasing its productivity and maximising its yields. This also known as site specific crop management as needed farming, satellite agriculture and precision farming. The five R's of precision farming. The five R's of precision farming include applying the right input at the right amount to the right place at the right time and in the right manner. Precision farming techniques. Precision farming or precision agriculture is a modern management strategy that employs the details of site specific nutrient management, remote sensing, global information system, global positioning system, variable rate application to precise manage the production input. How does precision agriculture increase agricultural efficiency and productivity? Precision agriculture increases efficiency and productivity by enabling farmers to target their inputs such as seeds, fertilisers and pesticides to specific areas of the field that need them the most rather than applying them uniformly across the entire field. This targeted approach can help farmers save on inputs as well as increase crop yields and quality. How does precision agriculture help reduce input costs? Precision agriculture helps reduce input costs by enabling farmers to use their inputs more efficiently and effectively. For example, farmers can use sensors and mapping tools to precisely apply fertilisers at the right rate and location. In addition, precision agriculture technologies can help farmers optimise their irrigation practices which can save water and energy. Conclusion. The global precision farming market is estimated to reach $12.84 billion by 2026. With climate change impacting farming in a big way and unpredictable natural disasters such as floods and drought becoming regular events and the world population growing unabated, precision agriculture is here to stay.
