  "text": "Hey everybody welcome back to the channel today. We're gonna do some container gardening Full disclaimer. I've never done container gardening before I did do a video earlier Man that's my that's my little crowd out there they they cheer me on so I Did do a video earlier on Which you call it when I planted my garlic and I did use grow bags so that was the first time I ever used grow bags and This year so the only plant in my backyard garden. I Plant it less than what I normally would and obviously I started way more than what I needed So normally I just throw those away, but this year I decided hey, why not use them and try something different So I'm gonna do some container gardening today First things first when I was deciding on what I wanted to grow in container I took a look outside and I said well, I got Brussels sprouts. I'm not too keen on Brussels sprouts, but I Grew them anyway here in the backyard garden. I want to try some different cooking methods with them If you got any recipes for Brussels sprouts, please link that below, but I Figured I got enough Brussels sprouts I looked at the The kale anything that's cut and come back I'm not gonna grow in containers, but I got plenty of it out in the garden kale collards Lettuce those are all cut and come back. So I thought about it and I said well the broccoli. I don't I mean I have maybe I don't know 18 plants out there, but I Love broccoli. So I'm gonna try to grow some broccoli in containers Another thing that's great for container gardening is Flowers I didn't start a lot of flowers this fall, but I did start calendula and so I have five calendula Transplants left so I'm gonna put all five of those in containers Which would be cool because then I can move them around and I can I can put them where I Where I think they need to excuse me where I think they need to go and I don't know. I mean, I'm new to calendula growing, but if it gets too cold I can bring them inside so Same with the broccoli, you know broccoli can't stand that that frost on it, you know And I'm gonna cover the the ones that are out here in the garden to keep the frost off of those but I think it'd be really cool to just grab the bucket or the container and take it in the house and not have to worry about the frost so Anyway, I'm gonna take you over here to the table and then we're gonna get started I'll show you how I'm filling the containers and I'm transplanting the starts into the containers. All right. Well, this is where the magic is gonna happen I got five pots here and I don't buy these I just save them from when I buy but I think there was roses in these and then Oh There's roses in these and then I have some bigger ones that I'm gonna plant the Broccoli in that I think I had trees in those and so I just saved the little containers and They come in handy when I need to use them down the road So what I did here look in there. I got pro mix down in there and then and then I I use this top sole mix right here To add into it Then what I do is I mix that top sole Down in there. I give it a good little mix Doesn't have to be you know perfect or anything So I get that in there and I want to fill this up to about maybe An inch to an inch and a half from the from the top there Perfect Reason why I like to do that is because when I plant in here I want there to be a lip so that when I water The water can get you know can rise up a little bit and then just seep down into the bottom so the first one Kalindula and I plant it to the depth of where it was already planted in there and then I just backfill and cover that up Press it in pretty good To get that seat the soil contact And the only thing left to do with that is to water Water that in oh, I missed a step. I missed a step. I gotta take that back up out of there So you see I mean, you know This whole process You can make a mistake here and there but you can always fix it so what I'd like to do on this is I'm gonna put some 50-50 bone meal and blood meal Down in there. I'm gonna put a little bit of fertilizer down in there And then get that all mixed up and then I can put that one back in there There we go Now we're cooking with Crisco Okay, so that one's ready to go So I'll do the rest of these real quick and then um Do the same process I got I got potting mix already in them And then I'm gonna mix that That top soil in there All right. I got everything all filled up Got the fertilizer mixed in them. So now I can start Popping these in here Just down to the to the level it was already buried um, and if you've never tried these Six cell bootstrap trains, they are pretty awesome. Um, I mean look look at that root System right there. It's not root bound and I've had these in here for Probably going on A month and a half maybe almost two months so As you know, I always link bootstrap down below I am uh Affiliated with them. So I do get a small commission When someone purchases from bootstrap Um using my link so But easy peasy all the calendula are planted into Containers and now I can make room here so that I can get the broccoli in All right, we're back. Um I got all of the fertilizer put down in here I'm gonna mix that in real good Mix up those couple layers of uh starting mix and you don't have to use starting mix. I just That's just what I had here. So um, if you had garden soil or raised raised bed, uh potting mix or something like that um I'm sorry. I'm using seed starting mix not potting mix, but you don't have to use seed starting mix I would say a good potting mix would work well I will link or I will put up on the screen the one that I like to use I get it from From home depot. It works really really good. I just don't have any on hand Yeah, get that mixed up in there All right I'm gonna top this one off a little bit more There we go. A little bit more in there so I want to talk about why I'm using this particular pot for broccoli and I use those other ones for the calendula The smaller ones Well, I believe that the root system on the Broccoli is going to be pretty extensive. I think they're going to get root down in these containers but I still want to try it and see how they do And so these are the biggest containers that I had so that's why I'm using these For the calendula. I don't think that the root system gets as vast I don't know but I don't think it does and so That's why I use the smaller pots the next step down from this that I had for them Well now we're ready. Uh, so I got three here so I can only do three I don't want to plant Any of these in smaller pots So I just I really don't feel like they would do well in smaller pots Same thing here. I just go down to the level that they were playing that Press them in real good And I believe that I'm going to leave these outside. I'm not going to keep them here in the greenhouse I don't really use my greenhouse for growing very much. I use it mostly just for um seed starting And some storage as well, but um I don't really like to keep full-grown plants in here except for like so I I cut these strawberries off of my parent strawberry plants out there and so All of those I'm kind of keeping in here just to see how well they do and and and they're doing pretty good so far I'll go over my strawberries. Uh, I gotta clean that bed out and whatnot. So I gotta show you all that as well So that's that they're all transplanted into containers And now we're gonna get some water on them. So we'll go outside and take care of that All right, so I got them out here Out here where I had my um What you call it the garlic at I also had these Pecan pecan trees. I don't know how y'all say it, but I say pecan Um Don't beat me up in the comments about that. But I got some out here that I'm trying to grow It's gonna take a little while, but let's see how they do. But anyway, I got my garlic out here So I figured I'll just leave these set up out here because I got to water all this stuff every day anyway So what I do is I use my my dram Nozzle and it puts out a a big stream of water Um, I got this one from Haas, you know, I'm affiliate with Haas. So if you're interested in it, just go to the comment section Click on the Haas link and search for dram or Anything like nozzle or something like that and it should pop right on the So the reason why I like to drown if you see how much water comes out of that. I mean, it's I wanted to do that. I wanted to pull up like that And then seep on down through there And then I do it again I want all the air to get out of there Beautiful and then I just Keep doing that. Just like that. I just love this nozzle when I'm doing stuff like this. There you go We got we got water running out of the bottom Let you know that the water made it all the way down through there All right. Well, there you have it. Um, I do want to touch on a few things before I let you go So water, I mean Growing in containers, you really have to keep an eye on watering The containers are going to dry out much faster than in ground So in the winter fall, you know, it's not so bad, but definitely Late spring summer, I mean you got to be on it watering it once if not twice a day To keep your pots from drying out But I think another like a great benefit is it's modular. I can move them inside in the winter if I need to Or if they're getting too much sun, I can move them to the shade, you know, so they're very versatile So I don't know why I've never done it before but I'm messing with the water But um, I'm messing with it a little bit now and maybe in the future that may be something that I do on a regular basis So if you would um, let me know in the comments below what you like to grow in containers So that way it kind of gives me an idea and what size containers you use today. I use They're getting crazy over there today. I used um eight inch pots and six inch pots so Um and the big scheme of things those are pretty small So let me know what you're using and and you know what you're growing in your container gardens Well, I hope you got something out of this video. Um, it's kind of fun to You know mess around with new stuff and and do new things when you've been Gardening for a very long time. So I've been gardening for a long time, but I've not been homesteading for a long time I've been homesteading My own homestead for three years But gardening. I mean that goes that goes way back, you know, so um But since I've never Gardened in containers before it was really cool really fun to To mess around with it and I'm looking forward to it I want to see how they do in those pots versus being in the ground where their roots can just spread and go where they want to so um Anyway, thank y'all for being here. I really appreciate it. Don't forget to check out the affiliates below like subscribe to my channel and I'm out of here. See y'all in the next video",
