My nuts being squeezed Like fresh orange juice I kicked and I hauled free He had it out for me Oh boy, you sure are in a deli of a pinco My voice hit notes that I'd never sung Screaming as my two church bells were being rung Oh, my balls got caught in the hay-bailer Preacher's prayer Squeezing, oh shit, I'm pleading Don't let me lose my manly pair The sun you walk just fine But sitting down might take some time My wife just laughed And my kids just scoffed While I limp back off Oh, my quiff all said, oh, a failure It was quite a sight The hay-bailer's grip was a real ball slayer Now the rooster won't crow And the cows won't move The sheep balls scattered When I walked through My wife just laughed When I dropped my drawers But I sent my balls Cause they are so Well, Paul, your nuts look like a belly button Been through a tornado",
