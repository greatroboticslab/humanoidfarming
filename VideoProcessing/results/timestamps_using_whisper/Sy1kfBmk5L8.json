  "text": "Welcome to U.S. Farm Report, a public information program brought to you in the interest of agriculture, rural business, and the well-being of our nation by members of the National Farmers Organization in this local area. The National Farmers Organization takes pride in inventing a marketing system to meet the needs of the 20th century, collective bargaining for agriculture. NFO represents new thinking in a new generation of farmers. The U.S. Farm Report now presents a look at agriculture and its effect on the economy with some of our nation's outstanding leaders. Now, here is Minnesota businessman Arnold Paulson. My name is Arnold Paulson, a businessman from Granite Falls, Minnesota, and I'm very grateful for having this opportunity to moderate this panel for you folks today. We have just completed a Blue Ribbon Conference in Sioux City, Iowa. This conference represented businessmen, civic leaders, educators, economists, and research analysts from 12 central Midwestern states, the key states of the agricultural economy for the United States. It's my privilege today to have the opportunity to interview some of the panelists and also a gentleman who is an observer and a participant at this conference. I'd like to introduce our guests at this time. On my right is Walter Bowers, retired economist from Washington, D.C., who served in government from 1929 through 1944. He worked for the Department of Commerce, the Department of Agriculture, the Treasury Department, the War Department, and he also has, I believe, degrees as a lawyer, as an economist. He's also a geologist and he's now a rancher and an abstract and runs an abstract office in Yates Center, Kansas, and it's our privilege to have you with us today, Mr. Bowers. Sitting next to Mr. Bowers is Carl H. Wilken, research analyst from Washington, D.C., who was one of the featured speakers at the seminar. On my extreme left is Mr. Harry Ranch, a banker from Thayer, Kansas, and also a member of the Agricultural Committee of the Independent Bankers Association of America. And also with us today is Ray Deichmann, who is an income tax consultant and an independent insurance agent from Gregory, South Dakota. At this time I would like to turn our attention to Mr. Bowers. Mr. Bowers also participated on the seminar. He's been an acquaintance of mine now for the past two years, and he brought out something at our conference that I think should be brought to the attention of almost every American. And Mr. Bowers, I wonder if you'd tell the folks at this time about the red schoolhouses and the little white churches. Well, at this conference someone brought up the point that no one had ever made a study, any research study of the importance of a single family unit on a small farm to the economy of America. They're talking about dropping the small family unit off the farms and going to big farms. Now what was the value of this small family unit? Well, I say that there has been a research project in progress in this particular agricultural area for the last 100 years. We had a group of people start moving into this rich Mississippi Valley 100 years ago. And all that distinguished these people from any other people on earth was the fact that they were bringing with them little white churches and little red schoolhouses. Two million of them settled in Nebraska before 1900. Two million of them settled in Kansas and half a million in North Dakota and half a million in South Dakota. And Iowa and Missouri and Minnesota and the other states of this rich Mississippi Valley. And they all had distinguished them from people of other parts of the earth was that they had a certain devotion symbolized by little white churches and little red schoolhouses to the principles of the freedom that we have in our private enterprise system in the United States that has not followed anywhere else on earth. And what happened? We had an explosion in this Mississippi Valley that is just as astounding as an explosion of an atom bomb. In 100 years in this Mississippi Valley we have built the greatest bread basket of all history. The greatest corn belt, the greatest wheat belt, the greatest cattle belt, the greatest cotton belt of the entire earth right here in this particular area in the middle of Mississippi Valley. And not only on top of that we have produced some of the most brilliant scientists of the entire earth. There are more Nobel Prize winners. Great scientists have come from these agricultural states than any other single spot on earth. From the little red schoolhouses, and little red schoolhouses, and little white churches they started from that background. In other words that's been in your estimation the key to the fantastic growth of the American society and our economy. It has demonstrated to the world what individual human personalities can do with a proper individual education and with a proper spiritual values in their hearts and minds. Well thank you. I'm sure we'll be back to you before the program's over. At this time I'd like to turn to the other end of the table and interview Mr. Harry Rash who's been very much concerned for a number of years in agriculture and also the economy of the state and Kansas and the nation as well. Mr. Rash, you've spent considerable time in research. You've also worked with the Agricultural Committee for the Independent Bankers. I'd like to have you briefly tell about your research and make whatever statement or observations on our conference at this time. Well first I'd like to make a statement regarding the economy of Kansas. In 1965 the farm production in Kansas had a value of a billion and a half dollars which was the third greatest on record. Still the realized cash net income was a decrease from the previous year, the realized net cash income. The proposition of trying to make people realize the dependence of the welfare of the entire economy of the state and the nation on the price and production of agricultural products seems to be one of the hardest tasks that I ever ever saw trying to accomplish. At this conference it was brought out the relationship of the agricultural production and price to the national economy. In Kansas four jobs out of ten are dependent upon agriculture. I come from southeast Kansas, a little town of fair where I've lived all my life, Neosho County. I am at present a member of the Southeast Kansas Regional Planning Commission appointed by Governor of Kansas to make forecast for the future of our area. I happen to be on the Agricultural Commission because of my interest. The forecast of population trends, the records on the population in Kansas show that we've had a greater, as great an out migration as we have of the new births in Kansas. The age of the farm population is over the 50 mark. The rest of the nation, I believe they say the average age is 25. Harry, can I ask one question? Most industries, the strength and the growth of most industries is based on the number of young people that enter this specific business or industry. And as a banker now, what's the future of young people entering agriculture with the present price structure from your observation? The required investment is such that the young person cannot enter agriculture. That is the sad part. The farmers are actually telling their own sons that you shouldn't be entering agriculture, that you have no future, that you will be underpaid and overworked. Do you think that the trends that we're drifting towards is going to be the answer to the solution to agriculture in America? The large type farm or the corporate type farm? The large type farm, the corporate farm cannot answer the problem. We have a need for more agricultural production in this country than we actually are producing. The day of the so-called surplus, that's a myth and a fantasy. We are dependent upon meat imports now to sustain our need for meat. Well, Harry, I'll get back to you again in a minute. At this time I'd like to call on our good friend from South Dakota, Ray Dykeman. You've attended our conference here as an observer and you've also had an opportunity to participate. I'd like to have you make whatever general statements you have on mind in relationship to agriculture in South Dakota and where South Dakota is headed unless we restore farm prices to balance with wages and interest. Well, I became interested in the agricultural program and the decline of rural America while I was attending the University of South Dakota in college in 1958. And since that time I have been trying to discover what are some of the answers to the farm problems. Why did we not have enough farm income to support the level of farming that they had when I was a boy? Because in the area that I grew up in, South Central, South Dakota, near Gregory South Dakota, there were a lot more farms when I was a boy than there are today. So I was trying to discover what the answers to this problem are. And by attending this conference I got a lot of the answers to why we've had this decline in rural America and what it would really mean if it continues. Take the period of 1946 to 1950, 70% of South Dakota's income came from agriculture. So due to the fact that underpayment of agriculture between 1951 and 1965, South Dakota lost nearly $1 billion of earned income. And this is what I'm concerned about, the amount of earned income South Dakota is losing because agriculture is being underpaid today. Well now you had an opportunity to associate yourself with many of the other people who attended this conference. From your observation what was their reaction to the discussion that took place and tracing out of the balance sheet and the loss of income for the various states and also the condition of our national economy? What did the other people think? What was their observations in your estimation? Of the people that were in TANNINTSETTA seminar? I think we can just about say that there was 100% agreement that they all agreed that agriculture was being grossly underpaid. And due to this underpayment we were not only undermining agriculture but we are undermining the whole economic system in the United States. Did it shock many of them to learn the condition of not only their own state economy but the national economy? Yes it did. There was much concern written on many of the faces of the people there. They knew there was a problem but they didn't know it was as bad as it is today. Well now one of the things that we did during this seminar is we had the representatives of each state figure out the actual loss of total personal income in 1965. And you mentioned that South Dakota lost approximately $1 billion. Some of the other states, Minnesota for instance, lost 2,275 million. Kansas I believe Harry was short approximately 3 billion. Was that right? Or a little over 3 billion? Under that it was about a billion and 3. About a billion and 275 million. Iowa's loss was roughly $4 billion. And the reason that the people in all these states were unaware of this loss of personal income is because they've never prepared a balance sheet on their own state economy. So they don't know where they've been, where they're headed or where they're at. And at this time I'd like to turn our attention to Mr. Carl Wilkin, a research analyst from Washington, D.C. who we call the father of a balance sheet because he's been keeping these records on the national economy for many years. And Mr. Wilkins when did you first prepare it? Just one minute to be sure to make this point that this loss that we're talking about was just for the year 1966 one year. Right, the loss in South Dakota was nearly $1 billion for the year 1965. For the 1965 I think we better drive that one home. Thank you for reminding me. Carl when did you first, when did you prepare your first balance sheet and what induced you to make such a study and what's going to happen if the American people don't wake up and analyze the records of our economy? Well briefly in 1929 I was operating a farm about 80 miles southeast of Seussettic and the economist said we were never going to have another depression. In 1932 I was selling corn for 10 cents a bush. Well the triple A program didn't correct it. Though I was one of three men who signed the articles of incorporation setting up the raw materials national council. And the that originated here in Seussettic? Correct and it's still incorporated right in Seussettic and Woodbury County. In 1941 I prepared my first balance sheet and as a result Seussettic is the birthplace of the first balance sheet that was ever prepared. And I've kept a balance sheet ever since that time and as you know at the seminar I presented a balance sheet 4850 as a base and the 15 years which followed I wanted out the audience how they could compute it and had them check the losses of the different groups during that period. Well now I know that when the group worked out the loss of income for private enterprise for agriculture for the corporations and so forth yesterday were stunned. From memory could you could you quote the the loss of national income and the loss of corporations and private enterprise during the past whichever period you care to select? Well briefly in the 15 years following 4850 we underpaid agriculture in terms of gross realized farm income three hundred and seventy and a half billion dollars. Now we have a trade turn of seven times the initial dollar farm income. So what happened we lost seven times this under payment or newly earned dollars to operate our economy. To offset the loss we added eight hundred and eighty four billion dollars to the gross debt federal state local and private. But in spite of this injection of eight hundred and eighty four billion dollars in the 15 year period we were still short six hundred and twenty seven billion dollars of national income over 40 billion a year to balance with wages and interest. Now then the question is who lost it. Well the down the sheet proves that private enterprise in terms of net farm small business profit profits after taxes absorbed five hundred and ninety seven billion of that shortage of income. The principal is there was a farm operator who was short two hundred and twenty two billion. The next principle loss was our corporate profit short two hundred and twenty one two hundred and eleven billion after taxes. And finally the small businessmen were short hundred and sixty two billion. And I would like to point out that the large part of this loss that is a greater proportion of it took place in our rural communities because the business small business man in. Our urban areas they had the benefit of the. Terrific increase in the payrolls that took place. Kyle I hope I have time to come back to you but I'd like to ask Mr. Bowers another question. I read your balance sheet on agriculture but yours is from a different aspect. You've written or prepared a balance sheet on production. And I'd like to have you comment on that. What's your attitude about the large type of commercial farms and so forth. And in your opinion is that going to work. Well from my balance sheet viewpoint my feeling is talking as a businessman now not as an economist as Mr. Wilken has been talking. Agriculture has a better balance sheet than we'll say the Iowa Public Service Company has. Or better balance sheet than the Missouri Pacific or the Illinois Central or Northwestern Railroads. The farmer has less debts and more assets than any other segment of our whole economic system. But that isn't true on his operating statement his income and expense statement. The farmer is not getting his large return on his investment as the Interstate Commerce Commission allows the railroads and allows the utility power and light companies and so forth. And as a result the farmer is working in the red so to speak. And the only way he shows in the black is the government subsidies that he's getting from Washington. The farmer before the average farm in America before his salary and before his taxes and before his new equipment and before his paying his debts is only averaging three hundred and fifty dollars a month. And the average farmer probably has an investment of a hundred thousand dollars four or five times that of a service station manager and he should be earning six thousand a year minimum after taxes. Well the farmer's got the best balance sheet of the four basic segments of private enterprise. The poorest operating statement. But the poorest operating statement. And he hasn't making enough money to hold on. He's not making enough to support his family. He's really in a depressed area so far as his personal income is concerned. All right well now Harry is a banker's viewpoint. You've heard Mr. Bowers say that agriculture's got the the best balance sheet of any segment of our economy. But would you agree that even so that the only way that agriculture can liquidate its debt is by liquidating itself or selling out. That's what has been happening. Now we've been done now we talk about we haven't had many farmers go bankrupt because they see the handwriting on the wall and they've taken the step of voluntary liquidation to make the change. But now if this is a condition of agriculture and they've got the best balance sheet better than the corporations or the small business and so forth as a banker what's your observation of the rest of the economy then. Well of course we've been encouraged in deficit financing. We've been told that that is the way to get prosperous. We've had the Chameleon theory that we increase our debt. There why we do more business and so we as we owe this debt to ourselves it doesn't matter and we become prosperous. It doesn't disappear doesn't know the debt doesn't disappear. In other words and the farmer has been staying in business by increasing his debt though. He's been there's been this inflation which has caused a markup in the real estate values which has enabled him to borrow more money on the basis of that so called increase in real estate value. And as a result of this this is what's been keeping our rural communities alive been keeping him going has been this increase in debt. Mr. Paulson in other words what we're the point we're getting at here that agriculture has a better balance but actually small business in rural America is in worse shape in agriculture. Absolutely. Absolutely. That's the point I wanted to bring out and Carl you heard Mr. Bowers make the statement on the balance sheet of agriculture and I think we'll agree that they've got a better financial statement than the corporations and small business. Why don't you point out the seriousness of the seriousness of this. Well the simple facts are that agriculture in terms of gross farm income is receiving a 49 percent of what they call parity of income. But on the net basis the net farm income is only 33 percent of parity income for the farmer. Now the farmer if he didn't work long hours and work his family just couldn't stay on the farm he'd have to get out. That's how one of the things that has made it possible for him to stay there. Well if we credit as much of the efficiency in agriculture to the fact that they have they've been producing for half the income they should. What do you mean by that. Well in other words they say that the reason that agriculture doesn't deserve a price anymore like they did back in the 30s is because they become much more efficient and they've increased their production through technology. Well that's why they don't need the price. Well that is what's been told to the American people but here's the fact in 1946 they had a net income of fifteen billion dollars in 1966. It was sixteen billion. But in 1966 they're operating costs with three billion dollars more than all their income in 1946. Mr. Bowers in your estimation what is the biggest problem in agriculture today. Well the biggest problem today is how to get farm income back to the same level on a parity with what the farmer has to pay and consumer prices. He's a buyer as well as a seller. And how does he restore his parity of income with a parity of income with other segments of the economy. And my feeling is my little town that has a sales volume of five million a year should have a sales volume of ten million a year if they could restore the income of the farmer to a parity of the people who produce the goods that he buys. What's going to happen if we don't restore the parity income of agriculture. Well our little town is going to disappear and that's why I came to this conference. I want to know how what we're going to have to do to keep our town from going out of existence. Well what effect is this going to have on the national economy if we don't restore the. Well it means there'll be vast open areas of agricultural country in this United States that will not be any longer operated by this small individual family unit. Well thank you very much Mr. Bowers. I see we're running short on time. Would you agree Carl with what Mr. Bowers said. What's the number one problem in agriculture today. Well the number one problem the only problem there's been in the history of the United States and that's price. So what's the answer. You should demand that Congress immediately restore the 90% price of pork with an accurate parity formula based on the consumer price level. And the record proves from 43 to 52 that this program worked effectively and efficiently. And the source of this information can be found in the 1962 economic report to Congress by President John F. Kennedy. I want to make that point that that needs to be based on the consumer price level. That's the governing factor that tells the story of what the parity price should be. I repeat the statement once more Mr. Rash. That we need 90% support prices based on a parity price level governed by the consumer price level. Under the 1962 economic report. Under the 1962 economic report. Would you agree with these other two gentlemen that the biggest problem in agriculture today are the only problem is price. Yes sir. How about you Ray. Well I certainly agree with this to Arnold because when farmers are being only paid half what they should get. They're only spending half of what they could spend in rural America. And this is why my town if things aren't changed it's going to go down the drain just like Mr. Bowler's town. Well thank you gentlemen. This is what we've been discussing at the Blue Ribbon Conference in Sioux City Iowa this past weekend. And it was the unanimous agreement of all those that attended that the only problem that we have in agriculture today is the price structure. And that all of rural America is completely dependent on the gross income of agriculture. And if the farmers don't get their proper share of the national income it's going to starve the rural communities. And one way that we could restore prices to agriculture is through legislation such as Mr. Wilkins and Mr. Bowler's and the rest of the panel agreed. However we've been trying this now for 15 years and it seems like Congress has lost sight of agriculture. And so this is what the National Farmers Organization is attempting to do. Merely one thing to restore the proper price level to agriculture through collective bargaining. Thank you. U.S. Farm Report has presented a look at agriculture and its effect on the economy with some of the nation's outstanding leaders. Members of the National Farmers Organization invite you to tune in again next week at this time for more facts on agriculture and rural America. Which is the gear wheel in our economy that produces the majority of our nation's new wealth. The farm income pattern sets the nation's prosperity and the National Farmers Organization represents new thinking in a new generation of farmers.",
