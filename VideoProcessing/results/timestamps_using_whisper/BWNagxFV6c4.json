  "text": "So a lot of you guys are asking how do you propagate ginger? Well today mom's gonna show us how. The mom got this from the local supermarket and now we're about to propagate them. When you buy them you want to put them in a pan like this and put a little bit of water and how long do you leave them? Two weeks. And after two weeks the nodes start growing like this and it's time to propagate. First you need a deep container like this and be sure to drill drainage holes just like this. Put the topsoil on like this. Put it like this. Lightly sink on the top like this and you water them one a week. Just one a week. Right here. And I eat this and this one they grow back. And this one will later grow back just like this one right here right? I cut and they grow back. And you're done.",
