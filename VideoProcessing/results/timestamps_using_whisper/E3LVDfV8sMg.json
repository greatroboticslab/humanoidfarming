  "text": "I started my journey actually at South Dakota State University and ended up getting a degree in botany because I liked the study of plants. Then I spent about 20 years with the USDA and most of it with ARS and doing research. I was the technician under the researcher, Shann Osborn, in Brookings, South Dakota. And so we focused on no-till, mainly diverse rotations and how they impact crops. And then that transitioned into a lot of cover crop research. Well ahead of the popularity I think we're seeing with cover crops, especially in South Dakota. The agronomists for Olsen Custom Farms now based out of Hendricks, Minnesota. But we have farms in South Dakota as well. Before I got to the farm, they had acquired a small seed business and so they started raising some certified oats and spring wheat. With me joining the farm we had other crops like sunflowers and then of course corn and soybeans, a little bit of alfalfa hay. And then they have forages that are devoted to the feedlot operation. And so one of the the first opportunities that I seen joining Olsen Custom Farms was to stretch our rotation out, to take that power of diversity and make it work for us. Because it's free, it just involves more management, but that's what I'm at the farm for is to help with that management and execute those cropping plans. So now we're trying to move from not just corn soybeans but rather corn soybean small grain cereal crop. Right now that's oat spring wheat or winter rye. So now we've got this diverse set of situation where the corn sees a different previous crop but also a different moisture balance in the soil. The community that we set up for in the soil with the cover crops. I look for many benefits to come out of it. It's a little too early to tell but since I come from research and have seen it be successful I'm pretty confident that we can be successful. And like any management we have to take an account the cost of our cover crop seed and what it costs to seed but I'm looking at it that will offset those expenses with reductions in applied inorganic fertilizer. That's my goal for the farm is to bring our level of applied inorganic fertilizer, reduce it by 40 to 50 percent. That would be a good goal. It's an ambitious goal but I think it's very attainable.",
