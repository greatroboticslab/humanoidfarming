  "text": "Hello, my name is Paul Yoder, Field Agronomist for Pioneer. And today I want to talk to you about the most important step that you can possibly make in developing a successful corn crop for this coming fall. The first step, of course, is planting and planting at the right depth. It's important that you plant at least two inches deep and I have five reasons why that's important. For those of you that may already have some corn out and growing, I strongly encourage you to get a square bottom spade to go out and take some analysis of your crop and see how it's growing. I'll also provide you with a PDF to kind of explain more reasons why I recommend this spade. So let's take a look and see what we have here today. So you can see that this cornfield is planted almost perfectly. It's about two inches below the soil line where the seed is and the nodal root system, which I'll point out here, you will find almost always consistently being about three quarters of an inch below the soil line. So really no matter the planting depth, you will find the nodal root system will be, again, three quarters of an inch below the soil line. So why five reasons to plant two inches deep? The main two reasons obviously is to meet your main goal and that is to get a nice even stand. In order to get a nice even stand, basically reason number one is you need uniform germination. And number two is you need uniform emergence. So at two inches, you're going to have more of a consistent soil temperature and you're going to have a more consistent soil moisture, which is going to lead to your uniform germination as well as emergence. Number three reason is that shallower planting corn, a lot of times run the risk of either drying out too fast, the fluctuations in temperature. So even though it's a shallower planting depth, it will warm up faster, granted, but it will also cool down faster, giving you that variability in the temperature which can offset the overall emergence and cell development of that corn plant. Number four, closing wheels of a planter are really kind of built to firm up that seed bed when the seed is planted at two inches deep. And number five, if you're using pre-emergence chemical or if you're using pre-emergence chemistry, the likelihood of that seed not being into that chemical at time of emergence is critical. So having that at two inches deep also reduces the pre-season emergent stress on your corn plant. So in summary, again, if you're out scouting, I strongly recommend you getting a square bottom spade as it can give you nice clean cut to kind of see what's going on within the crop. And then remember, as you're planting this year, plant your corn two inches deep. Thank you and have a wonderful day. That concludes this Pioneer Agronomy Video Podcast.
