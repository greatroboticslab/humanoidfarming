  "text": "We are currently in French Polynesia on the island of Tahiti setting up an aeroponic tower farm in the countryside. They will be growing a wide range of crops including leafy greens, aromatic herbs such as cilantro and parsley, as well as veggies such as buck choy. On an island such as Tahiti, where it is one of the most isolated islands in the world, growing vegetables locally is a great solution for local communities to not depend on imported vegetables. Stay tuned for more updates on this incredible tower farm.",
