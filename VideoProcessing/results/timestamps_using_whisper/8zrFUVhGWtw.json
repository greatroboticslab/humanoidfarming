  "text": "I am Nandu and I am the Nandu Partha. My main theme is natural forming. It is natural forming. Natural forming is a practice of growing crops which tackle like this in the industry. It is developed by the Tix and Dix of the year of 1999. He was the environmental health scientist in Columbia University. As you can see in the water tank, we should supply water to the entire portion of the plants without using the dripping system. The dripping system will help us to plant for supply of water. The dripping system means we are inserting hostile plants. And along with the water, we are adding manure leaves and plants out. The plant which grows in the water, that is what I have demonstrated by John Sox in the year of 1967. It grows here. We have set up one of the plants. It is a natural fertilizer and it is the booster of plant growth. It helps control of the pests and it helps to produce good fruits and good production. It is also from the beets. The products of the Panchagalya that are plants are green, green and green. The milk and the cement are the chiptons. First we have to mix the compost for 4 days. After decomposing the compost, we have to add the food mix. We have to mix it. We have to mix it. And we have to keep it for 1 day or 2 times. Panchagalya is helpful for the plant. Submissions are water-intensive. Imagine if you are going to a drip for 1 or 2 weeks, they will have a doubt about how the plants will dry. The doubt is clearly a reason for the adoption of these types of systems. We are taking a box and inserting it. In that hole, the water plant should be corrected. And we have to add water in the box. And in the water plant on the base, we have to put holes. And we have to put the good water absorb, such as cotton and wood. We are promoting cotton for absorption of water. The cotton will absorb water and it helps in soil to moisture. When the soil is moisture, the roots will absorb the moisture in the soil. If you want to add any organic water, such as it is for feeding, it is a solution. We can directly absorb the water. If it is in the liquid state, we can directly pour the water in the water and it is absorbed by the water and it is relatively absorbed by the roots. And for benefits of particular farming, we can see the soil fertility is decreasing day by day. So we have to promote these types of farming for good yield for farmers. For the small and marginal farmers, they have to promote these types of farming. They are putting a high income in the chemical inputs. They have to promote these types of farming. And it is natural. It will not damage our environment. It is eco-friendly in the nature. So that finally we want to conclude that we have to promote these types of systems in our country for the protection of our environment. Thank you.",
