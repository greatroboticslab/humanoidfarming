  "text": "In 2013, the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service entered into a cooperative agreement with the South Dakota No-Till Association and IGRO, SDSU Extension, for delivering the latest soil health and productivity technology to South Dakota farmers and ranchers. A series of four local events were held in South Dakota in Sioux Falls, Watertown, Belfouche, and Mitchell. Everybody keeps asking me when I'm going to retire, you know, and that must mean they think I'm old. We actually did a No-Till at Redfield. We started managing Redfield in 83 and left there in 1990. Ray always likes to say that he ran, he opened Redfield farm and I closed it. That's not quite true. They had farm there in 50, so, and you're not that old, right? So, but when I started at Redfield, there was 1900 acres of soybeans in Springton, Brown County, and I almost didn't pass my PhD because I made the stupid statement. When they asked me what I was going to do at Redfield, I made the stupid statement of Calgary Fine that I thought we could grow soybeans in the Jimmerer Valley without irrigation. And Larry Fine, for you guys that don't remember was the irrigation research guy that spent his lifetime working on the Wally Project and most of the young guys here don't even know the Wally Project, so we won't go into that. But, one of the things that we keep talking about are different kinds of tillage and hotel and whatever. An hotel is a tool that helps us control our ecosystem and that's really what we do. Well, we've got a lot of things, vertical tillage and all kinds of different tillage things. There's no commonality among these. They're all different. But there is commonality among tillage tools. All tillage tools destroy soil structure. All tillage tools decrease water infiltration. If you take a long-term hotel field that has good macroforage and pull vertical tillage tools through it, you'll cut the infiltration rate half. We got into no-till because we wanted to make water go on the soil and irrigation. We wanted to maximize our water efficiency under irrigation. We took it to Gailan because it's a much better idea under Gailan than under irrigation. Under irrigation, if you don't live in Texas or someplace and you have enough money, you can actually pump more water if you wait some. The reason is that Texas, they overuse their water, so now they're being restricted. All tillage tools reduce organic matter. All tillage tools increase weeds. You saw all those things today. See, I'm supposed to wrap it up. Twenty-nine thousand gallons of water with one percent organic matter and six inches of soil. This is a quarter of an inch. If we can increase organic matter by four percent, which is going to take a while, that is one inch in the top six inches and two inches in the top four. Think of what will find a place that hasn't been tilled. See how much organic matter and then use these numbers. Think about in the old days when Grandpa was farming it, and he got a big grain, and we got to eat big grains in that soil filled up, but it didn't get waterlogged. Now we take the organic matter out and we get these rains and we get waterlogged. Our response is not to go back and put organic matter in there like we should have. Our response is to put in drain type to get rid of the water. We have South Dakota. Ruth and I drove down here today. We came from Chamberlain to Mitchell. I grew up in Platt. I spent a lot of time in this circle. Kind of like when the moose show up from Canada. They're looking for something. When you're an adolescent male, you do a lot of traveling around. So I did that. Obviously it wasn't successful. I guess it's fine to go away to Canada to find a way. But it gets dry here. We're doing a better job of managing water, but we're not Iowa. Iowa is starting to get the same thing. Just think about how often they're too dry and then they're too wet, and then they get flooding, and then they're too dry, and then they're too wet, and then they get flooding. We get flooding because the soil doesn't hold the water like this. Incinerate or somebody has to tell the truth. I know you guys do manure here. We can put manure on in no chill. Compose can be, that's a composter, and young kids could make money running around farm to farm and doing this. That's not a propansive thing. It can be injected with a lot of our low disturbance openers. You put it in their seeder, you know, the screen to put in their seeder and go out and put it on. It can be applied on the surface under a growing crop. That's the way the Danish farmers do it. I got some more Danish people coming here. They have to do that. It can be injected with a low disturbance opener. It can be applied on the surface, legally inside of the footage, your own term, no tiller, but you lose a lot of land. And then putting cattle on the land is the best way to do it. Okay? Now, one of the big controversy this year was that peasants, why don't we have any peasants? Because we're going to have them being habitat. It's that easy, right? We need habitat. You need to have small grains and un-disturbed habitat in the spring. That's why Jackson Limited gave Dakota's research for $20,000 long time ago. Because we allowed them to do no tilling, allowed them to take winter week way further north, which really helps it out. And it was our help in them doing that, that is important. The ducks is also important to the peasants. So they have un-disturbed habitat with lots of residue, so plant it into wheat stubble with something early in the spring. And that's one of the places where that stack of wheat stubble, for instance, does wonders. What do baby chicks eat? Peasants. Insects. Thank you. So what happens if you go out and spray a fungicide and an herbicide and an egg insecticide and you spray your wheat all at the same time? Don't have any buds. We don't have any habitat, and then our wheat stubble, or wheat crown doesn't have any buds if we do that. Well, what about buds? Aphids are the real bad guy. Aphids are pregnant females that give birth to pregnant females. Women's live on steroids, right? So once they're there, aren't they? Aren't you just going to have no other option but to kill them? Because they're just going to keep having more and more babies. Well, not necessarily. There's a lot of things that impact them. Temperatures and natural enemies and whatever. One seven-spotted lady beetle female eats 115, so it's a lot of food. A baby beetle female eats 115, so it means Aphids in 24 hours. The male's 878, and the instar's the little baby, they're 105. So if you're going to go count your Aphids, you better count your lady birds, your friendlies. I've got more of those data, but we'll go on to... This is a fungi that affects Aphids. There's actually hundreds of fungi that kill Aphids. In fact, the number one thing that gets Aphids dead is fungi. So if you go out and spray a bunch of fungi sites in your soybeans, it's just because it's going to make it look healthier. And you put a little insecticide in it, too. You're going to kill your friendlies, and you're going to kill your fungi. If I leave this alone, it caused an 84% infection and an outbreak of soybean Aphids in 2003, after which it ate the population craft. And overuse of fungi sites cause its insect outbreaks. Yeah. Okay? We take out the beneficial fungi the insects will take off. And this is a documentation potato. One of the things we do with our cover crop is we try to have some that flower to attract predators in the fall. And I have one of my farmers came over and we had a bunch of insects in this mighty mustard. And he said, don't you think you should spray this? I said, what for? He said, we got to spray these fungi. They said, no, they're feeding my predators. I'm not going to spray these fungi. They're feeding my any predators. I want my predators here, when my insects, the bad insects, show up the next spring. Over-reliance of herbicides leads to resistant weed. Randy Anderson did a really good job. They talked about the weed thing. So not going to spend very much time on that. But if we're using only herbicides, if you're spraying a roundup on a given weed at the same time every year, because you're doing roundupretic corn, roundupretic soy bean, there's really no surprise that you're going to get resistant weeds. If you get to Farm Journal, read that little article I wrote about Nolan Ryan. Right? Nolan Ryan was a good pitcher because he did more than a fastball. All he did was a fastball. Everybody was hitting right out of the park, the same way with your herbicide. If you use your factors too frequently, they may increase disease issues. What's the big disease issue in corn right now? Cost as well. Cost as well. What is cost as well? Vacteria. The bacteria. When did we use to get this guy? He's good. We're going to give him PhD here. He gets an unknown, right? When did we use to get cost as well? Hail storms, wind storms, dust storms, something that damaged the waxy leaf on the corn. When did we use to get bacterial blight and leaf? When we had something that damaged the waxy leaf on the weed, same way with bacterial diseases on soy beans. What are we doing now to damage the waxy leaf on the plant? We're using surfactants. What's the number one thing that makes the dealer the most money? Surfactants, insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides. Surfactants. They're the most market. Fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides cause volatile damage. They are disturbance just like killings or anything else. We're trying to use chloride to take care of some of the tan spotting things. And I think gray things is important in corn as well, right? So to have our chloride levels up to keep our disease levels down. High disturbance technique, increased wheat pressure. Andy talked about that. It caused killings erosion. And yeah, Anthony talked about that. Okay, so I don't have to. Sanitation, rotation, and competition are primary methods of pest control. Herbicides are only part of sanitation. Keep weeds from going to seeds. They're only part of competition. They keep that weed down until I can get a good crop canopy. It's all I need to use herbicides for. I don't have to kill something. I just have to knock it down until my clients, my beneficials, gets ahead. Pesticides are only part of sanitation. They're only part of rotation and competition. Fertilizer replacement is really important. You give my crops a head start. Ecosystems that leak nutrients. I put in a drain tile. And it takes my lime and my gypsum. So that's what's in the saline seat. Right? Aerial array here. Aerial these things. If that takes them to the ocean, then I turn my area into a desert. People want us to be organic. But if we're going to export nutrients, a one big unit train of soybeans carries a million pounds of phosphorus, we're going to export our nutrients. We have to put it back on. But we export them. If we had to go out in drain tile, we export them. If we had to go down where we can't recover them, we export them and we sell them and don't replace them. Sailing seats are simple. That you don't have your nutrient water cycling right. What you need to do is cycle your nutrients in water. Now a nutrient placement is part of cycling. And in that I put it where my plants most likely to get it instead of where it can go away. I'm a farmer. I take sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and turn them into products we can sell. That's it. Who said that first this morning? Right, yeah. These guys are really good. Right? They're just eating sunlight. Concentrate on having your soil moist during the dry part of the year. Think about that. We're so worried about having a dry cycle, you can be the first guy to have them planted. And I've got a guy kidding corner across the road from me that beats up this little 40 acre patch and gets it planted. Got all his fertilizer on it and the white just starts bringing in pretty, pretty good at field day in the June. Irrigated, gravely irrigated corn. Everybody goes and comes in and they look at my corn where it's got this double-headed doesn't look as big. It's actually just as big but it doesn't look as big. They go, that guy's corn over there is better than yours. And I've begun now to just say, oh you harvest corn in June and look very confused and walk away. So we want to dry during the wet part of the year. That's what everybody wants. Concentrate on having a wet during the dry part of the year. Concentrate on having the soil cool during the hot part of the year because roots don't like hot soils. They don't function. These microbes don't function well in dry soils or hot soils. If you study Honshieny, remember Honshieny? I don't remember him. I'm not that old. Really? Actors with soil formation, 1937, Paul Carson studied with Honshieny. Paul Carson was our major professor. As you get cooler, environment-safe matter goes up. As you get warmer, environment-safe matter goes out. Remember this stuff he shows from Texas where they ground that land just white because they have hot soils and they kill the hell out of it, Texas. They turn to clay. We're going to build organic matter the more you keep it cool, the more of the faster you're going to build your organic matter. The more we try to heat it up, and the more of it we try to heat it up. So if we're going to heat anything, we're only going to have that little tiny patch. Covered forest crops are just one tool. It gives us a chance to provide an increase in diversity and intensity where we can't do it otherwise. You can grow crops and get diversity and not ever do a cover crop climb. So don't get too excited about cover crops are the only thing. Remember that if you can build soil structure, then you can start planting earlier. You get stranded in the back 40 in the rain to drive home across the pasture to the field. You guys seem to use this for 20 years. There's a whole lot of that hotel where you just can't get on it in the spring. We can drive around out in the pasture. I'm worried about my cows out on my ground. They're going to pack it. You put them out in the pasture, they're okay. The difference is you have soil structure in the pasture. You have an environment, tall grass, prairie, or wetter, probably east of here, this little bit here in the east, you should have something growing at all times. We haven't figured out how to do that yet. Then get these things started. There's a lot of research to do on this. But there's no money for doing this research because there's no grants available to do this research to speak up. Because there's no way it's going to make tons of money on it, other than you, as far as... Inside of you, let's say my area, areas like here and west, we use them when we have the opportunity. We'll do lots of cover cropping on our dryland if here, probably for reasons. Unless we're going to do some kind of a 4-H thing. So 10 things. You know, anybody that always has 10 things. Decide what you want to do before trying to choose a cover crop or a 4-H crop or whatever. Everybody goes, oh, my neighbor's doing a cover crop. I better do that. Radish is. Right? And Odette Menard the other day at the A&M Conference in Kansas that she participated with Ray and I doing. Just Ray is all kinds... She's from Quebec. She's a Quebecois. She's a Prince speaking Canadian. She just raised all kinds of hell with radishes. She said, if you want to take care of compaction, you need little groups, not great big groups. Notice with pictures you shot out of the radish. You had the thing sticking up by the ground. You went down there, hit that hard spot and went, now I go this way. Right? And it's not going to stay open. It's too big. You want a bunch of little tiny roots that go through there and stabilize that soil and hold it from getting together. You want lots of little tiny roots. And I do grass because everybody do dwarf as a tree seed ever. They have a thing about like this where it likely gets through and pine things. Then you can recover crop with just another component. Your rotation, using a mixture of cover crops which we do a lot of adds a lot more diversity. Each of them fills a depth. One of the things we do in this fall thing is we'll have oats and hay mellows. As the hay mellows get whacked by the frost the oats starts coming through. That's an example. Cowpeas and peas and chickling vats and lentils and the cowpeas dies when it gets to be about 37 degrees. And they just go south. And then the next one comes on. That's the way that the native furry works. Great conditions beneficial. The next crop is the most important thing. Okay? What you're there for. Water nutrient management. That's what a lot of guys mentioned. Using this excess water, you do have excess water. You try to wait until July until the next June. That's when your corn is going to start using water. How much water does your soil hold? Use your web soil survey. Find out the best ones are 10 inches. Most of them are 8 inches. Well, you get a lot more than 8 inches between when you harvest wheat and when you plant corn. Okay? So, instead of wasting it, let's use it for something beneficial. Understand your rainfall patterns. Use your web soil survey. Rainfall data. They must be inexpensive. Not necessarily cheap, but inexpensive relative to their potential impact. One of the things we do is look in the shed. Whatever seed we got left over, that makes a good start. Small seeds grow better on the surface. You're going to search for broadcast larger seeds. Usually, merge better through a matter of residue. That's one of the things against the matter of residue. The larger seeds do that. If you're going to put small seeds and you have a matter of residue, put large seeds with them to show them the way. That actually works. Grand boys used to put oats with alfalfa. And every while he did that because it shaded the alfalfa or did something, right? No, it just helped the damn alfalfa get out of the ground. That's really what I think most of the old students did. Do you as a hero or something? You know, to try to get your cover crop to grow is going to make the wheat trouble. It's going to do it for Andy Anderson said. Vertical tillage would do the same thing. It just makes the wheat really mad. They all start growing. One important goal is to use the cover crop to balance the diet of soil organisms. That's really all you have to think about. Just pretend that they're little, fanny cows. And you're just going to balance the diet. So if you've got a big corn wheat crop thing and you want to turn that into organic matter, you've got to add some nitrogen to it. So then you put a nitrogen cover crop in there. But if you're not going to feed 50-50 to a cow, you're going to have about 70-80% carbohydrate and some protein. A lot of guys get way too carried away on the broadleafs and they burn up. You put too many broadleafs in, burn up organic matter, not build organic matter. Organic matter is very high in carbon. Most of the cover crops guys who put it in don't have enough carbon in. Still a bit of gas work. Should be no use. You need to use ground agating components to seed a cover crop. We should be able to use something like clay seaballs. Just go blast them out there. And Google one straw revolution. And there's a guy in Japan that's doing that. They have these little balls of clay, peat and seed, whatever, and they just throw them out there and then they grow. Using a perennial sequence or perennial cover crop will be necessary. If we try to do only annual cropping, one of the reasons we've got so many saline seeds, we've got too many annual crops. They don't have root systems like the perennial. Grandpa used to come along and every so often he'd put in grass and alfalfa and these kind of things and he'd hit the reset button, he'd build his organic matter, he'd get rid of the weeds, right? He'd suck up a bunch of this nutrient that had gotten beyond the depth that you can get with annual crops. He'd bring that back to the surface and how many guys here have pH's that are going down? Most of you. It's because you're leaking lime and stuff out to bottom. You're not cycling it back to the surface. If you put that into perennial for three years, that pH would jump right back up again. You go down and get that lime. I noticed in Charlie, picture had a bunch of three lines. That picture is whole, right? Just got to get that back to the surface. The lime's here. Now the guys who are putting in the drain tile want to sell you lime and gypsum. First they give you the drain tile to get rid of your lime and gypsum and then they're going to sell you something to replace it. How about business point? I mean, I really admire the business savvy of some of these guys. So, they help you. The perennials help you with your nutrient cycle with your rotational flexibility and building organic medicine. Do all these things. Ship tail still has some proponent, right? Is it? What are you going to do with it? You know, corn beans are going to come in, right? Is it a fertilizer response or a closing wheel response? And Anthony talked about the closing wheel thing. That's a lot of the reasons the guys started to ship tail. It couldn't be a good sense because they had to have a closing wheel. Okay? What if you don't get it down and you don't have your thing set up to do fertilizer? Okay? And this is what I took this picture just last to Mitchell several years ago. And I like it. I love this one because I go, this guy, you know, he's got this thing here. This is a strip tail. And he's going to try and try to talk about trying to follow their stuff, right? Because RTK wasn't right. See? This guy got auto-steer. Auto-steer better than that. See that? You know, if you love to cultivate, you love strip tail. We get strip tail in the 80s. And just, God, we have all these problems with it. More weeds, this thing go over here and he said, look how many more weeds you're going to have. And I said that to Monsanto. I said, not a problem because we got around the pretty corn. Okay? Well, now it's a problem, right? So, okay. Now, and if they do it right, strip tail here may be a little bit more than no tail, but what they're doing is they're doing a different fertility treatment. They were putting extra phosphorus on the strip tail. Okay? So they put a bunch of phosphorus down plus a pop-up. And I said, okay, let's do it the same. Or even here they didn't make any money on it. And if they did it the same, you have to compare this one to this one. These are the same. Well, no tail one. Okay, the other one's a fertility difference. So, let's do it all at one time. That way it's done. We've done this for years. I've never not done this actually since probably the 80s where we put our fertility on when we plant. We cut the residue at the front. Move the residue with the little residue manager plant corn and then put a little bit of phosphorus with the seed. But this powder here helps us get through residue without doing much disturbance. Very low disturbance saying the fertilizer's right next door. We don't have any weeds here that can grow because they're covered with residue. Remember, we're in the Anderson stuff. And then there we have the fertility right next to the grow so it gets off to a fast start and doesn't have a chance. I have this one here because I was making fun of my carnally the other day and I just left it in with so much fun. But my carnally's from Canada back. A lot of people have trouble with stocks jumping up and grabbing their gatherings and stuff. Well, the industry wants you to get these topping corn heads. They're, I don't know, 100-something thousand dollars a piece. Mike put this bar up here. This is a piece of rebar. This kind of leans up in his direction. So he doesn't have to worry about it. So I was making fun of him the other day. Now what I did is I rearranged that because the pointer isn't all so that's why I rearranged this. But the only ones are on top so you can just read down. These are fertilizer studies we've done forever looking at placement. You read the side starter to the side pop up with the seed. That's what those numbers are. And just look, every time you'll see that treatment where we're doing all three of those is pretty much on top. But for sure that you rear that nitrogen to the side is always up there near the top. And we have the 28% on top of the treatment and surface phosphorous. That's what a lot of guys do and maybe a little bit of pop up. That's at the bottom. Now it's not a big deal. I mean, you're looking at, it's only 11 bushels. Right? No, a little more now. 6 and 7, 13 bushels. And that used to be a big deal when we're $7 corn. But now it's $4 corn. Not a big deal. 13 times 4, right? It's only $50. I'm joking. Right? Slow. Slow. You already have the seed there. You're re-intensified at the top. Now 215 versus 215 bushels. Here there's not much bushels, the difference is only 3. But it's never less. And Ken Ferry and Missy Bauer, right? They figured that out. The Last Farm Journal. They came on and said, boy, there's a response to start the fertilizers. So the people that have known me for 20 years are going, yeah, we knew that. On time ago. In the corned out where they do conventional till they only get one response out of the latter. But they get eight out of it. This is old David. We've known that for a long time. One of the problems with the no-till is people try to no-till without fertilizer placement. So where do we want to put the fertilizer? Under the seed, everybody says. Everybody's over there. So here at the corned, see, see, and that little radical does not take up any nutrients. Okay? So seed is an dominant pea source through B1, which is when that first leaf opened up, first two leaves, no fertilizer nutrients are needed, but if you get too much in the trench, it hurts you. But you put a little bit in there, it's fine. And then once you get past B1, and I think perceives light and puts those roots up right underneath the soil surface, those are the roots that do the feeding. So what you want your fertilizer to be is right where that blue line is, right here, two inches, three inches to the side and at the same depth as the seed in no-till. Not two inches below, two inches below and conventional till to the two-naked rise for root to grow in the surface. Okay? So this is our little resident manager. Doesn't have to be very aggressive. The end is like that. Okay? In case you're a slow learner or sleeping through that. I want to do script till. Think of the weeds. Think what else happened. This is from Aberdeen, Big Rain. And now what do you do? I know what you do. You get out of your no-till desk. This makes a lot more sense. I just don't understand why we're doing all this stuff. This is our closing system here that we use. It's one we designed. It's got a vertical wheel. Instead of the Keaton, the Keatons are okay, but I don't like them much. We've got a vertical wheel to think it's better. But notice how close these are together at the back. It gives us clearance. Now I want to show you some experiments we did with where we placed the phosphorus. The Olsen P on this field is less than 5 parts per million. Think about how low that is. Very low. So we went in and put 60 pounds in some place. Put the starter P some places in this. In the first case, it's to the side. In that side band. We had to pop up. Here we had no pop up. Deal with those two to the side. Here we put the end over the row. In between those two blades at the end. So it was concentrated right over the row. But on the surface. Almost a controversial difference. Here we put it in the middle. Look there. Just the same with all those other ones. Get it in the ground. Get it in proximity. Now let's look at if it's an end thing or a P thing. In this case we put all the nitrogen in the side band. Those are all the same. Then we put starter P in the side band. Or not. The first one we had was the pop up. The first one we had no starter P. A pop up 212. Starter P in pop up 206. Starter P in no pop up 206. No pop up 204. bipartisan really. What's happening? Raise Shaking's head. How can that be? Think what Mike said. Mike Layman talked about all these hyphae out there that we have now. This is 20 some years an O2. They're out there helping us get phosphors from the soil. This is 20 some years an O2. helping us get phosphorus from the soil, there's actually several hundred pounds of total phosphorus there. What the Olsen test is telling us is that it's not in this real soluble form, but we have to have a good phosphorus secret and just helps me get that. Now if I went out in that field and did tillage and killed a mycorrhizae and then did this test, I get a huge response to phosphorus. And what Ray is doing, he can't assume when he gives a recommendation, he can't assume that the guy is a long-term hotel effected mycorrhizae isn't doing their mycorrhizae, your fungicide. If I overused fungicide, they kill mycorrhizae too. I'm not doing that. Interesting data. Cliffs are planted corn into corn, but that's how you do that. We do have a lot of phosphorus. They keep the residue in place from last year's crop until this crop, this year's crop is established. We put our fertilizer in the seed or we put it on the surface after crop canopy. We put it on before then it encourages weeds. The three key factors are available nutrient moisture roots. What I have is very, very big root system. So if I have bigger root systems, because I do better rotations, I don't need as much available nutrient. And that's really what it is. It balances things. And that's not easily new. Cook and V-Sep, when we grow the soil highly and fast with root pathogens going to lack of rotation, we'll see a response to phosphorus fertilizer even when high concentrations are available. So you can have lots of phosphorus there and have a phosphorus deficiency if you've got crappy roots. And you often see that. No rich deal gets days when guys got too close where they're cut away gets. They get potassium deficiency because they cut off the roots. Okay? Savings might be affected in the amount of fertilized irrigation water and healthy roots. Biological control of the soil and residue that happens past the weeds is a conflict where they're not growing wheat more frequently in every second or third year. I can put corn there. So these guys might go corn corn on corn. And I've got to field the corn we've done since 1990. It's not as easy as when I wrote it. Okay? Crop rotation allows time for these things to go away naturally. So we choose a sustainable economic approach that takes advantage of nature's system. Atecical diversity, at least recrop types, long intervals, two to four years. And go on my website. We've got a really nice paper on crop rotation there. Okay? Just looking at what Randy Anderson was saying, I'm not going to do any more than this. But if you've got resistant weeds like anaranser, whatever, if you do a continuous roundup thing, corn bean, every other year springs at the same time. You get 10 million really fast. If you do real diverse rotations, you get no problem. Let's just look a little bit of data. Corn soybean rotation, where we use cover crops, we get 7.3 bushels each on average over where no cover crop is used in corn soybean rotation under irrigation here. In 2013 this year, soybean with cover crop yielded 62.9. We would have expected around 55.6. We don't do any without cover crop anymore. Every bed of our soybeans in the corn ground gets a cover crop of winter or cereal rye or something like that. Planted after we harvest the corn. We don't care if it comes up or not. We get that increase. So 62.9, if I do that, the first rotation corn corn soybean wheat soybean, the first year soybean this year were 76.3, the second year soybean were 81.2. That's a huge difference in soybean yield. People say, I can't make money on soybean anymore here. They don't compete with corn. Not if you're doing them every other year. That's too often to do soybean. We just started a new rotation, which is corn corn soybean wheat. Take them second soybean. So cover crop decreased soybean yield by 7.3, but that diverse rotation increased soybean yield by 15.9 on average. Continuous corn 203. That's an longer average 203 which is an acre. Corn soybean 217 and our more diverse rotation average about 235. So if I put it and then on my whole farm, I'm going to continue this corn. I get, on 5,000 acres, I get a million bushels of corn. And after only 18 cowmines, 200 grain dryers. Right? I mean think about that. How hard that it would be to harvest 5,000 acres of continuous corn. Corn soybean, I'd get this and then corn corn soybean wheat soybean, I'd get that. If I get more realistic, I can say 2,000 acres total, total money is 1.599 million for continuous corn. A little after corn soybean which is what you'd expect. If I do this more diverse rotation, it's more 1.7, 4,000,000. If I put in that wheat and whatever in there still in the same 2,000 acres, it's cheaper to grow. This is just gross income and this is way cheaper to grow. And then if I did that corn corn soybean wheat one into 1.66. If I get more realistic, I can say if I go to continuous corn 2,000 acres about it yet, but do corn soybean, maybe I can do 3 or 4,000 acres. If I do this other one, I might be able to do 5,000. That's really one of the magic things there. The big thing about what we're trying to do is build soil structure. This is the stretch I took in Argentina in 1996. They did seven years of passenger, seven years of cropping, and their cropping was diverse with cover crop. So that you see a black oak cover crop on the far side there and then oak cover crop on this side. And I have my friend Ron Elverson who I thought might be here today, and hold some soil so I can take a picture of it. Everybody talks soil health. Define what it takes to be a healthy soil. I like to challenge people to define a handsome man or a beautiful woman. Write down the definition. You can't do it. It's not possible. But we don't know one when we see one. This is one. That's a healthy soil. And then the Argentine government outlawed this export of beef. So everybody quit growing cattle, took out their pastures, started continuous cropping, and mostly doing soybeans, unsuibing, unsuibing. Because the roads won't really allow them to export corn to many bushels on a too bad a road. Okay. I went back to that same field in 19 or 2000 and said, ten years later, there's the same thought. Absolutely insane. And that's what we've done. I find lady soil all over. And corn soybean is just not enough diversity but it's not enough carbon. 80% grass is 80%. So we've got to somehow get our carbon up because we're just mining the organic matter out of our soil. So we put in high carbon cover crops. This would be that old hay mill thing. There's old spot ready to come up from underneath in there. Trevor, he's headed wheat straw and you can see on the left, that's the check. Here's one that we did with the Buffett project with 40 from the 40. This is the old beef mixture that they swath and harvested for forage for bales. They put the bales over the edges of the field. Then they put in hay millets and pearl millet and that kind of stuff. And they harvested that for forage. You can see they swath it for forage. And then they planted between the swaths with, that was my idea. It worked so good. It was really neat. They planted between the swaths with their little 750 drill. Right? And then they were close to put the old quail back out, use them in a string to maintain the cow so they could do real intensive swath grazing. But we didn't get that part done. I think it's that you. Is that you? Yes, it is. They're traagers. I didn't see them earlier. He's here. He's one of the Kerman next generation. And anyway, they're swath grazed. That's, you see how the cows are eating it and they eat it on down. To the point where now they're starting to eat the subject between. Okay? When soil water storage capacity is low, which we've done now to our soils, much of the rain that falls during extended periods of precipitation is lost. In contrast, high water storage capacity of soil combined with the effective cap for rain with macro pores and all that kind of stuff and snowmelt over the fall, winter and spring can support crops that extend the record. That's diseases again. Within all types of groups, there's organic matter increases from 1 to 3 percent to available water capacity brought to the double. Organic matter comes in increases 4 percent. They've been accounted for more than 60 percent of available water in the whole capacity. Okay? Some of the things you hear, again, this is that cronin, that straight corn. They've got this for silage and this is corn with soybeans planted in between, both without nitrogen. Micro-Risey allow the corn to get nitrogen from the soybeans the way it works in the purge. Okay? Here's our alfalfa that we, in our continuous corn out under irrigation, we have an understory of alfalfa. And that's my perennial cover crop. The other one that you'll see in Australia is switchgrass used as a summer bracer and then they grow over the wintertime, broken old and weak and whatever during their rainy winter period. And then when that's harvest, they let the grass come back and use it as a bracer. Look at the root system on the prairie. We're not even close to doing that. These are my three daughters. It's several years ago. One of the rice and alfalfa graduate college, one of the last in junior, and the other one's a senior in high school. You know, they just got paid. Why do we still have people that don't use no-tail rotations or have livestock? What's the problem? Because we've got the technology to do this. We know how to do it. Some political or whatever, could it be that the total subsidy for crop insurance in 2013 was $14 billion? Federal government subsidies, $14 billion for crop insurance. We'll have the small part of the farm bill, big part of the stamp. Well, there's 14 million people that get food stamps that get $80 billion a year at $1,700 per person. I don't think I'd want to try to feed myself with $1,700 a year. Crop insurance is $1.2 million in crop insurance policy for subsidies. $14 billion, so each of those policies averaged $11,700 per person subsidy. It's for...Sunday crop insurance is good, but Sunday health insurance must be good also, right? Can't have it both ways. Jack and Charlie's mom's a very good friend of mine. And we're having this discussion and they put this to Jan on day. She goes, they don't send for crop insurance, but they go, yes, they do. She says, well, they don't. They say, well, they don't. They say, ask Jack. Well, I asked that today if you had that discussion. Did you have that discussion with you? She must believe me yet. But I mean, no. The total $14 billion for subsidized crop insurance, the total federal budget for agricultural research last year was $2.6 billion. $1.6 billion as much. Just think about it. Making sense? $1.3 billion of that were short-term grants than if of... from the federal government to the states and their one or two year grant. USDA, the guys like Mike Layman, and the direct grants to the states, that used to be the way they supported research, are the other 1.3. So the only long-term research is that little part of that 1.3 that comes out to the states. So is an answer to give the crop insurance subsidy or part of it to the states of the direct grant? Let them work on research and developing these sustainable systems, alternative energy and switch. Would we make that trade-off? Say, well, if you're going to spend that money, let's do this instead. But you've got to ask for that. Spend some of that money educating the public on what the good growers are doing. So you don't have people asking Ray for organic farming. Not understanding what's going on. Ecosystems are connected. We can't just ignore what's happening in China and the rest of the world in terms of pollution because it includes them and it's polluting us. So take the E out of ET and take the T out of camp. We'll have Mother Nature do it. Thank you. Any questions for the way? Yes, sir. I realize you're out by peer and stuff, but you know, the problem we run into is we've got some soils that are kind of heavy and wet without any... And maybe if you're in a no-till system long enough, but I mean, we get those big rains in the spring and without some sort of airing it out, you lose a couple of weeks of planning time or delay it that much. Sometimes it's a trade-off to run some sort of minimum tillage. I mean, I don't know. You got an answer for that? Well, you've got to remember, I started at the Redfield on the La Custardian soils. And La Custardian soils are old, glacial, lake bottom. Let's start with that. So I'm very familiar with what you're talking about, and I grew up in the flat. And the big thing is soil structure. So if you're really challenged, you've got some challenging soils. The first thing you got to do is probably throw them in perennials for a couple of years. And they come out of that. I mean, the guys that had the CRP had a perfect chance to do that, but you got to be building soil structure. And what we would do is we'd start with a couple of years a week to really try to build soil structures. Spring, week, winter week, because then your plants will be... Your plant in the fall of the second year, and then you get the cover crop in after that, and that really gets you kind of rolled. That does make sense, because I mean, I had some CRP that came out, you know, it was a wet year, and no tilled into it. And like I say, if you had good flotation of the tractor, you could drive through standing water, seed it, and for the most part it turned out pretty decent. You notice the size of the tires on that tractor, very 800-meters, very big, fat, tight, low, low pressure tires. That's part of the answer. But when we moved here, we had some really degraded soil. Terrible. And I actually had, for the first year or two, we had issues with dropping through and whatever. Even there, because I was going, well, I'm out of here now. We have the same problem there. In fact, we probably have more problems, because we have to be more conservative in terms of a rotation. We can't use all of it. We can't push the cover crops as hard, because we may not get that rain in the spring. You guys are more likely to get it. That makes sense, because like I say, that would be a good answer to it, because when you're out there and you plug up a plant, and it takes 24 hours digging, it's pretty easy to get that vertical tail off. But we're asking the wrong question. I had that real brief slide in there that says we shouldn't need the ground-engaging tool for planting crops. Right, and I buzzed through it. Place heat balls. Here's the other one. Take something that looks like this. This is an alfate, if you can't see it. We can have seed stakes that look like this. And then all you have to do is go across with a hovercraft and shoot them in the ground. That'd probably be pretty cheap. Well, I mean, you think of it, we haven't really wrapped our mind around we don't want to disturb the soil, how are we going to do this? See, we haven't quite given up that tillage thing. What we're really doing is we're tilling that little zone. We haven't quite given up on the fact that we really shouldn't be doing any of that, whether nature has never done tillage. That big red cedar, when the guy from the PD guy, the product development guy from Case IH, flew to South Dakota to meet with me one March day and said, what's the best no-till cedar ever made? Meaning, what one can we buy and paint a red called a case? Right? And I said, well, the buffalo. He said, oh, the one out in Nebraska, I said, no, the brown one was horn. It's seen as a prairie for millennia before we got here, right? And it will do it when we leave. Okay, any questions? Need more carbon. And you can get more carbon by letting it be more mature. You can get more carbon by using something like plaques, which is the thing that's in almost all of our great number of our rotations because it's stiff, it's high carbon, it is a broad sea. You can think back what Mike Layman said. Mike Layman, how to keep them all these plugs out of the room. That's not going to give me money. Oaks, oaks in front of, remember how good oaks look in front of corn? So if you're coming in and you're going to put a bunch of broadleaf in there, you have oaks with your broadleaf. Remember what I showed with the corn taking the nitrogen from the legume. So you put a legume and an on legume together and then that on legume makes the legume work harder. And gets more nitrogen into this form. And Ray would tell you that it takes carbon and nitrogen to make organic matter. So just having the radishes and stuff out there, they don't have enough carbon. And that stuff just burns out. And so you're not really making organic matter, you're burning off organic matter. So some oats in there give you a nice fiber-shrute system. So if you would drive by the co-delights today and look at field two-seven, it had a mixture of cow peas, peas, lentils, dwarf-essy trape seed, flax, oats, and annual riger. And that was planted into wheat stubble going to corn so it had volunteer wheat. So it's got a lot of these high-carbon things in there. Oats to corn. Now, you didn't hear me say millet. You didn't hear me say millet. You didn't hear me say millet in hand-melt, because that's the ones that don't take it trough. But it's all a trade-off. But we want to build, that's a field that's very badly, it's been corn, soybeans for 20-some years, it's been the greats. But that was part of what we were trying to prove. So we're now going to jump-start. And really crank it up. Do you have one more question for Dwayne? And how'd you do your chili? I told somebody I'd give you an H for the steel seed and you can go to the damn plow when you want to. And go radio. But one of the things that... And I'll do this, and I quit. My grandfather, who's in Homestead in Brill County, when he planted his oats, he had tweak over with it. And then when he ran the binder behind the horses, he sat on the platform and spread more plastics or some kind of rape seed from the seed. And then when they had the shocks built, they turned the sheep out because the sheep would not bother the shocks if they had green stuff to eat. And then when they got the shocks thrashed, then they turned the cows out. Same thing we're doing now. It's really not the same work. And I think that one with clover in the wheat is one we really need to try. Hart, that's one of the things that's overseen. That gets by this, how do we get something started? We've got to do some research on that, but there isn't the impetus to do that. But there's a lot of research that could really make this work better.",
