  "text": "So here we have the drumstick spinach which is considered a super food. There's the sangapu, the aparajitta, clitoria tenatea which is very good for your brain, for women, for their uterus. This is a super juice. This is a lovely spinach called ponangani spinach. It's a traditional spinach. You know if you ask the millions about ponangani they're like yeah this is our culture. It's good for your skin and good for your eyes. Then we have the wild brinjal. This wild brinjal we don't plant it like actually quite a few of these things we don't plant they just grow and this is also very good for reverse diabetes, for kidneys. This is something that's so fundamental you know in our very existence. To know what foods are local. To know what foods are good for us. To know what foods you know can be eaten. This is so good for you. This is like a magic plant and it's a weed. I was very fortunate as a teenager because I went to J. Krishnamurti school in England and in that school we were very free you know to explore more existential questions of life you know why why was I born what's the meaning of my life. Could it be that beauty's kiss tonight. I drives me far from my tomorrow. Say my prayers and I'll say them right. I ended up studying a lot of jazz guitar and I was doing a lot of theater. I was even doing research in genetics. My teacher he encouraged us to get involved in publishing scientific papers but it was at that time that I discovered my passion for farming and gardening you know a life close to nature growing my own food. There was a teacher in our school who had lived in Auroville in the 70s and he he was very involved in what he was doing and it was very appealing to be with him and I learned from him that we don't have to go to university to do master's degree growing your own food living in community living a simple life is equally valid. So when we started Solitude you know it used to be farmland but hadn't been used for many years and it was just an empty land it was flat and the soil was you know little poor there were weeds growing and a few neem trees and that was all that was there so we really started from scratch with this land. We're trying to understand and replicate the natural systems in nature. There are so many natural systems going on in nature I mean the first obvious one is that leaves an organic matter fall to the ground and decay and become healthy you know available nutrients for the plants. So the first element in natural farming what I say is the first and last technique is to value all the biomass around us the organic matter this bio resource is our profit it's not a financial profit it's a nutritional profit because when we return it back to the soil soil becomes healthy this is the very premise of natural farming. People in the city people outside are still stuck with like maybe like seven to eight varieties of food that they are eating people are just eating cauliflower some maybe like in Bombay also we eat like two varieties of spinach but when I came here and I saw it was like eight varieties of spinach and out of that four of you are not even growing. You see food these days is functional you eat to go and do the job everything is geared towards economic gain I got the iPad I got a car but when there's no water left in the tap what use is that? Man has gone so far away chasing economic growth he has to come back to this this is the future of farming. First as I said we we plant fruit trees it's a ramfile and there's you know there's tamarind and there's jackfruit and mangoes and supporters there's a wide diversity of fruit trees and then there are all the papayas and bananas and so many other plants which are sort of the intermediary infrastructure and then we have things like the ladies fingers and there are cucumbers and pumpkins the sort of shorter duration the annuals then we have all the spinnages that are just growing everywhere I mean of course some of them we'll do in a line like the Amaranth but many of them are wild and it's these more wild plants that are really interesting like I mean take this chilli here this chilli is an amazing chilli it'll grow like about four meters high we'll get a good full bucket of chilies from it and we didn't grow it this sunda kai is really a very special plant again it's something that we haven't grown it grows all over the farm now and it grows all over the farm because we valued it but the main point is we didn't grow it it grew on its own there was no industrialization needed for this there is no carbon footprint over the years we've had less and less rainfall in fact over the last seven years apart from cyclones there's a couple of them that filled up the well we haven't had a monsoon that really filled the well and that makes irrigation really a challenge but when we return organic matter back to the soil you start to see the soil becomes like a sponge you know it's holding water you know this porosity is really synonymous with fertility and this porosity allows for us to irrigate less people ask me you know what about pests in natural farming there are no pests because there's an equilibrium starting with the soil and then starting with such diversity as you walk through the fields there's a very nice smell of different plants the insects find their place in that but not one insect predominates to create destruction you know of the whole crop this is a cafe that values local foods and it's amazing to see how it's grown over the years in 2014 we started with the full blown menu and that's like nearly six years ago it's become so popular and you can see in our bioregion how green papaya is slowly valued in more by more and more people how certain spinnages are valued by more people someone from sweden showed me how she was using the banana stem and you know that's very heartwarming because that's the aim of this cafe I think at the moment we're doing about 80 to 90 baskets in a month so that's a good income and it's all income paid in advance you know either a month in advance or three months in advance many people come in they say how can I start and I've got this one acre land and I said we'll start with fruit trees and around each fruit tree make a garden you know so you're watering those fruit trees and that water will also go for that garden so around each fruit tree you have like a a two and a half meter diameter circle where you have tapioca the maravilli kelenga kappa you have drumstick you have a papaya you have a couple of bananas and maybe you have pumpkins that go out so instead of trying to you know irrigate the whole field and take care of a whole field you've actually got say 20 or 30 circles that you take care of and you could even put a drip on each circle because you have to be practical you know this is a very romantic idea that we're presenting but it's grounded in utter pragmatism and reality the key to this system for a local farmer after the technical you know implementation is community because without community you can't share the gifts of mother nature shops don't want banana stem and banana flower and chicken spinach you know shops want beet roots and potatoes and carrots so it's really about having a community of 20 30 people for an acre farm and they they say give me the nutrition of mother nature let my children grow up eating seasonal foods eating foods that are relevant to my culture and are good for me nutritionally and medicinally so when you have that community that honors the farmer and honors what he can offer then the farmer has economic you know gain he'll have an income oh have you seen my have you seen my i defy the line that's drawn to define me have you seen my have you seen my i defy the line that's drawn to define me have you seen my have you seen my i defy the line that's drawn to define me have you seen my oh have you seen my I defy the line that's drawn to define me",
