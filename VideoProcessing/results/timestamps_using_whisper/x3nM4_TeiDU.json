  "text": "Many gardeners may find growing culinary herbs somewhat overwhelming and they may not want to try them, but culinary herbs have been grown in gardens for centuries along with all of the fresh produce that we grow. They come from the Mediterranean region which has some of the difficult parts of their climate as we do and difficult soils as well as we do and it makes it a very similar growing area compared to ours so they would be something you could take on pretty easily in your own garden. The one thing you don't want to do is to overwater them. When it comes to the end of the growing season you can then harvest a lot of those leaves with the aromatic oils in them and plenty of flavors and either freeze them or dry them for use in the kitchen over the winter. Another great feature about growing the herbs in your own garden is the cost savings that you'll see when you go to the grocery store and look at the cost of herbs compared to growing them in your own garden. So if you want to try some new herbs to add to your culinary garden, pick some that you use regularly in your cooking and start out by growing some of those in your garden and add those as a fresh item into your cooking.
