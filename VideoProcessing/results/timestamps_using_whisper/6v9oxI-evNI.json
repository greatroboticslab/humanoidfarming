Next thing we're going to do is we're going to dig us a little trench. We're going to take some nelson's organic tomato food or do a little salt bay action into the hole. I turn our tomato upside down, squeeze it, pop it out. We're going to lay it down into the trench, just like this, just like that. Go easy on it, don't snap it in half. Everywhere the dirt touches the stem, it's going to grow roots. We're going to put a little more nelson's plant food around the sides and throw our label back in here. Now we're going to water them in really well. We've got our sprinkler system going. We're updating all of the tomatoes and be able to look out for more vegetables and fruit gardening videos this summer.",
