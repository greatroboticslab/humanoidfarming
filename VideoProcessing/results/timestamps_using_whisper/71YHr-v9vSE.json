  "text": "So you got a shorter side and a longer one? Yeah, you're tying off at the handle here. So this knot that I'm doing is deemed to be 70% the strength of the wire, which isn't too bad. It doesn't slip and you can use it on short strains and it comes up pretty neat. That's how fast it is when you can do it well? Well, it's quicker than putting in a crump or anything, you know? Yeah. And my wire strainers are rusty because nobody seems to be able to build good wire strainers these days that don't slip. So you should again slower? Slower? Yeah, sort of. Oh, what you doing? Yeah, we're on the first and then a loop and then we're on the second pin. Each of these wires is tensioned to around 150 kgs and I'm pretty confident that this particular fence will stay that tight for the next 30 years because we've used 2.7m strainers all driven, all the foots are driven. So here we're just at a gormor. This is about halfway down the line? Yeah, halfway. From there? From where? The industry standard is for these lines to actually be tied off on the strainer so that there's no knots in the line except for joining knots of wire where your coil runs out. But that's good and I do tie off a lot of fences in that manner but this works really well on a long strain. You need to get even tension from both ends and like I say the knot is pretty strong and it doesn't slip. See this? No sharp edges on it or nothing like that. Yep. And it'll be fine, it'll stay here for years. Then you gotta put some buttons on everywhere? Yeah, 3 for every panel. Yeah. So this is a 9-wire fence and it's a pretty standard fence for New Zealand conditions. I really like it because by the time you put 3 battens on this fence nothing gonna put its head through it and hassle it and it's tight, tight like a guitar you know and they ain't gonna get through this ever. And then that means that I can finish this job and walk away and it should be as good as I can. Yep. As well as the 5 firsts and the last 4 in here. Yep. Yep. I set the strainers so that all the knots fall in a row as good as you can get. But the reason for that is when we come to batten this fence, there's gonna be a batten here and another one here so all of those knots are gonna fall down in the middle. And it's not hard to change the strainer to do that. Oh yeah. But you get I think in advance where you put your knots? Yeah. Because of the buttons? Of course, yeah. Yeah. So I'm just trimming off here what I need to work with, the rest is just surplus. So this is about how much wire we've pulled out of the strain, the strain offence. Yep. So if you have a look along here we've built around 200 meters here. Between the 2 strainers. Which is both ends. Nothing like this is the last of about 1.2 kilometers that we've built in this particular job. So it's a relatively short strain. And the rest of them are around between 3 and 400 meters which some people would consider quite long for 1 strain but I'm a real fan of having a long strain because it takes advantage of the elasticity of this wire. It's just like a piece of elastic really. I mean we're dealing with high tensile wire. Yep. 2.5mm and a little short piece like this feels very hard but over a great distance it becomes that very elastic. And you've got to take advantage of that so that you do have something moving your fence line for example if a foot comes up that was not going to lose much tension. But of course you're trying to set it up so you can't be there. There's had a trials on this job. There's been a lot of angle posts to put in which is like this one here. And 3 of them we had to blast. And those 3 took a day's work each by the time we blew a hole into solid paper and then blew out a big crater and then got down 1.2 meters deep, stick the post in foot and then you've got to find all the rocks get them back in the hole and by that time your males will pack their up and call it a day. All those comas and strainers they're deeper in the ground than over the ground longer. This one here is the same length in the ground as it is out. But all the ones at the end of the line are 1500. 1300. Shouldn't move it better. No movement. Some of this pussy ground around here is letting us down a bit. We've got to make sure that we put the foot on them. We're lucky that we're doing this job in the winter time while you know wet season anyway so that it makes us think really hard about putting foot on that aren't going to move. Because you can get fooled in the summer time by coming around and thinking oh it's nice and dry here. We can just put a little foot on and away we go. Some winter time in this ground gets really wet and you've got a tight fence. It'll move. Which is unfortunate. Yeah we just saw before we had to put a huge foot and replace. That's right. And that's where you get trapped. Trapped for young players. I've had many years to do this and I can proudly say that everything I've learned I've learned the hard way. Because when something fails and believe me I've had a few things fail you go and have a look at that and ask the question why and you do what you know you learn from it. It's time you think right I ain't going to let that happen. So you know I'm still trying to build the perfect fence. Have you done it yet? I'm working on it eh. I'm too fussy for that. I spend too much time picking holes in my own work. And why Australians can be a dog to deal with. And I've downed for years that if you just put them on a little safety pin like that you've got them all and then you can drop them on the ground or do whatever and carry them over your shoulder and you've got them. So you can drop them on down here and you pick them all up by grabbing that and not losing them. Good because I want to just want to put them on the ground. Easy to build. Yeah, whole bunch. That can be pretty heavy to carry uphill. I used to have 20 of these but yeah. 10 together as a load. I used to have 20 but I used to have those buckets that I've had working for me over the years that have lost them. Is it expensive a trainer like this? I think they're over 100 bucks or 130 bucks or something each. And what annoys me is there's two main companies who make wire for this country and they still haven't got them perfect. Well, they're working on it. So these are all my scraps that I've just made. Yeah, take back all the shit. Yeah, you've got to either end it clean up or... Yeah, that's all good. Part of a job. Yeah. Well yeah, good. So just butting for this one and it's done. Well you know, this fence is stock proof now. But batons will just trip it off.",
