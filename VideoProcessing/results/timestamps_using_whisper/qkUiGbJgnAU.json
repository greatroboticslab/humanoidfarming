  "text": "Welkom to Ewing TV, a station where you watch, interact and also learn. Your tutor today is Mr. Anjewike, an agriculture teacher. In today's lesson, we are on FOMCREwork lesson 8. The topic is livestock production 4. Today with livestock rearing practices. The sub topic is the routine livestock rearing practices. but in this subtopic we are going to tackle only the feeding only. Then we go to the lesson objectives. By the end of this lesson you will be able to explain and also define the term routine. The second one, explain or highlight the various routine Life-Stalk Rearing Practices Then we have the various routine rearing practices which include the following Number one, feeding Two, parasite and disease control Three, breeding practices Four, identification Five, de-beking Six, tooth creeping Seven, curling Eight, de-honing Nine, shearing Ten, castration Therefore we are going to tackle feeding and there are three types of feeding periods and the first one is referred to as flushing and the second one is steaming up and the third one is creep feeding What is flushing? Flushing refers to the period of the period during service time whereby you are required to provide a higher neutrality feed to the livestock so that you can facilitate the conception Then the second one we have steaming up during paturation time while the creep feeding means that feeding of the young one or raising the young one from the day one up to the time of winning What are the importance of flushing? This feed which is a higher neutrality it is provided to serve the forend to the unknown Number one, increase the conception rate or the rate of conception Number two, facilitate implantation of zygote And number three, it increases the lambing percentage especially in sheep You find that if you do flash feeding it means that the sheep will conceive tri or tetra it may end up giving four lambs by the end of the gestation period We have importance of steaming up The steaming up, remember, I have said it is the period where you are supposed to give an animal a higher neutrality feed during time of paturation or about two weeks to paturation What are the importance of steaming up? Steaming up, facilitate the foretas growth and development and also build up energy for paturation The animal or the cow will have enough energy which will be used during the time of paturation Then that one we have boost the health of the foretas or the health of the features which is developing within the ump Then number four, promote good health of the mother And therefore, if you do steaming up it means that the pregnant cow will have a good health Then we have increases in maintained milk production levels And therefore, if you do steaming up it means that the food will contribute to an increase in milk production Then we have come to the end of today's lesson And I will mark at the end of this lesson by giving you an assignment The first question is define the following terms as used in livestock production The first one, flashing And the second one be steaming up And the second question, high-right any three importance of steaming up I repeat again, high-right any three importance of steaming up For reference, you can refer from the secondary agriculture student Bukuduri And the publisher is the Kenya Retreater Bureau For more information, you can reach us at LMTV using the following addresses And the first one, you can use the SMS using the number which is well displayed for you Then you can use the YouTube at LMTV Moreover, you can use the Facebook platform at LMTV And finally, you can use a Twitter at LMTV Thank you for joining me in this lesson Till next lesson, goodbye",
