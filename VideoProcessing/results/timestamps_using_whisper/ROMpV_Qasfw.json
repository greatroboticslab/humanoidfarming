  "text": "In India, which believes the majority of farmers, more than 80% of farmers are small and large landholders. I think two or three things are very important. One is the farmer required good extension services. He needs real-time information about whether he needs information about the market. He needs support about the credit. He needs support about access to good quality seeds, availability of fertilizer on time. The second is the supply chain management. Once the production is over, what next? Support post harvest management play a very critical role to sell their produce at the market where he can have some good prices of their produce. So, this technology innovation is required because farmer has to manage to increase their productivity, increase nutritional value of their produce through the same piece of land. We need to provide information. We need to provide support to small farmer so that he can produce enough from the same piece of land. And for that, he needs the credit support from the government. He needs the technology support from the government. He needs real-time information on weather so that he can manage the resources. And also water is going to be the major issue in India because as I said, that 64% land is the rainfall. So, the technology related to the water conservation is very important. We are working with the, you know, the Mosaic fertilizer. So, and it's one of very successful partnerships we are running from. And the focus of that partnership is basically to educate farmer through field demonstration. So, like I said, that there's a mismatch of the need of the soil, need of the crop and what farmer is applying to the soil. So, we provide an integrated solution to the farmer. We go for the soil testing and the based on soil testing reports. So, there is a recommendation. So, we provide a package of practice for half acre and half acre, we allow farmer to follow their own practices, what traditional practices is following, so that he can learn, you know, learning by seeing. So, the advantage of this that there is an adoption of more than 70% farmer who adopt these practices next year. And as a result, their productivity is enhanced by 20 to 25%. In India, the challenge is that youth are not very sensitive towards agriculture. So, because agriculture is subsistence, they don't see agriculture easy. Nobody want to do agriculture at the field. They want to consume, they want to have a good produce. They want to have good quality produce. They want to have a nutritional food. But they need to be sensitized actually. How hard is to, like country like India, where there's a lot of, you know, the lack of resources, there's a lot of challenge to the farmers, you know. So, how farmers are producing and when it is reaching to the consumer place. So, I think Indian consumer point of view, there is a extreme need to sensitize our youth to move back into the agriculture professions. And so, to understand how this agriculture is very challenging in India and what solution they can, you know, provide to this agriculture.",
