  "text": "Companion planting is a great way to attract beneficial insects that can also help naturally control pest populations. My first is borage. Not only is borage a delicious tasting herb, but its flowers are a great attraction for bees which can help pollinate your vegetables. My second is basil, another delicious tasting herb, but by letting it flower you're providing a food source for beneficial insects. And when planted near tomatoes it's been shown to help deter our hornworms. Another delicious but beneficial herb is dill. The flowers are beautiful and attractive to insects. It's also a great food source for swallowtail caterpillars. My fourth is dwarf cosmos. These are low growing, making them a great companion plant to put under taller vegetables. They are quick to bloom, readily recede themselves, and the bright colors attract bees and butterflies. My fifth is french marigolds. Marigolds are known for being a natural pest deterrent, but french marigolds are great because you get a lot of blooms on a low growing plant. I've also found that Japanese beetles which eat almost indiscriminately in my garden will eat other varieties of marigolds but won't bother these.",
