  "text": "Okay, so angled purlins up and now I'm working on these ribbon boards which will have two channels running here and the wiggle wire will hold the top of the roll and the bottom of the wiggle wire will hold this roll up. So I ran into some issues yesterday with the battery powered drill not being enough power to go through. There's 2x6 and the pole so I ended up, went to Menards and got some sharper drill bits. So I got some longer drill bits and I also got a 4th inch long drill bit and the plan is that I'll do the small hole to get it through and then on the back side I'll use a shorter bit that is sharp to board out to the right size. The other thing was is I needed to use electrical drill so I have a generator out here to do that. The other thing you'll notice is that these were 16 foot 2x6's and I ended up cutting that in half because unfortunately there's no way of butting up two of them on a pole so what I have to do is cut it in the middle and I'll use that board to connect on the back and then I'll have another board that butts right up against that and then I'll be able to do it on each of the poles. So making some progress and my goal today is to get this side done and the other side done and then we'll be moving on to the end frames which is a little intimidating just because there's a lot riding on it of getting it right but I'm just going to try to figure it out as I go. So thanks for watching.",
