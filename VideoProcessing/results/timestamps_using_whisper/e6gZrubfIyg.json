  "text": "Hey, Tenny! What do you do on a camping trip? It's your friend Tenny and that's a great question. What do you do on a camping trip? We can start by building a tent. Let's get to work. Hold a tent! First we gotta click this together. Okay, and I'm going to Put this through here. I'm gonna put these little clippy things in or else. How did that happen? Are you a centipede? Or can I find more bugs? Try looking west, Tenny. I know, we can use our compass to find where west is. More south, east. Oh, west is this the way. Ladybugs have polka dots. Let's use our magnifying glass to count how many there are. One, three. Is that... It's a butterfly! Bye, Miss Ladybug! The fly just landed on me. I think another butterfly just landed on me. Something tickles. What is that? Star? Did I just find a star? Feeling hungry. Let's do some cooking. Oh, don't worry. The fire is fake. We need an adult for a real fire. Healthy veggies. Alright! Let's turn our vegetables into soup. Boiling, boiling, mixing, mixing. Just some finishing touches here. Shake, shake, shake. Shake, shake, shake. Making soup. Oh, yeah, making soup. It's all done. I can't wait to try it. And let's celebrate by having some dessert. Four is my favorite camp dessert. We got graham crackers, tasty chocolate, and squishy marshmallows. Squish, squish, squish, squish. Okay, gather. Mmm, so yummy! I bet I can eat an entire tower of s'mores. Campers, let's make the s'mores tower. I wonder how big I can get this tower. Alright, put one over here, and one over here. Wow, I'm like really good at this. It's starting to look a little slanted, but I think I can add some more. But I don't want to waste any food, so let's clean this up and save it for later. My teeny tiny... Every camping trip needs a campfire song. And look, the strings make music. No! Let's sing a song together. Twinkle, twinkle, little star Of the world so high Twinkle, twinkle. Great job singing with me. Yay, we just earned our music back. I had so much fun with you on my camping trip today. We got to catch bugs. And then we danced with the stars. And then we built a s'mores tower. This has been Tenny. Stay friendly. Some chickens. E-I-E-I-O. With a box of stale with a puff on the end of bird's tail That flies in the wind, oh, his tail. Love a lot of sounds one more time. A goat says, Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop. And a duck. This has been Tenny. Stay friendly. Let's play freeze dance. When I say freeze, freeze. Then when the music starts again, dance. Let's do it. Old MacDonald had a farm. E-I-E-I-O. And on his farm he had some cows. E-I-E-I-O. Everybody get ready to dance. With the moo moo here and a moo moo there. Here and moo, there and moo. Everybody get ready to dance. Old MacDonald had a farm. E-I-E-I-O. And on his farm he had some chickens. E-I-E-I-O. With a buck buck here and a buck buck there. Here and buck there. Everybody get ready to dance. A Tenny. Everybody get ready to dance. So good at freeze dance. You've got ice moves. Farmers do. Find out. Did you hear that? Let's check it out. Pick this one up. Noise making everyone. Look at its pointy ears. I bet it can hear really well. And look at its horns. I count one horn and two horns. Ooh and cool feet. If you look down there, you can see that this goat has hooves. A lot of animals have hooves. Like horses and pigs. Ooh, I wonder if you're hungry. Let's go make them some lunch. It is a lunch time. I got some grass for you. And some hay for you. Wow, it looks like they're really enjoying it. Well, I'm glad you are enjoying your lunch. A bunch of tiny little doors. I wonder if a tiny farmer lives inside. Count them together. I count one, two, three, four, five, seven, eleven, and twelve. So many tiny little doors. Should we knock? No need to knock. We don't want to disturb the chickens. Hi there, I'm Farmer McKenna. Hiya, Farmer McKenna. Hiya, chicken. I'm Tenny. Do you think I can hold your chicken? Of course you can. Thank you. Wow, you are so soft. And really pretty feathers too. I see white feathers and gray feathers. And look at your beak. It's black. A beak is a chicken mouth. Whoa, Farmer McKenna. What are the red things on its face? Right on the top of her head, that's called her comb. And right down here are called her waddles. Wow, her comb and her waddles. They're so red and so pretty too. Thanks so much for letting me hold her. Of course. Whoa. Question. What do farmers do? Well, us farmers have plenty of jobs. We take care of the animals. We pick fresh fruits and vegetables. But today we're going to collect all the eggs the chickens left for us. Eggs? Do you think we can play a guessing game? Of course we can. Come on, let's go. Alright, first door we have... Two chickens. But I don't see any eggs. Ready for the next one? And I see one egg. Let's go get it. Oh, look it's a tiny egg. We have a big chicken in here. But nothing here. I count seven eggs. One, four. I wonder how many are in this one? A second. These are an eggs. And this tag says, Old MacDonald. Did I just say Old MacDonald? An old hat, a farm, he had some chickens. E-I-E-I-O. With a black buck, here a black bear. Is that a inside and black on the outside? And they're all so yellow on the inside and black on the outside. Hi, what are you doing here, Burmer McKenna? I drive the tractors too. You drive the tractors too? She does everything. Do you think you can tell us a little bit about this tractor? I would love to. What do you want to know? Let's see. First, what does this button do? That one, when you pull it out, makes the tractor start. Wow. And what about this button over here? That one helps it to start on a really cold morning. And what do these circle things do? This one makes sure our engine is running perfectly how we want it. This one makes sure our battery is charged. And this one tells us how fast we're going and how long we've been going. Whoa. And let me guess, this makes this go really fast. That's right. That can make us go really fast. Yes. I don't know how I knew that. I just guessed. And what does this lever over here do? Now this one controls the speed. We can either go really fast or really slow. And this must be the steering wheel. You got it. That's what helps us steer. Ooh, Burmer McKenna, do you think we could go for a ride? Absolutely. Hop on. Did you hear that? She said we get to ride the tractor. Come on. I'm going to pick a seat, right over here. Sunflowers because they face the sun. Hey together. So many different colors. Like red, light. Let's add these to our bouquet. One poppy. Two poppies. Three poppies. And they are so pretty. Let's add them to our bouquet. Great job helping me pick those out. Wait. But before we go, there's something that I've always wanted to do. I wonder if there's an animal friend we can give our bouquet to. Let's go find one. Of course, too. I sure am. You must be a pony. Well, hello pony friend. I have brought you a bouquet. Would you like to smell it? Mmm, smells so good, huh? Wow, your hair is so long and so pretty. A horse's hair is called its mane. If I were a horse, this would be my mane. Hey, do you think I could feed him? Sure. I'll trade you. Okay. Thanks. Oh, all this yummy horse food and... Awesome. I'll give you your hand nice and flat. Oh, do you hear that? Nice and flat. And... Whoa! Hey, that tickles. He must really like it. Do you want another one? Oh, he does. So yummy, huh? Wait a second. Do you hear that? Let's check it out. Following the duckies, the duckies, the duckies. Where are we going, duckies? We're going this way. I'm waddling like a duck. Waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle, waddle. Waddle, waddle, waddle. Thank you so much for joining me on this farm-tastic adventure. We got to feed baby goats. And then we danced with chickens. But most importantly, we learned about what farmers do by picking flowers and feeding animals. Who like these fuzzy ducks? Well, fuzzy ducks, do you have anything to say to my friends?
