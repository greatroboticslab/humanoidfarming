They did it by following their principles, by being the best and by being honest to their customers. D.I.S. Technology-Driven People Focus We do a great deal of training. We talked about this earlier with our technicians in particular, product updates. Things are always changing. We spend a great deal of time and money on training to make sure they have the latest knowledge on what's going on with the machinery and the updates. We're fortunate that we are close to Racine where there is a great deal of case training available as well as Iowa, but our salespeople as well. They need to learn about the new products every year, so they're going and in our parts and in other areas we look for opportunities if someone has an interest in something that they might like to attend. We're certainly willing to support that as well, but we see it mostly in our technician area. We try to keep a good handle on the classes they have had and classes that they might be interested in taking. We want to make sure that a technician has the service level one before they move to a service level two. That's just the simple bookkeeping part of it, but it also tells us areas make sure we have certified technicians in all areas. You don't want to sell a piece of equipment if you don't have the people there to service it and support it. So, case is good about tracking it for us, but we like to do that as well and make sure we're covering all the bases of the products that we sell.
