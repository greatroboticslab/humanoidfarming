  "text": "Why do 80% of successful farmers say sustainability is their secret weapon? Because it's the easiest way to boost your profits and your peace of mind. Here's how you can do it too. Start with the right breed. Choose goats that fit your climate and land. Then diversify your pastures with native grasses and rotate your herds. This keeps your soil healthy and your goats happy. Feed them a mix of forage, browse and homegrown supplements for year-round nutrition. Set up clean water stations. Rainwater harvesting works wonders. Turn waste into gold by composting manure and using it as fertilizer. Encourage birds and bugs for natural pest control. And always keep an eye on animal health. Prevention is key. Build your ecosystem right and your goats and your wallet will thank you.",
