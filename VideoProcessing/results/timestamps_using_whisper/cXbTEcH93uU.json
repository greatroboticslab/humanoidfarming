  "text": "The small machinery expo organized by the Ministry of Agriculture in collaboration with the Taiwan Technical Mission, through the enhancement of the efficiency of the production, distribution supply chains for the fruits and vegetables sector project, provided a unique platform to witness firsthand the remarkable potential of mechanization in agriculture. With the introduction of these autonomous farming techniques, farmers now have the power to achieve increased crop yields while minimizing their efforts and their impact on the environment. Ambassador of the Republic of China Taiwan to St. Lucia, his Excellency Peter Chai-en-Chen, underscored the vital role of international cooperation in supporting agricultural development. He highlighted Taiwan's unwavering commitment to sharing its expertise and technology, emphasizing the strong bond between the nations and the shared vision for a prosperous agriculture I still remember last year, Honorable Minister Afri Prosper and I discussed how to use small machinery and technology to enhance the efficiency in the agriculture sector and to attract more young farmers in the sector. Today, I'm glad that we come up with the solutions. And this includes four teeters and four cultivators that could help farmers break up hard and compact soil into a smooth and loose seed bed for planting. Technicians and extension officers from the Ministry of Agriculture will be trained to use this machinery and every farmer can reach out to extension officers in the region to request for service. Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries, Food Security and Rural Development, Honorable Alfred Prosper expressed his heartfelt appreciation for the collaborative efforts between the Ministry of Agriculture and the Taiwan Technical Mission. With an urban anticipation, Minister Prosper also highlighted the transformative power of this machinery and vision in a future where innovative machinery and practices take centre stage in the agricultural landscape of St Lucia. These innovative tools and advancements have the power to transform the way we cultivate our land, enhance efficiency, reduce labour, boost agricultural yields and therefore the use must become normal in the sector. Agriculture is an occupation of mine and I am eager to see the sector move with the times. A competitive future can only exist where more and more technology is incorporated into everyday farming. The Ministry of Agriculture's prioritisation of sustainable agricultural mechanisation in its efforts to address livelihood challenges, food security and climate change showcases the country's commitment to fostering a modern and resilient agriculture sector while supporting farmers. From the Communications Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture, I am Anisia Antoine reporting.",
