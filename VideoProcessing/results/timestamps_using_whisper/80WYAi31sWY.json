  "text": "Hey guys, Aaron here, bushlockingservices.com. Starting a new job today, actually started last night, only did a couple hours, but this is about a 19 acre horse pasture property and the owner says it hasn't been cutting six months and when I look at this and you can look behind me, it makes me wonder, six months is accurate but we have had a lot of rain in Florida so it may very well be. So the question is, you know, what did I think about the job and what did I price it? So at this 19 acres, I charged $3,500 and how did I come up with that price? I look at the number of trees and if you look over my shoulder there, you'll see that there are quite a few trees on the property which means now we got to slow down and cut around those trees, which adds time. If it was just a field like we see out there, it was just straight cutting, $100 an acre and we're good to go. But when you look at the debris and things up around the house and having to cut around the house and all these other things that are in all these fence rows that divide the property into different segments, it's going to add a lot of time and the homeowner is not here in town. They're out of state homeowner and consequently a lot of the oaks have dropped their branches and have fairly good size logs that have fallen off. Now we got to cut around those and move some logs to the burn pile, things like that. So, you know, it's going to be probably at least a two-day job for two people. And when you think about the productivity rate that you want to have per person per day, then, you know, that is not out of line. The other thing is that I had to or I decided to rent a zero turn mower. It's the first time I've ever operated one or used one and I'm pretty impressed actually. It's going through a lot of this stuff and if you look behind me you'll see what this stuff is, right? It's grass, it's weeds and stuff like that and it's eaten that stuff up pretty well. It made me rethink whether or not a zero turn is a better choice than a small mower or a small tractor with another bush hog because with the zero turn I can have somebody circling the trees, running the fence rows, things like that that allow me on the tractor to come in and move much faster and more efficiently. I'm not doing a lot of backing, right? And we know when you're cutting around trees on a tractor it's like a six-point turn to cut all the way around a tree which is hugely inconvenient. So, a zero turn mower that has enough horsepower. I said, give me the biggest one you got and this is what they gave me. It's a gravely 60-inch cut I think it is. So, pretty good size and it's getting through this stuff and there are some bigger, more powerful mowers which my philosophy is the bigger the better. You can never add horsepower after the fact. You can only use less of what you have. So, I always buy as big of a machine as I can possibly afford to get the job done and it's just obviously you use less fuel. It's easier on the machine if you're not bogging it down constantly, etc. Get a better cut. So, we're getting started today. I actually have to go do another job. It's a more of a heavy duty cutting. I'm going to cut some palmettoes and then I'm going to bring the tractor back over here and get busy on these fields because these things are big. The next investment I really need to make is a 12-foot or more batwing mower. The reality is that if it's three times as wide as my current little six-footer, I should make one-third the passes with that which is going to save fuel. But more importantly, it's going to save a lot of time. That's the big thing. A 12-footer is like $13,000, $14,000 new. So, it's pretty significant to pull the trigger on that. I just bought a 35 plus five trailer gooseneck to go along with my truck. So, you know, I want to pay for some of these things before I get too far down the road on keep adding equipment. But I've got to get out of here, get over to the other job, get that done, and then get back over here. So, we'll see you back here midday and we'll get some more footage and we'll go from there. See you guys. Here we are going to the back of the house. The homeowner's been out here helping us. So, she asked us to help fix a belt on her little John Deere because she's out picking up wood in front of us, which is helping us. And we got Tim here today. Say, hey, Tim, you're on YouTube. We're going to make you famous. Tim's my cohort in crime on these jobs. So, they asked us to help fix the belt and Tim should be qualified after 30 years of airline maintenance, expertise. It's a belt. That's true. Here's the mower that we rented, which seems to be working fine. Pretty cool to drive. All right, what are we doing? It's really going to lift it up much. Just lift the back. Set it on there. Yeah. Pins and it drops like this. Yeah. To access all that, but we're only going to raise it that much. Okay. So, bring some cinder blocks or something. Good morning, everybody. Aaron Bush, hogging services. So we're back out at this 19 acre job that we started and we've had a change of events. And what that is is the customer found a tenant to come in and rent the property. So she wanted us to stop working on the job. And now the question becomes, what do we charge her for what we have done? And you'll look behind me and you'll see this was the nasty side of the property. So it was slow. It was full of wood. You can see that burn pile there. You can see another pile over there. There was actually a huge tree in that that had to get moved. And it took two of us most of the day just to do this area. We also did down this road and up around a good portion of the house. So we had the effort of coming out here, bringing all the equipment, all that stuff and spending really what amounted to about, you know, let's see, be one, two, three, about four man days worth of work out here. And I know what I'm going to run into with this lady is that she's going to argue that she should be paying a fourth of the price or you know, something like that. But you know, if this wasn't such a mess on that side, then we would have been able to go a lot faster and probably do this side. Well, I come back today and a lot of this side is now being cut by somebody. And if you look down there, that used to be all grown up and is now all cut by somebody, not us, which is, you know, the owner of the property is going to say, well, you didn't do it and you know, I don't want to pay you as much as you know, we should be getting paid. So it'll be interesting to see how this plays out. I have since gone and created a service agreement that addresses cancellations and to make sure that, you know, if we go this far in a job, if you decide to cancel, that's okay. But you know, there's a big cost for us to get to this point in these jobs. And if you decide that you want to go some other route or you want to work some other deal with somebody else, then, you know, that's okay. But we still need to get paid for not only just the physical work that we did, but for the time and effort to get out here and make things happen for you. You know, this job, and you look down this road, this road was four feet, five feet high with grass. Now it's looking great. She was in a big rush because she was done here from out of state to get this done. I left my day job to come up here on a Friday and rented a mower that day and got busy on exactly this for her to get her going. So she could get a lot of this done. And consequently, you know, that work led to her getting a tenant in here. So now she's making money on her property, which is great because, you know, she wins. We should win as well. And so today I'm here just to pick up the tractor and head out and get back to my farm and get busy on some things I got to get done and get ready for the next job. In a couple of weeks, we got another 15 acre partial that we're going to be getting done. So I'll be wrapping this one up and we'll see on the next one.",
