  "text": "Good day everyone and welcome to the program agriculture on the move. My name Philip Sidney your host. I guess today is a very important one one you're familiar with and you hear a lot from him today and he's none other than the honorable Alfred Paul Prospe who is the minister with with responsibility for agriculture, fisheries, food security and rural development. Welcome to the program honorable minister. Thank you very much. And it's a pleasure to be here. Yeah, well and thank you for taking time off. I know you're very very busy. But of course you always tell to Lucia what you're doing in your ministry. Very true. And the farmers, you know, always the fishes, the farmers, everybody in the sector, I'm sure they want to hear, they would like to hear what's happening. Definitely. And of course we're starting on the ball. One year. One year. Into your helm, the helm of the ministry. A challenging one year. Challenging one year. It makes the challenges honorable minister. What were your main achievements? Yes, and I must say it's good to celebrate this first year. I mean, as a new minister, there were lots of challenges, but there were also some very, very good achievements. And one of them that I must mention first is the state that we got the Manana industry when we came in. It was an industry that was almost lost. Our farmers are lost confidence in the UK market. Our farmers did not have the support to be able to allow them to buy the resources for the farms at the high cost of fertilizer, the high cost of other inputs. We had a problem with the NFTU, you know, not being able to have the financial resources to, you know, continue from where we infresh left off. So these were challenging times. And today I must say a lot of progress have been made. NFTU was, you know, we were able to assist NFTU if getting the 3.8 million dollars to assist them with their operations. We had a banana task force established to look into the whole industry, where it is, where we want to go, what are some of the challenges. That task was completed by a banana task force. We had a special consultancy then to really review the operations of NFTU. And then we moved further to re-engage the farmers to ensure that they produce the quality fruits that the UK market would get. And so far we've started. This week coming is the 10th week we've resumed exports of bananas. This is not something I will see there on both because this is not where I would like to see the industry at this time. But it's a start. It's a pro, it's, you know, some progress. But I really want to continue encouraging our farmers to produce the quality fruits that the UK requires and as well as the region. Currently we are exporting about 6,500 boxes of bananas to the region. And I'm hoping that before the end of this financial year, we can increase that to 10. We were happy to engage Sainsbury. You know, and Sainsbury has indicated to us they are more than willing to resume export to sign a contract with us. But we want to see that a lot more, you know, will happen, especially with the maintenance, the consistency with the quality, the consistency in volume. But at the end of the day, our farmers too are under pressure. They are suffering because of the high cost of imports. And every meeting I attend, I know the call is what can government do? And I want to say to them, I really wish our government could do a little more. But we have had the COVID to deal with and we now challenge by what's happening in Ukraine and Russia. I mean, you know, the high cost of gas fuel to be exact. And the government is subsidizing a lot in terms of the fuel, the rice, the sugar and so on. And it's a little unfortunate that the farmers are the ones suffering now. But I'm certainly sure in the next few months, in the next, in the short term, I'm certainly sure government will try its best too, you know, ease the pressure on the farmers. I want to commend, I want to say thank you to the government tomorrow and behalf of the government of St. Lucia for making available to us 3,944 bags of fertilizer. And all of that will be given to the farmers free of charge. I'm hoping that that would be a relief for the farmers. And that's the vegetable farmers. Yes, well, many of the vegetable farmers. And I feel sorry that, you know, the banana farmers cannot benefit from it because of the type of the various ratio. The ratio is more appropriate for the vegetable farmers. In the fisheries sector, we've made some progress. We, you know, there was a passage of the agricultural and fisheries incentives bill. And it makes provision to, for people, persons who are in the seamos industry, the fishes now can buy more of the products that they were unable to buy before. The lines, the hooks and all of those things have been made available in there. So that's a major achievement for the fisheries sector. We understand what the fishes are going through now because of the cost of gas. And our ministry has been trying its best to get what we call the fisheries and reading device, what we call the fads. And we are really going to see how many we can get to spread around the island so it can reduce the pressure of the fishes having to buy gas to go to FPC, to far out. And so they can go around the fads and they can, you know, be able to still earn a livelihood. Currently we have three fads and we're looking forward to see if we can get at least ten before the end of this year. So we can have as many fads as possible to assist our fishes. Just a week and a half ago, we were able to open a new fisheries facility in Sabans Bay. And the opening of it was not just opening it and giving it to a private person, but we gave it to the fishers. So we have an MOU with the fishers because I want the fishers to be more involved in managing what belongs to them. Taking care of their own. You know, we have the LBO that is closed now since last year December. The Blue Ocean. The Blue Ocean. And it is really impacting the fishers. But I really want to see that this step that we took last week in Sabans Bay will be replicated in Souffre, in Grosile, in Dennery, in Miku. So at the end of the day the fishers will be involved in managing what is theirs. You know, this is the direction, this is my vision for the fisheries sector. We are putting together the vessel monitoring device. We are hoping that our fishers will take advantage of it. So when they have any, they experience any problems at sea, they will be able to call and we will be able to use. Because as you mentioned that, as you mentioned that there is a gentleman in some few photos. Yes. And if he had that ceiling out there. Maybe out there but it cannot be found. If it was that device installed, there is a strong possibility it might be located. Very true. Yes. We saw the closure of the end of the project life of the BPIP. Yes. And we have replaced BPIP with what we call a Black Cicatucca unit. Right. Because we understand the importance of men taking control of the Black Cicatucca problem in our banana fields. And if we have to maintain the quality, we have to ensure that we continue to control and take action to deal with the disease. So we have that unit in place and we are still helping that. And by the way, before I forget I want to mention that all farmers who have quality fields will be getting a free cycle of oil from the BPIP. So I would like them to take advantage of that as they start in the right direction. You know, as a means of reducing on the cost of production. So these are a few of the things. You have the Seven Crops Program that was launched the second phase. It's a five-year program commencing this year until 2026. And to the tune of almost $10 million, thanks to the Taiwanese government for making available those resources for us. And the whole aim of the Seven Crops Program is to reduce our food import bill. Our farmers will be getting fertilizer at a subsidized price. We are training a number of young farmers under that program. Because I believe young farmers are important for this industry, considering what is happening in the industry now. We are giving technical support to our farmers. We are having a number of farmers markets happening in Dennery and all over the island. This direction, I'm hoping that our farmers can benefit and take advantage of this. I was happy we were able to launch a host of banana festivals. Yes. You know, our bananas, so many value-added products that can be made from bananas. I mean, this was followed by a mango festival. On a world food day in October, we are going to put together in Dennery at Fond du Parc to be exact a Seamos festival. So we are really bringing together all those people involved in those areas to really showcase the products that they are making. And to encourage our people, our locals to be able to buy and consume those products. Fresh and Lucian's best. Fresh and Lucian's best. We are progressing very well in terms of the volet livestock station. And we are hoping that before the end of the financial year, we can move the animals to volet and we can start a program where we can improve the livestock sector so we can get our livestock farmers a lot more involved in the livestock sector. We can produce a lot of the meat that we consume. I understand the challenges in the poultry sector. I know the high cost of feed for the poultry and I know the 28%. There are issues that we need to deal with, but I understand what it is because I know the poultry sector, like the livestock sector, they have issues with the feed. We are hoping that some sort of assistance can come their way and we can make farmers a lot more comfortable that they can get the help from the government. They can get the support from the ministry and to be able to ensure that they can remain and be a lot more sustainable in the sector. In fact, all that you have said there leads to one thing, food and nutrition security. That's where we are. You mentioned earlier about the war in Ukraine. Food security is more apparent now because our food prices in the supermarket are soaring. If God forbid something happened and the goods cannot come in to bring in those products that we need to consume, what are we going to do? We need to produce as much as possible to consume it. That is why the agro processing is crucial. We mentioned the Burdano Festival and the Mango Festival. These are things that we need to do to encourage people to do what we need to do and to eat what we grow. Moving forward, I heard you mention about the lockers at Savinsby. I was so pleased to hear the Prime Minister mention about the new jetty for Miku. It's not a floating, it's going to be a stationary one. It's a good point you're raising. It's unfair to the fishes of the week. We're getting something that they have no path to play. They never contributed to it. They never wanted it. It was forced upon them after just a few weeks. You're talking millions of dollars. But right now the announcement by the Prime Minister will give a lot of relief and hope. The intention was good. But I suppose the assessment of the roughness of the sea on the Atlantic side, people that did not take that into consideration. So I'm very happy that the Prime Minister said it will happen. Currently we are working with the Ministry of Infrastructure where they are looking at the costings, doing an assessment of the area. And to be able to come up with a very good structure that will be sustainable and cost effective. I'm very happy for this good news that is coming from the Prime Minister. And how that can impact the people of the fishes of Miku. And as we speak, they have another major problem affecting them. It's a gas emission. It's making life very difficult for them. So I just want to say to them that it is a concern that the entire government has been discussing. And we are hoping that soon from now we can be able to do something to give some relief to our fishes in Miku. And those along the eastern. We are due for a break. You're watching agriculture and the move, stay tuned. We'll be back very soon. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Food Security and Rural Development is placing heavy emphasis on the concept of food security. It's our prosperity, our future. The enhancement of the efficiency of production distribution supply chain in the fruit and vegetable sector project, more commonly known as the 7 Crops Project, is intended to increase local production of all selected crops and decrease our food import bill through the diversification of the agricultural sector and increased production of the targeted crops. Among the provisions are subsidized input sales, seedling distribution, introduction of new varieties, introduction to new technology, erection of weather stations and capacity building. For more on the 7 Crops Project, contact the Project Coordinator at 468-8122. Welcome back to the programme, Agriculture on the Move. And it's on the move people. The lots has happened and a lot is going to happen moving forward under the leadership of Honourable Alfred Prosve, who is here, our Minister for Agriculture. Minister, we spoke a lot about your achievements and now let's look at what is to come. I know there's a cocoa project, and there have been so many cocoa in the past. And the death of the natural death. I had Mr. Iloi Alexes with me a few weeks ago and he mentioned about that he's the coordinator and then he gave some good reviews about that project and I'm hoping it's going to be sustained. Tell us about that project. Well, this project was approved by 2022-2023 to the tune of almost I think it's 1.6 million dollars. And the aim is to propagate approximately 1 million cocoa plants to distribute throughout St. Lucia. Now currently we have lots, large areas of cocoa, but a lot of those cocoa plantations, those areas we have cocoa planted, these are not being maintained. So we have to focus on rehabilitation of almost 200 hectares to assist the farmers with inputs to be able to ensure that we get those plantations back into production. Now I know we have the cocoa pod disease that is a major. The pod, yeah. Sorry, the black pod. Thank you. That is a major problem in cocoa and it seemed to be discouraged by a number of farmers from wanting to maintain it. But the thing about cocoa is that we have a big market in the UK for cocoa. We cannot meet the demand of the market. Now given what is happening in the banana industry, given what is happening in the whole sector in terms of food security, I think that's a very good direction that our ministry is taking in terms of helping diversify the sector. Because I believe that while yes we have been dependent on bananas, but within a few months, a few weeks from now as we are in the rainy American season, the entire plantations of bananas can be wiped off. So our farmers must be able to diversify so they can depend on other crops grown on the same piece of land. And just imagine having a good mix of plantations with bananas and cocoa. The bananas as you fertilize the trees, cocoa benefits from it. So I really want us to do it differently this time because I remember in the past 10 or more years, we were given free plans to farmers. But you see this one thing to do that, but there must be maintenance and sustainability. You don't just give it to the farmers and turn your backs. So we have to be able to ensure that we take this project very seriously because I know it can impact the livelihoods of hundreds and hundreds of farmers, especially those farmers who are on their way out. They may be moving out of bananas, but they still have some interest in going to the farm maybe once or twice a week. Cocoa would be an ideal for them because they can go in there, they can do their trimming, but they can also do their harvesting. It's the market that's available. And what I like about it too is that, I love to mention the shade trees. You can use economic crops, tree crops, that you can gain from it also. Avocado, pears, citrus, and so on. As opposed to its own immotel. Yes, so you have a mixed crop system that would really benefit the farmers. And even short term crops, while you plant your vegetables in between, and why do you kind of pick up at least you're getting some money. Exactly. And that brings me to the whole value added. We have a cocoa from entry. It's sitting at Angers there. That need be commissioned. I'm happy that I can mention now, we have taken a decision to go and pick up a group. And soon from now, the group will be taking this facility on and getting it operational. Very good. I just visited the barbano, the fawasso, agro processing plant. And parliamentary, regional, but yesterday, we had a good discussion as to how we can move forward in operation. There are lots that can be done. There are so many high tech machines that I saw there. And we have to make use of it. But the good thing is that the persons who are knocking the doors of the ministry indicate interest in wanting to take on the facility. And we cannot have such an important facility sitting there closed. So we are looking at the possibility of doing that and ensuring that we can get into the whole value added agro processing. Because every time I participated in those festivals, I see the value. And the products that we are fascinated by that. And I believe these people deserve a place in society where they can display their product. And also, I think of exporting. Exporting, yes. I mean, what's the amount of money from the CMOS industry? Yes. $6 million with the help of Export St. Lucia. And when I look at the value added, I had a guy here with me on Wednesday. And I saw, there were not 20 products right here. Right there. I mean, it's amazing what you can do. Yes. So we have to take those, we have to move to the next steps of taking all those products and exporting. Yes, we need to export. To those various countries you can see. Yes. And the good thing about it, it looks like the cocoa. Chocolate is being sent to us. I mean, the rural women in Miku, there's a Miku chocolate. Miku chocolate. We have canries. We also have sofrae. You know, Jade Mountain. Jade Mountain. And then other little cottage industries that they're doing it to. So we can do it. And then of course, don't forget the cocoa stick. Yes, the cocoa stick. And then the big market in Antigua. And also in Martinique. And Martinique, I heard. You know. So the market is available. We need to take it. And one of those challenges we have with the export market is transportation. Yes. We need to really revamp and improve the transportation between countries. So we can move our products easier. Agroposacin is key. In fact, that's why after this festival coming up on the 16th of October, which is World Food Day, which is the CMOS Feast, we are looking at the cocoa, right? Back to back. And we're also looking at coconuts. Yes. So we need to show St. Lucia what we can do. And the rest of the world. And what is amazing about our CMOS, we produce probably the best CMOS in the world. Yes. Yes. This is impacting the rural people so well that, you know, we must ensure that we, you know, we regulate it. There was a gold rush, you know, you know, like that. Drink COVID. I mean, I had a lady here with me from Moshe. And she said, nothing to do nowhere to go. They started walking the beach and she said, let's do some CMOS. And there is an involvement in a product there. Gummy bears. Gummy bears. For the kids. And CMOS. And she will be at our thing. So there is a lot. And I just want to, you know, say that I am really looking for the resources that, you know, that are needed to really assist those people in this, because they need the support for them to be sustainable. Transportation. You mentioned about, which is market. The market. Now we know that you had a trip to London not too long ago. And you were told that there's so many other commodities that we can export. So tell us about that. Yes, there is a guy met and he's looking for mangoes, avocados, green and yellow coconuts, gel coconuts, plantain. And the yams and the dashi. And hot peppers. Yes. And he's going to be here sometime next month to go around to see how we can engage a number of the farmers to be able to, you know, generate some interest in being able to get those commodities, you know, exported. But what I am thinking based on my discussion with him, that would be an excellent opportunity for the marketing board. Yes. To embrace this. Yes. And begin the export of those commodities to the region as well as the UK. Because the demand is therefore a lot of the things we produce here. And you know, as you mentioned, marketing board, you know, you've been having those farmers meetings. We had one night before. Yes, night before. And limited hours. I mean, the feedback was really, really, really productive. And a lot of it came to marketing of the crops. And they have no, well, that trust in marketing board is still shaky. Yes. So again, I'm happy that you have a new manager and hoping that things might change because we need, all what they need is to, the assurance when they sell, the following week and get them on here. Yeah. And that is a very good point you raised in there. Because I always say the marketing board belongs to the farmers. And the farmers would be more comfortable selling to what belongs to them. But at the end of the day, the farmers also have to think of their livelihoods. They have to invest some of those funds from the sale of the produce. Yeah. Into, into, into. Yes. And that's a good thing. And when you have a situation where the marketing board is unable to pay on time or unable to buy as much as possible, it's going to be frustrating and motivating. All right. And the farmers in this case will have no choice but to go to Marcy and to other areas. But I, I, marketing bodies in a financial crisis now, and it is a discussion that we have in the cabinet level. And I'm hoping that soon from now we will be able to, you know, relieve the marketing board in terms of giving them some financial support. So, whether it's a loan, I think more likely it will be a loan. Right. Really get it back on its feet because the marketing board has quite a bit of money a few years back. Of course. This takes spots. Yes. But I was told it was mismanaged or it was, it was probably not really. Yes. So those challenges are what, you know, the marketing board is faced with now. And I am looking hard to see how quickly we can get them to have the financial resources to be able to buy as much as possible from the farmers. Okay. Farmers should not be asked to produce. But yet when they are ready for harvest, they have to wonder, where am I going to sell them? How much am I going to make? Who's going to pay me? Exactly. It is really, I mean, I, I, I, I understand what the farmers go through. It's not a nice thing for them. But, you know, those challenges have been there. They are real. They are real. They are in ways. Very critical. Really, really good. Yeah, definitely. Your constituency, I know you have your fishers, you have farmers. I know you have told them what you'll be doing as far as agriculture and fishing is concerned. Tell us what's going on. Yeah, well, my constituency, I must say, I am very thankful for, you know, some of the things that we have done. I have been able to, you know, bring this, the people in the constituency together and really make them understand this thing. This thing is not about me on my own. It's about everybody coming together and everybody coming to work towards the improvement of the community. We had this cleanup where most persons came and, you know, did this major cleanup on the beachfront. We are now having activities, trying to have activities every month to really revive and to get, revamp the whole Saturday fish fiesta. Right. There are two major events there. We're hoping to have one at the end of every month until I can get the Saturday fish activity back to white words. Very good, very good. I do not want to commence this activity, this Saturday fish thing, with the same, you know, tents and so on. And I would like to see the ambience, everything, I mean, everything change, drastically. And we are working towards that. At the council, I must say thanks to them for the support. But we are seeing the people beginning to embrace it. They are happy with the activities we are having. And what we are doing is using a lot of our local talent. Right. And then we segment and say, local people showcase their skills and really give back some of what they have. I must say I have done quite a bit in terms of the whole social aspect, the housing. You know, between August and now, I've built almost 20 houses and I've helped quite a bit in terms of, you know, helping with windows, doors, you know, assistance with people building the roof, etc. I want to continue that. And I want to, you know, urge the people out there, we really let them work together. I am looking forward to improving just the fisheries facility, the Daito. There's the conditions there in terms of the drainage, in terms of the area where the fish cleaning has been done. This place is in a very, very bad state. And I'm hoping that from funds that was approved for this financial year, I can, you know, make some improvements there. And other fishing facilities in St. Lucia. I'm also working towards the whole land rationalization. I'm in discussion with the people in the ministry to see how they can begin, you know, assisting the people in the obdenary who have been occupying lands for more than 40 years. They have huge buildings, concrete buildings, and they don't own the land, it's making it difficult for them to get a loan, etc. I'm hoping that we can begin that process, you know. So that plus, you know, the young people building the capacity, etc. We look into it. Mr. Minister, there's so much you can talk about. Yes, a lot, a lot. Yeah, but our time has come. Thank you very much. Thank you for being here. And I wish you success. And I know in the new year coming in, a lot will be said. A lot are looking forward to. Looking forward to get more projects. Thank you again. Thank you very much. I wish you success and Godspeed. Yes. You've been watching Agriculture on the Move with me, of course, on the Blarifred Prospect. Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries, Food Security, and Rural Development telling us all his achievements and proposed projects to come. Thank you again. Remember, agriculture is our business. Eat fresh. It's the Nusia's best. I'm Philip Sinney. Goodbye.",
