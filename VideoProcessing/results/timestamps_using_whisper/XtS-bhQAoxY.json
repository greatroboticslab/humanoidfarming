  "text": "My name is Mr Butcher and I teach agricultural practices here at Carinda State High School. We are very lucky to be one of the few schools in Brisbane that has a working school agricultural section as well as having access to a large area of common land adjacent to the school. Agricultural practices is a very hands-on subject that touches on many areas of food and fibre production. This includes beef cattle, sheep, goats, cropping and bees. While the course does have a focus on the management practices of these many different industries, there are components of transferable skills, practical skills such as machinery operation and fencing construction that are very useful in many different occupations. The farm setting also comes with its own unique challenges and agricultural practices is a great place to learn 21st century problem-solving skills in a real-world context. The last point I would make is that this subject will provide you with fun and exciting opportunities to experience the real Australia. Every week we work outside with our cattle at Oxley Creek Common which is our own little patch of the Australian bush in the city. What a great place to learn.",
