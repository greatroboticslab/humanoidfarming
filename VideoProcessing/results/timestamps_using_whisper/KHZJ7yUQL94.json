  "text": "Here we have Karen with her garden creation using recycled plastic containers What's the medium you're using there? Well down at the bottom I've just popped a really good draining Potting mix and then that's kaapu Yep, good stuff. Yeah. Yeah. So once I and I sort of lift it a little bit low Yeah, so once they start to grow up a little bit then I can put like that organic mulch Yeah, and do you poke holes in the bottom of them? Yeah, yeah, they've got to Probably about five different holes. Yeah, like in each corner just in the middle So you don't want too much drainage But then again, you don't want where it's gonna be all bobby and they're gonna go a bit, you know Sluffy and icky on the bottom. Yeah But yeah, that's worked out well. We've got the coriander at the top and then the rocket Well the herbs some bak choy Got a little sage down there And they're from seeds that you had or did you buy them? Yeah, no I bought the seeds. Yep and then just pop them in the little plastic cups Get like 15 for two bucks. Yeah, cheap shop. Yeah, just pop some holes in the bottom So half and I always do half potting mix and half kaapu because I found that that works the best So yeah, and it's gentle to the plants too Organic yeah Over here we've got some prepared earlier you'll have to talk through what you're growing because I can't remember at all So this is a chai The chai seeds that you'd probably get in a well, I got these in a hill food store and they're organic as well Yeah, and they they seed very easily. So I just put a handful in there and Water them and off they'll go so you can have your own Chai rather than buy it because it's very expensive. Yeah Sort of distantly related to the mint family Chai That's Italian passes. That's fat way And this was sort of sold as mint, but I don't think so Was that from bunnings? Yeah, it was in the little punnets. So Peppermint spearmint. Yeah, they don't really know what they're doing. Do they? Yeah, but I can tell the difference between the different leaves Yeah, and I meant it's got a broader fatter leaf and it's darker green So hmm and it smells like mint. Yeah, well, this has got a little bit of a peppermint smells Yeah, that's okay. I can make herby tea out of that. Mm-hmm toothpaste. Yeah That's some buzzle there is it? Yes Yeah Buzzle seed from our own seed from the busslet that we grew and then it went to seed and Then I just saved the seed and then re-soda Fortunately, it's not demon santo terminator seed. No, you plant it I call them godly goodness seeds. That's right Then we've got the zinnia Beautiful colors Love flowers. That's really good. Um, like companion planting Because a lot of the flowering plants will actually give positive things to the other plants here around like There are some insects that will be attracted to this so this is almost like a decoy Hmm, it doesn't go on to your vegetable stuff. It's synergistic is that the word? Yeah. Yeah So we've got zucchini there So hopefully they'll twirl up. Mm-hmm Got a nice structure to grow on. Yeah, and they're pretty I mean they can be I mean they can be practical and they can be pretty so they don't have to be just For an old veggie garden All we got in the back and we've got chives at the back and Spring onions so sort of growing them in shades so when we're bringing them inside it won't be too much of a shock Mm-hmm, and bucket full of onions and bucket full of carrots Beauty These are all hot chili So that's just like an old income you can reuse that Just so it's only two because these are called codleadons So they're the first little leaves that come out and the next little leaves that come out They're the true leaves and once they start to get the little true leaves Then they're really good for transcribing Also the problem with the stalks sort of tend to go a little bit purple as well, but Yeah Tomatoes it's like That we had a tomato that's going to stop the bank Yeah But they will go producer and it seemed to be a disease resistant to like the The silly mom that we tend to get here. So these ones you can see Right and see And also the goji berries which we did from We rehydrated Dehydrated and goji berries So I did them in South Australia and it worked so Yeah, because goji berries can be quite expensive that can be like For a small little pot like that. They can be just one can be up to eight bucks. Yeah So but it's good to know you can rehydrate them and grow your own Yeah, that's it just like rehydrate them in like a glass of warm water Let them go for about 20-40 hours in that little plump up Then you carefully like open up their little bellies and then scrape out the seeds like the back of a knife And then just pop them in the soil And these are like little avocados Ones that we've eaten and then have been planted and they're growing again A little lemon tree So it's amazing that can get to a huge big tree. I mean that's like same one with the With the mangoes as well as the massive trees. Mango I've got little magnolias there, but I don't know they're not sort of doing much Sometimes it's a big hidden miss That's fun too, so I think it's fun So and then we've got um our mangoes Hopes and hoops So there's the the Kensington ones right there Tends to be I think early to mid season right because there are probably about 15 15 maybe 20 different types of mangoes That's a little We've got Marygolds in the front of that's a a little what's called a bibi Um cucumber so they're little cucumbers. They're only about that big little cute cucumbers. Yeah They're nice and salad but Marygolds are really good because a lot of um Insects will sucking insects don't like Marygold if they don't like the smell that it gives off right So it tends to keep the insects away. You should always have Marygold in the vegetable garden Yes, absolutely. Do your pest control naturally. That's it Um, and you can also eat the the the petals of the flower as well. So like the Marygold you can go that Yep, um, then I seen um like winter salads and stuff part of the Kalanchola family Never got um Sunflowers you specials Marty's over there The hot wind sometimes knocks them around a bit. Yeah So there you go, don't throw out your plastic containers chop them in half and grow food in them Everyone can do that",
