  "text": "What are your thoughts on sustainability and the kind of sustainability movement in agriculture? How would you kind of frame that up? Well, that's a great question because I'm also on the Texas Peanut Producers Board and I'm on a couple of committees that do sustainability now. So it's so creative where Ag's been. You know, we used to do all chemical fertilizers and even on migration now, we do a lot of manure or compost. My son actually does a lot of compost where we don't do any kind of natural fertilizers. So we spread three to four tons on our peanuts, which adds us to sustainability issues, chemical fertilizers, you know. And we use them on our organics down here also, you know, our compost.",
