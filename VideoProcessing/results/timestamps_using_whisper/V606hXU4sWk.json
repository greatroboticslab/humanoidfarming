  "text": "Ragu, in today's scenario, what is the relevance of organic food? Yeah, see whether you call it as organic, there are different names to organic, you know, the organic, biodynamic, permaculture, sahaja krishi, natural agri-culture, all lot of names under various, you know, name, categories it is being practiced. But you ask me whether what is the relevance of organic, why are we talking today the relevance of organic? We know today that there are large scale problems with current agricultural practices. Everybody knows that they simply cannot sustain, that we cannot live with toxic residues both into our body, out there in the rivers and oceans and the large scale input that agriculture today consumes. Take for example, if I have to say the relevance of organic or natural forming or more eco-friendly forming, then we should know what is the problem with the current system? The current system today we have is, take for example, energy. Now, in order to get one calorie, we are today talking about consuming, spending 10 calorie to produce one calorie of food. If you take a frozen green piece, they talk something like 15 calorie to deliver one calorie. This is unsustainable system. And you say, for example, this is like burning the house to get rid of a mouse. You know, it just cannot sustain. You cannot be spending you body. We know the second law of thermodynamics that energy can neither be created nor destroyed. But at the same time, you can convert this one good form into another bad form. That's the problem. So, whether the current system is sustainable is a serious, serious question. Take for example, shrimp. Today to produce one kg of shrimp and to export it to United States of America, we have to feed four kg of sea fish. Is that the way to do it? Should you be, you know, why not eat the sea fish itself? Why produce this exotic variety and sell it to the United States of America on foreign exchange at the cost, at the capital cost of natural resources? And then you see, in our production system today, we have large number of pesticides, large number of fungicides and herbicides. So, large number of them, you know, in order to produce this food, we have, you know, we have to dump large quantity of chemicals. Does it really help? Does it really? Today, if you talk about India, we are almost using 20,000 crore worth of pesticides. And how it is exported? Of course, they have people use also pesticides within the household. But the system is riddled with all these toxic. Take for example, antibiotics. Why antibiotics produce? Antibiotics are not supposed to be given for weight gain, you know, meat production. They are supposed to be used for treating diseases. But today we have, they say you have antibiotic resistant genes, even in antaractica. See, when you use antibiotics in the animal farming in the current system, so what happens? You get the residues of it in the milk and egg and all that. But then its waste goes as manure to farm, to grow fruits and vegetables. So, you have problem of antibiotic resistance going across and bacteria is very clever. They also transfer their antibiotic resistant gene horizontally across other microbes. So, you have a serious problem of antibiotic resistant genes emerging across the world. So, I would say that today organic holds water and is relevant because in organic you have to do products. But in organic you have to do polyculture, you cannot do monoculture. There may be wrong kind of organic agriculture in the polyhouses and all kinds of things. Not that you should not do it in the polyhouse, but organic is embedded in polyculture. Organic means that you will have to bring back the number of sturdy and hardy variety of seeds and breeds that have gone into the oblivion. Bring them back into the system. They have their natural immunity. Some of them can grow without seed. Take for example a hybrid cow and a native breeds of cow. And what kind of input you need for the hybrid varieties where yield alone is the criteria. Look at the natural. You see typically they talk about the natural farming in the chicken farming. In the rural countryside chicken farming is you use the chicken, sorry the kitchen waste and feed the chicken and get the chicken back into the kitchen. That's a natural farming. That's a sustainable system. You don't build a house, a concrete house for the chicken and feed the corn and soy grown in the Amazon forest. So how do you do chicken farming? You know it just defeats the common sense that animal farming, if you take animal farming was always a part and parcel of the human farming. They were complimenting each other. You get the grain, grass goes to animals. Today you grow the grain for animals and the leftover oil comes to human beings. So today the byproducts of animal feeding comes to human beings. So this is not you know sustainable. This is not very healthy. Today we talk about global warming. Today we talk about ecological damage. We talk about sixth mass extinction. We talk about islands of dead oceans in the ocean. Dead oceans is where nothing grows because too much of nitrates from the agri-fotelizers leaching into the ocean and then algal growth and then there is no oxygen available. So the fishes die. The marine life you know is at great, it's a threat to marine life. So you have you know it's not farming is not within the four walls. It's done in the open environment. It is done in the open ecology and what kind of impact it has as a sensible human beings. We know that we share this world with other beings and the cataloged species on this earth are just about 10 million. But they say un-cataloged could be 100 million. That is why it is said that we need to preserve this world in whatever you do. Particularly agriculture because it is done in the open environment so that you preserve the nature. So one day you will start appreciating how ignorant foods we are. But Raghu they say that organic food is very expensive which middle class can't afford. What do you have to say about this? In my opinion they always ask this question, counter question. What is the real cost of cheap food? If you consume large quantities of sugars and fat and the refined foods that we all consume and we end up spending our money for the diabetes and sugar and heart health. Today you know WHO says that once diabetic strikes at the age of 40 it costs you 10 lakh rupees. So it is very good but because it feeds the economy and all that pharmaceutical companies grow hospitals grow and all that. So what is the cost of the real food? If you had to eat healthy food I know it's unfortunately organic today is expensive almost 30% more. But I would say if you account saving water, preserving ecology, insect population or the microbial population. If your production system has not eliminated and decimated those systems and do you produce cheap food then you will ask further questions. They see that typically current practices produce heap and sell cheap. You know that's the kind of agriculture production system we have. But what is the real cost of a food? If you produce nutritious food, if you buy or buy various food, if you have varieties of food, if production is slightly less then you if you pay more because you have saved water. Because you see for cleaning environment how much are we spending today? See the government of India last year sanctioned 3000 crore to clean pesticide in river waters. Is that the way can we clean up the air, water, soil can you clean up all that? We cannot clean up because this is a very dynamic emerging ecosystem. You cannot clean it up but you must eliminate how can you prevent. So in my opinion see organic farming is a thought intensive science. In chemical farming in my opinion you have a narrow construct of cause and divide. You have a pest problem use the pesticide. You have a soil problem you use the fertilizer. You use the problem use this. You are not getting sleep take a sleeping tablet. This is a kind of a problem and solution kind of a match. But I find problem with that match. So I would say that the organic farming can definitely feed the world if you follow the nutrition per acre and you know maintain the ecology environment and all that. All said and done today we produce something like 2600 billion tons of food which if you calculate is more than enough to feed 7 billion people. Why are 1 billion people 100 crore people are hungry and malnourished? Why are 125 crore people are overfed and obese? So it is not the production that the problem we have problem with but the distribution but the diversity and all that. And all said and done today you take for example, government across the world they subsidize chemical farming. If you put poison you are subsidized. If you don't put you save the nature and give you a healthy food there is no incentive. And people ask why is it more costly? People don't understand the hidden cost of food production. Do you know there is one connection many well-known people are saying that when you subsidize wrong food you end up being obese. You don't see the link apparently you don't see the link. But let's say I subsidize urea and I subsidize one single variety of rice. I subsidize processing I give you white rice and you eat it and you become sick. I am saying and then I subsidize the hospital care I subsidize insurance. Look at the economy we run around diseases. Should we not think of you know how to be preventive in diseases how to be proactive. So there is enough food and food can be take for example, India which is 60% is dry land. You can't use specialized in dry land but India has forgotten dry land. And we import 60,000 crore worth of oil from South America and Malaysia. It's massive quantity of oil. We don't grow oil seeds in this country. And if you can tackle the dry land farming which is possible to do organically. You know the eco divers you know ecologically fragile regions. So I see if you see what we have done is in the current economic system we exclude ecology and social cost. They say what is the cost of pollination by bees. The FAO says about 300 billion dollar. There is a cost of pollination but we don't account for it. That is why you always miss the wood for trees. People ask that is why it is sad that you know people we have great answers. But unfortunately for wrong questions you know production system today. So Raghunov tell me how difficult is it in India to do organic farming. Is it easy or is very difficult right now at this situation. I would say there are a lot of community knowledge when it comes to human health. When it comes to agriculture. When it comes to animal husbandry. How do Todas you know the tribes in Nilgiri take care of buffaloes. They know better than a doctor there. Do they not have do don't they know how to take care of animal health. They know. I have a book called Wild Health by Cindy. She says how do animals take care of their health. I am not saying you know you don't want science and technology. But you also see that something is working already. Something is already working. You see the natural farming and you know if I can grow food in a complementary way. Typically it is like this. Why does a pest emerge when there is monoculture. When there is water logging. When I have used. When soil fertility is connected to pest emergence. Suppose I have a beautiful milieu of microbe in the soil. And a good humus in the soil. Higher carbon content in the soil. Then the pest emergence is very less. So the deeper connection in nature. See don't have a narrow construct. Deeper connection in nature. Then you say the pest is not because the by pest itself. But because you provided a conducive environment for the pest to emerge. And first to become more potent. You use pesticides and more pesticides. And they become more potent. Then you had to genetically modified food. In order to resist the pest. So it is typically you know it is said that it is a treadmill technology. Where you know you keep moving. But you don't move at all. It's like a sea waves. They move but they don't move away. They are there. But you always make to feel that it is progress is happening. Development is happening. But all said and done I don't want to eat food riddled with poisons and pesticides and antibiotics. I don't want to eat a healthy food. I don't want to subject myself. I'm not a guinea pig. I want to be healthy. I want to be happy. I want to eat natural food. I want to take drivers variety of food. So that is what I think. Whether you call it organic, bio-dynamic and all. I think the science. See ecology was never considered as a science. Unfortunately. Even Evo Wilson. The man who popularized you know the ecological concept. In the Harvard his department was shut down. Where there's simply that this is not science. Science you show me. You produce something. You give me A plus B is equal to C plus D. Do you show me something. But in ecology you can't show like that. There are complex connections. So that is why in order to preserve ecology and you know diversity, health and without all these toxic residues that come to us. And that's a threat to other beings also. So that is where I feel. You give any name to organic. You give bio-dynamic any name you call it. But it is high time. We thought that can our food be safe? See the current world revolves around three things. Insecurity, uncertainty and unsafe. What the Ziegman Baumann, a revolution sociologist calls as the trinity of the modern world. Trinity of the modern world is unsafe. Insecurity and uncertainty. That's the problem. And in the production system he also says that we create waste. And one of the waste is human beings themselves. There are waste products out of the economic system. So I think we need to go back to eco technology, sustainable farming, less input. Take for example urea. Today in the beginning we gave 1 kg of urea for 25 kg of food grain. Today 1 kg of urea yields only 7 kg of grain. Imagine 30 million tons of urea for 250 million tons of food grain. And it is, you see the ratio is declining year by year. I think you will land up using 1 kg of fertilizer for half kg of grain. Is that sustainable? Serious question. I must also tell you that the phosphorus for example that we make DAPN phosphorus compounds to feed the agriculture. The phosphorus is mined. And nature and many of the best science journals, peer review journals say that at the current rate of phosphorus mining it would last about 125 years. And you don't want the agriculture to continue after that. What do you do? If you exhaust your mines, is there no other way we can grow food? So the input dependent, intensive input dependent, you know technological fixes do not help us in the long run. We need science, you need deeper science, larger science to understand all this, understand the human nutrition requirement, bio-divacity requirement, ecological requirement and you all are forming. Today for example, Wes Jackson, a brilliant guy in the US, the land institute, he talks about perennial crops. You need not even plow every day, every year and plant and replant and transplant and all that. Can you have perennial agriculture without the inputs? I mean that's something seriously we should. But of course when you do something, when you do an agriculture without the input, it doesn't help the pharmaceutical industry, it doesn't help the chemical industry, it doesn't help the government, it doesn't help the subsidy, it doesn't help anybody. So Ragu, one last question. How healthy is organic food? See if you ask how healthy I should ask you is if you think that the little bit of pesticide and antibiotics are okay, then it is not so healthy. If you think that more nutrients and phytochemicals, antioxidants are not all that important, then it's no different, there is no difference. So you see where you should look at this, if you do the comparison, based on this narrow nutrition concept of carbohydrate, protein, fat and all that, you may not see much difference. But if you look at the amino acids, if you look at the phyto-nutrient profile, if you look at the harm the pesticides and antibiotic residues can do to your human health, you see a world of difference. But you see the problem is Matt Ridley who wrote this famous book called Rational Optimist, where he says that in the high yield era, we have produced large quantity of starch which is sugary, which he says that there is more amylopectin and less of amylose, which means that it floods your blood quickly. What you eat floods your blood quickly and you don't spend the energy, it lands up being stored as fat. So there is a serious problem. If you see the very production system, the agriculture scientists are disconnected from nutritional aspect. Nutritional scientists are disconnected from something else, there is always a disconnected. But if you see the real value, you should be able to connect this way that when I give, we all have to derive 60% of starch for our energy because the blood and brain uses only starch as the energy source. But what kind of starch are you eating high yield, you know this sugary starch or complex starch, then you see the difference. A cow that works a lot and eats diversity of plants, you will have better nutrition in the milk. You will have higher omega 3 fatty acid than a cow that is always tied to its shed and you know just change from one shed to another shed. You will see a difference in the milk quality. So I would say that the difference that you will have to see, you know if you really see, I say that's why you know Oscar Wilde's famous statement that we today the modern age knows the price of everything but the value of nothing. So you will have to discriminate this way, then you see the real change. As I said you know that there are all large number of unknown compounds, unknown compounds. Don't take the current yardstick and judge and decide. You know that's why I say see we have one lakh variety of rice. But if you see the nutritive value of Indian foods or the nutrition table of the US FDA and many of the FAO tables, you get one table for rice. Are they all same? No, they are not same. You have different varieties of rice, different, they speak in different colors, size, shape, yield, whole load of difference you see. But nutritionally they are same. How can they be same? That's why you know Rumi the great Sufi saint said if you call me a Shia, Sunni, Hindu, Muslim, Christian and put me into any box that will be your coffin. So you must be able to, it's not that you know, it's not that the world changes but you need to develop a new eye to see this. Because our current scientific eye with which we see, there is a flaw in it, there is a fundamental flaw in it. Because you simply look at the protein, fat and all that. You don't care what kind of starch, you don't care whether it is sugary, you don't care whether there are phytochemicals, whether they are antioxidant. Forget this is a good part of it, the nutrition part of it. What about the bad part of it? Bad part of it. Am I okay with antibiotic residue? Am I okay with pesticide residue? Am I okay with growth hormones in the animal farming and the agriculture farming? Am I okay with early flowering chemicals? Am I okay with artificial ripeners? Am I okay with all that? I want my fruit to be natural and good so that I really enjoy my food.",
