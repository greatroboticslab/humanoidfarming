  "text": "high-speed contact guests. We've normally had markets now in the Midwest, covered in the corn belt, northern plains, southern plains, also in western Canada, and showing it for the first time this year into some of the vegetable and specialty crop areas here in southern California. Over the past year we've done some demonstrations in the area of proving its ability to not only be able to work in corn stalks, wheat stub or the row crops that we have in the Midwest, but also a lot of specialty applications that are here in California, different vegetable crops and different crop environments until it's practices that they have here. Especially crops that we've ran in here in California that included lettuce, broccoli, spinach and carrot ground, and seeing some of the harvesting practices they do here especially in lettuce, doing selective harvesting where you're still leaving some of the heads that are undesirable for sale in the field. It does a really good job in burying that residue, creating a good seed bed for the next year's crop, and basically doing a good finished job in the field after some of the traditional practices that we use here with the heavy rippers and also the heavy offset desks. Midwest the Joker's been used as a primary anisecberry tillage tool, and so far we've only seen here in the southern California area, it would be a complementary tool to some of the current traditional practices that are used in the offset desks and also with the heavy rippers, basically the clean up and the finishing tool behind those passes. The other network is expanding sales in the up this year, so it would continue to see very good growth in high-speed contact desks. We also see some of our competitors coming in from over in Europe and starting to have some successes here too, which is good for us because the concept of the contact desks is really something that we'll take on before we're seeing in the markets a big interest over what the guys have been using for the past five or six years in traditional vertical tillage. Some of the issues I've got are seeing vertical tillage, some of the dislikes they've had were really addressing with just the contact disc and the concept. So I mean I really see a bright future coming ahead for the high-speed contact disc concept. The biggest thing that surprised us about the contact disc is being how versatile the concept is being. With the Joker, we've got guys going into all types of front residues, sort of new row front now and now coming into the vegetable market. We see a big growing market for the high-speed contact disc here in North America. The guys are starting to see some issues with the traditional vertical tillage that they've been doing with the cutting coal and the type of machines, needing to have more blending of soil and residue for faster-week opposition. And just being able to do that at a fast speed. So I mean we continue to see that dynamic growing across the continent. Customers were coming very receptive to the high-speed contact disc. And frankly we see that as the next new popular way of the channel tillage here in North America.",
