  "text": "Today we discuss the Ford 5000 Utility Tractor 1965-1968 edition. Stick around to learn more. The Ford 5000 Utility Tractors were produced from 1965-1968 in the United States at the Highland Park Michigan factory. This American-made model came about after the wide success of the UK only Ford 5000 Supermajor which was produced before 1964. This model is often referred to as the pre-force because after 1969 the Ford 5000 6Y or Ford Force was available. Transmission. There were three transmissions available for this tractor. The 8-speed, the 10-speed full power shift and the 16-speed partial power shift. The 8-speed transmission offered 8 forward and 2 reverse gears via sliding gears. This was 4 gears in high and 4 gears in low. The tractor must be stopped before shifting gears. The 10-speed transmission was a select 0-speed transmission with full power shift. The operator could shift gears while moving. The 16-speed transmission offered 16 forward gears and 4 reverse via its dual power partial power shift design. Depending on the transmission, the tractors could generally accomplish 16 miles per hour in top gear. Engine. The Ford 5000 came with either a 3.8-liter four-cylinder 233 cubic inch gasoline engine or a 3.8-liter four-cylinder 233 cubic inch diesel engine, both of which produced about 69 horsepower, were liquid cooled and helped eight quarts of oil. Power. There are slight variations in power depending on the engine and the equipped transmission, but typical output of 69 horsepower from the engine was expected at 2100 rpm. The drawbar claimed 50.8 horsepower, but testing came in at 59.92. The drawbar was able to pull about 7200 pounds depending on engine and transmission in the machine. The PTO claimed 53.09 horsepower, but testing resulted in 67.31 horsepower. The PTO was independent of the transmission and operated at 540 rpm while the engine was at 1900 rpm and 1000 rpm when the engine was at 2060 rpm. Hydraulics. The tractor had an open-center hydraulic system that held 8.7 gallons of oil. The system produced 2500 psi and the pump flow was 6 gallons per minute. The power steering system ran at about 4.5 gallons per minute and produced 1050 pounds per square inch. Fuel system. The tractor held 20 gallons of fuel. Tires. The front tires were 6.0016 and the rear tires were 12.438. Some non-standard options were 7.516 fronts and 13.638 rear or even 15.538 rears. Dimensions. The wheelbase was 87.5 inches. The ground clearance was 14.25 inches. Weight. The tractors weighed in at 5,740 pounds from the factory. Ballasted, the weight climbed up to 9,700 pounds. Thank you for watching this video.
