Where do they get it wrong? Is it from the variety-selecting? Is it the market? Or what is it? Well in this tutorial we shall tell you everything that you need to know on successful tomato farming and especially how you can grow good tomatoes and the best timing for high prices. In this tutorial We shall cover the following topics. The Kenyan tomato industry. The best time to plant tomatoes in Kenya. The best place to grow tomatoes in Kenya. The most profitable high yield in tomato varieties to grow. How to plant good tomatoes. The worst tomato paste and how to control them. Tomato diseases and how to control them. Cost and profit of tomatoes farming. And finally the bonus tips. So make sure you speak till the end. If you really want to start getting good profit from your tomato farming. Actually at the end of this all you will realize what separates those who makes profit in tomato farming. And those who make crosses. And remember we are dedicating this fashion to those serious farmers. Those really focused farmers who need to start making a living and money and profit from tomato farming. The Kenyan tomato industry. Kenyan tomatoes most of them are sold in the market. Though there is a small portion absorbed by the industry. And therefore it is the mass market that determines the overall prices that farmers earn. Now tomato prices in Kenya. Ken be determined by weather, supply, demand and most of all the brokers will and grid. How much brokers want is what the farmer will sell simply because he cannot sell his own produce. And therefore the inability of most farmers to access market is what has empowered mass-reste brokers who never farm but eat the biggest pie of the tomato production. Selling tomatoes in kilograms especially as how industries absorb is the most profitable way for farmers. However brokers prefer using exploitive units of misia such as hip crates or pro box to and abnormal profits. The best time that you can plant tomatoes in Kenya. The perfect time that you can get good prices at low cost is one that coincides with low market supply. Yes. Plant in your tomatoes in such a way that will harvest them when they are least little market supply. At least at this time prices are high and even if brokers try to exploit you will still get good margins. And at this time especially when there is heavy rain. Most produce is destroyed by the rain. The roads are inaccessible. Therefore the supply is low and prices are high. I remember tomato demand is always there. People will still continue consuming tomatoes in the yard days of the weather. Where can you grow tomatoes? The best place to grow tomatoes is one that has fertile well drained soil and warm weather. Warm weather hastens and fastens the tomato growth. At low cost especially when it comes to controlling pangodiseases caused by cold weather. Green outdoor tomatoes in wet cold regions increases the cost of production especially in controlling diseases. Compared to doing it in warm weather regions. The greenhouse system is ideal in both hot and cold regions as it enables faster growth of crops. The most profitable high yielding tomato varieties to grow in Kenya. In order to make money in tomato farming you must select the best tomato variety with faster maturity, high yield and good tolerance to diseases. All tomato varieties are not the same. They vary in terms of yield and resistance to diseases. The best two varieties that you can plant and get good high yields is terminated from raw seeds and also from semi-nist. These are the best and most profitable outdoor tomatoes to grow in Kenya. For greenhouse farmers, Susanaifwan has good shape, good size and therefore makes it the best tomato variety to plant inside greenhouse. It is a product of raw seeds. Now let's check what makes terminated fwan a good variety. One it is a very vigorous plant, long, determinate and a heavy yielder. Its fruit has deep color with over shape. It matures with 75 days from transplanting, has a fruit weight of 125 to 150 grams, a yield potential of 40 tons per acre. And those harvested fruits, they can stay up to 21 days fresh at room temperature. This is what makes it most ideal for buyers. They want a produce that can stay long after harvest. Terminator fwan has a 21 day shelf life. Aneka can hold a plant population of around 8,000 plants of terminator. Another cool variety that you can do is also fwan from semi-nist. It is elongated, square, loud tomato hybrid. It's best for open field environmental condition. It brings value to growers with overall fruit quality, disease package, extended shelf life and plant yield. After getting the best variety, how do you plant it? Here is how you can plant good metro. In outdoor farming, dig planting holds on a spacing of 60 centimeters by 60 centimeters or 60 centimeters by 50 centimeters. But for greenhouse farming, you can do 50 centimeters by 50 centimeters simply because you will do the pruning. After that, apply weld compost manure, 2kg precisely per planting hole. Cover with the loose soil and water. Then drench with thandain sex site to kill any kathromes and city shooter or optimizer for removing any transplanting stress on the crop. After that, you can transplant your seedlings. In large scale farming, sosten seedlings is economical. However, for small scale farmers, raising your own seedlings is most economical. And the variety is guaranteed. Even for large scale farmers, if you can manage to raise your own seedlings, it's very very economical. And also the variety is guaranteed. We've experienced several cases where farmers, they ordered or outsourced seedlings, but they were not the variety that they were promised. Giving farmers roses. And remember, you can only realize this few months down the line and it's irreversible. There's nothing much you can do. Raising own seedlings is guaranteed of quality and variety. After you planted your tomatoes, the next thing is feeding. Feding is what determines the yield. Regardress of the variety, if you have a good variety and you don't feed it well, you will definitely experience low yields. Here is the tomato fertilizer application schedule. The fertilizer that you need to apply, how? And even the quantity. Tobresu with DAP, NPK, 7017, and CAN fertilizers on the 14th day after transplanting, 45th day after transplanting, and 16th days after transplanting, respectively. What do I mean? I mean, during planting you don't apply the DAP. Two weeks after your seedlings have developed, you can now come and apply the DAP. At this time, the seedlings will have developed the root hairs and managed to absorb the fertilizer. If you apply during the planting, it may be easily reached away and not add up helping the crop. After that, 45 days equivalent to one and a half months after transplanting, you can now apply NPK 171717. It has the burners, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. This will initiate fruiting and flowering. So you don't skip this one and go to CAN now. This one will initiate fruiting and flowering and give you high number of fruits and flowers. After that, then two months after transplanting, you can apply now the CAN fertilizer. CAN has the calcium that will help in expansion of the fruit. That's why we usually recommend it to be done 60 days after transplanting. You can supplement this fertilization by applying nitrogen for your fertilizers, such as you can apply the grow vegetative on the first month, that is, two weeks after transplanting on your top desk thing. Every week you do is a grow vegetative to enhance for your growth. On the second month, after transplanting, now you apply the NPK for your fruiting and flowering, such as the WUGZO and also ADVANCE K. This one has more potassium and it will help in fruiting and flowering. On the third month, you can now apply calcium rich folias fertilizers to prevent blossom end rot and also these calcium boron folias will prevent in fruit and flower abortion. After that, we are going to look at the worst tomato paste and how to control them. Imagine after selecting the best variety, pidin, then now what kicks out all of tomato farming, it's paste and diseases. We are not going to allow this. And that's why we are now giving you the worst of all and the best chemicals you can use and how you can manage to apply them. The number one paste that has run most farmers out of business is deutabusoruta or what we call leaf miner. It's the most destructive paste in tomato farming due to its infectiveness to most chemicals caused by insect nature of damage. Actually it tends to hibernate between the layers of the leaves so that when you apply the chemicals they are much not effective. To identify them very easily you can see some marks as the kind of snail passing by. We often call them blood shaped mines on the leaves. Really you find them on stems but you can also find them there. The best control for deutabusoruta is applying the best chemicals early. So you can apply belt for a male at the rate of 20 litters of water or a amount 10 ml per 20 litters of water. These applications should be done from the third week after transplanting and you continue at risk weekly, weekly, weekly. And when you apply, you apply on the leaves, below the leaves and also on the soil. Okay, why do we apply on the soil so that we can manage to kill all the eggs laid on the soil? Below the leaves you need to control it and also on top control. When you do this, you will manage to have a total control before it reaches the worst stage where it's like a fly. Remember it goes to the whole metamorphosis so if you don't control it directly before becoming an insect it will be hard and this is what has caused most farmers low yields. You find fruits, they have made some holes and buyers don't also want to buy them. No one wants to buy a tomato with walls made of insect. So the best way ensure that you can use belt for a male per 20 litters of water or a amount 10 ml per 20 litters of water and apply early. There is no shortcut about it. The next insight that has caused total destruction in crops and especially in greenhouse farmers is white rice. This one has drained most farmers. White rice, they are white star stacking insects and by doing so they tend to promote growth of such a mode kind of restricted honey due. They cause irregular ripening of tomatoes and can also transmit viral pathogens like the tomato yellow leaf cal virus. To identify them you just need to shake the plants a little bit and you will see white flying insects along. To control them apply profile at 30 ml per 20 litters of water or also a amount 10 ml per 20 litters of water. The application invits on greenhouses should be done on the midday invits on the farm should be done on the evening. You apply around the farm and then you apply inside. Not inside then you finish with around no. Spraying fast around the farm contains them and makes them easy to be killed. After controlling the pace the next thing you need to watch out is the tomato diseases. Here is how you can control them early. The most destructive tomato disease is bright. Of any known as badidi, kuchomeka. This one has drained a lot of farmers and kicked them out of tomato farming business. Tomato early bright is a disease characterised by brown spot with dark constrictory trends. The disease spreads rapidly affecting the leaves and the stem and finally it affects the fruits. To control it apply mistrace 72wp at the rate of 30g per 20 litters of water or redomilk gold at the rate of 50g per 20 litters of water. The best way to control them is early application. Once they are affected it becomes very very hard. Remember the cells of plant die so you cannot manage to revive them and therefore the best way is to prevent early. When you see in litra infestation you can first apply copper beast fangisite such as the green corp or lisa corp and then after that you now continue applying the normal fangisite. But most of all is ensuring that you prevented the infestation. And the best application lit is applying twice per week in cold seasons or heavy rains season or once per week in hot seasons. The next disease that has destroyed a lot of tomatoes is tomato yellow leaf sport disease. You find the leaves has black spots. The bright end sport disease are different. For sport disease you find spots evenly distributed on the leaves but for bright you will find along the margins as if they are starting to dry. It starts by affecting older leaves with greenish yellow spots begging from the top of the leaf. Progressively the spots become dark with infected bosoms also turning black and falling off. The disease it also affects fruits. For effective control you can apply either trinity gold at the rate of 50 grams per 20 tl of water or you can also apply the score. Yes at the rate of 20 ml per 20 tl of water these two will help in total control of leaf sport. Leaf sports and bright these are the worst diseases that will kick you out of tomato farming. Imagine all that investment in bees is where you come to fall or after all that investment and then you let just because of the carelessness you let your crops be destroyed by these paste the tutor and also the white flies. Actually we don't expect any farmer listening to this tutorial to be ever again stressed by this disease we've given you total control. And after you've done this now let's do the math how much are you willing or highly likely to make in how much are you highly likely to incur because in profit of tomato farming in Kenya the cost of tomato production in Kenya is 1.5,000 Kenyan shillings and you can find all this math on our previous article which you can click here above. This often varies with season, location and management and a good management aneka can produce 300 crates If a farmer sells one crate at around 100 shillings then he earns 300,000 shillings from 300 crates in one aneka this gives him a profit of around 115,000 however if he does sell just similar crates below 805,000 and even as it was in some months past at 300 shillings per crate the farmer definitely make losses so therefore the best means that you can manage to get good profit is selling your yield above 1000 shillings per crate at least this way you'll get some good profit remember we promised as we begin to give you the bonus tips we have the very bonus tips how you can increase yield then the second one how you can speed the tomato growth and also the third one how you can get your tomatoes to produce more fruits now to increase yield and especially tomato yield ensure that you've planted with 2 kg of manure ensure that you've depressed with 100 kg of DAP 100 kg of NPK 3x17 100 kg of CAN and you've done sufficient irrigation don't forget also to control the best end diseases once you do that you will definitely increase your yield the next one on speeding the tomato growth ensure that you've planted in warm areas ensure that you water very well and you feed them palm tree and by feeding I mean giving them the light fertilizer at the right time note that you're giving the DAP 2 months or your PINCAN at the beginning those one will not give you the good results the third one how do you get your tomatoes to produce more fruits one you can spray high potassium folia fertilizers such as advanced K these one will enhance flowering and fruiting and don't forget to combine it with boron boron will prevent the formed fruits and flowering from aborting and that being don't forget to add calcium it will prevent the brosome and rods that's how smart farmers grow tomatoes and make a kill from it I believe now you can comfortably begin your tomato farming if you have any question on tomato farming kindly let us know in the comment section we are willing to help you and we are willing to help you get those 400 or even 500 crates you get about 40 tons yes remember if you get high yields and at low cost regardless sometimes of the price you definitely get good margins but if you have low yields and you get low prices you end up making losses and in tomato farming there is no shortcuts there is no shortcut you cannot plant and no PV variety and you expect 40 tons you cannot deny the crop a CN or N PK and you expect good plant you cannot skip weekly spraying of chemicals to control teutabus or uta, white flies, bright yellow spots black spots you cannot skip that chemical application and you expect good yields it doesn't happen like that you have to be consistent don't forget also to like, to subscribe and to share see you next in the next tutorial",
