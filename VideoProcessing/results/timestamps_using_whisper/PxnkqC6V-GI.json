  "text": "And VARA's new carbon standard make rice farming more sustainable. VARA recently introduced a verified carbon standard VCS methodology, the MO051, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from rice farming. Under this guideline, farmers will practice improved water and crop management practices in flooded rice systems. VARA began developing this methodology in late 2023. They held a public consultation in 2024 with ATOA Carbon and external reviewers to refine VMO051. The new standard, improved management in rice production systems, V1.0, replaces the old clean development mechanism CDM method AMS-II.O. The previous method ended in March 2023. VARA's VMO051, a new approach to reducing rice emissions. Rice is a staple for over half the world's population. Rice fields cover around 168 million hectares, but they also release a lot of methane, which is a potent environmental pollutant. As mentioned before, VMO051 promotes sustainable farming techniques. These methods reduce methane emissions from rice farming and improve water and fertilizer use. The standard also provides social benefits by raising farmers' income and helping women get training and financial services in agriculture. Generate high quality credits.",
