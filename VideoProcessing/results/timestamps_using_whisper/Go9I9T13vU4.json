  "text": "In a small community in the Pacific Northwest, a dynamic company is growing. This company has served the equipment dealer market for 30 years. They did it by following their principles, by being the best and by being honest to their customers. DIS. Technology driven. People focused. The moisture was good, the commodity prices were real good, and we happened to gamble at the right time. It was one where we probably shouldn't have got as many sales as we did, but it was because of some of our loan programs where instead of taking the guys that tractors were broke down, the used tractors that we had, we took them in and we owned them. By the time we got their used one back, they said, we'll just keep it. And it's one where you don't know until you try, and a lot of these guys won't be able to make up their mind until they get sitting there and they put on 10, 15 hours on it and realize, you know what, maybe I can do this, money happens to be there, or sometimes you might not realize that's the only way. It might be a year down the road, but if the seed is planted, that's all you can hope for is that it will grow and it will get you something to come back with. Because that growth for us, it has exceptional. And do we know if we'll ever have another year like it? No, we sure hope we do. We hope we can improve on that year. But at the same time, we're optimistic, but we're still optimistic. And if we can't go forward and realize that we might not have another year like that, we might not be truthful to ourselves. And that's the biggest thing. We're honest with ourselves, we can be honest with anybody. The main thing about the growth, that's a great number of what have you. We major in growth with customer satisfaction. The customers are happy to tell your neighbor, if you're upset, call me, call Ken. That's what we're here for. Because at the end of the day, that's all that matters. I mean, we chose a profession to sell equipment in a rural area, which is probably not the most glamorous for some people. But you know what, it's a great place to raise your family. The employees love it. Some of the other amenities that we have around here, hunting, fishing, you know, hear the birds sing, so to speak, on it, which would drive a lot of people crazy. But if we didn't love what we were doing, we wouldn't be here. And the customers, there's our testament to it. With our sales and things like that, they're at the end of the day. That's what we need to do to be successful.",
