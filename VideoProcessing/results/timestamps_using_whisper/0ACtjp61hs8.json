  "text": "Did you know that ancient Mesopotamia like thousands of years ago revolutionized agriculture? That's right. Around 3000 BCE the Sumerians developed advanced plows and irrigation systems that transformed farming. The plow, a crucial invention, allowed them to till the soil more efficiently, increasing crop yields. Their sophisticated irrigation systems, including canals and dikes, enabled them to control water flow from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, ensuring a stable water supply for their crops. These innovations supported the growth of their civilization and influenced agricultural practices for millennia. So tell me.",
