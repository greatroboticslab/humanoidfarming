  "text": "Again, historically, drainage was just thought of as getting rid of water as quickly and as efficiently as you could to make the crop ground more productive. But more recently, with some of the more climate extremes that we've seen where we still have those wet intense springs with intense rainfalls, but maybe the drier summers where we're actually seeing some crop stress and yield loss due to not enough precipitation. We're looking at a more of a multi-purpose practice of drainage water recycling where we're still draining the agricultural lands, but instead of just draining all of that water downstream, we're capturing some of it and storing it in a pond or reservoir. And then later on in the season, in the summer, when it's maybe a little drier and the crop needs more water, the landowner can then utilize that captured water to irrigate it back on to their farmland. So this is a really exciting new type of project that we're seeing a lot of momentum in.",
