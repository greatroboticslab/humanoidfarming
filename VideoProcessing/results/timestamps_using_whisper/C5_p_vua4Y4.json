And when you start looking at gap, there are slightly different types of gap. There's gaps specifically for mushrooms, for tomatoes, for aquaponics, and for a few other things. There are certain categories within gaps. So there's the harvest step or the production step, field production. There's the harvesting or pack house, and then there's post harvest handling. And less, I don't know about you, because I think at some point you would wash your sunflower shoots, which would probably be considered post harvest handling. Since we don't wash our greens in any way, we did not have to comply with or fulfill or go through the hoops of the post harvest category of requirements.",
