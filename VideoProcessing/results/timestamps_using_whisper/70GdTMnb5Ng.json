  "text": "If you want to get a large crop of potatoes, at the same time spend little effort on growing them. Then use this method, dig not deep holes, in them spread out one potato at a distance of 15cm. Sprinkle with soil to cover the seedlings slightly. Lay the straw on top with a thick layer, at least 10cm. And pour plenty of water. See the straw will hold tightly, it will always be wet under and the potatoes will grow large and clean. A more detailed video has already been released on my channel, link in the description.",
