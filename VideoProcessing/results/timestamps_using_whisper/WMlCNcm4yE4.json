  "text": "This paper explores the concept of urban agriculture in Portugal, arguing that its primary focus is on food production for self-consumption with limited links to other components of urban systems. The paper presents international definitions of urban agriculture, analyzes interviews with key actors and a web search based on key words. It concludes that there is a need for clarification of the concept among actors involved and suggests a national network to raise debate about this sector. Political decision makers, civil society and planners should be involved in this collaborative process. The Portuguese experience contributes to the broader debate and definitions of urban agriculture. This article was authored by Cecilia Delgado.",
