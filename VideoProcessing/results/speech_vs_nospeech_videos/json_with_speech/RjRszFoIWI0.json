  "text": "The Southern Alberta Council on Public Affairs acknowledges that we are gathered on the lands of the Blackfoot people of the Canadian Plains, and we pay respect to the Blackfoot people past, present, and future, while recognizing and respecting their cultural heritage, beliefs, and relationship to the land. We offer respect to the M\u00e9tis and all who have lived on this land and made Lethbridge their home. Welcome! I'm so excited to be moderating. My name is Crystal Krain. I currently work at the Galt Museum and Archives at Guy's Salivinovno. And I am really looking forward to learning about today's presentation. I feel really honored to have SACPA as a support in this community and to have opportunities to learn from different individuals and completely different worlds than what I live in. So today we have Joshua Deitchie, who is the CEO of the VADS Egg. How does biological technology play into the practice of sustainable and regenerative farming? So as a lot of you, I see a lot of friendly faces. Remember to turn off your cell phone. Remember the presentation is 25 to 30 minutes, and then we will do a Q&A where you can line up right here. Or if you would like, please write it down, bring me the piece of paper and we can ask the presenter then. And again, always important to remind everybody as a moment of respect and education that we are gathered on the grounds of the M\u00e9tis to be. This is their traditional land. This is the land of the Ghana, this is the land of the Emskapi Bikani, the Bikani and the Siksika, as well as we pay respect to the M\u00e9tis in every individual Indigenous person who makes left bridge their home. So please warmly welcome Joshua Deitchie and so excited to have you here to speak on this. Thank you so much. I'm just going to move this up just a little bit. I will talk to all of them. And by the way, I don't think I've seen someone have the land acknowledgement memorized like that. So congratulations on that. Good job. Thanks for the warm welcome. Everyone, it's nice to have some home cooked food on a day like today where we have an overcast weather and it's a little chilly outside. So appreciate that. What I'm going to do today is we've been in business for 24 years now working with bacteria and it's been quite a journey. And I think right now we're seeing a shift in agriculture, not just in Southern Alberta but across North America and even globally. It's a very exciting time in agriculture and what we are doing is a big part of that. So I saw my time slot was 12 to 1. I created a large presentation. I realized I have half an hour. So I will be skipping over some slides and then we can get to some more topics through the question period. Alright. So as mentioned, my name is Joshua Deitchie from the CEO of this family run and founded organization. My mother started the company 24 years ago, 2001 as an instructor at the Lafriage Community College at the time, I believe. We really were just looking at different bacteria and what they can do in aquatic ecosystems. We knew that there was some research out there that showed that some of the bugs, microscopic bugs could break down organic matter in septic tanks and in lakes and ponds and wastewater environments. So Dr. Phyllis Deitchie decided to go down the hallway to Calc Oskowicz who's here. And she said, what do you think of this business idea? And he said, Phyllis, don't quit your day job. People weren't talking a lot about bacteria back then. But I am with iRap and I think they can get you some funding money. So we made a partnership with iRap which lasted many, many years over a decade and started working with the Aquaculture Center of Excellence at the college to just start doing research. And this is again really where it started. We were looking at using bacteria to clean up lakes and ponds. Today there's not a lot of budget for these types of products but even back then there was less. So the situation had to be pretty bad and this is actually the city of Chastamira Pond where we treated with our natural bacteria and cleaned up the algae in this pond. There's actually a golf course on the other side so you got to imagine all those nutrients and everything running into that pond. Created quite an eye sore for those homeowners on the side there. We did work with Henderson Lake in the city of Lethbridge a number of years ago. And this was really our first eye-opening moment. With all the research we had done over the first five to eight years, we didn't have any customers during that time. So the city of Lethbridge was actually one of our first customers. And Henderson Lake being 62 acres in size I believe, we weren't sure if all of our research was going to work in the real world necessarily. We worked with them, they had 15 years of baseline data, we treated the lake for three years and we had a 64% reduction in organic sludge in those three years. Now over time Henderson Lake has had more and more issues and really it comes down to a budgeting thing. A lot of times with these municipalities, parks, departments, where's the money to treat these bodies of water? Because we started cleaning up ponds, lakes, things like that, we started working with a lot of farmers. They all have dugouts and they have cattle around their dugouts and they're concerned with their water quality. So as we built a customer base with more farmers, they said, hey, do you have anything for crops? I'm thinking why would we want back to your crops? And I had a bit of a background in that at the time but I need to do more. The conversation really across the board was the same. They said we fit a wall for putting on more and more fertilizer every single year and we're not getting more. It's getting more expensive, we need to change. So I started looking into this, went online, started researching what are they talking about. And as I look at fertilizer use for hectare across North America, we see more and more fertilizer applied on crops. And fertilizer has been one of the more important innovations in that kind. It's helped feed the world, right? The issue is if you look at the efficiency of these types of products, they're not efficient. And when you have farmers spending more and more and more every single year, I mean looking at between Canada and the US, it's just over 50% efficiency. So if you're putting down 100 pounds, you're only getting half of that. That's not sustainable. So this is what they were talking about. Started doing more research. And this is a, you can go online and find things on this topic, but they figured by the year 2050, we're going to need around 60% more food to feed the world. There's more and more people, populations are growing. Is it more food? Is it better food? You know, that's debatable, but reality is that these fertilizers are not efficient. 46% of them are leached into our environment, into our water, into our soil. What's the solution for this? We know it's around these biological technologies. AI is another thing that's developing, but we know that the global market for biological products, bacteria that can improve soil health and plant development naturally is growing. Today, the market's 14 billion, and in a few years, four years, they figure it's going to be around 30 billion. And we're living that in the real world. Our business has seen this growth over the last few years. So when we talk about biologicals, we all get thrown into the same bucket, but there's multiple types of products that are under different categories. Three in particular, you have your bioskinulants. These are things that would stimulate natural bacteria in the soil, almost like a sugar or something like that that would stimulate the bacteria that are already there. Bio-control products. I'm going to get into this in a few slides, but we're working on a bacteria that can literally consume disease and fungal infections in plants. Very, very intriguing. The other one's a biofertilizer. So these are your bacteria that can take nutrients in the soil that the plant can't use or in the atmosphere and convert it to a plant-available form. It seems very technical, but I'll show some slides here that ties into that a little bit more. What a time for us to be alive. There's probably been three or four different times that moms should have shut this business down along this journey, along the 24 years. Almost bankrupt, no customers, no one wanted to listen to us. We were the crazy ones in the room just five years ago. Today, we know they're here to stay. We actually went down to Silicon Valley, met a lot of the big organizations that are putting a lot of money into this. Two companies in the U.S. I want to highlight, Indigo Egg, they've raised $250 million. Pivot Bio has raised $618 million to focus on the research of these technologies. And here we are. We've been doing this research for a long time. Like, timing is good for us. We're also seeing legislative support. So in Europe, they're starting to ban certain chemicals, certain fertilizers, things like that, and really move this route. And then, you know, farmers are seeing results. They're playing around with different products, they're trying different things, and we're seeing some success there. So there's definitely a shift. But there's issues with that. When we see that large growth in the market, you're going to have companies rush to the market, try to sell a product, it's not going to work, it's going to create some lack of trust with farmers. So just a fun fact here. A survey of 110 retailers or fertilizer supply companies in North America, 89% of them plan to push biologics more in the future. However, 41% of farmers in that same survey have a lack of trust in those products. And there's a reason why. It sales people going out and selling these products to people. Do they understand these products? These are living organisms, they're not chemicals. Do they understand what they're going to do in different soil types, different climates, different input programs for farmers? They don't. We know this. Ease of use. I've seen some products that say put on one ounce of bacteria on per acre. And we only have to think about that, right? You look at the acre of land and see that shot glass of bacteria. Probably not going to do much. And where's the data? I mean, it's great that some of these products are developed in a laboratory setting, that there's IP and different patents built around these products. But what is it doing on the farm? What is it doing under replicated plot work? That's what we have focused on. So there's some issues, but it's coming along. So our journey in the early days when we were working on water was really trying to figure out how to mix different bacteria species together. Just like anything in our natural environment, different species of anything want to outcompete each other. It's the same with bacteria. So when you're mixing them together, feeding them, growing them, the fast growers, the lazy guys, they want to grow faster than the slow guys. It just so happens a lot of times the slow guys are the ones we want around our plants and in our soil. So we focused on that in the early days. And then in 2015 when we moved into agriculture, we honed in on a more targeted approach of research. We wanted to see what these bacteria would do, not only in soil environments, but if we were to take, for example, this plate here is tricalcium phosphate, the white areas tricalcium phosphate. In our soils, we have so much phosphorus, it's just not plant available. It isn't. So our solution over the last 50-100 years is let's dump on a bunch of phosphorus that's plant available. Well, what if we can access that phosphorus that's there? So in this test here with this plate, we took a little colony of bacteria right there and that zone of clearing around it, sorry for those in the back that can't see, that's orthophosphate. These bacteria are literally turning unavailable phosphorus into an available form of phosphorus. When we talk about sustainability, I mean this is a big thing. So a lot of these bacteria that we've been working with here over the last seven, eight years, we've been focused on functionality. What are they doing around the plant and in the soil? We started seeing some results internationally. You go to countries like Brazil, every farm in Brazil is using a biological. We looked at Central America, we were seeing results on aloe vera, pineapples, bananas, anything you can imagine that's high-valued crop. These guys are going out there, backpacks spraying, an acre of whatever it is. And we were seeing responses on disease resistance, yield increase, biomass. What does that mean for Canada? What does that mean for North America? We're probably applying a lot less product for acre than some of these guys with these high-valued crops. So what we did was we brought the product out here and we started working with Dr. Bill Hammond out of Nobleford and just started doing replicate work. We wanted to look at peas, barley, canola, wheat, kind of your typical crops that would be grown around here. And just to see if there was a response. And we did four to five times, we saw a response with significant data. But more than anything, I think it was good to see this response. And honestly at the time I was a little naive because when we started getting these reports back, I'm like, oh my goodness, we're going to be on every farm. This is great. Like, why would any farmer say no to us when we have this data signed off from a PhD saying it works? Well, guess what? This is under irrigation. This is, you know, manure spread fields. This is not a dryland farmer in Saskatchewan or a potato farmer in Tabor. It's not their land. It's not their input program. So at the very least what we learned from those three years of replicate trials was that, you know, which crops would respond best? What dosage rates? We know it's not an ounce per acre. What application methods work best? Putting it, you know, in furrow through the pivot, spraying it on. We learned a lot during those first three years. And then there was a demand for it. So as we got the product out there and started trying this on different variety crops across Alberta, parts of Saskatchewan, not all the time you'd see a line in the field like this, but every time we pulled plants with the control and treated there was better root development. That didn't always mean better yield, but we were seeing responses. And we were learning a lot with our farmers at that time. To me, this was my Henderson Lake moment where this was a field in foremost with Hutterite colony and they had two inches of rain on this field of plant crop. Not a good crop whatsoever, but to see that line in the field with our bacteria was something, the research cost a lot of money in the early days. And this was kind of the moment where I was like, wow, we're onto something here. This is one up in Beckerville where the left side, the treated side of wheat was actually seven days advanced compared to the control. So this farmer was able to harvest his crop a little bit earlier compared to his control and all of his neighbors. So that was good. We had some success with that particular product. We still had to push the envelope of research. So in 2017, I mentioned different products that are designed to replace fungicide applications, bacteria that could consume fungal infections. So we looked at doing something like this. This picture you see here is a profile of a fungal cell wall. Every fungal infection looks similar to this, but there's one similarity that every single infection has, and it says purpleish pink line here called chitin. Does anyone know what chitin is? It's an ingredient in crab shells, lobster shells, beetle shells, things like that. And we just found out that our bacteria like that stuff as a nutrient source. And what we did was we took our bacteria, we grew it with crab and lobster shell chitin so that they were used to feeding on that nutrient source, and then over the last 24 hours of producing it, we started of that nutrient source. So what are they going to do when we go and apply it on the crops? The theory was that they would want to go out and consume that layer of chitin, which would break down the cell wall of the fungal infection. And when we did a study on bananas in the Dominican Republic, we saw that it not only outperformed the conventional fungicide, the bounce back of the disease wasn't near as bad. And this study was important because bananas used to be grown in Florida many, many decades ago, but because of a soil-borne disease, a form of fusarium called laxigatoka, they cannot produce bananas there anymore. So this is a real big issue, not only in Florida, Dominican, but anywhere producing bananas. We believe this is a way that we can kind of turn that around. We did partner with some world-class research organizations like EuroFins that are due diligence there to do some more plot work. So at least 5% to 15% yield increases on soybeans. And then just the small world we lived in, the farmers and agriculture, the customers we were working with, it didn't take long for a customer in Saskatchewan to say, hey, I want this on my lentils. We deal with the enphanomyces and in a bad year it can wipe out around 70% of our lentil crop. It is a huge issue in southern Saskatchewan, Moses Saskatchewan. So we did a trial with him. He didn't know much, but he was willing to put it on his crops. We took a conventional chemical fungicide, sprayed it on his lentils, split the field, did our bacterial SRP product on his lentils and chickpeas. And so this image here is a biomass image. And so you can just see the red is where there's some stress, where there's not a lot of biomass. The green, there's more biomass. And his agrologist actually worked for Sask Pulse and she's going, what's going on here? This is real. We got to walk these fields. There was something there. And like I do, the world of Saskatchewan, I always say you're one farmer away from knowing every farmer in western Canada. And I really, truly believe that. So these guys talked, right? This guy's one of the coffee shop and talking to his neighbors. Words spread really fast for us. Now here's one thing that we really believe in in our business. As great as a lot of these technologies being developed in agriculture are, if it's not making the farm money, it's not sustainable. Everyone loves that word sustainability, especially in agriculture. But if it's not making these farmers money, is it sustainable? It's not. The two go hand in hand. So we've really focused on this. Okay, our products doing these things, but how is it making the farmer money at the end of the day? We don't want to just be a feel good product that these guys are using. How is it generating income for them? The next generation that's coming and going to take over the farm. We had a group come into our office three years ago that farms around 150,000 acres in southern Saskatchewan. And these are your typical farmers, they're hard-to-regraduates. So people that know what they're really, really doing in terms of trial work, big, big farm. We did three years of trials on their lentils and their wheat. And this is pretty much the average for those trials. So we were gaining them around 6.7 bushels an acre of the right program. We tried mixing it with different fertilizer, different chemicals, different bio-stimulants. And when I went out to their farm, I was quite shocked because I go into their shop and they had every biological product you can imagine in their shop. And I'm thinking like, I thought you were happy with our product. Like, why aren't we just using our product? Well, part of their due diligence was to test every biological they can get their hand on. They had a biologist on staff to run these trials. And so for us to come out on top really, really means a lot. This is their proposed group setup now. So they're actually producing the bacteria on site. We're now doing 40,000 acres, all of their lentils on their farm and looking at an additional 20,000 acres of their wheat through a seed treatment. Okay, what about locally? I had a potato farmer, a purple springs contact me six years ago. And he said, and it's because we were treating their dugout. And he said, Josh, I'm just curious about this soil product you have. I have a piece of land that is not producing anything. It's a big alkali patch and nothing will grow there. I'm just curious that if we were just dump on your stuff, if it would work. And I said, I'm curious too, man. I don't know. I don't know. So I'm just going to dump the product, go dump it on and see what you get out of it. You can see there's some bare spots there, but he grew a crop. And it kind of got him down the road. Okay, let's look into this a little bit more. I believe that the processors like McCain's and Frito later are going to start pushing this narrative of sustainability. They want to put it on their bag of potato chips. Regeneratively grown. I believe we need to produce better food and use better methods to do that. So I want to continue researching this product. So he's a chipper grower with Frito-A. We started doing research with, it started with reducing his fertility. So every year we worked with him, we reduced his fertility by 5%. Most potato farmers are probably over fertilizing anyways. So the first two years, I think it was quite easy to see that we weren't seeing any yield drags with his potatoes. But what really intrigued us is when he went to a storage facility and saw a line in his potatoes where he had a lot of rot in his potatoes, which is pretty normal, and essentially none. And he had to go back as a skid steer operator that noticed it, went back in his piles and it was with our trials that he was using our bacteria with. So then he was all farm. He's like, I'm doing everything. This obviously works for a couple of years into this. We've reduced my fertility. And I'm going to say he's been our guinea pig, but he's really worked with us to help understand our products more on potatoes. Two years ago we started splitting fields with our products to replace fungicides. And two years ago it wasn't a high disease pressure year, but the fields did not look any different. And these potato farmers will go out four to six different times in spray of fungicides. Very carcinogenic. It's not great for our potatoes. We know this, but it's what they have to do to deal with these diseases and type rotations. Last year he went full farm. He grew every acre of potatoes with no fungicide on whatsoever. He sent me this picture and I almost had a mini heart attack because I didn't know what it was or what it was. There was no context with it. He just sent me the picture and so I called him like, oh, is it not working? He's like, right? Panic. A lot of money on those acres. He was so happy. He said, we saw some early blight on our potatoes. We sprayed your stuff and within 12 hours the leaves were crispy. It dealt with the blight. We're continuing. So the entire year last year, no fungicide whatsoever, isn't making him money. Over the last five or six years we've compiled all the data, everything he's done, and have looked at cost per acre. He's leasing some land to some other potato farmers. He is making, on most acres, around $80 more or saving $80 more per acre than the rest of the farmers. While yielding more on his potatoes. And we're not talking about storage. We're not talking about quality. And all the ripple effects that go along with it. FreeOA came up and looked at his field and they were like, okay, what's going on here? Because when he submitted his records to FreeOA they said this is impossible. You're the only farmer not top dressing your potatoes. You reduce your fertility by 25%. Your timing, you use no fungicide. But we're doing it. And so, and it wasn't something we figured out overnight. It's taken six years of working with this guy to figure out the right program. So this is just a QR code. We have a video of him talking about it, talking about the history of his farm and where he's gone. And just wanted to throw that out there. The last one I wanted to highlight is in a very, very dry area in Sunburst, Montana. For us, we're in Raymond, our facilities in Raymond. We will get out, like last year we got quite a bit of rain in the spring. They got none of it. And when we went out to his field day it was the saddest crops I've ever seen. That yellow lentils I shared it with them at their grower meeting. And I was like, this is a terrible crop. That's a bumper crop for us, right? So just totally different perspectives. So he's been producing our bacteria on site. And this is an agronomist. This is a guy who really knows his stuff and ran a number of trials with us over the last few years. This is his yearly rain, by the way. You can just see it's trending down. So these guys are spending upwards of $200 an acre on their fields and then not yielding anything. Just getting the insurance check every single year. So he really started to move away from that and wanted to move down the sustainability route. We cut out all of these products over the years for him. And yes, his crops still look terrible. But guess what? His nutrient levels in his plants, tough to see here maybe, but we're actually increasing phosphorus in his plants, available phosphorus in the soil over this time. And not to mention we were saving him over $162 an acre. That's sustainability, you guys. For dry land farmers that are really struggling, that's sustainability. So now we're seeing a pocket of, sorry, not Saskatchewan, Montana. Montana really starting to grow for us. This guy will have grower meetings, share the information, share the data, and now every farm is trying it and it's working. They're cutting out all of these products. And by the way, I just want to talk a little bit about that because fertilizers need it. A lot of these chemical herbicides are needed. I just think we've been too reliant on them. And I think there needs to be a balance. And a lot of these products are going to create that. So again, it all comes down to data and our buy on the farm. So he's spending over half of what he used to since 2018. So yeah, we were the creative ones in the room for many, many years. Mom still is at times. She's one of one. But guess what? We're starting to get recognized. And it's really just the success we're having on the farm with our research groups. We got chosen as one of the top 12 startup companies for soil health in Canada through SVG Thrive, which is really just an accelerator that, you know, you get to rub shoulders with the executives. They help you with your business, give you advice, things like that. Didn't really know what to think when we joined it, but they sent us down to Silicon Valley. The reason I have these slides in here is because it was a very high-opening experience for us. We learned about where all the venture capital money is going. And we sat in this room and they went on and on about biologicals, right? And we're sitting here like, oh my goodness, like, oh, we've done all this work. They actually sent us to the Bear Life Hub, where we got to hear their head biologist talk about all the research they've done on their biological products. And it's somewhere in the range of $100 and $120 million last year they put into this research. I would love that money for research. We would be so much further ahead. But as she's presenting, I'm learning that this stuff that they're figuring out, we learned that four or five years ago. We're actually ahead of them. And why they brought us in was to really partner with us. They want what we have. They want our research because we're having success with it. Their pitch to us was that we'll get you in 32 countries. We'll distribute your products. We'll work with you on that end. They're huge and they can do that. However, these products aren't at that stage yet. We don't understand them. We're not in this to make a quick buck. Distribute our products across the globe and have 50% success rate with these farms because they don't understand and understand salespeople swinging their products. We want to work with the farmers. We want to understand their issues. What fertility program they have in place so that we have success on every farmer on. And I think we're seeing a lot of these big companies are going to swing and miss with this biological thing because of this. They're too big. This is the future. This is where I get really excited about our products. We're actually doing genetic sequencing on the bacteria. This is really interesting because anyone know of ancestry.ca? You spit in it too. You find out you have a cousin in Norway. It tells you all kinds of things about your genetic make-up. Humans have not been around on earth very long. Our genetic fingerprint is not massive. It will tell us our relatives. It will tell us what part of the world we're from. Things like that. Bacteria have been around since the start of time. When we take a bacteria species and look at its DNA, we learn all kinds of things. How these things have evolved over time. Honestly, if there's no other biological company doing this work yet, they're so far behind. I believe in the last 12 to 24 months, we've learned more about our products than we have in the last 24 years. Just a quick example of that. You guys cut me off. Just a quick example. Four species, when we look at drought tolerance, this is how they've evolved over time. Some of these species, drought tolerance, disease control. What we're doing is we're trying to focus on seed treatments, things like that, where we can put it around the seed and take the right bacteria if someone wants drought tolerance for these dry areas or has disease issues. We're putting it up against the big guys. We're putting it up against the gentist products, chemical hundreds of treatments. We want to see what it's going to do. This is a study in Germany we have right now. Just after 14 days, we have better root development, we have healthier plants. So we're looking at all these things and we're wrapping it up, I promise. We know they're here to stay. Education is the missing piece. That's why I was invited. I'm like, yeah, I want to talk about this. This is my job in a company now is to educate. This is what we're doing and it is real. Too many claims are being made. They're not backed by the research. The future is bright. There's a lot of fear-mongering around food production globally. We're moving in a way that's actually very exciting for agriculture. And last slide. My wife started a retail division in the company and it's doing quite well. So I actually brought bottles of bacteria. They don't smell, they're not gross or anything like that. So here we go. For your garden, for your house plants, for your lawn. It's a division of the company that's doing quite well. In fact, before we came here, Kady had a conversation with all the Eastern Canada Site 1 locations. And we're going to be over there in parts of the US. So it's not just farmers that are looking at growing better. It's avigarden owners and lawn enthusiasts. So that's all I have. So everyone, over time, really, really appreciate it. Thank you. So we're going to start our Q&A. If you don't know the drill, please come up here and start lining up. And then introduce yourself into the microphone. Keep your pre-animal short. And then we will have our presenter, Joshua Dachief, answer your questions. So here we go. What are you looking at, water? How are we doing this? Okay, I'm good, yeah. Well, Kady knows that. Since nobody else is stepping up to the plate, I will jump in here. I spoke to Josh a little bit about it earlier, but could you maybe relate to us where our official intelligent can play into this whole thing about farming? I know my farming friends, they are on the leading edge of all kinds of... They control the pivots from the telephone. And it's amazing what farmers are doing nowadays. And if you can relate a little bit about that, that would be great. Yeah, thank you. It's actually a good question. Everyone wants to talk about AI because we're seeing what it's doing in the real world. My wife uses chatGPT all the time. It really does help. I'm like a dinosaur with that kind of stuff. And it's not my expertise, but one thing I will say, when we went down to Silicon Valley, it was a global egg summit. We learned about all kinds of things, where a lot of money is going, and there was a lot of talk about artificial intelligence. We know a lot of money is going into that right now. I had one guy up there and said, if you want to find venture capital money, just add AI at the end of your business name. Because chances are you'll find some money somewhere to help your business. But there was a big discussion around this as well in terms of what's missing for agriculture to really, really encapsulate that technology and have it benefit the growers. And it's data. I think over the years, like you think of the medical field, whatever's on Google, that's why chatGPT works so well. There's all this data flowing around online. I think for agriculture, it's going to take some time to accumulate that data, based off of what I've heard. But there's things like AI, biologicals, robotics. Every farmer I talk to and meet all of our clients, they have a hard time finding good hard workers. Will we be driving our combines in five, ten years? That's where things are moving. There's technologies out there, solar powered combines. It's a really exciting time. Obviously, I'm not a farmer, been around AI for the last eight years, but there's been a shift even within that eight years. I presented to the sustainable agriculture kids at the UofL. And I said, you're in an exciting time to be in this world of agriculture. Because there is a shift and it is exciting. Sorry I can't answer more about AI, but not my expertise either. My question is on the marginal land and the reclamation of marginal land. When you drive across the prairies, there's a ton of it out there. When the application, as you showed, brings up improvement in marginal land, does that continue each year until it reaches a point where it's no longer a marginal land? That's a really good question and we get that from our farmers too. Do I have to keep applying this? If I'm like ten years into this, what's going to happen? Or am I going to overuse my phosphorus? I don't think we have all those answers yet. I think we've been doing agriculture one way for so long. We're clear on what a lot of these issues are. Biologicals are helping deal with a lot of these issues, but it's still so new. A lot of the research that I shared is very exciting, but we're just scratching the surface. I had no idea about the storability of potatoes. Even his alkali patch, I didn't know. But then as I researched it, and there are research papers out there, the issue with alkali patches with that particular potato grower that I shared is that there's bound up phosphorus. Plants can't grow if there's no available phosphorus. There's probably more fertilizer in that alkali patch than anywhere else on this farm because he's been fertilizing his farm for so long but can't grow anything. So I guess to your question, I don't think we know all the answers. Right now the way it's trending is we're seeing it get better and better and better every year. And terms like soil health, I mean it gets tossed around everywhere, all over the place. What does that mean? Is it a more diverse biological population? Is it more organic matter? I think trying to find some of those terms, I think it's going to take some time. But so far what we've seen, yeah, every year, and whether it's the soil or the input program where we cut out one thing and then we're like, well actually we can cut out your inoculant as well. We're still learning and I think it will take a number of years, maybe even a decade, to really understand these things fully. Hi, I'm Amber Murray. I have two questions if that's okay. The first is when you talk about the phantom ice, he said in cell wall, have you tested with other fungus? Because what we've known is, what we found is that broad spectrum fungus sites are actually troubling because there are good funguses out there. That was my first question. My second question is, is there any federal funding available for farmers to convert part of their farm? For you, yeah, okay. Great question. Yes, so to your first one, I mean it started with bananas, which is brusarium, and then went to in phantom icies. That seemed to work. And now to the canola, spheterotinium canola. We're actually looking at doing a research with Alberta Innovates on Clubroot coming up. So again, we've seen some really good things. We saw it work on light on potatoes. We don't know, right? And it's exciting. We're going to do the research. Everything points to it working on any harmful fungal infection. And you're right. If you think about fungicide, chemical fungicides, it's really counterproductive applying it because I can tell you right now we've tried compatibility and stuff like that. The second our bacteria are mixed with fungicide, they're dead. Completely dead. So what is that doing to the soil when we spray this stuff on to deal with the issue that's there? What's the ripple effect of that? And so, yeah, I think when we talk about sustainability, using something that's going to improve soil conditions over time while dealing with the issue rather than just dealing with the issue and then not wearing all the side effects. But farmers have had to do what they've had to do, right? Farmers sometimes get painted with a brush of the bad guys. From city, people who live in the city and things like that, they're poisoning us our food. They're doing what they have to do to make a living. And if you ask every farmer if they can produce food better, they would. They've been doing what they can with what they've had availability for. And then your second question, funding. I actually just sent the team, who's that with? K.A. R. Dar. There's now, is it $20,000 grant that if you're trying different things on your farm, to improve sustainability, go give your grant to, you know, save on this product or to maybe pay for the product. And back to my once library, I said there's a lot of legislative support going in this direction we're seeing more and more and more funding going this way. Alberta Innovates, we've applied for an application to pay for a technical salesperson this year. We've also applied through, it's also Alberta Innovates to improve our equipment, you know. And it's like, it's half a million dollars for us to build our business and to continue pushing the envelope of research. So we're starting to see a lot of that. And I would say here in Southern Alberta, Western Canada, we're very lucky to have that. Our partners down in the US, they can't believe that all these grants are out there for us to grow our business. So I think we'll see more and more of that. And again, our business does not exist today without grant money, without funding. So yeah, it's really good to see that move to that direction. Hello, I am Katie Aurora. I have a question, and I apologize if maybe you covered this in the first few minutes of your presentation. I was a little bit late, but I am wondering how these biologics fit in with other sustainable agriculture practices such as no-till farming or, you did touch on it a little bit. You used drones or more like very hyper-targeted applications of various chemical pesticides, biologics. How does this all fit together? It's a really good point. When I walk through a trade show nowadays, I see a lot of products out there that would be your so-called silver bullet. Don't we all want to take that one thing that makes us lose weight? People like that. Farmers want that. They want that one thing that's going to solve all their issues. What we have found is that biologics have some capabilities. They're a piece of the puzzle. And I think they're a very focal piece of the puzzle. But if we can start building other pieces around it, they're going to be more effective. That data I shared from that farm in Saskatchewan, you'll see the numbers there are actually better when we're using a stimulant, like a humic acid with our bacteria. We don't sell a humic acid, but something that makes our bugs even more active. There's all these pieces that go around and build that puzzle that I think we're going to start to see what those pieces are over time here. But we definitely don't sell this stuff as a silver bullet, that it's going to solve all your issues, make all these claims. We're selling it based off of what we know. And we're starting to do research about those other pieces of the puzzle, like stimulants and things like that. Compatibility, no-till. Yeah, it's a good question. And I think you have to look at everything. Hi, I'm Pat Greenlee. I'm a gardener and I have compost pile. We don't use any pesticides or fertilizer in our yard. Could you put this stuff in the compost and have it affect? Yeah, that's a great question. Really good question. So we have a lot of, there's actually a distributor that works in other parts of the world that just focuses on compost. Do you remember back to my first couple of slides where we talked about organic breakdowns, sludge breakdowns in wastewater? We have a product, and it's not really our focal point of our business necessarily, but it's a product that will break organics down faster. So the idea is with your compost pile that we can break down those organics a little bit quicker. We do it in wastewater environments, lakes, ponds, things like that to break down the sludge. And the fact that you're doing that, every gardener should be doing that. There's a lot of good things, good bacterial and fungal interactions in compost and inorganic based products. And then adding the right bacteria in there, it's only going to help things. Jim Moyer, I used to work at the research station and when I started I was looking for a site to do an experiment that had all phosphorus. It was a weed management experiment. And I was told you can hardly find a farm in Alberta because people replied someone's phosphorus. And finally I centered on that farm was Keith Dagenhart's at that time, and now they'll have us. And you can't really find any available phosphorus and soil tests on that farm. We put on up to 300 kilograms per hectare treatment of phosphorus and soil tests still couldn't find it on that farm. So I'm wondering, I can see why you get a response with your biological on that farm. But what about all these other farms that I couldn't find any farm that had low soil test phosphorus? Does it work other places or does it have to be that high calcareous soil? So in the early days we didn't really know. We saw responses on Dr. Bilt's field, no wonder why. And then just as it spread as more farmers talked, I couldn't even get my states or provinces right. Like we're now, we have farms in Ontario and a lot of high value crops, strawberries, tomatoes, any organic wine that you drink. Chances are they use our product in the Okanagan. We're finding that because of the diversity of our product, it's working across a wealth of different soil environments. And back to your point about phosphorus, I mean we get it all the time where, you know, an old soil sample that you look at, it just tells you your total phosphorus. And these farmers are going, I don't understand, like I have all this phosphorus in the soil. But we're seeing this soil sampling technology and science evolve, and we're doing tissue sampling and real time data of what's in the plant. We know there's no available phosphorus in there. So if we can move the needle a little bit, that's going to make a huge difference. But yeah, we had looked at it like the worst the soil, the bigger difference we're going to make. Because there's so many things missing. But yeah, we're working across the board and now we're focusing on seed treatment. So it won't even necessarily matter as much all the different interactions in the soil and how a guy applies it. If we can put it on the seed and give that seed the best chance at success, no matter what soil it's in, that would be interesting. So we have a lot of field trials going out there this year for that. Carl Sturigal, one question. Thank you very much for your enlightening presentation. We always say without water there's no life. But you can apply the same statement without bacteria there's no life. So that's what you are into. But now they control as you all know how you establish how good it is and how bad it is. And this is time consuming and very expensive. And my question is are the provincial and cultural organizations and the federal ones involved in this type of work? Great question. Some are, I think we're starting to see more and more investment in that. Your question being more around what species and maybe you can rephrase that I guess for me. It's the same with bacteria there's no life. We actually need water as well. So a lot of times if there's no subsoil moisture the bacteria aren't going to move where they need to go. So that's why we're focused on the seed treatment delivering it where it needs to go. It is time consuming even for farmers. For me to talk to farmers say hey you need to make an extra pass through your field not mixed with anything. That could be 12 bucks an acre for him to do that. If we're saying you put it on your seed there's not an extra pass it's very little product. So I think there's a lot to learn there. But yeah in terms of different species of bacteria and things like that we're just learning. We kind of have a focus on around 9 to 10 different species that we're really focused on. You're right the research is very expensive as well. Very expensive. So are the provincial people involved? Are the federal people involved? A little bit. I mentioned some of the grant money that we're getting. There is more and more going to research. There's also something called SRED which has been literally kept our business afloat for many years where you can get up to 80% of your research dollars back when you acquire your taxes. Whether it's discussions around research, different projects, time that you spent, manpower. That's a federal thing. I'm not kidding in the early days we banked on that like 8,000, $10,000 check coming back to us during those times. So that's still in place and something that we do every single tax season. I welcome more and more of that. We actually just closed our first round of funding through a VC group. Very little part of the business they're taking but we're excited about this partnership because we always needed to sales in order to spend the money on research. And like I said I would love $100 million to put in research. I don't know what I could do with all of that but we could advance this so much quicker. So the money that we've raised there, the majority of it's going into research just to push us a little bit further so that we can know more about these products. I guess politically there's a lot of uncertainty. There's a lot of different things going on. We don't know what that's going to look like in 5 to 10 years but it seems like things, no matter what party is going to be in power, we're seeing things move this direction. And I always look at Europe. What Europe does in agriculture starts to trickle into the US and then Canada. And so we look at that. The EU has a lot with regulations on biologicals, things like that. Up here it's kind of the Wild West. The domestic substance list for what species you can bring into Canada is very stringent and very tight. So you're seeing a lot of our competitors in the US not be able to come into Canada. Especially around genetically modified bacteria. But when you're in Canada and you're producing it in Canada it's the Wild West. There's not a lot of regulations around it. We have a label with CFIA, Canadian Food Inspection Agency. A lot of these quote unquote competitors that we're dealing with don't even have a label or a guaranteed analysis. They're just selling products based off of some claims and that's a bit of an issue. So I'm hoping that federally, provincially there's more that goes into this from a research perspective but also from a regulations perspective. Thanks very much. My name's Ian Hurl. I have a past history where I used to beg elephant brand fertilizers a summer job. So it always came with three digits for your amount of phosphorus, etc. What I'm interested in, can you see where we still use fertilizer but those numbers change because of your product? Yeah, totally. I mean, I would, you know, looking at the Montana guys, they cut out multiple things completely. And we thought guys up here do that where they just go, I'm using nothing. I'm tired of paying when I'm paying for a fertilizer, I'm going to use nothing. And that not feel does not look very good. It might profit them a little bit more but it doesn't look very good and is that sustainable? I think, again, back to my point around balance, I think we're going to see like, you know, in every farm's different, every product's different. There's different fertility products, different phosphorus products. Where is that balance? I just think we've been so reliant on chemical, conventional products to grow crops. Where biological is going to fit where it's like, you know, we can come down 20%, 30%. There was this big controversy a number of years ago about reducing nitrogen emissions by 30%, right, for farmers. And I used to go on Twitter and because that's farmers used to like their Twitter, I don't know if they do anymore, but there was an uproar about it. Government can't tell me how much fertilizer to put on, you know, my emissions and all this. But reality is, and their big claim, their big thing was that we're not going to be able to produce enough. But we're doing that. You know, we're doing it with the potato growers. A lot of our guys, they're already reducing that. And it's not out of what the government wants, it's just at the end of the day what's putting more money in their pockets. What's more profitable and sustainable. And so, yeah, I think I'll never come up here and bash conventional chemical products. We need them. You know, there's been a lot of science and a lot of research around these products, but we need a balance. We also need to focus on what biologicals can do to offset some of the reliance that we've had on these products over generations. Thank you. Thank you everyone. Could you please send some support and sit here. Thank you. Thank you so much for your presentation. Where can I find you? I'll just be hanging out around here for a bit. Make sure you grab a sample. We have a few more books in the back. I wasn't sure how many people would be here, but it comes in a quart bottle like this. And yeah, make sure you grab one. Did you have a garden or indoor plants or anything like that? I just want to let everyone know before our next topic for next week is how do neighborhood connections support a stronger, more resilient city by Jerry Firth. Thank you again. And just before everyone leaves, I just really wanted to say something. I had the pleasure of attending the YWC Women of Distinction Awards over the weekend. And I just, I really want Dr. Bev Mungle-Atherzone to stand up. She was a lifetime achievement recipient. I just want to thank you for everything you do for sacrifice for the community and for your dedication to change this process. Thank you again, Joshua. I really appreciate everything you shared with us today and the work you do.",
