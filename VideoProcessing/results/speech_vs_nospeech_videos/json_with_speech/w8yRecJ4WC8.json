  "text": "Alright, several people have asked me is it actually cheaper to raise your own eggs, have your own chickens and that sort of thing. So this is 10 years of running cost and let me kind of explain what you're seeing on your screen. Total fixed cost to date, fixed cost is things like the cost of the chicken coop, the cost of feeders and waterers, the cost of the automatic door and that sort of thing. So it's like hardware cost, things that aren't feed or water. Consumables cost is the cost of feed and water over a 10 year period. So we go back to the fixed cost, the housing cost for my chickens over 10 years have cost me $3229.27. Then the chickens I have raised have $1,531.81 in chicken feed. Now I kind of do it a little different today, but when I first got chickens I bought the chickens. Those chickens cost me $211.03. That was meat chickens and egg laying hens. Now today the way I do it is I hatch chickens from eggs and it doesn't cost me anything. So that initial cost was maybe the first two or three years I was raising chickens when I was buying the chickens from a store. So the grand total of those three categories comes to $4,550.05. Now the total eggs my chickens have laid in 10 years is 4,789 eggs. But some of those got broken when they were laid or got cracked. And the number that was undamaged was 4,777. So if we go down and we figure up the cost per one egg, if you add in the cost of the chicken coop and all the hardware and consumables, it's $0.95 per egg, which would come out to $11.43 per dozen. But if you take out the fixed costs and only look at the food, it comes at $0.32 per egg or $3.85 per dozen. So you can see that both of those numbers, most of the time, is not cheaper than buying them from the store. But where you benefit from raising your own chickens is you know how they were raised, you know what they ate, and you know how they were cared for. And that price is consistent over 10 years. It doesn't really go up or down. The feed price can go up slightly like during COVID. The cost of feed went up several dollars per bag, but then it dropped back down to like normal levels again. And you do have some fluctuations, but this is the cost over 10 years. And as you can see, it's almost always cheaper to buy eggs from a store. Anyways, hope you liked this information. As always, God bless you. God bless your families. God bless your homesteads. Don't forget to hit the like and subscribe button.",
