  "text": "Small scale agriculture has been practiced ever since the Neolithic Revolution. More recently it is an alternative to factory farming or more broadly, intensive agriculture or unsustainable farming methods that are prevalent in primarily first world countries. Environmental health perspectives has noted that sustainable agriculture is not merely a package of prescribed methods. More important, it is a change in mindset whereby agriculture acknowledges its dependence on a finite natural resource base including the finite quality of fossil fuel energy that is now a critical component of conventional farming systems. Small scale agriculture includes a number of sustainable agriculture practices such as 1. Organic farming, which may follow rules and regulations set by International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements of Foam. 2. Permaculture, which provides a holistic methodology for farm design. 3. A arable land use, arable land from Latin Arari, to plow, is a form of agricultural land use, meaning land that can be and is used for growing crops. David Ricardo incorporated the idea of arable land into economic theory. 4. Non-arable land use. 5. Pastoral, pastoral refers to the lifestyle of shepherds and pastoralists, moving livestock around larger areas of land according to seasons and availability of water and feed. 6. Rain-fed agriculture. 7. Biodynamic agriculture was developed by Rudolf Steiner, which consists of using herbal and homeopathic preparations for the caldum manure that is used extensively on the crops for fertilizer. The methods of food sustainability and economics are hotly debated. This is a question between agricultural economics and the draining of the largely unaccounted natural capital. Some dietary methods may contribute to the sustainability such as macrobiotic, vegan, vegetarianism or restricting animal products to those produced using the above methods. There are many economic advantages in farming on a small scale land. Local farmers generate a local economy in their rural communities. An American study showed that small farms with incomes of $100,000 or less spend almost 95% of their farmer-related expenses within their local communities. The same study took in comparison the fact that farms with incomes greater than $900,000 spend less than 20% of their farm-related expenses in the local economy. Thus, small-scale agriculture supports local economy. Despite the claims of industrial farmer lobbies, large-scale farming is often less efficient than small sustainable farms. In fact, industrial single-crop culture aims for a high output per worker. On the other side, small-scale farmers produce more food per acre of land. The small-scale agriculture business model is generally oriented to sell products directly to the consumers. Decentre mediation gives the farmer the profit that would otherwise go to the wholesaler, the distributor and the supermarket. About two-thirds of the selling price would actually be lost for product marketing. Meanwhile, if farmers sell their products directly to consumers, they recover the totality of their product value.",
