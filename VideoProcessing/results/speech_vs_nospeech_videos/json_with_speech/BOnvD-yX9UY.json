  "text": "You know, when I think about gardening, I think about the reasons people garden. And there are many. People garden for exercise, they garden because it's a hobby, but they also garden to eat. Usually we talk about gardening and landscapes in the summertime. But you know, really for all those reasons that I think people garden for, you can get the same satisfaction gardening indoors. So one of the best opportunities that we have for gardening indoors in the winter time is herbs. Those are great, they're really hearty. And then we get to actually use them in the kitchen when we cook. So I have a few personal favorites when it comes to herbs. We like to use chives, my grandmother used to keep mint around all the time. You know the great thing about herbs is we can experiment. It's one thing to use dried herbs in our recipes, but boy, fresh herbs just adds a whole another flavor. So a couple things about growing herbs indoors. We don't necessarily have to baby them, but we do have to take care of them. We probably want them situated where there's lots of light. You know, we do want them in a good soil. We don't want to overwater them, but we do need to take care of them. If you have questions about using herbs in the kitchen or growing herbs, you can contact your local extension office or you can check out our extension website. This is Hudson Hill with the University of Wyoming Extension. You're watching from the ground up.",
