  "text": "There are well over 50,000 forest landowners in Oregon, each with different objectives for their forest. For many, harvesting trees is part of their management plan. West of the Cascades, in the Willamette Valley, a common harvest operation is clear-cutting using a skyline logging system. Clear-cut essentially is the final harvest of a particular stand in a given area, removing all the wood products in that given area. It sounds very simple, but it's a very long, drawn-out process that starts maybe two years ahead of time. Clear-cutting basically is the most efficient and safest way of removing timber from a designated area. It also mimics natural conditions and creates wide open spaces where Dougfer can get plenty of sunshine, which they need to grow and flourish. A skyline system runs a series of cables designed to extract the logs out of the forest floor with a minimal disturbance to the soil by suspending them lead end of the log. You're basically picking that log up, lead end of the log up off the ground and yarding it up to the landing so you're not creating a furrow. You're dragging it up the hill with a minimal impact on the soil. A cable-based system, we basically use those where your slopes are steeper than 50%. You need a cable-based system to remove that timber safely and efficiently. So there are several benefits to skyline logging. One of them is that you're able to reach out a long ways with a skyline system. When you're able to do that, you're minimizing the amount of roading that needs to take place. How can we build a road with minimal disturbance to natural water runoff? We make sure we have clean, fresh rock. On those approaches, we make sure we have silt fences or hay bales to filter out sediment and keeping the water clean and silt free as job one on those days. Oregon Forest Law requires us to replant the site within two years, and it needs to meet green-up standards by six. By state law, we're required to leave two live trees standing and two downed trees per acre of clear-cut harvest. We're also required to protect small, medium, and large fish streams. Small stream, we're required to leave a 50-foot buffer. On a large stream, for example, we need to leave a 100-foot buffer. There are times where we go above and beyond these requirements and protect resources that we at Warehouse are want to protect. Douglas fir is a highly sought-after timber product, not only for its strength, but its manufacturing capabilities. Douglas fir loves the sun. They are a shade-intolerant tree species, and they thrive in open canopy conditions. Clear-cuts allow for Douglas fir's seedlings to take full advantage of this. They love the sun, and they need it to grow and flourish. Clear-cutting is just one harvest method used in Oregon's forests.
