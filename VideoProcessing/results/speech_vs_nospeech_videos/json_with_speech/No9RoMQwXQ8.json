  "text": "Hey folks, we're going to do a little corn plant today and I want to carry you all through the process. Now keep up because I'm moving quick. So I get my BCS tiller out there and I'm going to work my spot real good one last time before I get ready. Now I'm going to carry you all the way through the process here of working the soil drip irrigation plant and turning my drip irrigation on. So what I did back during the winter times, I had a tarp on this spot right here and I left that tarp on there all winter long. So when I got ready for corn plant time, I just simply took that tarp off and I'm tilling it one time here. Now I'm going to be ready to lay off my rows and put down some drip tape. You see my BCS tiller here, I love that thing there. I got it from Joel over at Earth Tools. I've had a Grillo before too but man, I love these things. And a little pricey. The Grillo to me is just as nice as the BCS. It's got a few less bells and whistles but works fine. Now this thing is pretty heavy duty so it's going to wear you out if you used to working. I like to offset my handles or walk the side of it so I don't walk by and direct them behind it and leave those footprints. That last row you're going to leave a few. All right, now we're getting ready to lay off our rows. Now I use these little electric fence posts and string because I like to have straight rows. Now that's not necessarily something you've got to do but it's just what I like to do. I like to make my rows be nice and straight and I lay off my rows and I get all the rows exactly the same distance apart. So when I get down to the end of the row I just simply take my string and move it over, measure off, keep me a tape measure in my pocket. Now I move it over. You do this two or three different ways. You go ahead and lay off your rows at one time. Just kind of draw your little indigent into the soil there. You can do it each time. I like to keep that string just high enough so that it straddles my wheel and I keep it directly in between my wheels on my wheel hoe there. Now these plows I've got to put together and I'm laying off what we call a furrow. I'm going to lay my drip tape in that furrow for my sweet corn. I'm going to have about six rows here. Now I'm laying these off at 36 inches apart. You can do 30 inches. I've done 30 inches forward. It's fine. This particular plot worked good for 36 inches but that's what I did. So I got my furrow laid off and now I'm putting that drip tape down with that drip tape layer attachment. Just simply roll it through there and this thing here makes it easy work for me. Used to back in the day it took two people to roll this thing out from when we invented this thing here and got it perfected. This changed my life when I put the drip tape out. I can get it out by myself and do it. You kind of notice there I use these little pegs that come in your drip tape kit that I peg the tape down on the ends and that keeps it from pulling when I start off. Now also keep me some linemen scissors. I buy them Klein scissors at the Home Depot. That's what I keep in my pocket to cut my tape with. I'm laying that spike back in there holding that drip tape. Run down through there and it just don't take no time to put this drip tape out. On my drip tape from Korn I used an 8 mil tape because that's the one that works best for annuals. It's the 8 mil. Now you'd use the 15 mil if you were doing something you were going to leave it there for five years but I'm probably going to remove this after this year so the 8 mil works fine. This roll here has about 1500 feet on there and it'll last me a long time. Now with Korn I got six rows here. You always want to plant your corn in plots instead of two or three long rows. There's Maggie making her appears. And that's because corn is pollinated by the wind not by insects. So you want to make sure that you got at least four rows. I like to have at least six rows so you get good pollination. Now I'm planting sweet corn in this plot right here and we love to grow sweet corn. Sweet corn is something we really enjoy. We put a lot of it up in the freezer and it provides us a good food source all winter long. It's a good bit of work when it comes off and it's ready to pick. It's ready to pick and we have to get to it. And we normally take a day off to get a corn put up. You'd be surprised how much corn you'll get off a little bitty plot like I'm doing right here right now. All right so I'm through laying my drip tape and now it's time to put my mainline tubing out. I'll take that same spike there and I'll lay this tubing out and I'll pin it in on the ends and let the sun hit it for just a minute. And that'll cause that tubing there to straighten out on me and it won't roll back up. Now I'm laying my fittings out, getting ready to hook up my filter regulator combo. Now I got these risers in my garden but that's just simply a water hose fitting. So a water hose would fit nicely to this. If I had to do it over again that's probably what I would do. Them risers kind of get in my way sometimes. So I keep it pinned down on the ends and I start putting my filter regulator combo in and I'm attaching my mainline tubing to that drip layer combo. Get it all ready. Now what I'm doing is putting my rose starts in. Now here's a little secret. Use those scissors there on these rose starts and get you a good straight cut. A good straight cut is important to keep those things from leaking excessively. Kind of have to wiggle them a little bit. I like to keep the dirt out of them, keep them as clean as possible. And after you do this a few times you'll kind of get the hang of it. Take my hole punch, twist it, get my hole in there for my bar fitting. There we go. And then kind of wiggle it on there. You may have to go back and readjust these a little bit if you got an excessive leak. It's one of those kind of things you can use another hand sometimes. But once you get everything laid out it kind of goes pretty quick. Yep, so here's the ends. Now what I will do here is I will turn my water on and flush these ends out because I've probably got some dirt in there and I want to flush this out. So I will turn my irrigation system on and I will put my bigger eights on right here and what that does is double this main line over so it won't leak. The first thing I do is flush it out. So I flush those ends out, I put my figure eights on there. After I flush the main line then I go to the end and then I start trimming my ends off and I'm getting ready to put my end closures on my drip tape. A lot of flushed out good to get all that dirt out of there. Here's the end closures. Kind of fold them over a couple of times, pull them and they work good. Now we're getting ready to plant a corn with a house garden seeder. I'm planting a variety this year that was sent to us for us to try and see if we'd like it. We could offer it to y'all next year. It's a SH2 variety, SH2 type I might say. So I got my rows laid out straight and that's one thing I like to use my strength because it gets those rows straight. We do a good bit of videos so I like what looks nice and pretty. And there we are planting that seed corn. Short work of it. Now after I got it planted you can see the drip tape has got 12 inches of meters there. And it's getting ready to kind of run up and I'll let that kind of work together and get that corn up and growing.
