  "text": "The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, Natural Resources and Cooperatives 2020-2021 Media Review provides an opportunity for updates and feedback on work accomplished to date, as well as constructive criticism in areas where performance may be inadequate. Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries, Physical Planning, Natural Resources and Cooperatives Honourable Ezekiel Joseph during his address says the government continues their commitment to assist farmers who have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Honourable Minister Joseph informs that the government of St. Lucia recently approved the guarantee to receive the $7.2 million from the government of the Republic of China, Taiwan. We have started in some small way meeting the commitments that we made as a potential support to COVID-19. I want to say it again because I'm sure I've been chastised as to the one point, the $1,500, three months, $500 each. I said that I believe it's more in the interest of the Department to see how we can support our farmers with inputs. The Agriculture Minister also underscores the importance of providing adequate information to the public in a timely fashion. What can we do as a ministry to increase the frequency of information that we are given to our officers, be it fisheries, livestock, exchange, agriculture, forestry, WRMA, whatever it is we need to share information. Because you might have, and I mean I put my extension cap now, I might go down to a farmer and he might want to know something about WRMA. So our information should not only be on bananas or on the seven crops, we should have wronged officers as far as information is concerned. The Minister for Agriculture expresses gratitude to the team leaders and staff of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries, Natural Resources and Cooperatives for their continued efforts in ensuring the success of the agriculture sector. From the communication unit of the Department of Agriculture, I am Anicia Antoine reporting.",
