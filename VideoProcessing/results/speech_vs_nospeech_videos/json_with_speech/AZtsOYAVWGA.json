  "text": "How we bail 20 to 30 percent moisture hay without burning our barn down. First I use my 100 gallon Endura Plast diesel fuel tank and I top off the fuel tank on my tractor. Then I start cutting 13 feet each path even though it does rain the next day. Sometimes it's got to take a chance otherwise you'll never get done. The weathermen were right. Then we take our tether and we blast the hay all over. It spreads it out really nice and it allows the maximum drying. Next I take our rotary rake and rake all the rows single. Try to help it dry better. This step is very important. This is what keeps the hay from spoiling. We take our powder, our dry hay inoculate and mix it with water. Spray it on the hay while we bail. We then wait till about four o'clock in the afternoon to get it as dry as possible. And then we go. We have to bail it today because it's day in rain tomorrow. As soon as my dad gets some bales bail I start moving them and get them off the field. The final step to prevent these bales from combusting at higher moisture is to keep the bales spread out with air gaps in between.",
