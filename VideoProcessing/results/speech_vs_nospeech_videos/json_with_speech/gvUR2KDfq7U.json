  "text": "I'm Tom Harlow, Castrol Farm, Westminster, Vermont. We have 50 acres of vegetables here, and we're doing about 15 to 20 acres of sweet corn. Our primary market for the sweet corn is local retail at a roadside stand that we have. As far as crop rotation goes, we usually start with corn or squash in a field, then we move on to greens and then to a root crop in the third year. Being an organic farm, we generally use a lot of compost, about 20 yards per acre, on everything except root crops, and then we use winter rye and vetch as a cover crop on everything every year. Our primary cover crop here is rye, which we use at 100 pounds per acre. I try to substitute 10 to 20 pounds of that rye seed with vetch seed to make a total of 100 pounds per acre cover crop seed. Cover crops are generally tilled in fairly early for some early vegetables, but for corn and squash we like to wait until mid-May to let the rye and the vetch mature as much as possible. After using a moldboard plow, we generally apply about 20 yards per acre compost, and then we just care two or three times and then we're ready to plant. We do soil tests here every year on every field, and we amend our soils with compost, and we use some blended fertilizer through the planters. Being an organic farmer, we rely heavily on our cover crops and our compost to provide us with the nutrients that we need so we don't have to make huge purchases of blended fertilizers. We make our own compost here on the farm. We have manure here that's trucked in, raw manure, trucked in from a local dairy farm. Best stuff we get is mixed with a lot of straw, dumped in a windrow. We turn it every two or three weeks with a bucket loader. It gives us excellent compost the way it is.",
