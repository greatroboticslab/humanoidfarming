  "text": "organization of the CIA to give us the chance to come here, especially when it's a project that will happen in Spain and has no language that I work here. The work we're going to present us is between Rafael and me. Rafael had a problem two years ago. We need to survey huge amounts of very big areas in a quick and unabasive and cheap way. So first he will tell you about the problem he had after I would tell you the solution I think I gave him. And finally he will give the feedback of the happy customer. So Rafael, I will leave you with the file. Approaching the problem, located in the root of the Roman road in Alhazard, which corresponded to 34 nations in Antonia in 1880, has been a historical and archaeological monument for the past 200 years. Since the first conjunt to the end of the 18th century, there have been numerous suggestions for discourse. These propositions have been for two main problems. Firstly, the file identified the mission to eat the Antonin atonine itinerary. Secondly, the lack of a comprehensive study method for his search and identification. The first problem was solved at the beginning of the 21st century. The location of these mansions have no been pointed with archaeological data and that goes beyond mere hypothesis. The first was to realize about the lately corridors through which the I-354 called half-land. Or gold was to tackle the second problem with the study we carried out in 2017. The multifaceted study includes historical and archaeological source, both ancient and modern. 18th and 19th century maps and plans with the script of the road where the I-354 was discovered. We conducted an exhaustive topony study of what current ancient and ancient names mentioned in the medieval royal courtesies, especially those dating from the 9th to the 12th century. The 18th set some vertical aerial photographs dating from 1932 to the present, as well as the more recent low-level photographs. Where possible, we analyzed the area we laid out. And we carried out fieldworking and open-ed archaeological test bits. A possible solution. Precision agriculture and NDVI. In addition, we experimented with an over-methodology for the detection of archaeological remains taken from the techniques of precision agriculture. The I-354 measures 65 kilometers. So given the size of the project, it was necessary to use assistant data log coverage on the full length of the road to eliminate the quickly. These also have to be non-invasive and style-provider reliable results in the detection of a warrior linear structure. A reliable economic results allowed for 10 areas to be surveyed using drones equipped with infrared cameras that will allow the application of NDVI. These thin zones covered significant parts of the road where the presence of the I-354 was determined to be either secure, probable or unobtrusive. The inclusion of the securely identified roads was necessary in order to confirm that the results of the work were reliable. There were, should have been, contours and routes. This occurred in two places where the roads had been identified archaeological coming. Through fieldworking and in test bits, areas four and five. In the zones where the road was considered probable, there were five cases in which the historiography's areas, the location of I-354, ran through those areas or maybe. However, there was no reliable evidence for the road in these areas. Zones one, two, three, nine and ten. With regard to the documented places, we found three areas in which the pre-scope of the road has never been defined in the historiography. Areas six, seven and eight. We therefore expected Firsuzal to determine the validity of metal to recognize various remains. And secondly, we were looking for a solution for the sections in which additional research should have not been used or were not working well. Well, some years ago I started experimenting with the cameras to capture near-infrared wavelengths and also NDVI. From the very beginning it was very obvious that the infrared part of the spectrum is much more useful for identifying archaeological boolean remains than the visible part of the spectrum. That I was thinking, well, maybe perhaps we can see crop marks more clearly than in visible light. Maybe we can even see crop marks that you will not be able to see at that time of the year or in that place. Maybe we can even perform an archaeological survey just based on those invisible crop marks. So, well, the basis of these methods is that the plants, they are performing the photosynthesis, they actively reflect huge amounts of infrared energy. This is one of the most dramatic jumps in energy about their reflection on the market. You can see on the left part the reflectance of the plants on the infrared part between the healthy and the vegetative and the nutrients of the vegetative. The difference is huge compared with the same bands in the visible spectrum. So we should be able to see at least more clearly any kind of crop marks. So we expect that in an infrared photograph, as the parts of the plant are performing photosynthesis, not the trial, but the trials, but the beliefs reflect huge amounts of energy, they are always going to look like white. The white part of the plant, the healthier it is. So this is one of the basis of the modern precision of ritual techniques. One of the index that is more widely used is the NDVI. The NDVI index takes the infrared part of the spectrum and normalizes it somehow with the visible part of the spectrum. So the most classic formula is a near-infrared less visible divided by a near-infrared plus visible. Usually you give it funny colors, white from blue to red. In one photograph here we can see that all the things that are dead are not making any kind of photosynthesis look like blue. While the plants that are alive go from yellow, green to red, the other one has a different color scheme from brown to green. In this study I have made everything in black and white because I find it easier, at least for me I can see things better in black and white than with those funny color schemes. So I will try to keep it the closest way we will see near-infrared photographs. So the black are the areas that are not giving any variation and the white are the areas that are reflecting more infrared. So the white that you see in the photographs, the healthier the plants are. For this study we have used photographs from drones. We made different experiments flying at 25, 75, 120 meters with visible cameras, infrared, long pass filters from 600, a lot of different combinations. The one that worked better for us finally was flying about 75 meters high. With what is called a pseudo NDVI, it's not a real NDVI, you're making a single photograph, you're taking one band near-infrared and in another band you take something similar to a visible but you can make the image of the photograph, which makes everything easier. So we fly at 75 meters, we gave us a spatial resolution of 3.2 centimeters per pixel after we process the photographs in ground deploy, getting some automoscience that we imported in QGIS to calculate the NDVI, take measurements and everything and after we compare those automoscience with the historic images from the server looking for what those features may be. So in theory we are expecting that cut features and we are trying to see progms, so we expect that cut features will appear lighter and walls or other things that don't let the plants grow so well will appear as dark. That is the theory but we were not sure if this would really work. In one of the first flights we made we saw this white line going in diagonal there so we assumed it should be a cut feature and luckily we found a photograph in the moment where that trench was open when they were building the gas pipes, they took the photograph just in the moment the trench is open and there is no doubt that this white line is produced by that trench. On the other hand we have a dark line here that we didn't, it's very narrow or well defined so we assumed it should be more or less recent, so we are trying to find it in historic photographs and we find the wall that they create that line. So now we can assume that really the theory works is that we are going to have whiter colors for cut features and darker for walls or pavements or so on. Then we should have seen that a Roman road should look like a darker area caused by the pavement surrounded by two narrower white lines that are produced by the roadside ditches and that's exactly what we are following in all the areas, in eight of the ten areas you can see, well I hope you can see, I don't know how clearly it's in the photograph. In the center you have a darker area that is the pavement and on the sides the roadside ditches. What happens is the roadside ditches go slowly eating the pavement and the pavement of the road goes falling into the roadside ditches so they become bigger and the pavement is smaller. But it's a very consistent road and we tested it in ten places and we found it in eight and it's always about seven, eight meters wide and the pavement about five, six, so we have reasons to think that it's the same road the one we found in all the areas. I guess you're not going to be able to see the key. First, the purple line is the conjecture path of the Roman road that is a file one minute to look at. The wider roads mark positive anomalies so areas with the clouds are doing better and the little black arrows mark negative anomalies. The first area we couldn't do anything, we went there and it was just cloud, there were no vegetation to make any kind of NDVI analysis so it was a total failure. In the second one we found traces of the Roman road coming here, disappearing in this area and after... and after appears at the end, we're seeing perfectly the roadside ditches. The top right corner at the end, you can see that it's quite well preserved after the road. The next area is a very interesting one. We have the road in the middle but we have a lot of little channels, as well as other features in the right corner. We have some buildings here. Here we can see that it's so much clearer in infrared photography than in the visual one. The one at the right is the same photograph taken in the same flight at the same moment and we can barely see anything. This is the landscape we can see from this photograph. It's amazing that you go there and using techniques to manage the landscape, nowadays, in half an hour, you have a peak into what was the landscape in Roman times. You can see the walls, the channels, the wells. Here we can see the road. Here we can see the road and also a post-medieval road crossing on some features, caused by water. That's also an interesting one. We have a lot of features appearing here. This one is especially interesting in the top. The darker area probably is the crumble of a building and we are seeing the walls of the building in negative. Really what we are seeing here is the rover trenches of the walls that have been taken out. All the features we have here, they seem to have two different alignations. One is that go very well with the Roman road in red, probably from Roman times. Another is in yellow that correspond to another moment. Here we can see the road again. In this one we can see a lot of fossilized agricultural landscape, but not from Roman times. This is just before the feeling closer. As we can see in the historic photograph below, it perfectly matches everything with the other. Luckily, there were some works in that area, and the file was going there. In a part that we consider to be the Roman road, suddenly there was a hole and you can see the Roman road, you can see the ditch and the pavement. Conclusions, I think it is clear that it is much better the infrared or the NDVI photography to show the local features than visible light. Here we can compare those areas, you can barely see anything in visible light. The number of features we have recovered in infrared is enormous compared with other techniques. Photographs, only 40, NDVI 150, compared with visible light, again nearly three times, the number of features. A big work, like the Roman road, you can see it in almost any technique, but all those little channels and walls and things prove to be so much better than NDVI techniques. We do not hesitate to rate the use of this method, as it is highly satisfactory that we achieved our mine of duties. The validity of the method has been demonstrated as far as the exploration of archaeological revises concerned. And we succeeded in vastly increasing the identification sections of the Parian road. In the zones used as control for the experiment, we knew the use of the road, the Roman is detected by the NDVI correspondingly with the observation mesh for the details. These zones correspond to the surrounding mansions, and quivitates of the Leia and its Stati. Out of the five survey zones, considered as probable localitions, other are four obtained results compatible with the course of the ITER-54. And one obtained a negative result. In the undocumented sites, positive results were recorded in two of the three zones, and negative results in one of them. The two negative results obtained are due to two different reasons. In the first case, the absence of crowd did not provide NDVI information, so the result was as expected. As for the second, this was simply because there were no archaeological remains. From the methodological point of view, it is a sursets because no remains were recorded in a place where it is very unlikely that they will be. In this way, we have additionally tested the experiment against first positives. Regarding the positive results, it is clear that the results were better than expected. If our aim was to determine whether it is possible to identify the course of a Roman road with these methods and improve our knowledge about it, then we have achieved far more than our initial goals. In two cases, in addition to the course of the road, anomalies were observed in the crops that are compatible with built structures. Today, these have not been observed with other techniques. In some three, winding remains were seen which can be identified as a structure associated with the suburbal area of the Masio Anquita subbelly. In the case of the Zone 6, the possible structural remains found will fit with the structure associated with the deceptive medieval settlement of Garona, documented in 1025 AD and which disappeared during the 13th century. Final conclusions. We believe we have shown that the gambling of this method has solved a very complex problem in the heritage of our world. Furthermore, we can see that these tools offer very high potential for both extensive archaeological research that time significantly results in a fast, efficient, and unimpossible phase.",
