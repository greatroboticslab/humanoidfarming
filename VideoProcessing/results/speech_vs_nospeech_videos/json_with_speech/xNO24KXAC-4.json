  "text": "Namaste and welcome to the video course on water shed management. Today in module 2 on sustainable water shed approach and water shed management practices, lecture number 5 we will discuss about the agriculture practices and water shed management. So, the topics covered in today's lecture includes water shed ecology and the agro ecosystems, soil and water conservation management practices, sustainable land management practices, crop management, nutrients and pest management, integrated farming and finally, a case study. Some of the important keywords in today's lecture include agro ecosystems, agriculture management, nutrient and pest management and integrated farming. So, as we discussed in earlier lectures like sustainable water management or sustainable land management or the sustainability issues are all very important in water shed management. So, in any of the water shed which we consider one of the important land uses the agriculture. So, we have to see what are the important issues as far as the agricultural management is concerned, what are the important issues in sustainable agriculture management. So, as far as water shed in many parts of the world are concerned, water sheds are experiencing pressure from high population growth, climate, land use change and over exploitations of natural resources. So, you can see the effect of population growth and then the land use change all these are directly influencing the agricultural practices within the water shed. So, as we discussed earlier to stop the degradation of natural resources and to understand the sustainable agriculture management practices, we need to deal with upstream and downstream resources management challenges. So, what are the major challenges within the water shed as far as various resources are concerned, how we deal with the management of those resources. Then the sustained agriculture management is concerned, we have to deal with the to identify sustainable land use practices to increase sustainable agriculture production and to increase opportunity of rural livelihood. So, we can see that in most of the areas rural people are mainly based upon the agricultural or the farm outputs. So, we have to improve this farm output in a sustainable way. So, for that on a water shed basis we have to see that the agriculture is sustaining and then the land use is sustainable and water use is sustainable. So, within that we have to see that how we can have better agricultural or agriculture water management or agricultural practices. So, let us see some of the issues as far as water management in agriculture is concerned. So, this deals with the interactions and interplay between food people and nature sectors. So, we have already seen earlier when we discussed about the sustainability issues. So, the important sectors are food people and nature. So, out of this the food sector produces a biomass and influence ecosystem most of the time positively and sometimes negatively. So, we can see that as far as agriculture is concerned the water is concerned major use is consumptive. So, this is can be directly through irrigation or otherwise. So, as far as irrigation is concerned there can be major or micro irrigation and many times farmers use excessive irrigation and say this irrigated water are largely recycled. Then some of the other issues like use of fertilizers and pesticides and then corresponding problems like non-point source of pollution in the water either surface or groundwater. So, like this we can see that agricultural water use is concerned a large number of issues are there which we have to deal as far as the particular watershed is concerned or watershed management is concerned. So, you can see that when we consider the three sectors like food people and nature. So, the requirement of water for the people is relatively small. So, you can see that say for example, if you can see 1 centimeter per hectare per day for as far as irrigation water is concerned that much water is sufficient for 1000 people domestic or other usages. So, if you consider say the well average as far as agricultural, municipal and industrial water usage is concerned the ratio is 70 to 15 to 15 percent. But say for example, in developing country like India this usage is 85 percent for agricultural only 8 percent for municipal use and 7 percent for industrial sector. So, that way you can see that say for example, in a country like India major portion of the water is used for agricultural purposes. So, if you can save the water available water say by doing appropriate agriculture managing practices effective water use in agriculture then we can save lot of water. But you can see that in most of the time whenever we consider the farming sector for a sustainable agriculture we need irrigation. Since as we discussed earlier the rainfall is say distributed only for say 4 or 5 months. So, time wise variation is there then spatial wise variation is there. So, that way we need irrigation for sustainable agriculture. So, that way if you consider say for example, the global withdrawal of water for agriculture industry and municipal use and then it is total use in liters say for example, the data from 1900 to 1995 for about 95 years you can see that this curve shows the total withdrawal and then you can see that this just below this curve shows the agricultural withdrawal and the municipal usage is much smaller. This white line shows the municipal usage and then this grey line shows the industry usage. But especially in agriculture lot of water is lost in different ways. So, that way with respect to the total withdrawal you can see that the effective water the total water usage is much less compared to the total withdrawal. So, that way if you can save the water which we are using for agriculture by appropriate management practices, optimal irrigation management practices we can save lot of water and that can be utilized for many other purposes and then also we can use say for example, for further irrigation and other purposes. So, if you consider a well average the well average for irrigation is concerned, irrigated area covers about 40 percent of arable lands in the well and rainford is the rest that means about 60 percent of the arable land in the well is say the water is obtained through rain and only 40 percent is obtained through irrigation. Say for example, now if you consider India's agricultural scenario and irrigation is concerned. So, India has about 2 percent of well's lands, 4 percent of fresh water, 16 percent of population and 10 percent of its cattle. So, this is the major issue as far as a developing country like India is concerned we have got only 2 percent of well lands, but we have 16 percent of population and then 10 percent of cattle and only hardly 4 percent of fresh water. And geographic areas concerned say India's 329 million hectares of area of which only 47 percent is cultivated, 23 percent is forested and 7 percent under non-agriculture usage and about 23 percent of the land is wasteland. And if you consider with respect to the population the land availability is concerned per capita availability of lands 50 years ago that means in about 1950s it was about 0.9 hectare, but now due to the population explosion this will be reduced to about 0.14 hectare by 2050. So, that way the land availability compared to any other country it is much much smaller. So, that way India say major problem as far as the sustainable practices as far as lands, water and agriculture is concerned. So, whatever available we have to do it in a better way. And out of the cultivated area in India about 47 40 percent is irrigated which produces about 55 percent of the food requirement of the country and 60 percent is rain food producing about 47 45 percent of about 250 metric ton of food required presently. So, you can see that 40 percent of the irrigated area produces 55 percent of the food and 60 percent of rain food only produces 45 percent of the 250 metric ton of food produced. So, in 40 years say for example by 2050 say government of India wants to increase the irrigation level such that we can have more food production. So, the irrigation we want to increase up to at least up to 50 percent. So, that 50 percent is irrigated area and 50 percent is of the arable land is the rain food area. So, that ratio of food production 75 percent can be produced from irrigated lands and 25 percent from the rain food land out of the 500 metric ton of food required by 2050. So, this is the Indian scenario as far as the agriculture and irrigation requirements is concerned. So, now let us see what are some the the agriculture related issues as far as especially India is concerned. So, India after the independence in 1947 there is a large increase in agriculture growth rate. Say for example, in the 1950s if it was about 0.3 percent, 60s and 70s or 80s it has increased to 3.5 percent. So, this has mainly happened due to a large number of irrigation or reservoir projects implemented in the earlier 5 year plants. So, that way the irrigation capacity has increased and that way the agriculture growth has increased. So, then another important issue is say in the first few 5 year plants say in 70s and 80s government of India put a lot of efforts to improve the agriculture sector through introduction of new high yielding varieties that is say we can call it as first green revolution in 70s and then in second green revolution say in 80s government of India through its agriculture and other ministries concentrate on the genetic engineering through organized input management and say farmer services and extension and then also better seed varieties were implemented in the agriculture sector. So, that way we can call this say 1980s as second green revolution. So, that way lot of improvement were taken place in the agriculture sector. But of course, lot of issues are still there in the agriculture sector. So, some of the negative trends in spite of the positive trends as we discussed here the negative trends are say per hectare yield is low. So, compared to other countries like US and China the per hectare yield is much low. Then infrastructure facilities in the farming sector is sector are consents are poor. Then say the total management aspect is neglected in most of the farming sector and then also you can see that still in rural area the farming is not mechanized. So, people are using different types of traditional equipments for farming and then say most of the time the rural farmers are not adopting scientific farming. So, that way say lot of issues are there as far as the agriculture in India is consents. So, some of the important constraint as far as agriculture sustainable agriculture India are consents are listed here. So, these are decline in per capita land availability. So, as we already discussed that per capita land availability is decreasing due to population explosion. Then stress in water resources so available water is not sufficient for irrigation due to lack of say better agriculture management practices, water management practices or lack of availability of sufficient water. Then degradation of soils the lack of efficient water management monocropping in many areas farmers are continuing with the same crop. So, that way there are lot of problems as far as nutrient management and then other soil related issues are consents. Then lack of crop management negligence of sustainable agriculture. So, say as far as especially most of the farmers are consents they are not bothered about the sustainability issues as far as agriculture is consents. And then of course, people are for the that means the farmers are in difference to various the scientific farming or mechanization and other issues due to of course, various other constraints due to lack of available sources or due to lack of education and other issues. So, that way these are some of the important issues especially in a country like India as far as sustainable agricultural management practices are consents. So, now let us see the water the agriculture management practices within the perspective of watershed. So, the we have already seen that agriculture practices are very important in in any of the watershed management plans. So, the agricultural practices following within a watershed the the the whatever watershed plans or management issues we are making. So, that will definitely affect. So, that way let us discuss about the watershed eco hydrology and agro ecosystems. So, this agro ecosystems we can define as a subset of ecosystems that defines functional representation of coherent agricultural activity including interaction of living and non-living components involved within the watershed. So, we are considering a subset of the ecosystems as agro ecosystems. Then we can do various sonation according to the the ecology according to agriculture practices and the climate systems. So, that way we can call this sones as agro ecological sones which are defined as land units carved out of agro climatic sones based on major climates superimbursed on length of growing period. So, a particular clop is consents a particular say climate season is consents. So, accordingly we can say define this agro ecological sones. So, this mainly depends on the moisture availability. Say for example, India is consents we can classify India into 20 agro ecological regions and 60 agro eco sub regions. So, as we defined here agro ecological sones indicate the various issues as far as the agriculture is concerned with respect to land with respect to climate and other issues. So, each agro eco sub region has further been classified into eco unit at district level for developing long term land use strategies. So, when we have discussed about the sustainable agriculture practices this agro ecosystem or agro ecological sones are very important since we can implement or we can sort out many issues by considering this agro ecological sones or agro ecological sub regions as we discussed. So, here in this slide you can see the agro ecological regions of India. So, this various colours indicate various sones. So, these sones are delineated based on physiography, soil, length of growing season and bio climates of the region. Say for example, we can say the agriculture ministry has put various nomenclature also. So, for example, AER sones means say a sone is called AER sones. So, there it is numbered as A13 EH1. A stands for physiography, 13 stands for soil scale, EH stands for bio climatic sones and 1 stands for length of growing period. So, that way we can put various agro ecological sones. So, AER sones A13 EH1 is referred as western Himalayas here. So, the some of the important characteristics of the sones shallows, scaracter soils, hyperarid climates with the length of growing period less than 60 days. So, that way by considering this agro ecological sones we can look into various sustainable agricultural practices or issues and then we can go for planning and management. It can be watershed based planning and management, but by considering this type of sones we can implement or we can have various plans. So, as we discussed them, so what are the necessities or what are the needs of agro ecological classification? So, the needs are listed here to assess yield potentialities of different crops, crop combination in agro ecological regions or sones. Then to formulate future plan of action involving crop diversification, to disseminate agricultural research and agro technology to other homogeneous areas, and then to determine the crop suitability for optimization of land use in different agro ecological regions or sones. So, as we discussed, so this agro ecological region or sones indicates what kind of crops, what kind of climatic region or what kind of soil pattern is there. Then we can put plans say like what kind of crops can be grown there, what should be the crop period length. So, like that various issues can be put according to the agro ecological classification or agro ecological sones or regions and then we can come up with the plans as far as sustainable agricultural practices are consensual. So, now as far as sustainable agricultural practices are consented, soil conservation and water conservations are two important issues. So, let us look into some of the important principles and issues as far as soil and water conservation are consensed. So, soil conservation important principles are based upon rainfall of high intensity then erosion of top fertile soil takes place. So, we have to stop this soil erosion. So, that is the so by various practices we can reduce the soil erosion. So, that is the so called soil conservation. So, we can have various measures like condor farming and then say we can plant trees or grass to reduce the soil conservation. So, various measures are possible like biological measures like a conservation tillage, deep tillage, conservation farming and we can go for mechanical measures like terracing, water disposal, other low cost measures. So, like shown here we can say reduce the soil erosion and we can go for soil conservation using various techniques. So, then as far as water conservation is consensed the principle of the water conservation is say where precipitation is less than crop requirements what we have to do. So, then where precipitation is equal to crop requirement or where precipitation is in excess of crop requirements. So, accordingly these three classes we can have a particular say intervention or particular strategy say according to the climatic or rainfall conditions. So, in the first case where precipitation is less than crop requirements strategy includes land treatment to increase runoff on to crop areas following water conservation use of drought tolerant crops suitable managing practices. So, this is when the precipitation is less than crop requirement. Then second case where precipitation is equal to crop requirements. So, the strategy is local conservation of precipitation maximizing storage within the soil profile and storage of excess runoff for subsequent use. So, this is when precipitation is almost equal to what is required as far as crop requirements are consensed. And then the third case where precipitation is in excess of crop requirements the strategy is to reduce rainfall erosion to drain surplus runoff and store the surplus water for subsequent use in summer season. So, this way as far as water conservation is consensed we can make particular strategy depending upon the region depending upon the case we can have either another precipitation is less than crop requirement or whenever precipitation is almost equal to crop requirement or when precipitation is in excess of crop requirements. So, accordingly we can go for particular strategy as far as water conservation is consensed. So, now based upon these issues now let us discuss the sustainable land management practices. So, we have seen the for achieve sustainable agriculture practices we need to go for sustainable land managing practices. So, sustainable land managing practices that gives knowledge based it is a knowledge based system which helps to integrate land, water, biodiversity and environmental management to meet rising food and fiber demands while sustaining ecosystem services and livelihood to meet requirements for the growing population. So, we can define the sustainable land management like this. So, it is a holistic way of sustainable approach as far as land, water, biodiversity environmental management and then say the requirement as far as the growing population is consensed. So, this sustainable land management or SLM enhances the productive capabilities of land in crop and grazed area. So, if you consider the various issues appropriately and we can increase the productivity the crop yield and then forest tree can be improved or the grass land or grazed area can be improved. So, through sustainable land management we can have actions to stop reverse degradation or at least to mitigate adverse effects of earlier misuses. So, whenever we discussed about the watershed deterioration issues and related problems we have seen that say here say the watershed will be degraded say by various problems, various issues as we discussed earlier. So, through sustainable land management practices we can at least reduce what is happening and then also we can reverse the trench so that we can have the same overall sustainable development. So, now let us look into what are the objectives as far as sustainable land management practices are consensed. Some of the important objectives are listed here to increase land productivity. So, that means replenish soil nutrients by liming or other means and then maintain soil cover. So, like cover we can use cover crops and residue recycling and second objective is to provide adequate quantity of water. So, there is no scarcity of water. So, we can use crop forage or tree species with higher water use efficiency. So, that depending upon the available water we can go for say water resource management using particular crop then to maintain water quality. So, water quality is also an issue. So, here we can protect vegetative filter areas in the riparian zones to remove excess sediment and nutrients and then also the non-point source of pollutions all those we can reduce and then third objective is to reduce flooding and flood damage. So, as we discussed earlier flooding is always a problem. So, we can through sustainable agriculture management practices or sustainable land management practices we can plant a deep rooted vegetation to enhance infiltration and water consumption by the plants and this also may decrease the soil erosion problems. So, these are some of the important objectives as far as sustainable land management practices are concerned. So, now let us look into the sustainable agriculture issues. So, first one is the crop husbandry. So, crop husbandry means the practices of growing and harvesting crops based upon scientific principles and careful management and conservation of resources. So, whenever the cropping pattern so, we have to consider the cropping pattern what type of crop is to be used then the various issues say as far as soil is concerned water is concerned and then the health of the crop is concerned. So, here the crop husbandry includes soil enrichments usage of hybrid and improved seeds and better crop cropping pattern. So, some of the techniques used for improved crop productions include soil enrichment by bio fertilization then introduction of micronutrient management then usage of hybrid seeds achieving optimum plant population so, that better production will be there and timely and effective weed control. So, we say in agricultural practices weed control is very important. So, we have to timely do the weed control then pest management. So, these are some of the important techniques which we can utilize in crop husbandry so, that we can achieve sustainable agricultural practices as far as various crop management or crop husbandry is concerned. Then the next issue in sustainable agriculture is nutrient management. So, as far as nutrient management is concerned it is important to tackle problems like use of inorganic fertilizers. So, last few decades farmers are using lot of inorganic fertilizers like urea then phosphate same like that. So, whenever we use without say the crop optimal use or without scientific say knowledge then what happens is that it decrease the soil fertility and then also it become a pollution source as far as soil and water is concerned. So, then other issues as far as nutrient management is concerned to stop weed growth to avoid crop diseases improve crop yield. So, these are the main issues which are these as far as nutrient management is concerned. Then as far as nutrient management is concerned it includes disseminate knowledge of nutrient and its function to plant growth. So, most of the time say in a country like India the farmers are not well educated. So, we can disseminate the knowledge say why we have to study nutrient analysis as far as particular area or particular watershed is concerned and then how to improve the nutrient same in the soil. So, we can disseminate the knowledge and then its function same in plant growth as far as nutrient management is concerned. Then assessment of nutrient availability as far as the watershed is concerned and then nutrient management like supply deficient nutrients to the soil also avoid excess use to protect the environment. So, as I discussed say for example, the nitrate phosphate and then sabotage NPK is concerned. So, you can see that the last few decades many areas farmers are using this importance nutrients like NPK. So, what happens when it is overuse is there it becomes an environmental problems and whenever under utilize under use is there. So, then it becomes a deficient nutrient as far as the particular area is concerned. So, that way we should look into an effective nutrient management as far as the particular area or particular watershed is concerned. Then let us further look into the nutrient and its functions. So, there are two basic types of nutrients one is so called macro nutrients. So, this macro nutrients are available in soil in large larger percentage say for example, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, calcium, magnesium etcetera. So, then other one is so called micro nutrients. So, this is available in soil in minor percentage. So, like iron, copper, zinc, manganese etcetera. So, that way this depending upon the requirement for the particular crop say depending upon the availability of that particular nutrient for the particular area we have to provide that particular nutrients to the soil. So, that the crops can grow in a healthy way and it can give better yields. So, appropriate nutrient management is very important. Then let us look into what are the important functions of nutrients. Some of the important functions are listed here. These are include an involvement in photosynthesis and produces carbohydrates. Then early root formation and growth. Then nutrient helps plants to survive in bitter environmental conditions like the environmental conditions like drought area or the increased saline area. So, like that so the nutrients can helps plants to survive in these particular areas. Then increasing water use efficiency. So, if you give appropriate nutrients appropriate levels to the plants or to the soil then we can even increase the water use efficiency. Then important role in reproduction of plants. So, these are some of the important functions as far as nutrient is concerned. So, we should have better nutrient management plants as far as the particular area or particular watershed is concerned. So, then say particular area is concerned we should assess the nutrient availability and then we have to provide nutrients to the soil for the particular crop is concerned. So, the various tests are possible as far as the assessment of nutrients are concerned. So, some of the important tests are listed here like traditional soil test including test like pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, electric conductivity etc. So, these type of test traditional soil test we can perform in every 3 to 5 years. So, that depending upon the non-availability of this particular nutrients we can provide this nutrients according to the curement. Then another important test is called nitrous test. So, this includes the pre-planted nitrous test for additional nitrogen and deep nitrate test how much nitrate has already leads below the crop rooting zone. So, this test we can do and then accordingly we can provide appropriate say nitrate treatment as far as the soil is concerned. Then next one is traditional plant test like a chlorophyll meter to quickly determine the nitrogen status without destroying any plant issues. Then also we can go for a reaction water test then electric conductivity and pH test. So, these are some of the tests used to assess the nutrients available for the particular area, particular soil for particular crop growth. So, then accordingly we can go for nutrient management by supplying appropriate nutrients on appropriate levels or appropriate measures to particular area for the given crop. So, now another important issue in sustainable agriculture management is pest management. So, the pest management the main objective is to say how pest management interlates with climate water crop and soil management same for farmers to understand. So, the farmers should understand how the pest management will help them. Then to incorporate this pest management techniques and its decision making process as far as the farming is concerned. So, this is another important issue. So, some of the important necessities as far as pest management is concerned that include a critical component of conservation practices. So, it is a very important the pest management. The negative impacts of pesticides. So, if overuse is there then lot of issues can be there. Then ground and surface water deterioration due to non points source of source of pollution like a pesticide contamination. So, this is a very important issue as far as water and soil is concerned. Then environmental risk like say for example, burning crop residue for disease and then insect control. So, these are the necessities as far as the pest management is concerned. So, then for the concentrated area, concentrated crop we have to go for appropriate pest management as far as the sustainable agriculture management is concerned. Then generally we use a term called integrated pest management so IPM. So, IPM approach is to pest control that combines biological, cultural and other alternatives to chemical control with the judicious use of pesticides. So, instead of overuse or underuse of pesticides, we have to judiciously use the pesticides by considering the various biological, cultural and other chemical issues are concerned. So, the important goals of integrated pest management includes maximum use of naturally occurring control forces in the pest environment. So, particular area or particular crop is concerned. We have to consider whether we can control the pest naturally. So, if it is not possible only we have to go for chemicals. Then first focus on nonchemical measures. So, whether biologically or with say natural control whether we can reduce the pest. So, first focus is on nonchemical measures then use of chemical pesticides only for preventing severe damage. So, as far as particular farm is concerned or particular agriculture is concerned. So, we go for integrated pest management so that to reduce of course the damages due to the pest, but we have to see that whether without nonchemical measures whether we can reduce the pest problem and then if chemical measures to be adopted then it should be in a controlled way so that there are very less environmental problems so that we can achieve sustainable agricultural management for the particular area is concerned. So, now finally, let us look into what are the important issues as far as sustainable agricultural management practices are concerned. So, some of the important issues are listed here first one is biomass management. So, for the particular area what kind of crop is to be considered for the particular region particular area depending upon the soil depending upon the water availability and also like crop rotation. Then second issue is concerned better conservation practices as far as land and water is concerned land and water are concerned we have to go for better conservation practices. Then conservation buffers so for a sustainable to achieve sustainable agricultural management we can consider conservation buffers like a forest buffers at particular area then a grassed waterway then we can go for a filter strip then a vegetative barriers and conservation barrier for wind etc. So, various conservation buffers we can consider for the particular watershed or particular area is concerned to achieve sustainable agricultural management. Then as we discussed earlier we can go for crop husbandry by considering the various crop management practices are concerned. Then we can go for nutrient management so as we discussed in the previous slides nutrient is very important. So, we should not overuse and we should provide sufficient nutrients as far as the particular area or particular crop is concerned. So, nutrient management is very important in sustainable agricultural practices then integrated pest management. So, first we have to see whether we can go for pest control without chemical use and if chemical use is required then we should go for a on a scientific way controlled way. Then of course, as far as sustainable agricultural practices are concerned we can go for modern technology like molecular biology then and genetic engineering. So, now these two branches of science like molecular biology and genetic engineering have grown considerably in the last few decades. So, the scientific availability of this molecular biology and genetic engineering or its practices through its practices we can have better sustainable agricultural management. We can go for say for example, seeds are concerned we can go for hybrid and improved seeds and then we can go for tissue culture we can go for say hybrid varieties. So, like that various things various due to the development in molecular biology and genetic engineering we can use the various available techniques for sustainable agricultural or agriculture management. So, now another important issue in sustainable agricultural management is whether we can go for integrated farming system. So, say integrated farming system or IFS some of the issues are listed here in this slide. So, say for example, mixed farming system we can go for mixed farming system. So, mixed farming system combines crop and livestock enterprises in a supplementary manner. So, for a particular watershed or particular areas concerned which is not only crop we can have an integrated way of say mixed farming as far as crop is concerned as far as livestock are concerned. So, we can combine together so that we can have a better say economical achievements as far as the watershed is concerned. So, integrated farming system means integration of various agricultural enterprises like cropping, animal husbandry, fisheries, forestry, etc. So, that we can have a better economical achievements as far as the particular areas concerned and this gives great potentialities in the agricultural economy. So, some of the important components of integrated farming system includes crops, livestock, birds and trees. So, depending upon the area say for example, crop is concerned we can have mono crop that means only one type of crop or mixed or inter crop then multi-terc crops of cereals, legumes or pulses and oil seeds forage etc. So, crop is concerned we can have not only mono cropping we can have different crops together say for example, say wherever coca and farming is there with coca nuts we can go for say we can group pepper. So, like that various crops can be combined within the given area so that the farmers can have more products and better benefits from their particular farms. So, the main motto of integrated farming system is maximize food production and then overall development of a watershed. So, say by integrated farming we can achieve say overall development of the area since the farmers will have say better profits since through various crops in the same area so that we can maximize the food production and maximize the benefits. Then integrated farming system is concerned some other same issues like inter cropping, mixer cropping, strip cropping. So, as far as crops are concerned we can have three ways of integrated farming first one is inter cropping. So, here crops are grown in space available in between the plants say for example, turmeric can be grown in mango gardens. So, like that say some crops will be already growing like this you can see that here the in the mango garden here mangoes are growing and then here other types of crops. So, this is so called a inter cropping then second one is a mixer cropping. So, here alternative rows of different crops we can use so that say we can improve the crop yields then preserve soil fertility. Then third one is strip cropping where long strips are used for growing crops on leveled birds. So, like this as far as integrated farming is concerned cropping is concerned we can have inter cropping, mixer cropping and strip cropping. So, like this same by using integrated farming system we can achieve sustainable agriculture practices or sustainable agriculture management for the given watershed. So, within the perspective of what we discussed today sustainable agriculture management practices are concerned let us look into a case study. So, the case study is Adarshav watershed is in Kothapurli village in Andhra Pradesh it is spread over 465 hectares and the say an integrated watershed management plan based upon sustainable agriculture has been done by ICCRISAT in this area. So, the details are taken from the ICCRISAT websites details are available in this website. So, the main objective of this watershed intervention was to link strategic research in natural resource management with the development research to increase productivity of rain for agriculture through enhanced efficiency of natural resources while maintaining the resource base. So, this was the main objective as far as the watershed intervention in Adarshav watershed. So, finally, through this the aim was to increase the productivity through adoption of improved soil, water, nutrients and pest management as far as the areas concerned. So, the areas shown here it is taken from this websites. So, the important strategy in this watershed was to link the research with the watershed development schemes to enhance effectiveness of community participation and in this watershed a multidisciplinary multi institutional consortium approach has been utilized and various developmental projects were implemented by KRISAT in this area. So, they used an islanding approach through micro watershed as upfront demonstrations managed by farmers with the technical backups. So, technical advice given by KRISAT in this area and then say the farmers implemented these projects. Then the watershed is concerned one form strategic research was conducted by KRISAT in partnership with the farmers. So, some of the important watershed details are say 270 farmers out of which in this area 136 are small land holding up to 1 hectare and 60 are medium land holding and then 74 large land holding above 2 hectares. So, this were as far as the distribution of land holding as far as farmers are concerned in the Adarshav watershed. Then some of the other watershed details like annual rainfall is about 800 mm say 85% of it occurs during June October. So, soils are predominantly black soils in this area. Soil depth varies from 30 to 90 centimeter. The general slope of the land is about 3%. And some of the important crops grown include sorghum, mice, cotton, sunflower, pigeon pea, soya bean in rainy season and sorghum, sunflower, weightables in post rainy season under rain flood condition. And then in some areas say the farmers grow turmeric, onion and rice cultivation depending upon the water availability and then well irrigation. So, all these details were taken from the KRISAT websites. So, let us look into what are the important interventions done by the KRISAT authorities. So, here they conducted a complete resource mapping as a first step and then they identified the various problems as far as the watershed is concerned. They discussed the various issues with the farmers. So, some of the interventions done by KRISAT include continuous weather monitoring. They implemented a number of automatic weather stations in the regions and then say conducted scientific soil analysis. So, that soil according to the soil analysis, the soil has been classified and then they identified which type of soil is suitable for particular crops. Then also cropping system analysis has been carried out. So, that how much crop yield is possible, then what is the cost for farming and then what will be the benefits from the particular crop in the particular area. Then cropping has been done according to soil, then the cost effectiveness of particular cropping has been also analyzed. So, that whether say better crop yield can be achieved through various measures. Then another aspect which has been implemented in this watershed is in the cropping. So, we have already seen what is in the cropping. It is not only one crop, various crops were say run in the same area. Then use of nitrogen fixing plants so that say instead of providing say nitrogen through artificial fertilizers. So, if the nitrogen fixing plants give nitrogen to the soil so this has been implemented then vermicomposting then organic farming. So, all those things were done in this particular watershed. So, also integrated pest control through natural control measures were implemented in this watershed. So, that was one another important aspect of the success in this watershed. So, then finally, the Cresat or the NGOs carried out capacity building and then they gave training to farmers. So, that farmers know what kind of cropping to be done in particular area and then say scientific way of farming then by using soil testing and then nutrient management then integrated pest management. So, these are some of the important watershed interventions done in this watershed. So, then now let us look what are the important impacts of these measures interventions done by the Cresat in this others watershed. So, the analysis showed that crop yield considerably improved in many of the areas then considerable improvement in water availability including groundwater. So, they implemented rainwater harvesting also in this area. So, that improved the water availability for the area then integrated nutrient and pest management were carried out. So, that way farmers are using very less artificial fertilizers, but they go for organic fertilizers and then better nutrient management and then they go for better say scientific pest control and natural pest control instead of going for say chemical using chemicals for pest management. Then continuous monitoring so, as far as the watershed is concerned it was monitored using remote sensing and then GIS platform has been also used for overall better management. Then holistic watershed management the holistic approach as far as land, water, agriculture and people are concerned. So, that way a holistic development approach has been say done in this particular watershed. Then this watershed has been declared as a role model of integrated sustainable watershed management through sustainable agriculture management by various agencies and then so, this has been replicated in many villages in India and abroad. So, another important aspect in this watershed is city building and training has been given by the NGOs to the people. So, people participation was another important aspect and then overall socio-economic upliftment has been taken place in this watershed through various interventions. So, as far as this today's lecture is concerned some of the important references are listed here including various websites. Then based upon today's lecture here I have listed one tutorial question. So, the question is illustrates necessity of sustainable agriculture management practices as far as overall watershed management plans are concerned. So, you can do through a systematic approach some of the steps are mentioned here. So, identify the components then the possible scientific interventions as far as the agriculture management practice is concerned and identify the problems and identify the role of modern techniques like molecular biology and genetic engineering. Then importance of nutrient management and then role of integrated pest management. So, most of these issues we have discussed in the lecture. Then some of the self-evaluation questions from today's lecture are listed here. First one is discuss agriculture water use and compare weld and Indian scenarios. Second question is what are the major constraints in achieving watershed-based sustainable agriculture management. Then discuss the agro-ecological classifications in India and its importance then illustrate sustainable land management practices. So, for most of these questions the details are available in today's lecture. Then few assignment questions discuss Indian agriculture and irrigation scenarios. Then explain watershed ecology and agro systems. Then explain important issues in soil and water conservation. Then discuss importance of nutrient and integrated pest management and related issues. So, most of these questions can be answered based on today's lecture. So, finally one unsolved problem is listed here for your watershed area. Study the scope for integrated farming systems in your area. So, this we can do in a step by step procedure. So, first you can identify the suitable Indian farming system practices for the area for integrated sustained agriculture management. Then carry out stakeholder analysis. Consider traditional practices of the farmers. You can go to the field and discuss with the farmers and identify. Then suggest scientific methods, various methodologies how we can go for integrated farming systems. Then identify soil and water conservation measures for the area. Then identify proper monitoring and evaluation strategies for the area and involve how we can involve the local people to achieve integrated farming systems for the given watershed. So, this is you can do it as an unsolved problem. So, this is today's lecture we discussed about the sustainable agricultural management practices and then it is important in watershed management. So, we will discuss further the various issues as far as sustainable water management or sustainable watershed management issues are concerned in the next lecture. Thank you.",
