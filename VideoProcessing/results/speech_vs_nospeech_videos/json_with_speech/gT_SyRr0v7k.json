  "text": "Animal Justice just released an eye-opening new report on disease outbreaks in Canadian farms countering claims supporting ag-gag laws. Ag-gag laws punish whistleblowers and conceal animal cruelty in the meat industry. Ag-gag laws have been passed in several provinces and a federal ag-gag bill is underway. Bill C-275 threatens to jail people who go into farms to expose animal cruelty and hit them with fines of up to half a million dollars. Supporters of ag-gag laws often argue they're needed for disease prevention. But Animal Justice's report shows that outbreaks are often caused by poor farming practices, including needle-sharing, inadequate disinfection, and exposure to virus-carrying wildlife, not animal advocates. The real biosecurity risk is farmers themselves. Help stop ag-gag laws by signing our petition at animaljustice.ca.",
