  "text": "Agricultural markets have evolved with our societies revolutionizing how we farm and trade. About one third of global agricultural and food exports are traded within global value chains. COVID-19 posed challenges to food markets everywhere, but global value chains showed their resilience, highlighting the importance of international collaboration and an integrated approach to food systems. Access to markets and global value chains can help farmers to integrate into the economy, providing opportunities for income growth and better livelihoods. Smallholder farmers, they lack the information, skills and resources needed to participate. This year's State of Agricultural Commodity Markets report looks at how local and global agricultural markets can also drive sustainable, economic, social, and environmental development while leaving no one behind, securing a better future for everyone.",
