  "text": "Hey, Fong! Hey, Mo! Quiet! Farm Quiet! Everyone gather around! I have great news to announce! There is an animal singing contest next month. We need to start practicing to win first place this year. Now it's time to choose the lead singer. Who wants to give it a try? Oh! Me! When it comes to singing, no one can beat me. Silly duck on the farm. Quack quack quack quack quack quack quack. Wow! That's the baby! That's the best! Uh, hey! I want to try out too. Tinky donky on the farm. Hee ha! Hee ha! Let's sing together! Ha ha! Hee ha! Sounds a little out of tune, but very unique. As long as you practice more, you will definitely be able to sing better. Thank you! I declare that the lead singer of our farm choir is... Duck! And don't get it! He was out of tune! How can he be the lead singer? Although I am not as good as Duck, I will try my best to sound good. You can do it. Hey everyone! Rehearsal starts tomorrow morning. Remember to get to your own time. You will be late to the rehearsal. Oh, a talented singer like myself doesn't need to practice. Well then, I am still going to practice hard. La la la la la! Hee ha! I'm so nervous. It's okay. That's alright. Let's do it again. Together! Duck is still not here today. Today is our last rehearsal. I told her she must attend. Huh? Huh? So sleepy. Finally, everyone is here. So, let's start the final rehearsal. La la la la la! Oh, oh, oh. I think I had a weird crack in my voice. No worries. Let's keep singing. Ha ha ha. La la la la la! I should have practiced the song. Everyone here except me knows their part and is ready to perform. I don't think I can be the lead singer anymore. Don't worry. I can help you practice. We can help you practice too, Duck. Oh, thank you. Thank you, friends. Alright everyone, let's start rehearsing now. We are Find Animals. Quack quack quack quack quack quack. Let's sing together. Thank you, everyone. Now our next team is the Farm Choir. Fa fa fa farm and eat farm animals come unite. Let's sing together. Moo moo moo moo moo moo moo. We are Find Animals. Let's sing together. Sing quack quack here. And a ha ha there. Sing that. We are Farm Animals. Let's sing together. Sing together. For me? Thank you. Thank you. You were amazing today. You also did a terrific job, Duck. From now on, I am going to be a humble lead singer and practice hard like you.",
