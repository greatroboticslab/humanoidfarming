  "text": "Vegetables are primary cash crops for most farmers in Africa. Farmers generally sell to the first buyer who comes along or the buyer with the best price. Brokers often dictate prices leaving farmers with low bargaining power. The produce farmers cannot sell to the buyers at the farm gate cause considerable losses. This area is very fertile and the vegetables they do very well. Once I planted the vegetables I couldn't sell. I could throw even to animals because everybody was having them in printing. I couldn't even store because of the of the storage. We had a claimant. We had a kipindi which was $2000 per kipindi. The kipindi was $300 per kipindi. The kipindi was $100 per kipindi and $150 per kipindi. Kipindi was $300 per kipindi. Kipindi was $100 per kipindi. Nonetheless, farmers have found solace in solar dryers. Apart from managing excessive food production during 20 seasons, solar dryers increase the demand for healthy foods creating a sustainable income for farmers. Kipindi is a dry product. For example, kales or skumawiki. If they are stored in a place whereby they are not able to be contaminated by moisture, they can even stay for more than 2 years. For carots, they can even stay for 1 year. One kilogram of dried kales or skumawiki we sell between 800 and 1000 shillings. What are the other advantages of a solar dryer? You might ask. One is faster drying compared to direct sunlight. Why? The dryer is warm at an outside. They lower the spoilage risk due to fast drying. Dryers protects food against dust, pests, rain and insects. It also saves labor. You do not need to keep transferring the foods inside when it rains or at night. It has high food quality due to high hygiene, color and nutrition. Again, it is more economical compared to fuel or electricity dryers because of low maintenance and operation costs. Ultimately, the dryers do not harm the environment. They also last longer. However, everything with an advantage doesn't lack a disadvantage. The major disadvantage is that overdrying can lead to losses and poor hygiene can introduce microorganism, leading to food fermentation and losses in the long run. The first aspect of drying is to maintain a high level of hygiene. Years clean water and clean all working surfaces before introducing your vegetables. Wash your hands, cover your hair, wear a dust coat, gloves and cut your nails. Only use healthy foods and dispose of those contaminated by molds. Selection High food quality begins in the garden, not in the processing period. Use good quality vegetables. Select the vegetables that is Sukumawiki, Managu, Terere, individually. Discard the damaged, rotten and deceased vegetables. Chop them to increase surface area for drying. I know you're probably wondering how dried vegetables maintain their green color. Well, here is how. Through blanching Blanch all vegetables in steam or boiling water. This reduces enzyme activities that lead to loss of color, flavor and texture. Steam blanching is the best. It prevents the loss of nutrients, prevents wages from adhering to each other when drying. Under blanching might leave some enzymes in Yosukumawiki, Managu and Amaranth dried vegetables with enzymes deteriorate during storage. What do you need for blanching? Knife and cutting board Large pot with lid And a basket Large bowl for ice water plunge A timer Methods of blanching Steam blanching Pua water have full into a large cooking pot with a close fitting lid. Add a tablespoon of salt. Heat the water until it boils. Place a wire or metallic basket with your veggies. Make sure it does not touch the surface of the boiling water. Cover the vegetables, steam for half the required time. Ensure that all the leaves are steamed before removing them. To check for proper blanching, Sukumawiki, Managu or Amaranth should be wilted, heated through and soft. Remove the veggies after one and a half minutes and use a blower to cool them. Place them on a paper towel or clean cloth to remove excess moisture. Cover to keep off that and insects as you finish your entire batch. Transfer to the dryers. Water blanching Boil water and poor vegetables as it is boiling. Let kales, spinach, managu and amaranth sit in the boiling water for one to two minutes. Remove and immediately pour into cold water. Preferably cold running water so it does not heat in the process. Let it run for one to two minutes similar to the blanching time. The process stops cooking. If not clean running water, have two buckets and let the vegetables sit in the water for one to two minutes in each bucket. Remove the veggies and place them on the paper towel or clean cloth to remove excess moisture. Cover them to keep off that and insects as you finish your entire batch. Transfer to the dryers. Dryers You can construct or hire an artisan to construct a basic box type solar dryer. The dryer has a wooden frame and wire mesh trays covered with a clear plastic sheet. The size and potability depend on the purpose of the dryer and resource availability. Trey loading Use clean trays free from contaminants. When working with large quantities load the trays as you slice or cut. This reduces adhering or the sticking together in bowls. It also kick starts the drying immediately. Lay the vegetables close to each other without overlapping them. Place the dryers when they are fully exposed to the sun throughout the day. Ensure plastic covers are clean to increase drying performance. Dirty ones prolong the drying period. Keep doors closed after placing each tray and keep insects and flies off the dryer. Drying Turn the vegetables every 6 hours. If it is too hot, open the loading doors slightly. About 20 cm and cover with a mosquito net. Close as soon as it is cloudy. Whenever possible keep the box type dryers from rain as they stop drying when it is raining. Condensation begins and might contaminate your vegetables. In hot weather fruits and vegetables slices dry after 2 full days. Remove the veggies and fruits where they achieve a crunchy feel. Otherwise insufficient drying might encourage mold formulation. If not properly dried allow them to keep drying for another 1-2 hours. Final product should have approximately 10% moisture content. This cannot allow enzyme development. Unloading the dryer Unload as soon as the veggies or fruits dry. Unload in the afternoon preferably when it is sunny. Which reduces the chances of food condensation. If possible package the product while it is in the dryer. Otherwise package as soon as possible as foods are highly susceptible to pests. They are also likely to reabsorb moisture. Pack in airtight containers or bags. Brown papers placed in plastic bags are preferable. Smaller quantities have less risk of contamination. Glass containers are more attractive but they should be placed in dark areas. Label your product with your company name, location, address, expiring and manufacturing dates. Store in a cool dry and clean place. So how much can you earn from dried vegetables? 1 kilogram of dried kalesos kumaweki we sell between 800 and 1000 shillings. While if it is fresh it is only 10 shillings. One row of pumpkin will sell at around 300 shillings but when we dry that the same pumpkin will sell at around 1500 shillings.
