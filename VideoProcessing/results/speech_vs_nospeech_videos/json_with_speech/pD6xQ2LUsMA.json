  "text": "Hey good people, Batavia here. We're talking what I'm growing in containers this year. See you in a few. Okey-doke. So quick housekeeping items. Thank you to those who like, watch, comment, share, subscribe to be BetterGuard and we appreciate it. If you haven't subscribed already, consider it. There's a button below. And if you do hit the notification bell so you're alerted each time I share more hashtag, Guard Enjoy. Let's see other housekeeping items. I am going to walk through today what's been planted in containers. So what we have in the backyard that we're growing. There is another video that I'll link that talks about the different types of containers. So basically nothing but container sizes, things that work well at growing in some of them. So I'll link that. But if you have questions about something you see today, feel free to drop it below. Okey-doke. So I'm just going to do a quick view of where everything is then we'll dig into each of the containers. So this is what I have on the deck this year. I scaled back because I wanted to make sure that folks when they came could comfortably kind of walk around. Hold on to a rail and feel comfortable here. Next up we have some buckets that we're growing in along the fence line. I'm going to pan around. Next week we're going to do a kind of backyard raised bed garden tour. So you'll see what I have growing in these raised beds. This is a set of containers I have kind of put out in a row and I have them covered. This is new. So this is like a row of grow bags. So I have it between the cage baby and then this bed here and we'll talk about what's in those. Then my favorite space to grow in as far as containers is along this wall here. Last year we did potatoes. We're doing different things in it this year. And one more set and this is where we'll start talking about what we're growing. So inside of the cage baby, I have some ins and odds that are tucked into what's kind of the stepway or walkway. So I'm going to open this up and then we'll take a look. Okay, so we have things opened up here. These are three sets of containers and we'll try to put a picture of what they look like when they were more empty. So in the back we have two broccoli plants and they've started to form heads. They're doing okay. I'll be harvesting these when they get it. They get a little bit larger. It is kind of taxing on that seven gallon container. There's probably not a lot of soil left as those roots can get kind of large for those plants. Next up I have some cauliflower here and then there's cabbage here. And these plants are just struggling a little bit in these smaller containers compared to the ones in the raised beds. We're right at June the 12th today and in Chicago in zone 6. And it's starting to get warm. This morning it's pretty warm and some of these plants just didn't like, you know, kind of those warm tents. But what's doing super well, I have two different types of red kale here. So I direct sow these seeds back on four. It looks like 418 and so then I also did a regular curly kale. I probably started with more than one plant, but it looks like maybe one or two made it. And I tried my hand at planting the stershems as a deterrent. Rather than covering the plants to see how they do. And all in all in this side, there's not a whole lot of damage. Let's take a look at the other set. So down here we have a similar setup. There are the two different kind of bus boy containers. You can see where one stops and the other one starts. So back here I have collards on my right and then that's cauliflower. It hasn't started to form a head yet. Up front we have collards again, and then that's cabbage. And these plants have been a little bit tattered. I think one of these in a container would have been optimum. But fitting too well in, I think just as they're getting larger and the root systems are getting larger, they're struggling just a little bit. So this is the Tuscan and or Lassenado or dinosaur kale. This is where I've seen the most damage. So all of these plants can fall prey to a number of bugs. My biggest issue when it comes to these plants are the cabbage moth. So I have seen some damage and I may be able to find some of the worms, but you can see the holes. And there's a part of me that's kind of left this as the sacrificial plant, you know, and just kept an eye on the others which haven't had that much damage. I have harvested some leaves that have had some holes just to try to see where new damage starts. So so far so good when it comes to these containers. They won't live here for the entire season. At least not with all of these plants in them. Things like the collards would stay all season, but the other ones are going to end up coming out once I end up harvesting the food. So there we are there. Okay, so in buckets we have on the far end two gallon buckets, then they go up to like four gallon and then there's one five gallon on the end. So parsley from last winter that were wintered in the garage, started growing this spring and it's basically flowering and I'm going to go to seed. I'm going to let it since it's kind of tucked away here. Celery is in raised beds all over the place, but I tried it in two gallon buckets. You can see a little bit of damage based on some sun there. This is a chart that I direct sowed earlier this spring. This is another kind of test here. So this is a red cabbage and a two gallon bucket and then here is a four gallon bucket. And you can see they were planted on the same day. Both starter plants, you can see the difference in the size when looking at them. So more space did allow for at least larger plants and leaves. We'll see if they form a head of cabbage and what that looks like. Not quite yet. I have, I think there's just maybe a jalapeno pepper plant tucked in there. This is going to be interesting because this is a potato plant. So I'm pretty sure I put one seed potato in there with the intention on seeing how potatoes do in a five gallon bucket compared to I have some grow bags over on the other side that I'm growing potatoes in. This was the big hot choy that I'm just basically saving the seeds for. This is the Russian kale. If you saw that spring tour, it was in the one of the garden beds in the front yard garden. And what needed to be happening is I pulled the plant and I wanted to see if I could basically save it and sit it in a bucket just to get to the point of saving the seeds because I really wanted the space in the bed. All right, so grow bags. We have 20 gallon grow bags on the end. Then we're coming down to 10 gallon grow bags here. The 10 gallon grow bags are the only things that I didn't plant in last year. I just got those this year and I like them so far. So let's talk about what's inside of them. Some may recognize the plant. Potatoes, potatoes, potatoes and potatoes. So these are French fingerling potatoes. They were planted on the seed potatoes on five one. Next up, I think these are Huckleberry Gold. They were planted a little bit later like mid-May. And then I believe this is a combination of kind of what I had left of seed potatoes. So there's I think French fingerling in there, more Huckleberry Gold. There may even be like a Yukon Gold in there. And so then I have one last set and these are more French fingerling. So this is a 10 gallon. I have three seed potatoes in this compared to the one down there is a 20 gallon and there were six seed potatoes compared to the five gallon bucket that is just one seed potato. So five gallon, 10 gallon and then 20 gallon and we'll see how they all do. Next up, I want to try Zucchini in these 10 gallon grow bags. I don't expect necessarily the plants to stay here. The bags that stay here just based on the size they may get. I direct so those on six eight and so we're just not quite a week and they haven't germinated just yet. This is where I started just tucking some things in. So I have some lettuce hoping to get some growth out of this before it starts to bolt and then I have a couple of like snack size or style peppers. Then I have some herbs down here and I kind of tucked in a bit of everything. My herbs got started a little bit later. So that is this wall. It's convenient so far because I can get my little card and I can move about in between these two spaces over here. Not that convenient but I'm not necessarily going in that space too much. I transplanted this very early in the spring for me. This is actually a volunteer so I don't know what the tomato is going to be but it's the first tomato out. I think it's a cherry tomato plant. I ended up bringing a container inside last winter looked up and there were tomato seedlings so I carried them through the winter and the spring just to see what would happen and I got two of them planted out. So these will likely be the first tomatoes of the garden. It's looking good so far and then I just tucked in recently some basil here. You can see I'm using in the backyard if I've mulched I've used shredded leaves which is new to me but so far I like it a lot. So this is kind of let's see what happens. So I have okra plants. You can see there's a transplant that I planted and then I direct sowed a couple more. I probably only keep well I'm not going to be dishonest. I'll probably keep all three. I probably should only keep two in this container. Someone asked me last year I think about growing okra in containers versus like in raised beds or in the ground and I really thought it needs to be a big container because it has okra can have really big a really big root system and I'm just trying it out now. So these are 20 gallons all of these blue ones here and this is the attempt to try to do some trellising. I just have a sunflower in the middle just because and then you can see the beginnings of right there of cucumber seedlings. You can see them over there. So I direct sow those just on 6'8\". So what's that four days ago and they've already germinated. Next up these two containers we're doing corn. Yeah so we have first time growing corn this year I did corn in a raised bed and it's over there. You can see it's come up. That was planted on April the 27th. This corn was direct sowed on 6'8\". Again I might just drop some lettuce in the middle know that it will be done way before the corn really gets up to size. So I direct sowed I think going around the intention is six plants and so I double sowed some and I'll end up pulling the weaker seedling. But so far so good. I checked around online for folks that are really growing corn in containers. I actually know a couple of gardeners that are doing it so we'll see. Very last set of containers are going to be in this kind of row here. This is probably the most inconvenient space in the garden when it comes to how I've set this up. But luckily I don't get into these beds that often and so it's not that big of a deal. But I'm going to uncover this and let you check it out. So while this isn't my favorite setup these are one of my favorite types of containers. These are kind of the rectangles that are about 16 or 17 gallons. I like them a lot because they're pretty decorative. They actually stack nicely as you can see. I have cabbage here that has some damage. I've kept it covered with the tool but it hasn't been covered. There are moments like this where I take it off and so I also have transplanted some things in that may have brought some bugs with them. So I'm doing four inside there. This is more cauliflower and you can see that there's some damage on these leaves. I'll probably do this give us a spray of neem oil today and I'll clean up some of these dead or dying leaves. And then I have some onions kind of tucked in here and then on the far end is where I have some bok choy that I started from seed and just transplanted out. This is going to be the shortest kind of crop along this line as far as containers because it'll come up to size and I'll start harvesting it before it bolts as it will pretty soon here. One more. I forgot about the sweet potatoes I have tucked away in here. We're doing sweet potatoes in one grow bag this year and then we have them in a raised bed in the front yard. Okay though so I appreciate you spending some time with me. If you have any questions, comments or suggestions feel free to drop them below and I shall see you all in the next one. It's going to be raised beds in the back yard. They're like eight raised beds we're going food in so I'll see you guys then.",
