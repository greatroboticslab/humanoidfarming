It's equestering it there so that it's permanently in the soil or it's available for a future crop to use. Our goal with the growing system of Caranada is to grow Caranada in situations where you normally wouldn't have a crop. So it's a non-food acre, an acre where nothing would be growing. Caranada goes in that place, harvests that energy from the sun, harvests CO2 from the air, creates yield for us to create biofuels, other oil type products, and also returns carbon into the soil, making it a net negative carbon crop.",
