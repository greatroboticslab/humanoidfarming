  "text": "Chris and I had the opportunity to finally get down to the National Farm Machinery Show. It was our first time ever actually going, I've wanted to go for years, but running my business and being such a small business is hard for me to get away for that many days and not be able to do all the other stuff I have to do. But this year I bit the bullet and went down there and it was a lot of fun. We got to see all sorts of stuff. Spent a couple days there, parts of a couple of days, talking to a lot of folks. The second day we saw things that we missed the first day, either you walk right by it or there's so many aisles that, well you just get confused on what you saw and what you didn't. And they have stuff for tractors big and small. I mean a lot of the equipment that was there is not really relevant to my business, into what I sell or what I use either. But it's still cool to see some of that really big equipment in person that's in pristine condition, right? Brand new showroom quality. But of course there were plenty of different tools and tractors and all sorts of brands. You could sit out and try them out and see how they felt. So a really good opportunity. If you ever get the chance to go, I'd highly encourage you to do so. They say if there's one show you're gonna go to, this is the one. We bumped into a whole pile of YouTubers out there too, so you'll probably see some familiar faces in the video. But I thought we'd just kinda take you through mosey on through all the booths that we saw. Just kinda like you're there yourself. So let us know what you think. Here we go. Hey we got the big map now. Mm, okay so we're, let's get out of the way here. This is like their 1025R model right here. Yeah, X20S. See it's got one of those flip around seats down there. Oh there's no third function. I'm gonna fall in the middle. 45, 40. Yeah they're good looking tractors. They're good looking tractors. Oh, it's been disgusting. I don't know. A lot of hydraulics there. It's cool daily. Coyote. Ooh I gotta check that out. So it's tree terminator. That could be cool. No I'm just kinda looking around. Thank you. Well these guys are the three foot one. Oh this is a three point mount. It's like a little mini one. I wonder if this fits on a if a subcompact would lift it. Ooh. 20 inch. Nasty. The hydraulic flow is almost the same on the JCV. All I need is 10 gallons a minute. Oh okay. At 2000 PSI. Wow. So any 50 horsepower skid loader's got that. Yeah for sure, not much at all. Even for the bigger one, the 20 inch? Well 20 inch I need 15 gallons a minute. But still, any skid loader today could do so that. You just have to have the 20 inch, I'm looking at lift capacity. Okay. Wait lift capacity. This weighs 1400 pounds. Oh. And the 20 inch weighs 2200 pounds. Okay. So you have to have the carrying capacity. Yeah. But this one here. Is this a 14 inch? This is a 14. Wow. That's sweet. It only weighs 800 pounds, but there's a lot of head average out there. So. Is this telescope or no? Not an telescope, just rotates. Okay. Swivel. Oh nice, that's cool. That's handy, so that's good for limbs and stuff then too. Yeah, on a skid loader you got eight foot of reach here, so you ought to be able to reach up about 16 foot inside a 12 inches up to 10 inches in diameter. That's sharp. What's the tree terminator? Is that the more? Well tree terminators are named brand. Oh it is, oh okay. So all of these are tree terminator. Okay. They're made by Grace Manufacturing. That just happens to be our rotary mower. Okay. What size does that got? Five inches in diameter. Okay. All right. And what kind of load does that use? Standard load. Up to 25 gallons, 15 to 25. I'm gonna make a heavier version of it that'll go up to 45 gallons. And what diameter would that cut? Eight inch. Wow. That's nice. Oh, okay. That's cool. How do you guys sell? Mostly through distributors. Depending on where you're located, if we have a distributor in your area or not, if we don't, we just sell direct. Okay. Where you located at? I am a dealer in Michigan. Up in Michigan. Yup, but I sell- Farm Co is our distributor. Oh are they? Oh okay. I sell online though. I sell nationwide. Okay. Well you can buy from Farm Co. Good. Okay. Well that's good to know. Our distributor up there. Would it be under Grace Manufacturing then? Yeah. Okay. Okay. I'll have to check that out. That might be worth looking into. Yup. This is the motor I have right here. Got that same one. Okay, our third. I don't even have a rep here. That looks sweet. 12 gram for it. Oh it's triple stack of, no double stack of weights. Got a bit of a counterweight up here. I didn't know anybody would get one. Oh wait, yeah they do. Cool thing. Okay. So that way all the stuff's way back there, but you're still total control up here. But it's all electric then. Wow, interesting. Is it the same series then? Yeah it's the same sprayer. It's just got up here much. So in other words if you want to do all three at the same time, it's master's wedge. You need to increase your pressure a little bit. Six, eight, 10, 12, 24 maybe? 25. 26? I don't even know what to say. Man, seems like so much maintenance. Oh. Stack. Blanker, here. Here's. All right quick. You're helping me so much. This would be like, I think this would be like what the summit size is like. Cab? I think so. Cab's pretty significant. Yeah, this must be like a fairly economy model. 7,320 power shuttle. Looks kind of like the M4, huh? Yeah, it's pretty similar overall. This must be the, does it not? Faller cabinet. Is this not the, huh? Reason other than just looking? No, I'm just looking around. I'm looking for new manufacturers to work with too. I feel like my lineup is going to need to. What do you need? Depends, depends whatever. I just want quality and good pricing, features, accessibility. I know your business model, kind of observed your business model. You would like the gentleman over there on the phone. These are very, he kind of eats out about that kind of stuff. Are you doing anything with Summit? Are you just influencing? Summit tractors? Are you developing new products? Or just trying to perfect them on the head? I agree. So, are you, now your equipment like? I'm taller than it. I just feel like all the moving parts on those things. Oh, okay, here's the PTO. That's what? Yeah. See, you're on the problem. But then that's the problem. Yeah, I mean like just take some random pictures. Yeah. Are you guys still doing just the one pen and then the bolt on second pen? Yes. It's a big cost consideration. It's a lot. Well, most of them have, the coupler have two holes. Yeah. I mean, so they'd be able to, because if you had, if you needed this. You know, when I'm selling these, these are like a five series, right? Like a 520M or something like that, right? That's cool. Yeah, and that's pretty much you can do that. So you can retrofit though your old. Yes. Oh sweet. You have that cross here, you can do that. That's huge. That's one of the newest things. That's a big deal. The location was great. It is a good location. It's really easy to get in there. Definitely weren't going to get anybody that came by. Yeah, works out. Do you guys have any of the, like your three point stuff? Like your, I didn't read that close. I just saw like they all posted it on there. What's that? He's there. Over seven foot tall, isn't it? I should have just kept the manager here. Kind of miss it though. I can't think of any video title anymore. Backo. It doesn't, it's actually, I feel like this tubing here is a lot smaller. North Carolina. Well that's where their headcourt, that doesn't say that's where it's made. Hey, how much? How are you? Good. Good. Just looking around the day. Is that a flail more there too? Or is that a chiller? That's a chiller? Okay, so flail, flail more, flail. You're like the only ones on the market that make a quick hitch compatible flail more. Oh, sweet. And this is 1980. No kidding. Wow. So yeah, we made you actually in North Carolina, but we've got dealers out there. Interesting. Oh, they have cedars too. Wow. This would be great though for around the ponds, you know. It'd be fun to have a blower mounted on the skid steer, you know. That'd be sweet. But that thing would chuck it, you know. Well, actually, the designer was fired. He was let go. It's a lot of. Not contacted here, but you can't contact the end again. I hope it is. Love to be a... Well, I'm not sure if it's a good idea. Love to be a... Wow. I mean, these grill guards, I've seen a few of these now that have like nothing on them. You know, I don't quite understand that. There are no armrests. Lovely. There's the only thing on this whole fender here is the joystick. Got your controls up here though. This is nice. Wow. This is quite basic. Huh. Those are fat tired, aren't they? Wow. Brush mark. Please do not sit or stand on more. 56 grand. Oh! 40 grand. Oh, but you get a... Where's that... There's a bigger one. There's a bigger one. There's a bigger one. There's a bigger one. There's a bigger one. There's a bigger one. Yeah, that's sharp. Can you see it? It digs the initial, softens it up, this flings it out, and then it smooths the bottom of the trench right there. I think I've seen these online before. Like the Kubota. Batteries probably. Nope. Like, it looks fake. I will say. Look how short these ropes are. They're great. That do what, exactly? This is the drain of lake. Is that what it is? How's it going? Good, how are you? Good. Got some cool stuff here, man. Looks like it's built like a brick house. I'm sprinkling skid steer stuff now and then. Where are you from? From Michigan. Oh, sure. Did this show? That's big. Yeah, I know. That's about as big as they come. Yes, that's why if you're going to go to one, this seems to be the one to go to. Two. They do a lot of skid steer stuff, but... I do... I just... I do. We're by 30 miles from the skid throne, quick attack. Oh, okay. We're getting a lot of... I guess traction in the... the multi-show. Oh, really? Yeah, yeah. Kind of shows it all. Then also you don't want to be hurt, but they're tight. Face and make sure they would both work in there and so we wanted to just put one in. Gotcha. Safety bar. Raise the neck, raise the shoulders. Yep. The way this is set up, this is ground level. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And the tires flip. See how much pressure she put on him? Yeah. Probably be all right. Yeah. Maybe a break. He keeps doing it, you know. Yeah. He's a trooper. Safety is convenient. One pin, one hole. Now, roll. Yeah. All stops. Yep. Perfect. I could save these for a lifesaver. Huh? All right, so let's see. We got to go... Wow, this whole other... whole other world in here, isn't it? Let's see. I'm glad to have you. I've talked to... I've talked to other people, talked to you. I don't know how we've ever talked. I know. That's just how it goes, you know. Today, huh? Yeah, we got a meet and greet. Do you? Yeah. You had a bunch of people side by it? I've been doing well. How are you? Nice to meet you in person. You know Tony? Yeah, we just bumped into each other. Yeah, yeah. So I was looking around the rest of the area for you, but you're blending in. Man, everybody's here. They're doing the work. Good. That's awesome. Arms family. Mmm. I watch you all the time though. It's good to see you. Likewise. I still don't know how you do it. Do it every day. A video every day, man. Can I tell you what? Facebook has been really good for me. Some people are. I know. I know. The YouTube. I don't... We just download them, the same video we put on YouTube, you know. Any good ones? Not really. What's that for? This thing? Oh, this is kind of hydraulic. Kind of fingers on it. I like the knee. My neck's right right here. Okay. Wow. And then this is what you want. Wow. Actually when you hit it, you kind of get that harmonic noise. Oh yeah, yeah, I heard it. Touch the seat. That's crazy, man. No. Good to see you. Yeah, you too. You too. Yeah. How's it going? Nice to see you. Yeah, how's the show? Fun? Yeah. We were here yesterday too. You can't see it all. Well, you think you see it all one day and you don't. You miss all sorts of stuff, you know. But then you get pulled in different directions and all that kind of thing too. It's a big crowd out this morning. We were just talking about... I think it's bigger today than it was yesterday. Yeah, they're mainly in Talbot right now. Yeah, it is. But the line even to get in was long. Just, you know, through parking and all that. But that's a good thing. Oh yeah. You got anything for like compact tractors that maybe I should take a look at? Are you selling our root rate grapples, like our baby root rakes? The light duty root rakes? Yeah. So I just looked at those the other day. Maybe on those. Well, so the big, the huge concern with small tractors is lift capacity, right? And so like the work saver grapples with little guys are... I really prefer that. I think that does a better job. Yeah. This thing, you put a six inch branch in there, it'll just rattle ahead of this bottom to pick something up. Oh, yeah. So that's what calls two times. Dude, right? Kind of clean up. With this, you end up standing it on end. You have the dumps on this. Yeah. But weren't they? Yeah, yeah, they are a little bit more money. So no 72 then for like a four series? No. I would... People would love to have a two inch receiver in those forks. They would... Well, you know, I mean, Wild just orders a whole pile and I haven't bring a few skids, you know, whether they come in six packs or 12 packs a game, remember? But... So I... Right off the top of my head, I don't remember what are up there. And then the pulverizing basket at the end, that's going to break down the rest of your clumps and kind of give you a smooth finish. Okay. All right. I think quite a bit lower than one of these guys. Oh, for sure. She was on big old... Well, but still, even the business end down here. All that. Hey, how are you doing, Bill? I'm just really selling this to make any money. And if you ever want to sell the company, I'd be interested if you had a patent. Oh, no kidding. Yeah. Oh, wow. And 30 days later... Because it's a bigger, you know, a bigger beefier one. Yeah. There's a lot of people here. It was a work. Yeah, I was coming by to see everybody. You know, it's like the most, the highest concentration of YouTubers in there. I was like, I don't know. I got to get pictures. I'm taking pictures. I can't post it because I ain't got no signal. Look at that. I thought you were going to let me on the corner. Yeah, right. You too, I want to take you down for a little while. Can you hear something? Well, I got a YouTube channel. I mean, mainly the small compact tractor type stuff, though. That's it. Clean it. At a disco too. I know. Maybe the language is not official. Huh? Yes. What am I missing here? So there's some sights and sounds for you. Just kind of, well, let's just say it was a lot busier the second day than it was the first. I don't know what the last couple of days are like, but we went the first two days and they got really packed out. But man, it was a good time. I think we'll probably make it down there again. I just kind of moseyed around and Chris followed along with the camera. I think next time we do it, though, we'll probably both be miked up. A lot of good, well, you're just noticing things, right? So a lot of new equipment that you're seeing. You're trying to figure out what some of it is or maybe what differentiates it. And so there was a lot of good back and forth banter. We talked to quite a few reps too. That was pretty fun. Now, of course, we do sell tractor attachments. That's one of the main reasons we were there to kind of seek some new manufacturers out.
