  "text": "Hello friends, welcome to our YouTube channel simpler agri sciences We are here with the mission to spread agri sciences in a simplified manner among farmers students and those Personals who are interested in farming and we will begin our ride from the base focusing on how Agricultural cultivation practices changed so far in our country, India with the hope that it will benefit you in many ways So let's start this video and watch it till the end to learn the impact of agriculture and spread the knowledge as much as possible among us Indian agricultural cultivation history Traces back to Indus Valley civilization and it was also evidence to be found in some places of southern India Serial shrubs fibers were domesticated crop and dog goat shape were domesticated animals to begin with Conventional plowing technique mostly used in farming for cultivation practices in Vedic literature Rig Veda describing about plowing following Irrigation in the field for cultivation of fruits and vegetables are some proven facts in form of written records of agriculture in India Evidence suggests that rice and cotton Were cultivated since Indus Valley time it was also reported that some archaeologists believed that rice was cultivated as Domesticated crop need the Ganges River banks since sixth millennium before Christ and Other crops such as barley oats wheat lentil chickpea pulses Millets cotton and cookable bittersius fruits were also grown in different parts of India Plowing patterns were taken from the bronze age and this technique was involved being drawn by 2000 fastened to the wooden cross piece at us to the plow to pull together Traditional agricultural implements used mostly at the time made of bronze namely sickle win over which are still used by many farmers now bamboo sieve widow and X More than 2000 years ago Indian farmers began growing many spices and sugar cane crop and Spreading of sugar cane cultivation took place when Macedonian soldiers carried reeds or tall grasses which were honeybearing on their return journey and Processed to produce the sugar crystals were invented by the period 500 DC now As clear as it is that agriculture is the backbone of our country's economy and Depending on the three factors such as climate technological development and socio-cultural practices Cultivation methods also changed quite significantly now farming at present can be of subsistence and commercial type Under subsistence type shifting cultivation which is also known as slation burn Is still practiced by many farmers to grow cereals and other food crops It is a system which involves shifting from one plot to another by abandoning the former after exhausting it and let it Revert its natural vegetation The purpose of such kind is to allow natural replenishment of soil fertility following natural processes Now this farming practice is known with different names in various regions of the country and in other countries As well for example zooming in northeastern states Deepa and Chattisgarh district and andaman Nicobar Island Bevar in Madhya Pradesh Hudo in Andhra Pradesh and in other countries like Mexico and Central America. It is known as Milpa Roka in Brazil and Ladang in Indonesia Even today some primitive tools like hoe, dow, sticks, Community labour on a weight basis are used in agricultural practices on small patch of plants Although such farming is entirely dependent on monsoon season soil fertility and other environmental conditions that favor crop growth India has three cropping seasons namely ruby, brave and zeib and crops are sown accordingly in different time of the year Now ruby crops such as wheat, barley, chickpea, peas, mustard They are sown in winter from October to November and harvested in summer from March to April and They are predominant in Indian states like Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Jambankashmi and Uttarakhand On the other hand, kharif crops like rice, millet, maize, green gram, black gram and so on are sown with onset of monsoon and harvested in September to October They are predominately cultivated in states like Odisha, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and Kerala The third season zeib crops like cucumber, watermelon, mask melon, pumpkin and bittergourd are sown in between ruby and kharif during summer For instance in February to March or March to July Now Indian villages witness tremendous transformation of agriculture From self sufficient production to commercial production with extensive services through commercial farming Commercial output provided by agricultural practices involve mostly about grazing crops in large scales or estates And shipping of the produce to other countries for monetization Thinly populated states like Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat have adopted the commercial farming system for plantation already And main crops grown for the purpose are wheat, maize, cotton and sugarcane So commercial farming is of two types namely intensive commercial farming which requires large amounts of capital or labor with relatively smaller areas of land and another is extensive commercial farming Which requires investment of small amounts of capital or labor with relatively large areas of land Farmers of India still have skeptical views When it comes to adopting new scientific technologies to grow their crop in present situation They have grown a mixed attitude towards farming technologies Which is evidenced by growing of new plant varieties alongside 30 to 50 year old varieties adjacent to the field area While owning mobile phones to check regularly about crop prices But fail to pay attention to the necessary information about best methods to grow their crop for higher yield Here we can possibly interpret the reluctance of adopting new technology pointing at first That less emphasis have been given to the communication of science to the farmers Second, deformed ways to promote the adoption of new technology Another barrier is that sometimes farmers interest does not meet eye to eye With scientists or technical persons soil test results For which we see varied range of prices in case of macro and micronutrients Unfortunately in most parts of the country covering mostly the rural areas Reports still indicate that approximately 45% and 26% women and men respectively Are illiterate and unaware of even the basic economics All the government took step to form fine policy tool in terms of incentives or subsidies To promote new agricultural technologies in India For example, higher yield seed varieties, advanced instruments and developed machineries Irrespective of the attempt, it is associated with pros and cons As companies draw some unnecessary additional features to the product for profit maximization Here in view of this all effective and more simplified scientific communication to the Farmers and tweaking policies at certain level could perhaps reflect some different picture on the overall obstacles The strategies however to increase the crop yield and spread of agricultural education could boost up the economic growth of the country in an exponential manner The new strategies if adopted may change the scenario For example, use of improved seed varieties, strong hold on land ownership, crop rotation, irrigation methods such as drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation and appropriate use of farm machineries, improved packaging practices, productive measures for pathogen and insect attacks To make farming profitable, increasing minimum support prices may aid to more than 95% cost return Now this perhaps will trigger the Indian farmers to invest more in agriculture Small holder farmers with their entrepreneurial strategies could be encouraged to invest in their farms and turn their image around for agricultural growth status of the country as they own more than 80% of the total farming land and 50% of livestock in India But due to low produce, low productivity and market pricing status, they do not receive what is expected and thus discouraging fact to invest in farming However, a market with price transparency, new land leasing laws and investments in livestock could encourage the small holder farmers to invest with enthusiasm Presently we see there is a wave of organic food consumption to build better health Thus, sustainable farming movement can set the opportunity for a bright future of agricultural cultivation Although organic movement started long back in 1921 and the pioneer work promulgated by Albert Howard, who is known as a father of organic farming and his wife Gabrielle Howard, when in early 1900s scientists were seeking for solution for the side effects of the toxic chemicals entering the food supply and certainly declining the overall natural fertility But current era people have already realized and are aware about how consumption of junk foods causing greater ill effects on their health and thus causing lifestyle diseases, especially who are residing in the urban cities. General awareness from national and international exposure helping people to take steps avoid such lifestyle diseases by switching into organic diets. So certified organic foods ensuring growth of organic market under the influence of scrutiny and regulations. Since past few years organic farming has witnessed a tremendous development almost in every crop type due to the general awareness of the end users for healthy foods and also environmental safety. It is reported according to WHO the organic food market is around 37 billion dollars at present already. So it is to be believed that health conscious end users will promote the growth of organic agricultural sector in future India.
