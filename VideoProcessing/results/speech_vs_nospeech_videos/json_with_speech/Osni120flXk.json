  "text": "In this episode we're going to talk about America's favorite vegetable, at least to grow in their garden, and that's the tomato. Tomatoes are going to have to be planted after the last frost. They do not tolerate frost, and they really like warm soil and air temperatures. The tomato is gardener's favorite vegetable to grow for several reasons. First off, they're just downright good to eat. They go with many different things in many different ways. There are literally hundreds of different varieties of tomatoes. There's yellow ones, there's red ones, and everything in between. It's great to can tomatoes and use them all year long. One thing to really remember about tomatoes is they're going to use a lot of water. Tomatoes need to be watered deep, and they need to be watered pretty often, more often than most other things. And in many places in Wyoming, in order to get a tomato, you're going to have to either start the seed inside, or buy pretty big bedding plants when you go to plant your garden. When we talk about how productive the tomato is, you can see here these tomato plants have cages around them. These tomatoes are going to grow up, and these cages are going to support them, because there's going to be, hopefully, so many tomatoes on there that will need that support. Of course, in my family, it just hasn't been summer until we pick a tomato off the vine, warm, eat it like an apple with a little bit of juice running down her face. This is Hudson Hill with the University of Wyoming Extension. You're watching from the ground up.",
