  "text": "Chinampas, often referred to as floating gardens, were an ingenious agricultural system developed by the Aztecs. This method involved creating small, rectangular plots of fertile land on shallow lake beds. Farmers constructed these gardens by piling mud and decaying vegetation, which resulted in highly productive soil. The Chinampas increased crop yield significantly, allowing the Aztecs to support a large population. Plants like maize, beans, and squash thrived in this environment, benefiting from the nutrient-rich sediment and water. This sustainable practice not only maximized space, but also showcased the Aztecs' advanced understanding of irrigation and ecosystem management, laying the groundwork for modern agriculture techniques.",
