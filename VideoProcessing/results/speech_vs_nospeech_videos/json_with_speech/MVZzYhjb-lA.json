  "text": "Feed the Future Innovation Lab for small-scale irrigation, otherwise known as the ILSI project, has been responding to the major challenges relating to agriculture, nutrition and health across Africa for the last three years. Through research and leveraging agricultural innovations, the project is uplifting the lives of small holder farmers across Ghana, Tanzania and Ethiopia, and also demonstrating potential for scaling up from individual farms to a national level and even further a field across the African continent. In Ethiopia, the work of the lab uses a combination of research, training and innovative technology for use in the field to improve food production, enhance nutrition and transform the economic standing of small-scale farming households across the country. Adequate and sustainable water delivery is the core component that will ultimately allow the Ethiopian farmer to grow and prosper. The water-lifting and delivery systems used in the field and supported by the ILSI project range from manual water lifting such as rope, pulley and tanker-based implements to motorised diesel pumps and now an instrument that can be directly sourced from one of Africa's most ubiquitous resources, the sun. Solar power pumps provide cost-effective power sourcing and a reliable method for farmers in remote areas. The solar panel has proved very useful. Before we used to pull out water manually and put it in the tanker. Now with the new solar pump, the water goes straight into the tanker and I'm able to water the vegetables. This new method has saved me quite a lot of time, energy and money and I would recommend this type of working technique to all other farmers. To make the best use of this system, I learned that it is important to save and conserve water and we now store all the water from the winter season in tankers. This new method has also allowed us to increase our yields. We are now able to produce maize up to three times a year so I would definitely suggest that solar technology be made more widely available. The majority of the components for the SSI innovations can be made and more crucially be maintained locally, allowing cost-effective and productive usage of all the primary irrigation tools. One of the tools that helps them to manage their water resources is the waiting for the detector. So this tool is an indicator of when to stop the irrigation, when the yellow flag within this waiting for the detector pops up and we also installed some instruments that measures the soil moisture status of their plot so that you know when to irrigate and when to stop the irrigation. The goal of the Innovation Lab is to define the most effective irrigation systems and practices from water lifting, distribution and monitoring methods that will enhance the lives of smallholder farmers like Germa Yehone and his family in Ethiopia and present the opportunity to transform the lives of the next generation of farmers.",
