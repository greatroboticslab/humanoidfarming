  "text": "Hey everyone, my name is Jordan Smith and I am the president of Voight Smith Innovation. Today we're going to go over the standard features and what is included when you purchase a VSI 400 gallon jet agitated hydroceder. We'll start off with the fully welded structural skid frame. There's fork pockets on the front, sides and the back so the hydroceder can be easily loaded and unloaded from all sides. There's also four built-in tie-down points to make strapping the hydroceder down fast and easy. All of our skid frames are bead blasted, epoxy primed and then powder coated to ensure a long lasting finish and corrosion protection. The 400 gallon jet agitated hydroceder is powered by a proven and reliable Honda GX390 with standard electric start. This engine is mated to a high performance, high pro three inch poly pump that allows you to mix a thick slurry and spray up to 250 feet of hose. Dual agitation allows flexibility to mix from the top open flow or from the side jet agitation. All of the plumbing on the unit is banjo flanged poly parts with stainless steel clamps. The combo of poly and stainless parts helps to ensure long service life and low cost of ownership. The flanged parts are also very easy to take apart in case you clog the system or in case one of your parts happens to break. The unit can be filled through the standard garden hose fill kit or through the pond suction feature or also from a hydrant or storage tank. If you do plan on filling frequently from a pond or other body of water, we would suggest getting one of our pond suction hose kits, which we'll cover later in the video. For those of you that plan to regularly fill your hydroceder from a pond or other body of water, you'll love our standard pond suction feature. In order to utilize the feature, you need some kind of suction hose, such as our pond suction hose kit, which is an optional accessory, has a two-inch cam lock, connects to your unit, isolate your tank, drop in the other end that has a detachable strainer basket to prevent debris from getting in your pump. Start your engine, make sure your pump is primed and your unit will self-fill. Our 2020 400 gallon jet agitated hydroceder models come with a nice variety of standard items and accessories. The unit includes three 50-foot quick connect cam lock hose sections and that can be expanded by up to two more hose sections for a total of 250 feet on the 400 gallon unit. Our valve spray gun comes standard with quick connects for the hose connection and for the spray nozzles. The gun also comes standard with a swivel fitting to make things easier to change the angle of operation and also to work the kinks out of your spray hoses as you roll them out. There are three standard quick connect nozzles that are included with your 400 gallon unit for your spray gun. This is a one-inch nozzle, which is great for tight areas and for trimming long edges and obstacles. This inch and a quarter nozzle is great for open spaces in larger areas. And finally, this cannon nozzle is great when extra spray distance is needed or when you're working in wide open space. For 2020, we're also including a 28-pound pail of 1.2 punch, which is our signature blend of tachifier and fertilizer. For other information, please visit our website at www.vsinnovation.com and thanks for watching. We look forward to talking to you soon. Have a great day.",
