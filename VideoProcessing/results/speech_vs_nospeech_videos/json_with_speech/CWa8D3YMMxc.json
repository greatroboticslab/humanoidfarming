  "text": "In a small community in the Pacific Northwest, a dynamic company is growing. This company has served the equipment dealer market for 30 years. They did it by following their principles, by being the best and by being honest to their customers. DIS. Technology driven. People focused. For ours, I'm going to say from that 100 to 150 horsepower class, that would be our bread and butter. I'm going to say 90% of the tractors we sell are in that class on that thing there. And we've got to the point where we'll get out, we'll demonstrate. You know, if we have somebody go down, we'll rent them a tractor and own one for the time being to keep them going on that and then all of a sudden they come back in, hey, calf check was better than what we had. We know we need one. We've got a tough winter coming and we planted the seed and it came back. The combines and the four-wheel drives, that'd be a very nice market to be in. But you look at the hours these guys are putting on the machines, oh, that's changed in the last 20 years. They buy one of those that they might not have to buy another one for another 20 years. And these smaller ones, we can get more guys rolling into them. And if we can get the customer to get them the reputation where they need to trade more off it, we can keep our business going. And our part of the country is guys will buy them and run for 10 or 15 years instead of trading after five. And we would like to get to the point where you can get them to roll them more often to keep them current, keep them under warranty and to realize how the technology is changing, not only for their benefit but for ours also.
