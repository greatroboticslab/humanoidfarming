  "text": "It's not possible to have a good use of softwood without pollination. A hand pollination. Now preparing to get the collected pollen grain of one flower in the May stage. In the May stage we can see that we are getting some enters and these enters if he is impregnated with pollen grain. This yellowish color that you can see we can go to this flower and under this flower we can observe that it is in the female stage. So in this female stage I need to transfer the pollen grain from this from this brush to the flower. For example I touch it in the recipient it will be full of pollen grain and I will transfer this pollen grain to the flower. With one hand I try to open the flower to expose the female part the female part of the flower and after that I put my brush with pollen grain in contact with the female part of the stigma. I do it crossing and that's all. It is pollinated. This flower will continue developing but developing only inside these flowers who they were pollinated maybe some five some ten days ago and they continue in this with this formation with this appearance for 60 days for about two months and after that fruits will begin developing and with the development of the fruit we can say that we have to protect this fruit. So we are going to pack this fruit just after 60 days of the pollination the fruits begin to develop. We can see the spine that they appear to develop to separate one from another and this is the moment of protecting this fruit because now it's fruits and from this time it is possible to have infection with the seed borer the number one insect in the world to source up. So from this phase to when fruits it be the size the seed borer can attack. So we have to protect at this phase because if you protect when fruit is large one it will not work it will not avoid the problem. So I put the fruit one or two fruits together. I protect it with this protection with this bag. This protection should be kept at least during two more months. Now it is protected in this case means that the pest the seed borer has no capacity of getting into this environment because they are protected with this net with this material. So I will keep this fruit here during two more months at least and after that I take out this protection and the fruit continues developing naturally. The insect is not capable anymore to produce any kind of damage. The seeds do not permit the overposition of the female insect. Now let's talk something about pruning. Pruning is very important in source up production. It is a practice that you have to adopt if you want to get good results, if you want to get better control of diseases and also to help you to pollinate it to protect the fruits with packing and also if you during the moment of spraying against some insect, some diseases it also during the time of harvesting. So the pruning is very important. You have to open the center of the source up tree in order to get some sunlight inside every day and also to permit the circulation of air. So irations should be here. It will reduce the problems of diseases and also will help us to make other practice. For example in this case it was pruned here. This branch was pruned. This also this other branch in the center was also pruned. Here we have other branches that was also pruned because it was growing in this direction. I need to keep it open and after pruning we can do it with a saw. We can do it with a shear. In this case of new shoots that usually appear after pruning we have also to eliminate it. We have to eliminate it in order to avoid having closing again the central part of the canopy. So we can do it every every branch that shoot that tree is growing we have to eliminate it. When we do it once twice or three times after that we can see that it you do not it will not appear new shoots again because you will be reducing its force its strongness over this material. So this is what we have to do. Another thing that we have to understand that every time that this plant is growing in a height for example more than three meters in height or more than 10 feet in height I have to put like this plant here for example when this branch it is very high I should cut it I should cut it I should cut it to avoid growing and closing again with one tree like this in that this height I can make all the practices that this plant will need like pollination sprays packing harvesting and so on. So I have to maintain this saw-saw tree with pruning continuously because it's the way that we can increase yield and we can have fruits of good quality harvesting of saw-saw we can see that one fruit of saw-saw when it is near the moment of harvesting we have to take a look on the spines and the color of the skin to see if it is ready to to be harvested. In this case for example we take a look on the skin you can see some changing the color of the skin and especially when you do that when you cut you take this spine and you force it you see that you broke easily it becomes soft at this stage and also the operation of harvesting should be done with a shear and you have to be a good care so you have to put your shear near the the peduncle near the stalk near the fruit near the fruit and cut like this way you can cut it this way and the stalk should remain on the branch because it's important because in this zone in this site it will continue producing new flowers it's very important to get in one tree like saw-saw to get the site like this one where we can install a flower bud like this one it means that we have produced or harvested one fruit in this site at this region you can see this car with a fruit that you harvested some months ago it means if it is well harvested we can get at this site a lot of new flowers flowers button it is very important because it means that in this during many many years we can produce flowers and fruit at this site and we have to prune to stimulate new sites like this new buds like this one in this position in this position in this position like this one in this position like here it will help us to increase more and more fruits flowers and fruit the following years it will help us in increasing yield and fruit quality traditionally people use both organic matter and also fertilize chemical fertilizers you can use both okay but if you say no i don't want to apply chemical material no problem but you have to apply a lot of organic matter it's very important to apply because there is good response for sasab tree to uh what to apply of organic matter and also you have to consider that when you prune when you prune one tree of the sasab you are we estimate that you are you are putting four to eight tons per egg of leaves and branches because you have that two or three years that the root system goes through this material superficially with very nice results and also when you have opportunity you can use warm compost to be bio fertilizer and so on in this case for example you can see related to to nutrient cycling observer for example in this the sasab tree it was pruned all the leaves and branches should be put together under the canopy under the shade of the canopy but you should not put fruits please never put fruits small one bigger one natural fruits never put fruits in this situation only leaves and branches never fruits why because fruits usually developed untrack noses coletotrico coletotrition is the most important disease that we have in sasab",
