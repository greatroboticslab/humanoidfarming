  "text": "Five years ago we decided to move to the country so we bought 20 acres of forested land, had it cleared, and planted five acres of pasture. After several years of mowing and maintaining the pasture, we decided to try our hand and making some hay. We own this Kubota L30901 Compact Tractor, but all the other equipment was borrowed from a friend. First we cut the hay with a sickle bar mower, and if you haven't used a sickle bar, it is one of the most satisfying things to mow with. After letting it dry for two days, we raked it and baled it. Now this being our first time using this equipment, there was a steep learning curve, especially with the baler, and I actually got the very first bales stuck in the baler and had to pry it out. But after that, things went pretty smooth, and after a couple hours we had 100 bales of hay ready to be picked up.",
