  "text": "I have learned a few things in those two years of potre farming and the first one is if you want to succeed in your farm be there most of the time try to do your work like feeding your bats so that they can also be able to recognize you. When I started this venture most of the time I never used to be in the farm if I'm getting time to look for my chickens I didn't have time so they could get safe and maybe die and stay for some days in the coop without my knowledge. So if you want to succeed in your potre business being present in your farm can really help so much and stop being a fun-call farmer because worst things can happen in your farm without your knowledge and this really helped me to grow my farm so try to commit yourself with the farm to be able to achieve your goals. Most of the times I feed my chickens so that I can be able to feed them the collect ratio and be able to know whether there is any problem like a disease and being present is the only way you can be in a position to learn your business smoothly. I also realized that water is so essential in lacing of chickens and now I supply them with clean water always and I also learned that it is better for a chicken to go without food than drinking water. I also learned that you should have a business plan for your chicken farming and this includes like your goals, your target market. I learned that when you are starting any business you must have a goal now like this one for chicken farming you must have a goal whether the chickens you are raising are for consumption or for business and also your target what you are targeting and you are targeting how many chickens or how many trees or vex you are expecting. You should ask yourself these questions before you start your venture because without a plan it is very very likely for you to close your business. Do not start a business without considering the market where you will be selling your produce. Most farmers start their venture without even considering the market it is very very important to know your market especially when you are lacing bloirans for meat have a lady market when they are lady you have your own market. If an eggs do your marketing research before your chicken starts laying not to be disappointed and this is a point everybody should know before starting the venture because eggs can stress you if you don't have anywhere to sell them. Also have patience because if I that some farmers who venture into chicken farming want to start making money immediately they start the project my friend let me tell you it is a journey and you should be patient until you start making profits. Most farmers here if they can comment here they cannot test to this. You cannot start today and tomorrow you are waiting to receive profits. You need to wait especially if you have started with the old chicks you have to wait for them to mature to start today and if you have ordered your chicks somewhere you have to wait for them to arrive at your farm. Sometimes we order chicks and they take so long before laching at the farm you need to be patient and at that you'll be able to eat the fruits of your labor and patience is the key. I also learned that you should be ready for the worst especially when the prices of foods are high or the prices of eggs are low be prepared with some capital maybe in case of the time the eggs are mini in the market the eggs take to black market and still the chickens are still feeding and no selling of eggs or selling at a dru away place. You should be prepared to face this challenge and know how to handle it because it can also discourage you especially if you are a beginner like in the month of november and december there are so many challenges of eggs flooding in the market and the prices of foods going up this really can hurt break a farmer who decides to start at the time of challenges so when setting up your farm consider this and be prepared for anyone in the farm also be prepared that any day your farm can have an outbreak of disease and you can lose all your chickens so put tight biosecurity in your farm another lesson I learned is that keeping record is important because you have to have a record of bats you have in your farm or bats who have received also keep records of your eggs record how many trees you have collected in a day also record the broken eggs in order to be able to know when you are making roses or profit another record is the vaccination record so note the vaccination vaccination date now the day you are supposed to vaccinate your bats also have a record on feeds that you buy and the feeds that you are giving to your bats record the expenses on the farm to be able to calculate the profit you are making from the farm make sure your records are clear not waste time doing potter farming with no profits I also learned that you should not copy what someone is doing like you see your neighbor has started chicken farming and you also start and maybe you don't have enough knowledge on how to run your farm you will earn up in curling losses some people they like coping everything if you are a kind of a person you will have a lot of problems because you carry your business as if you are competing with your competitor first you need to have enough knowledge to be able to run your business effectively I had a friend who started chicken farming and the neighbor decided to start also and started with a large number to compete with my friend so due to this that person had failed little knowledge and also to identify and treat the diseases was a problem so the new castle struck the farm and she lost everything so stop copying someone business if you don't know how to learn another thing I have learnt is about vaccination you should vaccinate your bats so that you you can prevent them from diseases I never used to vaccinate my bats I could lose so many bats until the time I came to run the importance of vaccination and that is when I started vaccinating my bats and this is could strike my farm without my knowledge and could sweep all my frogs I was very lucky to know this and nowadays I don't lose so many bats to diseases also I learnt that you should not vaccinate sick bats the last lesson I learnt is that you should start small and grow your farm gradually you should start with the number of bats you can be able to feed without straining and the number you can be able to feed until they start laying some farmers they start with the large numbers and they end up selling them due to lack of capital to buy fields so plan yourself well so that you don't get disappointed on the way in case you want to start with the chicks keep the ones you will be able to raise without stressing yourself that is all what I had for you today and thank you so much for watching hope you have learnt something in case you purpose to start your pottery farm I'm so grateful for your support Adam Mesta from Esther farm and if you are watching this video and you have not subscribed kajde subscribe and remember to join our membership to be part of the family and let us meet in the next video be blessed always",
