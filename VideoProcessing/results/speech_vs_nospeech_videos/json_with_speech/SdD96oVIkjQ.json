The deal sparked global backlash as Monsanto's reputation was marred by controversies over GMOs and glyphosate lawsuits. Bayer inherited over 100,000 lawsuits linked to Monsanto's weed killer Roundup, alleging it caused cancer. Legal costs and reputational damage led to billions in losses and a sharp drop in Bayer's market value. This merger became a cautionary tale that financial synergy can't erase public distrust.",
