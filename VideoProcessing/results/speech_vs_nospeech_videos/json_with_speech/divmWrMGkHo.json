  "text": "Farming is definitely not the most sustainable practice around, and there are ways that it can be improved. First, let's look at what sustainable agriculture even means. Sustainable Agriculture Defined In agriculture, sustainability is a complex topic that is economic, social, and environmental components. Environmental sustainability in agriculture means good stewardship of the natural systems and resources that farms rely on. This involves building and maintaining healthy soil, managing water wisely, minimizing climate pollution and promoting biodiversity. Overall, these practices comprise agroecology, the science of managing farms as ecosystems. Hearing this definition may bring up a lot of questions for you. Is sustainable the same as organic? No, organic and sustainable aren't the same, because current organic standards leave room for some practices that are not optimally sustainable. Also, not all farmers who use sustainable practices qualify for USDA certification for organic status or choose to pursue it. However, certified organic fruits and vegetables are more likely to have been produced more sustainably than conventionally grown produce. So, while choosing organic produce at your grocery store may not necessarily mean that it was grown sustainably, there's a better chance that it was compared to non-organic produce. How can farming methods improve on being more sustainable? Here are some examples of sustainable agricultural practices. The first is rotating crops and planting a variety of crops. This helps create healthier soil and improves pest control. Inner cropping, growing a mix of crops in the same area and complex multi-year crop rotations are two common crop strategies. Next, planting cover crops during off-season times when soils might otherwise be left bare is an effective way to protect and build soil health. This activity prevents erosion, replenishes soil nutrients and restricts weed growth. Another way for agriculture to be more sustainable is to reduce tilling by inserting seeds directly into undisturbed soil, which reduces erosion and improves soil health. Traditional plowing can cause a lot of soil loss. Next, integrated pest management, IPM, includes mechanical and biological controls to keep pest populations under control while minimizing use of pesticides, which contribute to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Finally, adopting agroforestry and adding trees or shrubs to farm operations provide shade and shelter to protect plants, animals and water sources. These are all the ways that agriculture can become a more sustainable practice so that we can ensure we are taking care of our earth instead of depleting it.",
