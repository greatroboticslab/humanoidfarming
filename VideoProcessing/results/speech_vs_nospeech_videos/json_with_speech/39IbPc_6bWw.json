  "text": "Dogs have been by our side for thousands of years, evolving alongside human agriculture. Initially they helped hunt and gather, but as society settled, their roles transformed. Herding breeds, like border collies, emerged to manage livestock efficiently, showcasing intelligence and agility. Terriers were bred for pest control, keeping crops safe from rodents. Guardian dogs, such as great peronese, protect flocks from predators. The bond between farmers and dogs became essential. Their loyalty and skills increased productivity. Today, working dogs continue to play critical roles, adapting to modern farming needs, improving their worth on homesteads across the globe.",
