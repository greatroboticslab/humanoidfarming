  "text": "All right, let's see what we find. We have no idea because we have not checked our bees yet Don't tell the bee police. So we have a brand new set of deep frames that We might have to replace. Oh I need some medium frames in case we have to take some honey out Let me go grab some medium frames and then we'll be good to go Oh You want to go grab those? They're right inside the door of the barn. I had them ready If all eight frames are full of honey, we will just take the entire box off and replace it with these deep But if there's not a lot of honey, then we will only take a little bit of it and replace it with empty frames We've actually never done a honey harvest from a live colony. So this is new to us and We're hoping to get some honey. This is their second year. So there should be it should be full of honey and and I'm hoping that's what I see but We don't know yet because we haven't been in Lives and done an inspection yet. So this is our inspection slash honey harvest if it's available Well, I guess it's safe to say that this is a healthy swarm we caught They are busy busy bees All right, so we added another box to our swarm hive and got A couple of frames of honey from the other two hives each We didn't want to take it all so we just took a little just a sample So we're gonna have some honey crushing and tasting Mmm Are you guys picking strawberries? Beautiful ripe organic strawberries. How many have you eaten daddy? We just got here it's probably gonna have more than three Oh more mama make sure it's red not white. Nope. Nope. Nope not the white one Gotta pick solid red Daddy you teach him a little bit stronger I already told him but I think he needs reinforcement Not the white one. There's plenty of red ones. Are you just eating them instead of picking? You trying to get Odin to come? I mean you trying to get Liam to come? Hey, can I see your fingers? You got a lot of strawberries today, didn't you? Mine looked like that too Yeah In your face So much strawberries. Let me see you Look at your chin Smile for the camera I have lots of strawberries. Yeah, you do my hands are red. Yeah, mine do All right, come on when you're so obsessed with strawberries that you buy I absolutely I absolutely love the diversity of our instead You're doing You pushing me while I'm trying to fill All right, I decided to pull Some garlic heads to see because Everybody is having to pull their garlic early here in Georgia And sure enough So are we So I'm gonna go ahead and Probably pull all of it. I might leave some But I'm gonna evaluate as I go if I see one that looks like it's gonna be tiny. I might not pull it out Yeah, go put them with the garlic We decided to get a couple of these extra large onions to cure As well. So we're gonna put our garlic and our onions to dry in the sun And then we'll hang them up To stay dry Watch your step Oh, you're coming close to the corner of that All right Put them up here You want you need some help? Yeah, you do one at a time. Oh, okay Yeah, you're gonna do that one. Yeah Oh big boy big helper. Thank you So we had a very strange winter Which is the growing season for garlic. So the garlic has had a very abnormal Year for growing and it looks abnormal We've got some that are huge and already trying to sprout and grow new heads And we got some that didn't even divide into heads that are still really small Well, that one's divided. Yeah, that one's dividing But garlic goes through like an onion stage where it's just layers Before it starts to clove off Like you can tell this bump right here is in clove forming on the outside Obviously this one is doing the same But you just never know what to expect with your growing season How it's going to affect the crops You just have to go with it and for me. I decided it was worth Pulling it all the garlic and having that bed for something else to be planted into The guinea have taken quite an interest In the bunny Champ has a new outdoor Cage so that he can have more space and more breathe We might still put him in our more protected location At night, but he lacks it out here The American breasts are doing very well. They are upgraded to the chicken tractor And it looks like we have a good hen to brew ratio So we'll be Confirming that as things get further along but right now it looks like we have a couple of rues and a couple of hens so that's Enough to start breeding them You got it open? All right, put that one in there Perfect now zip it close So easy a three-year-old can do it We're going to use this to dry some of our herbs for teas and medicines",
