  "text": "Good morning everybody. How you doing today? My name is Andrew. I'm Daniel. I'm Lauren. I'm pop-pop. I'm Cali. And we're some of the veggie boys. And girls. And we'd like to thank you for stopping by. If you're new around here Please consider subscribing because we can grow a lot of stuff on the farm But one thing we can't grow is this channel without your help. We'd also like to give a big thank you to Thrive Market for sponsoring today's video We had no eggs in the farm market so we quickly got one and two full boxes Graded Welcome back everyone. It's so nice to have you with us today As you can see we are currently out in the fields My dad and Daniel are working on bringing some equipment back because we've got some planting to do We have reached the time of the year where we're basically full throttle into planting time We've been working on getting so many different things planted We've been working on planting some corn some peas green beans a little bit of pumpkins watermelon Canaloupe right here we have some eggplant and peppers lots of peppers I mean like lots of peppers and today we're gonna be changing it up just a little bit because we're getting started on Planting our tomato crop now we do multiple plantings of tomatoes But what you see in front of us all this blank canvas is soon gonna be painted with tomatoes that we're gonna be putting in the soil Now personally I am pretty excited about this Harvesting tomatoes is one of my favorite jobs and getting them put in the soil today That means I'm one step closer to that goal Before we get started with planting tomatoes today I have to show you guys something that had just recently showed up on our doorstep It was in order from Thrive Market What's cool is our order that we got arrived in one of these boxes Thrive Market box And it was completely covered with packing materials to make sure that everything was delivered safely I mean I ordered some of these chips and I like about these chips that got a short list of ingredients I ordered these chips and it doesn't sound like any of them are really crumbled up real bad. That's good That's very good behind me are a few of the things that we ordered we ended up ordering a few things for the kids think over here I ordered some of these mangoes sometimes mangoes have like all these extra ingredients in them that they don't need and my daughter Callie loves mangoes I was able to get the kids some squeezable pops I also got some protein bars for the wife and I little known fact been losing a little weight kind of proud of myself and Thrive Market's also been helping me with that one of the things that's really really cool about Thrive Market Is it works with so many different diets? I think it's like to up to 90 different dietary needs that they could help you with If you're looking to eat more high protein, which I was they were able to help with that if you're looking to eat a little less sugar They also could help with that so what's really cool is Thrive Market wanted to work with us here on the farm They saw a lot of the stuff that they raised They saw they've seen a lot of our ideas and not only did they want to work with us They wanted to work with you my audience so what's really cool is on your first order They're actually gonna give you 30% off and they're even gonna be offering a free gift So what we're gonna do is have a link down in the description and you're gonna visit thrive market com Slash the veggie boys and that's where you're gonna be able to place your order once again I just want to give a big shout out to Thrive Market for sponsoring us today And let's get back to planting those tomatoes as you saw right away this morning. We loaded a mess of tomatoes here onto the wagon We've got some plum tomatoes. We've got a few different varieties of round However to get our day started off. We are planning a few unique varieties We have a few heirlooms that we're putting on to the planner and we also have a few cherry and grape tomatoes right here We have some chocolate cherry tomatoes. We have some brandy wine up here on top. We have mr. Stripe What else we have here? We have some Amish paste tomatoes We got some sweet 100 cherry. We got some yellow cherry and I believe yeah I look here and we got some orange cherry and some Juliet tomatoes, which those are like a large cherry Once we finish off planting all these different unique varieties We're gonna be moving on to our first planning of round tomatoes now I've got a few different varieties here, but to get started off. We're gonna be trans planting primo red We had an entire wagon full of tomatoes and we still forgot a variety So Daniel just ran back with the side by side to grab that while Daniel's gone. We're gonna get our planter put into place A lot sunnier out today. Sure is beautiful. You know we call a day like this. Hey drying weather Did you find them? Oh? You found them look at that? We got a lot of varieties on here today. You know that Daniel I'm just so happy we get to work together today. It's like the last couple days isn't it great? I Love you So the first thing we're gonna be transplanting to start off the day is our sweet orange cherry We actually didn't have any of these set aside for ourselves. So um, we borrowed some of the large ones from the park Slow it down. Paul. I'm gonna plant these large cherry tomatoes. I don't want to break them We already finished off the orange sweet cherry. So now we're transplanting some red grape We're gonna be flying through these early varieties pretty quickly and after we finish off these red grape We're gonna be moving over to the large cherry variety called Juliet. Who has those you got those? Oh Daniel's gonna be planting those. Plants Daniel was just putting in the soil. Those were our sweet 100s. We had some yellow cherry that we're going in We also had the Juliet and now I've got chocolate cherry Alright you can put more. We don't know what this tomato is. We just know it's an heirloom that we're putting in right now The tomatoes I'm putting in right now. These are called Amish paste. So these are really good for sauce Mr. Stripey tomatoes changing it up Daniel has a pack of Cherokee purple So a lot of these are heirloom varieties that we're planting right now and some people ask why we don't plant a lot of heirloom varieties and in truth be told a lot of the tomatoes that we sell are for sauce and A lot of people that buy these heirloom tomatoes. They don't end up using them for sauce Although they can be really good for sauce the round varieties that we raise are very very popular for sauce Oh, and that's everything when it comes to the smaller varieties now. We're moving on to the round We go a little faster dad. That's one row of tomatoes down and many many more to go So Daniel of everything that we've been transplanting so far. What's been your favorite? Why is it tomatoes? You go faster you get a little breeze I will say it's cool to see it going so fast right now It is cool to see the amount of peppers that we get transplanted down to the soil But just you move so much faster you cover more ground when you're doing tomatoes Even though you're putting less plants into the soil It still feels like you're doing a lot because you're moving through the field so quickly I can't tell you how I know the difference Lightning speed We just got finished off with the primo red tomatoes and now we have moved on to red deuce Red deuce is a very popular variety that we planted for a few years now And the interesting thing is every single one of these tomato varieties that we're putting in the soil They mature at different rates So some of these tomatoes are gonna ripen up a little quicker than others That's something that's very important to keep in mind because when we come out here and we start harvesting We know which variety to start picking on so one variety will start ripening up a little sooner And then the other varieties will follow suit. We basically have an entire row and a half of primo red We're hoping to get the same thing out of the red deuce and then the following round variety If we can get two rows out of that that's gonna be really good for us all together We want four to four and a half rows of round tomatoes to start off our beginning planting There's quite a bit of space here, but if we can get it filled up with tomatoes pretty quickly That'll be nice on one of the previous videos I had uploaded where we were doing some transplanting a few people were asking if we keep these old plastic trays And the answer is yes, we do keep them. The only problem is after you keep them for a few years They really start to break down this tray over here. This one's probably about four to five years old We've been using it every year and we're gonna have to retire this one because it is Falling apart as we use it here. Maybe we get one more year out of it, but this thing Is very flimsy and we don't want to lose any tomatoes just because we're being careless We're all loaded up and ready to start planting again Sometimes the trays can be a little fuller than others So there are moments where I have to let Daniel plant by himself and he has to let me plant by myself We try and keep everything as even as possible Even though the next variety that we're gonna be planting is also around tomato We like to make sure that everything is exactly where we need it to be and a reason for that is because we like to know Which planting does better? Under the circumstances that it has that year. So if we have a dry year, it'd be important to know which Particular planning did really well not that we can predict if we're gonna have a dry year or not or a wet year But it's just nice to know in future So if we do need to sell one of those plantings to somebody who has a drier climate, we can do that Oh Daniel, we've got someone out here watching us. Oh my goodness. Look who it is. It's my wife and the kids Hey Lily. Hey Ronnie. Hey mommy. You out for a stroll? Alrighty that looks pretty good. Go have fun. I bet you Lily can plant fast I don't think Lily can plant faster than me right now, but give her a couple of years Maybe a couple months. She'd be probably going as fast as you Daniel We just got our entire variety of red-dose tomatoes put into the soil now We're on to our last variety of round. This is Biltmore if you've been following the channel for any amount of time You'll know Biltmore. It's one of our favorite varieties. We have over here. Hi, buddy You need a little hat? You guys riding on the side by side It's snack time, huh? Yeah. Yeah, having a snack out in the field doesn't get much better than that Ronnie wants to get out He probably wants to go on the trans planner. The other day we had him out here He was sitting in the tractor a little bit sitting in the trans plant. He loves he loves being out in the fields Lauren just told me she saw two deer. You you chased him out over there, right? Yeah, that's over by her broccoli You chased him away, right? I guess so. That's one of the coolest things ever getting some tomatoes planted Every little family come out and see a Cali's at home. She was making cookies with Grammy this morning Do you believe that? I shouldn't say she was home. She's at the farm. That's home the farmer's home But yeah, she was making cookies with Grammy We've only got a few more trays of round tomatoes and then the rest is all plum Well, we're trying to get some work done and this guy parked right in the way I was supposed to get those next rows planted. I Was just thinking the same thing. Oh my goodness and guess what? We're probably in your way No, it's okay. Oh Now I feel bad. You're not in our way Joel. That's my brother. That's my cousin This guy's hanging out on my arm. I don't know where this spider came from but I don't want him there for much longer Spider-man Joel was just rolling up with the rake. How much of the hay did you get rake last night? Quite a decent amount, right? Yeah, so Daniel flipped everything in he did about 40 acres and now Joel is coming through and he's flipping everything out Hopefully we'll be able to get some of our hate bailed today And then we'll get started working on Joel's hay either tomorrow or the day after we have about a hundred acres of hay that we end Up bailing I think we're able to get like 80 acres down We had a little bit of trouble with our disk mine, but very soon We'll be able to get all that done, but that's enough talk about hey, we're planting tomatoes right now Give me some tomato talk Daniel Tomatoes wherever they're from They started feeding them to the poor Yeah, they thought tomatoes were poisonous They're up in the mountains eating tomatoes and like the same that bad and then the royalty started eating tomatoes Wild and now you got us eating tomatoes. Look at that This is simple farmers out here planting and eating tomatoes pretty large update We just got our first planting of round tomatoes all into the soil and now we're moving on to our plum tomatoes It's very difficult to tell the difference between the plum and round tomatoes just by looking at the plants But that's why we tag everything because if we didn't tag We'd have one crazy field to pick and that would get Matthew all fired up right Matthew used to hate when you get everything mixed up Out the field like it's not that big of a deal, but now I see where he's coming from I hate it too I like when everything is kind of near each other. So when we are harvesting we don't have to run all over the field Looking for stuff. It's just all right together Oh that guy over there raking the hay. I think I know him Joel you're being noisy We just got our first row that is just fully plum tomatoes put into the soil We're gonna hope to get two more we were playing a plum variety called Mariana and now we're moving on to a variety called Shelby Yeah, see these this tray is old this turn apart. I'm coming Daniel. He already got started by himself There is a little difference between planting the Mariana and a Shelby These Shelby are a lot smaller than the Mariana where these got planted a little bit later on It wasn't too too late for our first planting. They're just a little bit smaller It doesn't really matter because as we move into the time of the year that we're getting to we're gonna have longer days We're gonna have more sunlight and that equates to more growing hours Sometimes getting stuff planted earlier on it'll make you feel good But it doesn't mean it's gonna be ready any sooner than some stuff that you would plant later a lot of times It depends on if you've got sunny bright weather and if your ground temperature is nice and warm because if your ground temperature Is cold well things are gonna be running into a little bit of transplant shock when you put it into the soil a lot of times Your trays because they're not in the ground They will just adapt to whatever the like current air temperature is so these plants for example They've been sitting around 70 you know 65 70 But once you move into the soil the soil can get pretty cold at night And that's where a lot of this black milk mulch comes into play because it helps to warm up that bed and kind of Gives these plants a little better opportunity to start growing now one thing I will say because we're having more growing hours We're having more growing light. It's really gonna help out these plants in the next coming weeks We're gonna have some really warm temperatures with some rain So that's only gonna help these tomatoes to get rooted and grow like crazy. I got the last plant right here I would one whole extra. That's okay There you go Starting right here We got all these rows to the left of it all planted with tomatoes today Wow, what a good feeling I'm surprised that we were actually able to get our whole first planting of tomatoes put into the soil today Now the thing that's gonna be interesting is we're gonna have extra planting So we got some space here for tomatoes But it looks like we're gonna have to lay some more mulch for peppers Which isn't really a problem because I think we're gonna have to lay mulch for our last planting of cucurbits too But as of right now I'd say we've had a successful day so far getting all this stuff planted Makes you feel good. Let's see what we're having for lunch It looks like we're having tacos for lunch today taco Tuesday, and it's not a rhubarb pie. Oh my goodness Once we got all finished with lunch I got this tractor unhooked from our waterwheel transplanter and we've now got it hooked to the cultivator Daniel has got the round baler hooked up. He's been working with the round baler. Yeah, we're already getting started with hate today We were worried it wasn't gonna dry out enough But the weather is like perfect for it and Joel is still out there raking now dad is coming back with me just to make sure This is all set up for the coal crops, but then after that I think he's gonna go and plant corn So everybody's working on something different and everybody is very busy today Those round bales look pretty good. I'm happy with that Update for you things seem to be working out pretty well the cultivator is doing a fine job Cultivating is never a sprint. It's a marathon You want to make sure you have some really good coverage near the base of the plant What I'm basically trying to do is just loosen up the soil and disperse any of those weeds that are sitting on top If I can get those weeds underneath that's only gonna benefit us gonna make sure the plants get more moisture and nutrients And those weeds won't be sucking it up The only issue I have is where I'm at right now kind of a pretty nasty wet spot So I'm having to be very careful around the middle of the field But once I get past that wet spot, we're good to go Towards the middle and back where I started of this field it doesn't seem to be too many rocks But as we get closer to this ridge that I'm going over I'm starting to see a lot more It just means there's gonna be more drainage on this side It doesn't look that it had affected our planter at all because all the coal crops seem to be looking great over here But it's something to just keep in mind for when we're rock picking again. Maybe we'll have to go over this hill I'm currently cultivating the coal Robbie and what I've done is I've lifted the cultivator out of the ground quite a bit I don't want to get any dirt on top of where the coal Robbie is forming because it actually causes the coal Robbie to rot And we definitely don't want to have that problem We sell a lot of coal Robbie at the farm and if we don't have enough to satisfy the customers Oh, we're gonna be in trouble So what I'm doing by having the cultivator raise a little bit is throwing just enough soil to get it to basically the base of the plant But not enough to pile it on top of the future coal Robbie So that's the kind of stuff we have to watch out for every vegetable is different Daniel and I while we were working on the transplant or today we were talking about jobs We enjoy doing he had talked about how he likes harvesting corn and hauling corn around loading corn into the bin This is one of my favorite jobs. I told him my favorite job was picking tomatoes, you know That's just I enjoy picking tomatoes, but this is a close second I just love cultivating and I just think of all the good it does for the crops. It makes me feel good We're just about finished with this job So I wanted to take a moment and show you guys what I was really trying to do back here You can see this broccoli behind me. I have a little section here that I did not hit right here where the broccoli plants actually would be We've got tiny weeds Popping up and that's a little bit of a problem as I've stated before that takes a lot of moisture away from The plants that we had actually put here. It also takes a lot of nutrients out of the soil So what we're trying to do is just displace those weeds. We're trying to turn soil on top of them Essentially killing them and what that's gonna do is just make sure that our crops can benefit the most from the nutrients And the water in the soil now I am trying to take some of this soil and throw it up underneath the plant You can see we've been pretty successful in this row and again That's just to prevent the weeds from being right around the base of the crop I think I mean I think I did a really nice job here The stuff looks really really good. The only thing I would actually be concerned about would be the coal Robbie I did come through here with the cultivator and I think I did okay I didn't get any dirt on top of the heads that were forming Looks good right there at the base you can see there's a little coal Robbie's forming very cool all things considered I think it looks really good and I've been happy with the way the coal crops have been growing now The other day dad had went through the potato crop with our new cultivator that we have for potatoes and these also look outstanding These potatoes down here They're gonna take a little bit longer to get ready to harvest But we have a couple early plant things all the way up here at the top You'll notice the size of these plants they look really good But look at the plants that we have up here like almost double some even triple the size of what we've got a little further down the hill That's okay with us. It's just gonna extend the potato harvest. We've got a couple beautiful fields here We got a nice crop of wheat right there right down into our potatoes And then after our potatoes we've got the coal crops and they all look outstanding as well I mean that make a pretty good meal maybe some bread with potatoes and some broccoli cabbage Sounds good to me So what we're gonna do now is just finish out this row that we're working on get this taken back to the farm Find out what the boys are up to I know Daniels bailing. Hey, it's probably making a lot of progress It looks like we had a runaway a runaway right through a wheat field. I had a little change up of jobs I went straight from Cult of Baden to getting this thing hooked up to the wagon and look at this We're harvesting hey, woohoo I just got back to the farm with our first load of bales What we're actually gonna be doing is storing some of these bales in the back here where we feed the cattle So I have a few things on the ground here I need to move But then I don't know how many bales we're gonna be able to fit but we're hoping to get like maybe 20 in here 25 if we're trying to get a little crazy whatever the case We're just gonna try and move some stuff around here make some room for bales and get it filled up Dad is now bringing down his wagon full of hay bales, but I got five hay bales stuffed here into the corner I think we're gonna be able to fit a decent amount We just need to make sure that we have enough room to move cattle from one pen to the other and just That we can get in the back and feed Mama's been working on dinner. We've got some spaghetti in there and then she already had her salad But we're gonna sell it. She's got prepared for you. What a nice girl. What a nice lady. I love my wife. Oh My goodness look over here. What do we have the spaghetti monsters? You eating spaghetti I'm daddy. Yes one last thing. I'd like to mention before we end the video Don't forget you can use our code to get 30% off your first order at Thrive Market And we like to thank you guys so much for watching, but yeah now that I'm home I'm pretty hungry and I'm gonna sit down and eat some spaghetti So since I'm gonna sit down and eat my dinner that means this is where we're in in the video today I'd like to thank everyone for watching and we'll see you next time Bye",
