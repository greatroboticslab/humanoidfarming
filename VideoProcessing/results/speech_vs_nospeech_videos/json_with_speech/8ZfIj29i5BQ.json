  "text": "Shalom Shalom. I am more a a mere writer and I just wanted to do this quick video To show you a little bit of what I'm going to be doing today on my land If you follow Torah culture assembly TCA You would know that we are all about practicality and functionality We want to make sure that we have a understanding of the scriptures according to what our ancestors would have understood the scriptures to be and one of those things is Is is is husbandry? So we're really about getting into the agricultural perspectives of the text and with a practical application, so Just come over here real quick So this compost pile here just started this compost in In like mid-October, so it's only been here about a month So it's a new pile, but we're going to use this compost to help You know provide that that field and that sustenance that our soul needs When it's come when it comes time for for planning What we're going to do today is we're going to relocate this pile To another area of the land because it's a little too close to my home for comfort and plus we're going to use this This portion of the land here. This is what we're going to be tilling today breaking up that soil Getting a lot of this debris and stuff out of here so that we're going to be a Getting this soil ready to plant in the spring one thing that I want to do is I want to get some watermelons here I want to grow some watermelons Seated watermelons. All right, that's one thing that I want to grow here, but I got to get the soil right I got to get the pH right So this is going to come in handy and make sure that soil is rich and fertile and I got some lime I had this soil professionally tested by the county and so they told me the things that my soil was deficient in so I'm using this time I'm doing a dead season To get this soil prepared for for the spring so I got some lime here I got some some compost and some manure and so we're going to be Transporting this over there. We're going to break up this all over here and get everything going It's gonna look real good. So just get this out of the ground. You see some of this Dabry and stuff right here. We just moved on to this property At the beginning of the spring or I'm excuse me So we didn't have a chance to do pretty much anything on this land so far So this particular area here I've tested four areas on the land and this one had this one would be most ready to actually grow food So what we're going to be doing here is like I say clearing this stuff out There's a lot of rocks bricks Here That we're going to be clearing off today I got it's gonna be me My my sons I got some help coming And so we're gonna be clearing out a lot of this this trash that's here to get this all ready for For the for the planting season And so that's what we're gonna be occupied with today. I got my goats out They're roaming around somewhere in the front of the house right now That's what they are. I have two males two female goats like I say it's it's new It's we're in the infancy stages of what we're trying to do here with the homestead But once again, this is what we I got some raised beds down there But we're trying to get this stuff ready and when you really get into the agricultural aspect right there the agrarian aspect of living The scriptures began to come to life and you know you get away from a lot of Religiosity and some of the stuff that's being said in scriptures if you don't have that agrarian background You actually won't even understand it and you can study all the books that you want you can do all this research But it never really makes sense until you actually do it until you're actually getting your hands dirty literally When you get the when you get the animals There are certain aspects of trying to guide these animals and and how that changes a perspective on a text Like I said, I got the goats and since I've been watching them I was able to give my my son's I've had revelations and I was able to pass this down to my son about how The goats begin their behavior change once we brought the female goats in right we brought in the the nanny goats Right and mixed them with the billies and then we start seeing how the Billy goats begin to behave differently. So So a lot of things that when you get into a husbandry that Begins to open your eyes up and allows you to truly understand what the text is trying to convey to you And that's what our goal is at TCA Touriculture assembly is to make sure that we are having a practical Application a practical functional understanding because if you're reading a text all day, that's great But if you can't apply it to your life, it's really not doing you much good on a day-to-day basis, right? So we always talk about this Kingdom building and that's cool, right? But what are you building right here on earth that you're living in right now? So then we want to make sure that we we accomplish that goal and also strive for that Kingdom to come. All right So shout out to Atlanta harvest. They are of course in Atlanta or in the drones row area actually and so I work with those brothers and That's where I really began to get my my first my first hand Contact with with husbandry with with the agriculture in and it really changed me and it really shaped me and And it's continued to shape me as I as I continue my fellowship with Atlanta harvest So make sure if you're in the Atlanta area go ahead and support your people They have a farm there. They got they got or grass fed beef there They got the lamb there in season right now. Of course, they got the crops there support your people Support people who are actually doing real things versus just debating all the time. Let's get practical Let's become functional. Let's do something other than debate all the time and argue about scriptures That a lot of people really don't fully have a grasp on because they still operate in a Western line So that's it for today I Amore a mirror rider and I will see you next time shalom flat tire",
