  "text": "Royal Development and Agricultural Extension department realized that classroom learning or campus learning is not enough for Royal Development graduates in Ethiopia. The department is putting further attempts to strengthen the field-based practical teaching and improve professional competence of its graduates. The needed professional skills can be imparted only when students are exposed to practical teaching and make them stay in village for some time and get exposed to livelihood surroundings and lifestyles of the rural life. There are no substitutes for learning by being part of the real rural life situation. To improve the productivity of the agricultural sector, the country designed the economic strategy called agricultural development led industrialization which has been seen as a long-term strategy to achieve faster growth and economic development. Achieve the desired goals of the country's agriculture, skilled and competent human resource in the field of rural development and agricultural extension is very crucial. Through this effect, the department of Royal Development and Agricultural Extension is strongly working on to produce competent and dynamic graduates. There is no doubt that all these efforts contribute to address the agricultural development policy and food security strategies of the country.",
