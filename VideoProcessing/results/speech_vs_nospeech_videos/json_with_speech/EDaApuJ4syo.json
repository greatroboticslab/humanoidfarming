  "text": "From the very earth that nourishes our crops to the food we eat, agri-food systems are ever more susceptible to mounting global challenges. Further aggravated by climate change, conflicts and pandemics pose a significant threat to global food security and nutrition. In response, nuclear techniques and biotechnologies provide innovative solutions to help us adapt and counter the effects of climate change on agri-food systems. At the forefront of developing, applying and disseminating these technologies and practices is the Joint FAO, IAEA Centre of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture. Through its agriculture and biotechnology laboratories, research is conducted to create solutions that reduce the effects of climate change on food and agriculture, while promoting the adoption of sustainable production methods among member countries. Starting from the groundwork of agriculture, the interaction between soil, water and nutrients in cropping systems is carefully analyzed through the application of isotote and nuclear techniques. This allows to analyze soil erosion and the effects of soil and water conservation practices, allowing for the implementation of tailored solutions to boost the productivity of crop production systems. These solutions are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, enhance crop water efficiency, optimize fertilizer use, improve water management and combat land degradation. To increase crop resilience to the adverse effects of climate change, new crop varieties are developed to adapt to challenging climatic conditions faced by member countries. By applying irradiation technologies, mutations are induced at a higher frequency than natural spontaneous mutations. The resulting crops varieties are carefully bred through selections for traits such as tolerance or resistance to harsh temperatures, drought, pest and diseases. With changing climatic conditions and global trade facilitating the spread of insect pests across borders into new regions, the sterile insect technique SIT allows to induce insect sterility through radiation, offering a solid solution to curb target insect populations. When used in an area wide integrated pest management approach, this technique offers a sustainable means of managing target insect populations while reducing insecticide application. Livestock production and health can be enhanced throughout their entire life cycle, thanks to the application of nuclear and derived techniques. Research into optimizing feed can reduce pasture degradation and mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions associated with animal agriculture. To ensure livestock can withstand changing climatic conditions, animal reproduction and genetics are enhanced through biodiversity characterization. The management of animal and zoonotic diseases is advanced through the application of nuclear and related techniques, helping to develop and transfer animal vaccines, rapid diagnosis solutions for disease prevention, control and eradication. Changing climatic patterns are increasing the uptake of heavy metals, pathogens and mycotoxins in food. To ensure that the food that reaches our tables is safe and authentic, food analytical techniques to detect harmful residues and contaminants in food, to ensure quality are developed and transferred to member countries. These techniques include food irradiation technologies and standards, as well as food testing practices. This comprehensive approach not only reduces the risk of foodborne illnesses, but also addresses invasive pests and food fraud, safeguarding public health and securing market access. Through the peaceful use of nuclear techniques and biotechnologies, the Joint FAO, IAEA Center of Nuclear Techniques in Food and Agriculture, develops and implements green solutions to lessen the impact of climate change and increase food security worldwide.",
