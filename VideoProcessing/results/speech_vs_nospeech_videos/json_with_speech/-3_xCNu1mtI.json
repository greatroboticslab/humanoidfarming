  "text": "Hey everyone, it's Tim from Lone House of Arms, especially in heirloom livestock. Thanks for joining us again today If you have a pasture like we do and you do some bailing We want you to watch this before you do your first cutting. Stay tuned to find out. Alright, so here we are We are in Northwest Indiana and it is the weekend before Memorial Day And we usually like to say we get our first cutting out of the fields no later than Memorial Day weekend and as you can see my orchard grass and my pasture that I'm actually going to Make bails out of we're gonna make round bails out of this here in about a week Or actually within a few days, but you'll notice that it's awfully darn tall and it's all going to seed and some people may tell you that That is not necessarily a good thing to do, especially with your first cutting The reason for that is you can see how stemmy this is this is orchard grass And you can see how stemmy that is it doesn't make necessarily very good. Hey Um, it depends on the animals goats will eat this up pretty good, but That stemmyness makes that hey a little harder and a little less soft So uh while we do appreciate that we have second and third cuttings that'll be nice and soft and be more grassy If you look down here lower, you'll actually see we do have quite a bit of clover and we do have Some alfalfa that's in here as well to add some softness Um But you may ask yourself why do I let it go to seed like this? Why would I allow that stemmyness to go and if you look when I do that you can see the reason why Do you see you probably can see all these little seeds that are coming off of here? And that is exactly why we let this go to seed if you follow me in here a little bit farther and we look closely Anywhere Let's look down right here look on top of this clover and you can see See all these little grains of rice that look like little grains of rice on top of this clover And that is actually grass seed. This works out fantastic I don't know how much you enjoy spending money on seed, but we don't enjoy spending it too much at all So for our first cutting we always allow our orchard grass and our other grasses to actually go to seed That way when our baler comes through and we mow this down. We've got good seed Spread it'll get down pretty well into the Into good soil contact and it will help To ensure that our our pasture is basically over seeded So with that being said just something for you to consider before first cutting Let it go a little bit longer. Let it go a couple extra weeks Let it go to seed and I think you'll notice some pretty substantial returns for your patients This is actually mavis mavis is our New puppy. She is a great Pyrenees and she's going to be protecting our livestock So I guess this is as good a time as ever to introduce her to you But she is out following us around Anyhow that is all I have to say right now about that So thanks for joining us again today and I look forward to seeing you again next time",
