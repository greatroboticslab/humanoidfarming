But a lot of work is done now. Hence no thought research in these areas, And I think farmers can be trained because The farmers would initially be a bit skeptical.

You create big China's use the product, you reduce the population, and it's not only in Rodentia now how this happens, it happens with birds, there are things that can be used. So it's a range of activities that should be done on a farm, and a farmer has to pay attention to it because if not he will always have issues. And he can be train to see the runways of the rat to look at where they come from. And they know it, they see it. It's just to understand how to use what they have to control. So, okay so you all work in Rosu? Yes, okay so where else will that be replicated. We are looking at Region 5, that's in the 5th area. Also we did it on the watermelon the pumpkin and corn farmer. Very important to us will be having a child with a sweet potato farmer because you know there is a serious issue in terms of the rat infestation in sweet potato. So once you can get a sweet potato farmer who is interested, you can transfer the technology to whatever region we feel we can have the child.
