  "text": "All right guys, welcome back to the channel. Hill Creek Outdoors. Let's show you what we got going on today. We'll be working here in the little garden. So here's our little garden area. We have a powered tiller today. We're gonna try, this is my grandpa's. So we're gonna try it out and see how well it does. I mean, normally you would hook up a tiller on the back of a John Deere 1025R or something, but we're gonna try this powered out for folks that don't have the ability to have a tractor and let's see how well this thing does. So we're gonna try it out. So there you go, got it all tilled up. It didn't do too bad. You can see how fine it made it, not bad. The only thing is you gotta worry about that cord. Don't forget to like and subscribe. Until next time here on Hill Creek Outdoors, we'll see ya.",
