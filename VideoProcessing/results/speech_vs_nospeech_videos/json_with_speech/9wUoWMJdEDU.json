  "text": "Antoni Bambale, 27-year-old man, chair 15 memba asociasyenu youth, who have just started their journey in agriculture, growing maize and raring poultry. We asked Bambale what he and his association members expect at the end of the agriculture season, and this was his response. I hope to yield match and to get profit from that activity I am doing. It's a mindset like this that officials say is delaying the transition from subsistence to commercial farming. Changing Bambale and his counterparts' mindset was one of the objectives of a one-day agriculture expo organized by Goal Uganda in partnership with MasterCAD Foundation held in Kasese Town. What needs to be done now is to really do the proper enterprise selection, so that people get the right enterprises and concentrate effort in terms of operations to make sure that all operations are geared at making sure that there is efficient in the system to produce the product that the market will desire. When we still produce products just for the sake of producing without a focus on the market, we are still in the old-fashioned system of subsistence. The expo sought to find solutions to the challenges that may arise from this market-led production like market linkages and access to capital. This is one of the interventions to stimulate demand and to create that relationship with the young people so they can get familiarized with the new technologies and inputs and services available in the market. If we get the youth in input distribution for example, distribution in inputs, we get them into the marketing. There is the formation sharing, they have skills in IT. The agriculture sector contributes only 24% to Uganda's gross domestic production despite employing over 70% of the country's population. Story by Ben Anujambo for the news.",
