  "text": "Chickens were first domesticated around 8,000 years ago in Southeast Asia, likely from the wild red jungle fowl. This early domestication was driven by the need for a reliable source of food, as chickens provided both meat and eggs. Over time, their popularity spread across Asia, influencing cultures and cuisines. By 3,000 BC, evidence shows chickens in China, and they appeared in India by 2,000 BC. European Egyptians also valued chickens, linking them to deities like the goddess Hathor. As trade routes expanded, chickens moved to Europe and the Americas, shaping agricultural practices globally. Today, chickens are among the most widespread domesticated animals, showcasing their rich historical significance.",
