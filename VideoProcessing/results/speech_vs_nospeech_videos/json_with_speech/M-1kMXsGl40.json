  "text": "I'm back in South Korea four years later to visit Mr. Yong-Sang Cho again the inventor of Jadam organic farming. We are at his brand new farm where he has two different setups one that's set up for farm scale agriculture and one that is set up to show off more garden scale growing of food and what's so amazing about Mr. Cho if you are not familiar with his work he's created an organic farming system that's extremely inexpensive for farmers and gardeners to implement where you actually make all of your own inputs so your own inoculants fertilizers even natural pesticides and even your own soap that you can use in your house so he is a genius in my opinion he's invented so many different things and even this house behind me he designed it so today I'm here with Cho Yong-Sang the inventor of Jadam organic farming we're here at his new farm so he's going to take us all around and give us lots of different updates about what he's been working on the last few years so Cho Chep-nyong-nim thank you for letting me come to your farm and showing us what you're working on. Yeah this is a very beautiful place and I love how private it is too you're just all back here by yourself so let's go check out the farm and tell me there's two different sides of your farm here and tell me why did you design it like this? In Korea it's normal just every time they make a new crop they till it right? So you recycle this plant back to the ground? Yes. When you made these beds how did you start the soil? Did you put compost, JMS? What did you do to make the soil fertile in the beginning? And then rock powder? Yes rock phosphate. Yeah. So many people would be concerned about the disease coming but that doesn't happen. Yes. JMS is not a good place to be. Oh yeah? What does he mean? When starting a big field like this and the soil is poor, how much JMS does he recommend? Like should I do like JMS once a week for four weeks before planting like do a lot of microbes in the soil or just one time and plant and go? The drip irrigation he's just water nothing else nothing special. JMS water. JMS water. So that's so cool. That's yeah I mean this is what I believe about farming too. The microbes do everything. How many pounds of peppers are you going to grow this year in this area? It's been very hot and still the blossoms because usually like above 32 it's you know there's no blossom. When did you plant these? Oh wow so yeah they still look really good. The reason why I like to grow it is because it's so simple and simple. You can just do it easily. But what you do elsewhere is to give some kind of nutrition here and put something on it. We don't have anything like that in order to make it complicated. The farmers have a tendency to pursue a little bit of a mysterious thing so it's a little bit difficult to understand. I tried to go as easy as possible. I tried to go as easy as possible. Jesus was affected by my father as I said. I was interested in him. You like the farming Jesus? Father. Jesus drinks well. I love drinking like Jesus. I think he's better. Actually this farm is for only two years. So next year it's going to be taller. Yeah, the soil will be better in two years. This is very important in these times. This is used as a reactionary structure. This is the flower that is spread. It gets a lot of sunlight. Because if you go to other farms, actually the chillies are going just straight. Right. It reminds me of like a peach tree or something. You keep the middle is open for light. That's right. Tell me about how the experiment has been going on all these fruit trees. All the plants have different bugs. The plant has only been planted for two years. But this one has very small bugs. And then the peaches fall into the peaches. And then the carbonate disease is very bad. And then the redness of the peaches. The color is very red. So I'm not good at fruit trees yet. But I'm doing a clinical study on the disease. So farming is very complicated and difficult. Because when I build a bug, it's all I need to do. We run YouTube and Instagram. People who don't know how to farm can ask me why I bought this. Why I'm selling a lot of farmers. But if I actually do farming, I'm sure I'll see a lot of diseases. I'll realize that I'm important to farmers. In fact, there are many things that can be said that the tree can bite itself if it's balanced, balanced, and healthy. But that's not realistic. Right. Because that's what we learned in his book. He's learning from the world. There are many criticism of using land scape fabric. It's good to sit down, but it's almost impossible to see the tree growing. And it's definitely helpful in growing. And it covers it. It covers it, so it's getting better. I'm not going to use this. I'm going to use wood chips, and then I'm going to cover the leaves, and then I'm going to cover the sodas. It's not working at all. It's not working. So I'm going to use the cover to cover it. I think the form of the form of the form is ideal, but it's not helpful to the whole family. The Korean sesame has been in the process for almost two months, and the plants have been pulled out. It's too hot to plant it again, so the condition is not good. In addition, the space is the size of the front yard that Americans have in general. And in spring, it's about 50 cm. It's very beautiful and cool. We also used fabric here, but if you don't like fabric, you can do that. In order to do that, you have to come out of the forest to get a fire. People around me are tired of pulling it out and giving up. And now, when you go to America, vegetables are too expensive. And people get sick because of what's wrong. So I'm going to a different article. Learning how to build a small farm and making a farm is a way of making a farm so that the families can be healthy. So I think it's important to prevent the destruction of the farm. And should we go over there? It's only 18 cm. But there are many cases where other people do it very high. I've done the wood and cabbage here, and I've planted carrots, and I think this is enough. Potatoes, too. So don't make it too high or too low. And then same system with this one, this cellar. So it's like a little staple in there. And this one keeps it from going. It's not like this when it's going. And in the case of cucumbers, tomatoes. It's weird to see Americans doing this. They put tomatoes on here, and they wrap them up with a wrap. They also do cucumbers. You can do many things. And that one over there, they also do the eggplant, and the flower. They plant vegetables like this, plant tomatoes, and potatoes. If I work on a whole day of cellar, then I can do 50% of the work. It's very important. And in Korea, there are many foods that are made of salt and soy sauce, so you can eat them all year round, like the water from spring. Like eggplant, pumpkin. We didn't farm in winter, but we had vegetables made in spring and summer, so we can enjoy vegetables all year round. So we have four types of vegetables, and there are small ones, so we can make a variety of models. Does this mean something? We zoomed out. It almost looks like it spells something. But it's not Korean, but what is the... We thought a lot about it, but it's not. We took a drone picture, so we turned on the light here. But it's not a good idea to make this mistake. We put the land scale fabric on the floor, and put it under the roof, and put wood chips on it. If you don't use the fabric, the grass will be very bad. I use you in landscape fabric in Tennessee, and still the weeds come out. Yeah, you're cool. You're all right. Yeah. So now this next section that we're going to talk about here, this is more set up for a full-scale farm, so don't be intimidated by this. But you can have a much smaller, easier system to set up for injecting JMS, like the inoculant or fertilizers or whatever you want into your garden or your farm, of course. There's something called an easy-flow irrigator. That's an example of just a siphon pump that you can just hook up to your hose, and then you can put the JMS in that, and then that will put it out through your irrigation system. But let's hear Yongsong tell us how he designed this, and I also want to ask him how he prevents clogging in his irrigation system, because that's something a lot of farmers have problems with when they do inject inoculants or other fertilizers. So this is your full system for your pesticides and the JMS. So tell me, this looks really cool, just tell me how you designed this and how does it work? The system for the pesticide to be used is good, so that it doesn't get tired. Basically, we have this pesticide-based plant, and it has a similar machine in the U.S. And then that's one you can get it from the United States, too. You use it for natural pesticides. So this line is here, and you have to pass aside in one of these tanks. Passed aside. Passed aside, that one. And this one. JMS. Show you how. And I take this and take the medicine, and it's all here, so it's in the military. So we have four families, and four of us are in the same team. And if you open this, you have a spring cooler. You have a spring cooler and a pesticide, and it's connected. This is the water supply. When you pass the water supply, you open this valve. Oh, we use the belt. Open it. Oh, fresh water. It just runs the fresh water through? Yeah. Yeah, fresh water. Yeah. Yeah. So just after he sprays JMS, does he, at the end, fresh water to clean the line and then leave? Okay. Yeah. So the JMS goes through this filter. Before going. Before going through. That's right. That's why it doesn't stop. Through this. It's all here. The feature of this is that there's no need to clean. It's a lot of work. Because if you open this, the inside of the pump is clean. Right, you flush it. Yeah, okay. It's very easy to clean. So this is what it is. It's a water pressure control. Then it doesn't burst at all. It doesn't stop the line. So you have two filters, two pumps. This is the pump that powers the spray line though, right? These are for the drip irrigation. Two of them. That's water. And he's using the lake water. He's pulling that into this tank. And then. This is the water. Soft water. This is what we do when we make JWA. And we prevent it from bursting in winter. So we open this. We add salt and it doesn't burst. We can also re-serve the salt. Potatoes are expensive. And when they purchase the micro-salt, they get potatoes. Oh, cool. Potatoes are very expensive. But with this, you can save money. We add water at 15 liters per 1kg. When we're in the water. Then we add 15 liters of water. Then it's all gone. Then we put our hands in and we add the water. Then we turn on the fire and boil the water. Then it goes over 60 degrees. It's half transparent. So we put it in here. And then we add to this. Potatoes. And you culture it here? Yes, culture it here. Then we add salt. And of course we need to season it. We add the fire. And then we add more salt. It's not good to use potatoes. But you can use the car. Yeah, maybe from certain countries might need that. Even if you measure the acidity with a retemos test, the acidity doesn't change. Is there any other starchy vegetable? Oh, it's possible. Yeah, it's possible. Like taro or sweet potato. Oh, it's possible. Because all kinds of vegetables are different. So before we go, I have something really exciting that Mr. Cho is working on. He's working on a third edition of the Jadam Organic Farming Book. And this is going to be more than just another edition. I mean, he's rewriting a ton of the book because with all the new research that they've done here at this new farm, there's just a lot of really interesting updates that he has for us that I think is going to revolutionize farming even further than what he's already done in the first book. So, Cho, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for teaching us and showing us and showing us a better way of farming without the use of chemicals and helping us to save money and just grow healthier food. So go check out his book. I'll put a link down below and check out their YouTube channel and their Instagram as well. They put all of their content out in English for us and even some other languages as well. So thank you so much. Thank you. We'll see you again.",
