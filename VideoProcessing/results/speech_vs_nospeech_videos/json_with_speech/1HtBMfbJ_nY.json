  "text": "vegetable sewing dates right throughout the year. Every year I publish a calendar of this and recently I got a question, I try in my calendar cover all the possibilities because I don't want anyone to feel like they've missed a date and then there's no subsequent one and so I list things quite a lot subsequently and that this year actually has caused a bit of confusion and I got a question on Facebook this lady said so you saw your broad beans nine times in the spring like nine different sewings no they'll stop what I meant and it brought it home to me that I in next year's calendar I'm going to do it more of an overall framework but that's what I'm presenting to you in this video it's just anybody could use this as an overview of the many possibilities during the year the key dates for all the different common vegetables for succession sewing for example and why as well just there's always a good reason for why you say when so we're going to start with February. February is still a pretty cold month or here it is at least we're in the oceanic temperate climate zone it's mildish but not warm enough for most used to germinate outside so it's undercover and in fact most of my sewing dates through the year are undercover because it works a lot better if you want to sew outside that's also fine there'll be a few I mentioned specifically which are for sewing outside and you'll would need to sew a bit later normally in the spring at least so mid-february is a good time to start I reckon I've found over the years I've been doing this for a long time now and there's increasing light levels and more chance of warmth undercover from the sun getting stronger so lettuce for example would be the first one to sew in February and then when do you do your next sewing of lettuce so there's two ways you can harvest lettuce you can harvest lettuce leaves and for that I'd recommend subsequent showings in Lake Mayor early June and mid-July and that's it three three lettuce soings to take you through the year outside there's one more you can make in September but that's for undercover cropping then we have lettuce for hearts so you're going to let your lettuce grow and cut the heart that you need to sew more often because once you cut a lettuce heart it's gone and you need subsequent follow-up lettuce to give you continual harvest so you would sew them say now like late February whatever and then next sewing could be April next sewing after that could be early June then a sewing in July maybe one at the end of July so more possibilities there then we have radish so radish is a spring vegetable really it grows best in the spring or a little bit in autumn it doesn't grow so well in the summer you get more pest and disease it's inclined to flower get elongate and get woody so the best dates for sewing radish starting February and then March and April and then I will stop right the way through and do maybe one more sewing in September onions come in two different categories so we've got onions for bulbs and they have one main sewing period which is late winter early spring they grow very well in cold weather so you can start start them undercover now we'll be planting out late March for example and so you can sew them through February you could still be sewing them in March but I wouldn't sew them any time after that it's possible of a late sewing in late summer to over winter as a small plant if you want to try that onions for salad you can do multi-sewing undercover works really well pretty much until July space them out by six to eight weeks between your sewing so you've got those just a slow progression not too often then we have one or two speciality vegetables a little bit like kohlrabi and fennel and both of those actually flower in the middle of the summer but they grow quite quickly as well so you've got time to sew them like February into early March not too late though and then you can get a harvest like early June or through June before they bulb up and flower sorry when they're balbing then they're going to go to flower and then you can re-sew them in late mid to late July for a harvest in the autumn you've missed out that sewing period in the middle so some of this is about understanding how plants grow and do their flowering as well as growing the bits that we want then also in February we got spinach so that's a very good time to sew it quite early again before it flowers late May June so spinach is February through March but I wouldn't sew it after that don't sew spinach this is true spinach in April May June July even but so you can sew it again in August you've missed the flowering time then and you'll get nice spinach to eat through the autumn winter and even possibly into the following spring if it survives the winter then we have the legumes so peas and broad beans some broad beans over winter you've got an option maybe to sew them in November but main sewing time for broad beans is late winter early spring because they grow best and crop best in late spring early summer you can in theory sew broad beans in the summer but the results when I've tried it and others too had not been that brilliant so you know you'll you'll hear sometimes advice yeah you can sew broad beans in the summer yeah you can but is it worth it yeah so there's this kind of thing to bear in mind as well you can plant potatoes in the summer too but I don't think it's worth it personally you get a few new potatoes so then we have peas which is very similar to broad beans but I actually sew my peas more in March and in February I sew peas for shoots so February's a good time so peas that you want the leafy bit the very sweet shoots that they grow you can do fantastic sewings multi-sewinged beetroot undercover in February also in March and in April and I would stop at that point and then you've got your early beetroot and then you can do a second sewing anytime through June into early July and that will give you nice beetroots for autumn eating and also for winter harvest two more good sewings in February are one is the large brassica family so you've got options for cabbage cabbage is interesting because you've got different types of cabbage and the kind of cabbage you sow in spring will be cabbage for early summer cropping and they could be pointy or round sew them February through March and then have a pause before you sew in May the cabbages for autumn cropping like lovely red and pointy cabbage for sauerkraut and that kind of thing then in July you can sow savoy cabbages and hardy cabbages to overwinter and the fourth option is late August early September so just early autumn sewing cabbages which are going to overwinter a small plants and crop in the spring then we have broccoli which in Europe we call calabrese for summer cropping the lovely big green domes then you've got the overwintering purple sprouting broccoli that one I recommend so in June the calabrese types you can sow any month in the spring right up to June even to early July and that will be for cropping through the year but not so much to overwinter and then you've got cauliflower so cauliflower is again read the small print which type you're growing so you know when it's going to head up but that can be sown you can start again mid-February and I actually then don't sew it again until June for autumn cropping and that's my call but you know that's an idea of the the possibilities you've got there and even in July you can sow for overwintering cauliflower to crop the next spring maybe and then you've got the heat loving plants like chili pepper aubergine you can sow them I recommend sow them towards the end of February there's no rush but they do grow slowly so giving them more time helps you could also sow them in March but whatever you do just give them warmth to to get them going and I wouldn't sow beyond the end of March as we come into March the options expand you can still sow any of the things I've mentioned for February sowing still possible to sow right the way through March it depends a bit where you are and when you want to be harvesting you've got additions now that start to happen such as well tomatoes is the big one and I know some people say to sow tomatoes in February I find that 10th of March actually to be precise works really well here it's actually in order not to have too big a plant before the ground is ready and the conditions are ready so work out when you think you can be planting tomatoes whether it's undercover or outside and so six to eight weeks before that is is a reasonable rule of thumb that you can keep them warm a little bit peas so I've mentioned pea shoots peas for pods grow very far from the bottom of the very fast from sowing and I reckon early March is a good time because then you'll be planting them out towards the end of March when the ground is starting to warm up the days are getting long really got good chance that you know the peas make a big plant often and it's worth giving them that little bit of extra warmth to sow them in March not February also in March we got the first outdoor sowing so that's carrots and parsnips which you can sow them undercover but if you chance plant a tap-rooted vegetable the vegetable we want a tap root off they probably force there are ways of doing but generally speaking I find it more straightforward I recommend that you sow them outside starting from the middle of March or towards the equinox is a good time equinox is a good time for first outdoor sowing and planting in climates like this celery and celeriac so why not so them if every week can so you can so celery in February for planting undercover but they're both a little bit warmth loving and if celeriac of it has too much cold weather on it after sowing as a small plant it risks bolting in the late summer so I reckon mid-March is a good average time for sowing celery and celeriac and then celery you can go on and sow a bit more after that but not and not after the end of May Leeks and basil I often sow at the same time actually around the second week of March and again you could sow leeks for summer and early autumn cropping in February but be careful because the earlier you sow your leeks like the celeriac the more likely it is to have cold weather and that can prompt early bolting so actually my favorite date although I might sow a few leeks in March for sowing leeks is early April and likewise basil you can sow it late March but we're going towards April so there's some overlap in these months now and then we got two bulb plantings if you like so there's onions for sets I've talked about onions from seed which you sow a bit earlier I'd recommend you don't plant your onion sets too early so equinox time again over the years I found that's reliable because if you sow too early they can bolt and potatoes so one can plant potatoes early but again it tastes to hold off of it there's a lovely saying that later sowing is in spring tend to catch up they've got time you know going forwards potatoes grow really fast once it warms up a bit there's no rush to get your potatoes in you could chance a few early potatoes especially if you haven't got much late frosted that's what can really damage them so make sure you know your last frost date and pop your potatoes in no more than four weeks preferably three weeks before your last frost date so here my last frost date just to give you an idea is the middle of May that's on average and so we're risking it if we plant our potatoes here much before the middle of April but I always like to put a few in in late March just hopefully to get an early crop and you know work out ways to protect them from a late frost if it happens as we come into April there are more warmth loving plants I've mentioned basil already and basil you can carry on sowing up until about July but having said that once sowing a basil if you look after the plants that can be enough for the whole year so there's options there a big one that comes along nicely in April is cucumber but not too early I found mid-acreal is a good time for cucumbers that's only four weeks before we plant them undercover like polytunnel greenhouse I'm talking about cucumber for growing undercover if you want to sow cucumber for outside I'd recommend sowing it in early to middle of May in no rush for these warmth loving plants courgettes also the same story really do much better if you sow them not too early so mid-april I would say is first call for courgettes even going towards 20th 25th and 25th of April over the years is the date I've worked at gives best results for squash plants particularly winter squash it means they have enough time we're planting them out here you know the ground is starting to warm up they do like that even if you you've passed your last frost it can still be quite cool and you put warmth loving plants out in cool ground they just sit there and that can even slow them down and you know result in loss of growth in the longer run so that's why it's good to respect the dates don't sow before and if you miss a week well don't worry too much you probably still be all right might even be better sweet corn that's another example you know sweet corn does not like growing cold ground it'll just sit there and look a bit yellow so mid-april is your first sowing date for sweet corn you probably got about a month beyond that there are early and later varieties but you could even sow an early variety and a bit later and it'll just crop more quickly but towards the end of the season then we have chard and leaf beet so I've mentioned true spinach already it's not the same chard and leaf beet are beet basically beet leaves and they do best for sowing middle of April because if you sow them too early they again they bulb so that's one to keep up your sleeve and it also spans out the sowing a bit you know like here I find that the propagating space we haven't got a huge space but it's nearly always full right the way through the year because there's this nice progression going right through and then one I haven't mentioned is melons and actually that really should be the beginning of April because melons take a bit longer to grow and develop as plants than cucumbers do cucumbers I found if you can keep them warm particularly they just grow like a rocket and melons just take a bit longer they're for whatever reason we're going to plant them out at the same time but if you sow your melons in the first week of April that's a really good time and give them as much warmth as you can when it comes to May ironically spring is just really getting underway we're starting to think of autumn and winter more and you could still be sowing cabbage as I mentioned before that you know there's lots of continuing options from the previous months but one new one that I find works really well in May is brussel sprouts and kale actually it's as two brassicas that you could sow at the same time and and look after them in the same way to transplant around the middle of June outside and that's enough time for them to grow big particularly brussel sprouts they need quite a long season but if you sow them too early they can just get enormous before you really need them and you know this is a plant to crop nicely through the winter one more brassica that it's good to sow in May is a root brassica Swedes or Ritterbeggers and again they don't need the whole season they can get too enormous a good date to sow them is right at the end of May so late May early June just one sowing they'll chug away slowly through the summer and autumn and you can harvest them when you want to eat them in the winter and then a big sowing in May is something that I know a lot of people do or try to do in April often not getting great results because it's beans not broad beans that's different plant entirely so French beans, pole beans, runner beans, ballotti beans all of those need warmth and so that's why it's good not to sow them too early it's not only about avoiding the frost they positively need warmth you'll just get better results from sowing them that little bit later so here my best date is 10th of May to sow those warmth loving French and climbing beans and you've got from there maybe another two to four weeks of options for the climbing beans which need quite a long time to to climb up and give you the harvest whereas the dwarf beans mature more quickly so you could be sowing them right up to early July even no we come to summer high summer how easy is it to forget to sow something because you're so busy enjoying all those lovely harvest that you've already got but you will be noticing that gaps start to appear in your beds and summer is actually a great time to sow specific vegetables in particularly there's quite a few you can still be sowing again from what I've mentioned before but new ones are for example endive and radicchio and these are great leaves for slightly bitter taste but which crop particularly well in the autumn when lettuce is starting to go off the boil a bit and get a small mildew on its leaves so this will be endive that you could either pick outer leaves or that you can wait for heart up if you're going to take endive hearts you'd need to do another sowing or you could do a sowing from mid-June then one in mid-July and one in mid-August maybe chicory is for heads so that's chicory to make radicchio which is what I recommend because then you get the bittersweet leaves of a folding heart they work really well from the first half of July that's a really good time to sow them but not beyond that otherwise they won't have time to make their nice heads and then towards the end of July you can sow Chinese cabbage or even it's the first week of August that way you avoid quite a few of the brassica past that are more common in early summer like philly beetle I still get protection but a good time to sow it is first week of August actually Chinese cabbage for making lovely heads in the autumn and not after that and then also in August having waited all summer to do it even spring I found it doesn't really work to sow salad rocket and mustard and pak choy in the spring because again they're coming right into their flower season and philly beetles pest and everything like that so wait until the first week of August and then generally the first half of August even through August is good month for sowing all those brassica plants for salad and you can have lovely crops through the autumn so you've got about a month of sowing for them now already we're into autumn my goodness how the year flies by radish but there's actually some you can sow late July which is special winter outage and they're more the ones rather like turnips fat turnips you can sow in August as well so there's brassica family come big towards the end of summer into early autumn and the other big sowing in early autumn of brassicas is all of the ones I've already mentioned like rocket and pak choy there's mustards for growing under cover through the winter so if you wait until mid-september even the equinox for sowing brassica salad plants and then you can transplant them in October under cover so that's a very nice option to have at that time here and also lettuce lettuce and endive grow really well under cover through winter they're frost tolerant and if you sow them early September that just gets them in prime position to go nicely through the winter and then there's not so much after that but there are just a couple of plantings I'd recommend this is the garlic I'm experimenting with growing garlic a little bit earlier sowing a bit earlier well when I say sowing you're popping in cloves of garlic keep your own garlic bulbs break them into cloves plant them around the equinox and going into October and you can plant garlic at any point really until February actually then you've got broad beans as I mentioned before they could be sown early November I'd recommend this best date and to help see you through all of this we sell my calendar in digital form you can buy that from my website as well as in paper form and we sell a sowing timeline wall chart that you can hang on the wall it gives you the monthly summary just that overall framework cast your eye over it just so every so often every month you know just be reminded a lot of it is about that trigger and if you want deeper descriptions do have a look at my no dig book which actually although it's called no dig it has a lot back no dig that's a lot about growing vegetables as well and it gives you the description for each vegetable and not only how to grow them but how to save seed and how to store the vegetables",
