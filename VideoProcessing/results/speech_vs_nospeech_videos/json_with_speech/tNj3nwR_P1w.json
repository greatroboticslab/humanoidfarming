Manure and fertilizers are added to soil. Crops grow well if exact amount of manure is added to the soil. Some crops like rice and sugarcane needs lot of water whereas maize and wheat need less water. So the field is supplied with right amount of water and this is called irrigation. The seeds are sown in the soil are sprayed with insecticides and pesticides to protect them from diseases. Using natural or organic manure and biopesticides are good for the environment. The crops are cut and gathered. This is called harvesting. After the crop is harvested the grains are stored in granaries. Unwanted plants called weeds are removed regularly. To prevent animals from grazing the fields fencing must be done.",
