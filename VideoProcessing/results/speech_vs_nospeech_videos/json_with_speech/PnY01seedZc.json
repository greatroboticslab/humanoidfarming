  "text": "In his determination to transform Nassarawa into an agricultural powerhouse, Governor Abdelahi Suley has reaffirmed his administration's unwavering commitment to boosting the sector. He restated this resolve while launching tractors, farm imputes and dispersing checks under the Nassarawa Accresal Hybrid Implementation Support Mission. Lafayette, our correspondent, Meryo Gigi, now reports. Back in the World Bank for the Accresal Initiative, Governor Suley urged beneficiaries to make good use of the support and repay loans as others have done. He reiterated the government's push for sustainable practices through programs like Accresal and NGKirs, while also disclosing the construction of a new road linking Awee Luka government area to Guma in Benway states. Two days ago, I ordered the contract that will now connect Awee and Guma in Benway state. Once that road is completed, that road also is going to be another road that you have seen today for those who have traveled from Aguada to Udegi, because we thought that was an impossible travel to do. But today we went there in less than 25 minutes. So the moment we complete that road, majority of the people coming from Tarawa, from Benway, are now going to be using that road to be coming through Awee and coming all the way here. But the most important thing is that we have taken over that area for development so that we have opened it up for agricultural development and the rest of that. World Bank Accresal Country Lead Dr. Joy Agene commanded Nassarawa's progress, stressing its strong sustainability model. National Coordinator Abdul Hamid Umar encouraged other states to learn from Nassarawa's success. There are three components. The component A is focused on landscape restoration. The component B is focused on community landscape restoration. And the component C is focused on sustainability, supports to institution, strengthening of institution and policies. And I want to hear, stand today and say, we can attest that when it comes to sustainability on sustainability plan, that Nassarawa State is in the lead. We saw your support, your leadership to the extent that the project is really, really taking a good shape. That the communities we saw came, celebrated and were excited. And that's what we call development. That the quality of job we saw can only be lacking to the one in Nassarawa State. Why? Because it's Nassarawa and other states. And it's because we are an engineer. Commissioner for Environment, Princess Margaret Eliyo highlighted the empowerment of community groups through the initiative, while Accresal State Coordinator Napoleon Gilbey revealed that over 5,000 acres of degraded land have been recovered so far. With your excellent foresight and the dedication of all stakeholders, I'm confident that Accresal Project will continue to deliver results that uplift the lives of our people, especially the most vulnerable. Together, we are restoring our land, securing our food system and protecting the future for generations to come. Traditional rulers led by the two mothers, Sam Singh Gamuyari, pledged continued support for the projects. Mary Ujiji reporting for ADBN News.",
