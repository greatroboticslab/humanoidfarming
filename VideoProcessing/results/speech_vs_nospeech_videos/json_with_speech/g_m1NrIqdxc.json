  "text": "Welcome to R&R Technologies. This presentation is on the excursion to a commercial farm. For effective teaching of agricultural science practical to students in secondary schools, it is required that the students should, one, visit a commercial farm and a subsistence farm, then make a list of all the machinery, implements, equipment and tools found there. Two, visit a farm workshop, then list the tools used in the workshop and state the functions of each. Three, go to a nearby farm and identify one disease of a legume plant or of a beverage plant. Name the causal organism of each disease. Four, go to a nearby farm, identify different types of weeds found on the farm. Make a weed album. Your students deserve real-time experience in practical agriculture and organic farming. To booking students for farm excursion to a commercial farm, contact 090 9650 5940 or send email to armand.ec360 at mail.com. Thanks for your time.",
