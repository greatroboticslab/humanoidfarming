  "text": "Homegrown wheat. It's more nutritious than most of the imported cereals here, but it's also more expensive. In the 1970s, Yemen was self-sufficient in wheat, but now it imports over 80 percent of the crop. Local wheat is becoming a scarce commodity here in the old town in Sanaa. The use of domestic wheat has gone down in Yemen. When Yemen's farmers found out that foreign wheat was half the price of domestic wheat, they stopped growing wheat. People prefer what is cheaper. They want to eat so it doesn't matter where the food comes from as long as it's affordable. They say it's not good, but it's good. Bakers pray for peace while they make bread. It's a staple part of the diet here, so demand is constant. Despite the fact that bread prices at this bakery have quadrupled over the last year. The rising cost of importing wheat and rice is forcing up food prices in Yemen, which is why the government wants to reduce its dependence on imports. The government has ordered that the buying price of domestic wheat should be the same as imported wheat. And we have started planting big plots of land and are investing in irrigation and fixing the problem of supplying water from wells, but it will take time. Wheat production will increase, covering a large portion of domestic needs. One of the biggest strains in agriculture here in Yemen is the production of ghat. Most of the population chew the leaves of this plant on a regular basis, and it's a lucrative business for farmers here. Ahmad is one of these farmers. He also goes wheat, but ghat is twice as profitable. So profitable that he has three lookout towers around his farm, which are meant 24 hours a day to guard his valuable shrubs. We grow ghat because its income is much more profitable than other products. If the government paid us a good price for buying corn and wheat, and such products, we'll get rid of ghat and start growing wheat instead. The reason farmers agree more of this malnokotic plant is demand. Consumption of ghat is rising. 70% of the male population choose it on a regular basis. It's embedded in the culture here, but it's also a drain on productivity. And an expensive pastime for a country where over 40% of the population lives on less than $2 a day. The challenge is how to convert this type of activity into a more food activity. So that's the dilemma, food or ghat. What's the choice? The good thing is that it's no longer a taboo. The government is aware of that. The international community is aware of the problem that ghat is causing. Nobody is saying we will stop with eradicated ghat, but we can combine the production of ghat with something else. And this would help to preserve the country's valuable agricultural water supplies over a third of which are used for ghat. The rising cost of importing cereals is putting pressure on Yemen, but encouraging more farmers to swap ghat for food crops will help the country solve its food crisis.",
