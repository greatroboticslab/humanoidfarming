Ya na wia niwha kutesta parasyla Ya na kutesta parasyla ya kutesta mha bumingia kutesta maha. we will call her egg collection. That is another control management practises that is supposed to be carried out during pot Antar production. They are supposed to regularly control to collect the eggs so that you can control the devices of egg eating. Then the perpetual egg eater and the perpetual carnibles are supposed to be debikht. This is the process as I explain the previous lesson of cutting short the egg paulia kwa kwa pagalisha matap special kaiki, iliwezawe kwa katipalisha na kamaingia. Kallen katia jamama hengiwa. Salana hoho hengiwa na kwa hihpe criminals kwa hiu nga kuga? Kwa hiu kwa hihpe criminalisasi? Kwa hiasi na thatgo? We suposs to check so that we can know that this bat is supposed to be called and this is a, this bat is supposed to be left to continue with production. First one is poor growth. Those births which have poor growth should be called out. Then number two is chronic disease. Then number three is old age. Those births which are old of age, they are supposed to be called by selling them. You sell them or you slaughter them because they have less level of production. They normally lay few eggs and also the body weight is also very small. So it is uneconomical because they are feeding a lot but they don't produce a lot of eggs. Then potray vices, that is also the eggs which are, the potray which normally feed on eggs, egg eaters and also the carnivores are supposed to be called out. Then you have the poor layer. How do we know a poor layer and a good layer? How do we differentiate? A poor layer is the one that allowed only one egg in between the bellvig and bone. A good layer should allow two to three fingers. That is it. Then methods used to identify good layer and poor layer. As you can see, the first one is observation of physical trait of the mud. For example, the big, those which have Euro big poor layers and therefore they are supposed to be eliminated. Then we have trap nesting method. In trap nesting method, you can identify which bird is a good and which bird is bad. In trap nesting method, you put a nest where the bird goes to re and upon laying it is trapped there and therefore you mark it. Then you remove it. Then next time another bird is trapped in mud. After several occasions, you will find that there are a few birds which will remain and mark meaning that those birds which will not have any mark meaning that they are all poor layers or they don't have the eggs. Then characteristic of a good layer we have comes in a large, warm wakse and red. Number two, eyes are bright, orange and the bird is very, very alat. Then number three, vent is oval, moist, red and active. Number four, temperament. They are alat and active. Then bigs is pale and six, space between the keel and the pelvic bone or gido should allow two to three fingers. Then broodiness is rare. For those good layers, they rarely come brood. Then we have the space between the pelvic and gido. You can see in the diagram there for a good layer, there is a wider space and for a non-layer, there is a smaller space. And also you can see the finger, one finger, that is for a non-layer. Then we have three fingers for a good layer. Then the three fingers are supposed to fit exactly in between that space. Then we go to the images of Komzen Watus for a good layer. You can see these are good layers. Then we have color of chans. You can see this one. The chans are red for a good layer and those that are yellow is for a poor or non-layer. Then a broody hen. You can see non-broody, the appearance of non-broody and the broody, you can see it in the second image and you can see even in that image we have a broody hen there. Then there is a continuation of good layers. You can see them, the diagrams and we have come to the end of today's lesson and the foreign questions are supposed to be answered by you. Number one, explain any two methods used to identify a good layer and number two, discuss the routine mdiniwe practices in a portray. For reference, you can refer from secondary agriculture students' book and they publish it in the Kenya literature bureau. For more information, you can contact us through the following addresses as well illustrated and displayed for you. Thank you for joining me in today's lesson. Until next lesson, bye-bye.",
