  "text": "Hello viewers, welcome to LMTV, a station where you watch, interact and also learn. Yatita today is Mr. Wanyoike, an agriculture teacher. In today's lesson we inform three lesson nine. The topic is livestock production form. We are on the sub-topic that is routine livestock rearing practices. But in this sub-topic we dealt it from the previous lesson. And we are on the first routine management practices, rearing practices in livestock. And that is feeding, but we are on creep feeding today. On to the lesson objective. By the end of this lesson you should be able to explain, define or explain the first one. You define the following terms that is creep feeding and also discuss creep feeding in lambs. Then term used we have creep feeding. This refer to as rearing, rearing, rearing, rearing from bird up to the weaning time. Then we have weaning. Weaning means the time at which you are supposed to eliminate the milk. You no longer feed them on milk, but you give them on a cabbage and other type of feed such as concentrate and also the rafegis. Then we have the third one. We have the piglet. The piglet is the young one of a pig. The fourth term is kid, that is young one of a goat. And lamb, that is the young one of a sheep. The kidle is the young one of a rabbit. We have during creep feeding, the first feed that you are supposed to provide is the korostram. This is the first milk which is produced by the female upon maturation. And the korostram is rich in water, antibiotics, minnoswats, protein, vitamin A and E and lactose. It means that it is very, very nutritive and therefore it promotes high growth of the young one. And also presence of antibiotics is the one which provides the young one with immunity because the antibodies are there to fight the disease causing micro-organism. Then we have the milk composition. We have the components of the milk in kids' as I have already said, there is water lactose. We can look on milk composition in terms of percentage and you can see that water amount, the content of water in the milk is about 87.7%. Then we have the lactose that is 4.9% and we have the fat also that is about 3.4%. Then we have protein about 3.3% and also we have the minnoswats that is the smallest percentage of about 0.7%. Then we have the whole milk that is the second feed which is supposed to be provided to the young one, to the young lamb. That is the whole milk that is produced by the mammary grub and it contains those composition which we have already discussed and they are meant to provide the animal with the required nutrients for growth and development. Then we have the succulent on week 6. You are supposed to provide succulent and soft cabbage. Those are the young leaves which are very soft and therefore you just train the young lamb to feed on them. Then the young nape grass is an example of a soft cabbage. Then we have leaves of sweet potatoes and also fresh grass should be introduced on week 6 so that you can train it on how to tackle the soft, to tackle and feed on soft cabbage. You introduce the rafish that is when it becomes used in feeding of the soft cabbage, you introduce the cabbage which may be on the after one month you can introduce the rafish so that it can become used to eating hard foods. Then we have come to the end of today's lesson and I will mark the end of this lesson by giving you assignment. The first question is define the following terms as used in livestock production for. The first question is you are supposed to define creep feeding. You define what is creep feeding and the second question you are supposed to define the term winning as already discussed in this top. Then we have the second question is you are supposed to highlight any four types of nutrients found in milk as I have already discussed in the milk composition. So you are supposed to highlight on your state any four types of nutrients which you are supposed to find in milk. Then for reference you can refer from secondary agriculture student book 3 and the publisher is the Kenya Retreatia Buriom. For more information or if you would like to clarify something from us at Enim TV you can reach us through the foreign contacts. The first one you can use the SMS using the number which is well displayed for you. Also you can reach us through YouTube at Enim TV. Then you can reach us also using a Facebook platform at Enim TV. And finally you can use Twitter at Enim TV underscore KE. Thank you for joining me in this lesson. Till next lesson. Goodbye.",
