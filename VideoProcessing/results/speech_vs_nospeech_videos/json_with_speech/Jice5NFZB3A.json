  "text": "Good evening. Welcome to the Private Property Farming Podcast. My name is Mbali Malko and I am your host every Tuesdays and Thursdays. Thank you so much for watching us this evening and we've got another amazing show all about traditional farming methods for crop rotation. So if you're looking for a number of ways to rotate your crop and obviously smart ways at that to ensure that you increase your yields and that you farm just you know using the maximum amount of space that you have in your land and farming efficiently with different crops then I think this show is for you and tonight we are joined by Lofi Smits who is the founder who is pretty much a farmer and founder of the friendly butchery and we're going to talk about crop rotation, traditional farming methods and a bit about his enterprise and how he started and how he's grown his business till date. Lofi thank you so much for joining us. How are you doing? I'm fine, Mbali. It's a pleasure you know to have you and yeah let's get going. Awesome, awesome. So Lofi tell us about your farming journey. When did you start farming? Are you a second, third, fourth generation farmer and give us more insight around the friendly butchery? Yeah it's my father bought the farm around about 89 but I grew up in a farm which is basically next door to the farm that I'm on and I was born there and grew up in the farm so I've been in the farming business for many years and then I started farming in 1996 with the farm from my father and then you know culture type of farm. We had a few very funny years where we had a lot of crop losses due to heat waves during the fly-in of the wheat. I started realizing you know we've got to do something we've got to change our methods and ways of farming and that's when I started doing going from a monoculture I went over to I went and I started doing medics. Medics is clovers where I do the clovers in the one year and the following year I will do the wheat on the specific same land so I went on a rotation and and it's been brilliant. It has been it's been it's been to me because I think about the medics is it's it's nitrogen fixing and and you can carry so many animals on on a hectare I mean I have dormers you know which originate from Elsinburne it's a meat nice mutton and I run I can run four twin dormer hues meaning four hues with twins on a hectare and it's it's just amazing I mean the quality of sheep that comes out of there the within a hundred days I have my lambs marked ready off medics from their mother so you know basically in a hundred days you know and because of that because I was running the sheep such good success you know on the medics I started thinking about myself you know it's it's a place so much for for any end or sheep specifically mutton or lamb you know in the in the supermarkets and it's always been just you know dream of mine to start my own butchery and then two years ago about two and a half years ago I got to the point where I applied for a license and we started the friendly farmer butchery and it's and it's absolutely amazing my wife does all the admin I'm the block man and it's it's just amazing it's just picked up and I've gone with it and I was very fortunate that my my late mother she's from the Karoo area Richmond area where she grew up and always as a kid you know whenever we worked meet I used to go and help her and she showed me a lot and I'm actually using sort of all my recipes and so on this you know from my late mother so you know something something special and I really I it's been it's been a long time coming that I wanted to start a butchery and like I said two and a half years ago we got going and we do deliveries we don't have any on the farm shop where you could come and buy due to security reasons and so on you know and so we do the we do the deliveries we do tap down we do polls where and yeah it's it's been it's been wonderful it really has been good I certainly saw a hell of a change in my soil after going with the medics it's amazing how much life returned to the soil and also with with this change that we made we went into we started doing we got planters where we use the shank so we we try and do minimum disturbance of the soil to try and keep as much moisture as well when we are doing the week here like I said the one year's week the next year we have medics the next year we have wheat again and also do other rotation crops as well I use oats I do a lot of oats and some oats we do for oat hay the other oats you know I'm at the moment I'm actually busy harvesting oats for seed you know for for for the carp around here and and getting a very good yield but it's important to you so there are any wheat kernels in your in your oats so it's it's very important that's what I'm doing oats at the moment also we have now the last four years we've started with um uh regenerative farming where we take our soil and and and we started doing cover crops you know obviously you know my medics is is of such nice quality and it's it's it grows you know in abundance you know a hell of a nicely so that to me is also a cover crop because in the summer and when the medics goes down it goes and lies down my my soil is basically covered you know and and we do we also bring in other cover crops when we do and then we sow it into the land of the best and it owns the same rate so the medics and also come through and and you know leave its burrs and everything and and I'll find it absolutely amazing it was incredible to see it's what has started in its own life how the earthworms came in and started burrowing and I always say to the people whenever I walk they always say look at this look at this earthworm life because those are my plants those are my is what what is you know doing the thing and and I think I personally that's the way I've gone and I'm on a rate of 38 kilograms of nitrogen where people from in right next to me on the old mono culture are going in at about 110 kilograms of nitrogen on their wheat labs you know so I mean that's some is very easy like you know you can just see what you know what lies in it and I'm in fact just finished harvesting my wheat for this year and it was an amazing crop I must I must say that for the last six years we've really had tough times so we've had droughts last year wasn't too bad but we had a bit of of frost you know during the flowering season but last six years was really it was tough but this year was amazing and on on site that's great stop me if I talk too much I mean we want information right and my question then is you know it sounds like you've you know dabbled a bit in a number of different crops you know for the purpose of co-operation and when you're going through these processes as a farmer you know who are the people that you sit down and talk to to assist you to say like who made made you say now you need the specific crop to rotate with weed for example sorry and how did you come about doing that research you know so just in case maybe people in the audience are thinking yes I want to do crop rotation but I don't know what to rotate my crops with so how do you find a good companionship with the kind of crops that you're farming which first of all was wheat so that you could you know rotate and obviously grow your enterprise so at what point did you make that decision and who are the type of people did you liaise with to maybe see if this idea would work or not yeah um yeah in the western coat you know always say in the area that you are farming you know what they do there is a success line and the agricultural the western cap agricultural union that they have a very close to us about 34 kilometers away they've got a farm there where from elsenberg they they do a whole lot of trials you know doing basically canola doing lupin doing oats doing the medics different variety of medics and then the rotational crop and then you have companies like agri-coal and you have barrenberg you know that come and they do it on this on this farm that is that is owned by the the western cap agriculture from elsenberg and and and they all do their little trials there and all different type of trials you know and then what they also do is and it's it's it's um it's called a scottach it's normally in september beginning of september they have a um and the farmers day everybody's interested comes along and we have a look what are the varieties that are doing good what you know what what should you do next year for your area which is which to me that that's that's basically where where you learn a lot of things you know because you can see what happens and i think that's the important thing about it also we have i have a company that i do you know um the guy helps me with my fertilizer and you know what to do inside um i don't know about we minimize our risk you know and i think i think that's the biggest thing of all you must minimize your risk by going in with the least inset but the best outset you know and the best quality and and i think that is very important and quite honest with you i think there's a little bit of a you know if you if you if you see the the quality of weed that we get from from our medic system you know uh we and we specifically i also do um my fertilizer is is um i try and do biological farming with my fertilizer where i use a chicken and and then of course nitrogen and it's all in a little fertilizer little pull little chicken you know manure pull they they do it in a pull form and then we sow but to me that the big disappointment is that as a farmer i don't get because the quality of weed that is doing local farming i think that's but i i think it's something that's that's that's going to happen soon you know where when people are now starting move the quality of weed that they get and has to other weed that has for instance you know had a lot of nitrogen and so on i mean there's just a bit of quality you know so hopefully that's and and also and also we uh you know we we we in die straight for next year you know we're the first so unbelievably high so fortunately you know i'm on my system of farming where i go with the low insects and i just bring my wrist down and and and that i do my friends uh this friend of mine who you know who does my fertilizer and then of course you know we use pesticides we have to uh and then i try and lay away from things like ronda i try i don't always but i try my best you know to to sort of keep that out of my system yeah yeah you know typically traditional farming is uh sorry to interject there typically traditional farming is um you know heavily reliant on pesticides and chemicals and fertilizers and it sounds like you've obviously adopted like a biological approach as you've said do you think that you've seen a significant amount of um operational reduction in terms of the expenses that you would have ordinarily paid for um when if you had gone you know the traditional farming methods now that you've adopted a more of a regenerator farming or biological approach as you put it so do you think that uh with going with a different approach maybe deviating slightly from traditional farming methods to rather care more for your soil do you have you seen a change in your business operational expenses where they have reduced perhaps yeah yeah definitely i mean without a doubt i mean my diesel my you know my fuel account i think has been halved from what it used to be you know and um my fertilizer i mean i used to go in here with you know 60 tons you know full of fertilizer i have one truck of 30 30 tons that comes in and does my and and and it's amazing you know it's you know from from those years to now i would say i think there was a reduction of about close to 40 in usage of of of fuel and fertilizer definitely yeah what do you think from your from your experience causes the shift for farmers to think slightly differently from traditional farming practices is it things that happen in the economy or you know like high fuel prices or high input cost prices or is it because maybe over the years farmers are starting to become uh thinking yes definitely much more long-term to say how do i preserve my soil and therefore how do i find companion plants to to ensure that my soil you know could last generations to come if i'm still you know producing in this one specific farm or piece of land so what do you think causes the farmers to make that shift um you know to to to to to focus a lot more on the production practices is it the economy is it the push from high input costs or is it just do you think that farmers are becoming slightly more conservative rather um um with regards to the environment etc and you know people are starting to just make certain changes yeah i think the the thing that is really hitting home not far is is is the weather you know yeah it's been amazing the last five six years to see what global warming and and i believe in global warming i have experienced it myself yeah we we we have a September month it's very very important that's when just after the weeks fly it and it must sit it's a little it's a little gray you know must get it was set now and and we just haven't had September months we just don't have raining September again yeah you know lately and and i put it down to global warming and global warming has made it that you must absolutely at all costs you must try and preserve as much moisture in the ground as possible that means you don't open it up you don't open it up you must do your as little as possible and i think that together with the cost of of inset costs and everything as really i think um well for me that was my game changer because i i just i just thought to myself i just thought my own eyes that if i wasn't going to make a change i wasn't going to be on the farm for real so that is what i did and i go with the lowest inset as as possible and and i try to make the more just i mean at the end of the day that is what it's about you know making a profit and um yeah and that's what's changed and incidentally you know it really changed my my mind as well i can remember um you know when you when you drive along to the fence you don't on the fence there's there's like a half a meter this side half a meter that side that you you never work there and and everything that grows on next to the fence you know it's always looks lush and if there's a little weak kernel that falls there or a medic it grows with so much power and and why you ever gets disturbed you understand and that is why i say i try and just i don't burn my lands a lot of people still around here they burn the stubble because they're doing the murder culture culture that's why they got to put on like close to 100 kilograms of nitrogen whereas i go i don't burn it at all i don't disturb it because my material must go into my swell and that's the only way that you're going to get your carbon content in the swell and on content in your swell goes up then the penetration of water is so much better for the swell and that's what what what set me go i think all those things together you know yeah yeah my last question for you this evening lofi is you know you've mentioned monoculture right and for anybody listening and thinking wow there's monoculture and there's crop rotation and you're farming wheat you're farming medics you're farming something else in between that all for the purpose of crop rotation is it fair to say that the crop rotation practices and methods become slightly more expensive as opposed to monoculture because in monoculture you're controlling expenses you know year after year you're farming a single crop where you can control your expenses control your input costs whereas crop rotation each crop requires something different and it could be different fertilizers etc so is it true maybe to to think that maybe crop rotation will be slightly more expensive than monoculture or does it not make a difference at all no no not at all especially what i'm doing with my medics you know my clovers what i started in the year 2000 never of my lands because because i let the clover develop the first year the second year it gets wet the third year when it's clover again and you know it comes up naturally in the winter so it's a once off it's a once off thing it's quite expensive the seed because everything comes from Australia you know and so it's quite expensive to start off with one look after your your phosphate that's on which which which you correct in the in the year of the wheat you know where you put your phosphate star and so on and and and if your pH is fine then it's a once off thing and that's just every second year you have this most amazing medics you know that you can either harvest or you can use it for for your animals to graze on oats oats to me is is also a very very nice rotation crop oats have an amazing root system which i think it's it's it's conducive to i think magnesium gets you know put into the swell which takes a lot of the i don't know what the English word is for all the wheat yeah normally you know is amazing it's you know it's just such nice better keep than this is crops which is amazing i like to do the the japanese radish it's it's like a whole radish a huge and it breaks up your soil you know so so if you have compact soil and so on and you do the radish it breaks the swell it is it's it's like a it's like a twine you know that you when you when you plot it's it sort of does the same thing it loosens up your soil that's also very nice and then lupins i i i forgot to tell you about lupins lupins also it's got a nice been roots that also penetrates that soil you know so it loosens the soil and it's also nitrogen fixing you know which you're following yeah you know you can cut back on your nitrogen application to your wheat and uh yeah that's it and what is it what is amazing is there's a lot of things i wish you could see this this sheep on the medic land amazing how the man nice grass that they have on their legs nice thick bone structure and everything it's just to me it's the best thing off the slice breed and and really i i i enjoy being off because then you know your livestock can definitely benefit from it and your butchery can also benefit from it and that's i like the fact that at every process you keep adding certain value into your production and into your agribusiness but thank you so much for your time this evening luffy it was great chatting to you and i just want to say to the audience just uh you know apologies for the um this connection here and there when you was when when when luffy was speaking you know connections not always the greatest at farms but yeah luffy thank you for obviously bringing that wisdom and various crop um advices in terms of rotation and different um crops that one could use obviously um to obviously improve the the the texture of the soil to prove the composition of the soil nitrogen etc so yeah thank you for coming on to the show this evening all the best for your farming as well as well and i hope i hope the rain comes thank you so much okay you need the rain if you miss this conversation we're just speaking to luffy smiths from the friendly farmer butchery um he's a farmer in the western cabern we're speaking about traditional farming methods that one can adopt for the purpose of crop rotation and luffy informed us that he's a weed farmer but also has you know dabbled a bit in medics in clover and also gave us some gems about you know planting radishes to improve your soil and what it is it does to your soil um from farming and all these have obviously created a great impact in his business because he has now reduced his input costs and also we all i think just trying to win it where climate changes where climate change is concerned as farmers so if you miss this conversation you could catch it on the private property youtube channel under the farming podcast playlist if you have any questions please feel free to drop them into the comment section and we'll answer them to the best of our abilities as well um and yeah keep supporting the podcast thank you so much for tuning in this evening i will catch you on thursday at eight o'clock take care",
