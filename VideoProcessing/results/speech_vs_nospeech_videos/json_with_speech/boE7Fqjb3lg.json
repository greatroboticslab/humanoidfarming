  "text": "You don't need a vast lotment to grow veg, you know. If all you've got is a doorstep or the tiniest of patios or balconies you can still grow things to eat. What you need is a large pot like this one. I say large because small ones tend to dry out and if you're away all day at work you'll come home and find your plants completely desiccated. This one here I've planted up with lettuces. They've already started to grow it seems to do it within minutes of being planted. The compost I'm using is good ordinary peat-free multi-purpose. Here's a large pot, good drainage holes in the bottom of course to allow any surplus water to escape. There I put lettuces. Here I'm putting dwarf French beans. You can buy them now in strips like this and when you push them from below out they will come with their little root balls. Now if you really mean you can split these but to be absolutely honest in a pot like this four of these trios put in will give you an absolute welter of beans so use your hand as a trowel, pop it in there like that and just work them all the way around. There's no way that these are going to out-compete one another and some are going to do better than others because if you make sure they never go short of water and on days like this that's quite vital they will romp away and then after about three to four weeks you can start liquid feeding them once or twice a week. Dileague liquid tomato feed will do well. Kept in the sun, kept well watered and just allowed to grow away and do what they want. They'll be picking beans off those in a couple of months. Lovely thing to have in the tiniest space. Of course that's one way of growing them from plants. You can also grow from seed even cheaper. A pot like this with radishes or spring onions just make little drills and our drill is a miniature furrow and this piece of cane pushed along the surface of the soil like this will make furrows in which you can sow your seeds the way I like to sow. It's always to put some in my hand and then sprinkle them almost like salt on your fish and chips you know you used to do when you were poor. Let the seeds settle about half an inch apart these radishes that will give them room to grow. Right the way along those drills and this bare seeds pop back in the packet and then pull the compost with your fingers right the way across I've moistened this before I sow them to make it easier to do but I will along with the French beans give them a really good watering in with a rose a sprinkler on the end to settle them in position and avoid any kind of check particularly with the plants and there you have three large potfuls which will give you lettuces to off beans and radishes it'll take you next time no time to do them and boy will you feel proud when you're picking your first crop.",
