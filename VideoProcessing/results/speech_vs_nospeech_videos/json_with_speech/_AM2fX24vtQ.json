  "text": "Organic farming is a method of agricultural production that emphasizes the use of natural and sustainable practices to cultivate crops and raise livestock. It is based on principles that prioritize environmental conservation, soil fertility, and animal welfare. Organic farmers avoid the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and genetically modified organisms relying instead on techniques that work in harmony with nature. Dear viewer, today we will try to explain in this video how to start organic farming, organic farming methods, advantages, and disadvantages. Organic farming to start, assess the availability of suitable land for organic farming, look for fertile soil, access to water, and proximity to markets. Consider leasing or purchasing land based on your requirements and financial capacity. Ensure that the land has not been treated with prohibited synthetic chemicals for a specific period to meet organic certification standards. Contact the relevant organic certification body or agency in your area to understand the certification process and requirements. Implement organic farming practices that comply with the certification standards from the beginning. Keep detailed records of your farming practices, including crop rotation, pest management, soil amendments, and inputs used. Assess the quality of your soil through soil testing. This will help determine its composition and nutrient levels. Improve soil fertility by incorporating organic matter, such as compost, manure, cover crops, or green manure. Practice crop rotation to prevent soil erosion, control pests, and maintain soil health. Choose crops that are suitable for your region and have market demand. Implement crop rotation practices to manage pests and diseases, maintain soil fertility, and prevent soil-borne pathogens. Diversify your crops to minimize the risk of crop failure and maximize yield potential. Implement integrated pest management practices which combine preventive measures, cultural practices, biological control methods, and organic approved pesticides if necessary. Encourage natural predators and beneficial insects to control pests. Regularly monitor your crops for signs of pests or diseases and take appropriate action. Develop an irrigation plan based on your crops, soil type, and local climate conditions. Optimize water usage through efficient irrigation systems, such as drip irrigation or mulching. Collect rainwater and consider implementing water conservation measures. Harvest your crops at the appropriate stage of maturity to ensure optimal flavor and nutritional value. Handle harvested produce carefully to minimize damage and maintain quality. Follow organic standards for cleaning, storage, and packaging to preserve the organic integrity of your products.",
