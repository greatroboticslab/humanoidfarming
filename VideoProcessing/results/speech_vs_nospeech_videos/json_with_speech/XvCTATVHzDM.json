  "text": "San Timatunog is a 62-year-old single rice farmer growing traditional variety in a hictar farm located at Barangay Bankasay, Hinunangan, Southern Lady. His farm was earlier dug for treasure hunting, but nothing was found. Because of his continuous learning through seminars on sustainable agriculture, he makes his land more productive and sustainable through the application of diversification and organic farming. His burning interests to make things better were simply irresistible. The challenge he faced was his area. It is flat and prone to flooding, high cost and fertilizer and pesticides, drought and unpredictable weather, and proven animal integration in the farm. As a solution, he started container gardening as climate change adaptation and mitigation, measuring floods. He locally innovates his own tea, formulated organic fertilizer and natural pesticides to improve plant vigor and effective insect repellent. He modified multi-storey crapping by placing container-based tea chai under the trailess of opal. Then, he integrated Korean pig racing into the farming system and used the composted beading of the pigs as organic fertilizer. He worked hard to establish an organic farm. Established a native tilapia pand and learned that a local snail kuhol constitute a nutritious feed for tilapia when mixed with rice bran. The pand water is also used for his farm during dry season. Planting of rotwis and legumes are used as wind breaks and as a source of grain manures. Vermicomposting as a source of organic fertilizer. Recently, the Agricultural Training Institute provide additional support like sprayer, vermicompost facility, free-range native chicken and ducks and cross-site visits to the project's farms with similar under-tikings. With his innovative concept and farming experience, his farm was transferred into bit-size model for all interested farmers willing to learn and adapt. He became a resource person. His income before the technology is 35,000 pesos per year derived from rice farming alone. Now, he earned more than 80,000 pesos per year. Organic farming takes time but with far bigger rewards. Learning doesn't stop when technology is applied. Technology adoption plus actual observations, plus experience, plus well-to-invade equals effective location to good agricultural practices.",
