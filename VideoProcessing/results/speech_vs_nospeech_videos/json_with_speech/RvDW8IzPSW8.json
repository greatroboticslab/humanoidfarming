  "text": "Our distinguished Prime Minister, Srinarendra Modi's visionary leadership has called for natural farming a mass movement. To increase the fertilization capacity of the soil, crop production, pure food and income of the farmers, PM Srinarendra Modi appealed for natural farming. Earth is our mother and we are its sons. This relationship of mother and son has been strengthened by our natural agricultural techniques or local cow-based agriculture. Natural agricultural technique means coordination of natural resources without using any chemicals and external inputs in farming. Experiments displayed that mixing cow urine, jaggery and flour of two pulses or gram flour etc with 10 kg of cow dung gives miraculous results. This is called Jivamrit. Jivamrit the nectar of the earth in natural farming process. Let's understand how Jivamrit is prepared. Required material for Jivamrit preparation. 10 kg cow dung. 8 to 10 liter cow urine. 1.5 to 2 kg jaggery. 1.5 to 2 kg gram flour. 1.5 to 2 kg water. Handful of under tree soil. The method of making Jivamrit from these easily available ingredients is so simple that any farmer can make it on his own. Out of these ingredients, jaggery, gram flour and cow dung can be mixed in either water or cow urine to form a liquid. For preparation, this liquid is stored in a drum and carefully stirred with wooden stick after which it rests in shade for 2 to 3 days. Every morning and evening this mixture is stirred for 2 minutes and Jivamrit is covered with a sack. When this Jivamrit is used with the irrigation process, there is evident increase of bacteria in soil which improves the chemical and biological properties of the soil. Try Jivamrit twice a month or once as per availability at 200 liters per acre with irrigation water. The shade that falls near the fruit trees at noon, 2 to 5 liters of Jivamrit per tree should be poured once or twice in a month in circular motion. This makes the soil healthy and the crops available are equally healthier. Due to this, there is rise in the number of earthworms which are also considered as farmers' friends. There is no need for deep plowing in natural farming. Apart from it, natural farming also increases the level of underground water. With this process, subsidiary crops can also be sown along with the main crops.",
