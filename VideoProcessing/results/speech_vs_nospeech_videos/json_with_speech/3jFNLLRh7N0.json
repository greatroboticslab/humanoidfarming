  "text": "You might not believe it, but in our village, there's an 80-year-old vegetable farmer who has been growing vegetables for many years and he never uses pesticides, yet there isn't a single insect in his garden. Today's I'm going to share his secret with you. First I suggest you activate the plus sign and the heart, to save this formula just in case you need it later. It's something you'll use sooner or later. Here's what he uses. One orange peel soaked in water to treat small flying insects. Point two white vinegar mixed with dish soap to deal with sticky bugs. Point three laundry detergent diluted with water to combat red spiders. Point four boiled Sichuan pepper water to eliminate beetles. Point five chili and garlic water to deal with cabbage worms. Point six Artemisia mugwort boiled in water to prevent ground beetles. But if you learn how to make these six solutions, you won't need pesticides and your garden will be free of pests.
