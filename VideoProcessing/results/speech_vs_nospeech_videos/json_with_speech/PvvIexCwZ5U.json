We don't drink, but it still has mint lime basil Lavender I Wouldn't mind those things and it's a cool little set. So I opened it to see what was inside Donovan wasn't interested in doing this with me As you can hear he's off singing because that's what he would rather do I Mean if it's their recipes, I wouldn't want to just put it out there, but they have some recipes on here Isn't that nice and? We've got you've got three of these for three of these at these There was another one, but it had cilantro and me and my husband are not big fans so Doesn't taste like soap to me or anything. It just It's just a strong flavor when people use it a lot. It's just kind of it's all I taste It's like a cilantro. So I'm kind of Not into it There are instructions in the back of the box. I see I need a table spoon. Be right back. Okay This was sitting in our room with three candles in it because it's meant for candles It was just sitting in our room just collecting dust so I cleaned it off And what I was gonna do was put these in it because then I mean why wouldn't I do that that? Right. I love it when things like this happen I don't know if anyone else has a situation where they have a thing in their house and they need to use it for something and You know what I mean like this just yeah, I had that I've had this for years. I just bought this It just fits. I mean it moves around but still whatever it still fits We need to put this in something else the way they say it Okay When when I look at instructions, I'm very specific with them So sometimes it causes problems with me Overthink things because I see dissolve one growing medium pellet in five tablespoons of water fluff with fork and place into bio cup These are the bio cups. So that means you don't dissolve it in the bio cup Not aware. So I'm gonna have to grab another container in order to dissolve this in order to Be right back. I'm just gonna use them You know what I'm probably just gonna do it because there's no need to talk during this So enjoy some music Okay, so these needs to be on top this one needs to be in there, okay",
