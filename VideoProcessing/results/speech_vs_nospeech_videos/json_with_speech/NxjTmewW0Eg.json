  "text": "Agricultural markets and trade have evolved with our societies, making a difference in people's lives and livelihoods. This year's State of Agricultural Commodity Markets report, SoCo 2020, looks at how local and global agricultural markets can play a role in contributing to growth and sustainable development, while leaving no one behind. Since 1995, trade in food and agriculture has more than doubled. And today, about one third of global agricultural and food exports are traded within global value chains. The rapid spread of COVID-19 posed challenges to food markets everywhere. But global value chains showed their resilience, highlighting the importance of international collaboration and an integrated approach to food systems. Trade moves food from surplus to deficit regions. This helps to promote global food security. It can also help to promote growth and reduce poverty. With appropriate actions and policies, trade can also drive sustainable economic, social and environmental development. Developing countries are increasingly participating in global markets. Their exports make up over a third of global agri-food trade. But at the same time, smallholder farmers in many developing countries cannot access modern markets. Because they lack the information, skills and resources needed to participate, and rural women, remain most at risk of being left behind. Access to markets and global value chains can help farmers to integrate into the economy, providing opportunities for income growth and better livelihoods. SoCo 2020 shows that there are many ways for countries to foster market participation and sustainable development. Digital technologies are revolutionizing how we farm and trade, and can be used to help smallholders overcome many barriers preventing their participation in markets. Inclusive business models such as contract farming allow farmers better access to markets and value chains. A more stable income and encourages the adoption of better practices. Value chains combined with sustainability certification schemes can help to develop markets for food produced sustainably. Public policies and private sector actions can promote the development of global value chains and contribute to growth in agriculture and the food industry. While agricultural markets and trade are an integral part of the global food system, we all have a role to play to ensure they promote sustainable development, securing a better future for everyone.",
