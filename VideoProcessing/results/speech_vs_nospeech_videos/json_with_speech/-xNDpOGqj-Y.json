  "text": "Hello, my name is Ashley. Today I want to teach you how to raise a chicken. I have two chickens over here which is they are really really beautiful animals. They are in my garden of course. That's the easiest way to raise. You see the garden here which is it's really like a country garden. I'm a country girl in the middle of the city. So the chickens it's really good to have it everybody should have because they really lay fresh egg for you every day which those two chickens they lay every day two eggs and I let them they have their own cooks their own place they go at night by themselves and in the morning if you don't like the cake they come out and they wander around in the morning to eat all the insects and everything and besides that when they they're manure I have to tell you that it's a very very good fertilizer and that's how my garden it grows. This is special tree garden with the fruit trees. I don't put grasses the animals they eat the grasses and they give me back fertilizer and they give me food back again. They are very very beautiful animal I think everybody should have it and enjoy it. And this is what they need all. It's a little grain their food a grain bird seeds whatever you put and a dish of water over here and you can put you know bird bird back over here even other birds they can come and enjoy it and eat it. Now you have to see my garden my fruits whatever thanks to the chickens with their fertilizer I raise them and we eat always organic things all kind of fruits and vegetables. Well thank you for watching I hope everybody will get animals or chickens in their house in their garden if they have it's a wonderful thing to have it. Thank you very much for watching bye bye",
