  "text": "Well people ask me why I plant cover crops and there's so many reasons I'll forget half of them. This was a oats field that we harvested roughly the last week of July and right away that night after we harvested we had the drill going. This is a 21-species cover crop mix. Always try to use multiple species of warm season grasses, cool season grasses, warm season broadleafs, cool season broadleafs. Try to have at least a carbon to nitrogen ratio of 25 to 1 or better. I try to do a lot of grasses. I try to have a few plants over winter. This will go to corn next year. We do graze this with cattle but we're trying to lower our inputs on synthetic fertilizers and there's just so many resource concerns that I'm going after. Building soil, organic matter, better water infiltration, cycling nutrients, micro fungi but there's just so many benefits.",
