  "text": "Fertilizing is another essential aspect of growing green onions. These plants require consistent moisture, so make sure to water them regularly. However, be careful not to overwater, as this can lead to rotting. Aim for about one inch of water per week and adjust accordingly based on your climate and soil conditions. Fertilizing green onions is also important for their growth. Use a balanced fertilizer, such as October 10th, 10 or 14, 14, 14, and apply it according to the package instructions. Avoid over-fertilizing, as this can result in excessive leaf growth rather than bulb development. As your green onions grow, it's essential to keep them weed-free. Weeds can compete with the onions for nutrients and water, so regularly remove any unwanted plants from the garden bed.",
