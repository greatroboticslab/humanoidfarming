  "text": "So when I met my industrial investor, he mentioned a very interesting statistic to me. Something I didn't know at the time, even though I worked with flowers and everything else. He told me that in Mexico, less than 5% of the import flowers that come into the United States are grown in Mexico. So if you ask anyone logically, it doesn't make any logical sense. We're so close to the US, we share a 2,000 mile border, there's great climate, low cost of labor and everything else in Mexico. Why don't more people grow flowers in Mexico and export them to the US? And so he just saw that as indicative of the paralysis that involves most low income farmers in Mexico. I found that farmers in Mexico are very... they learn quickly. Even in my personal case with my plants, they don't have soil in them. I remember the farm workers that we hired to oversee the operations there. Well this thing's not going to work. There's no soil. You have to have soil to grow these plants. I was like, no, no, no, that's okay. They'll work, just trust me. You're not going to get fired at the plant's dire. But in a week, they saw that it worked and they learned quickly. So it's not a thing of the people there cannot be taught the skills they need, or they can't learn the skills they need. And they have an innate grasp of how to grow things as well. It's just that going back to the government schemes that are in place, government schemes, here's a bag of corn seed and here's some fertilizer and you're going to go out and grow corn. And that works fine, I guess, but it's just subsistence farming. It's not a real path to long-term employment or any kind of future for these people. And it gets them into a vicious cycle of every month or every year going back to the government to get more help, more subsidies. And so the government needs, I think, to get away from that plan. Say like, you know what, we're not going to give you any more subsidies. But hey, we're going to have these other opportunities which are, instead of you growing corn, why don't you grow another high value crop like my orchids or some other kind of flower or something else. But get some sort of training mechanism to where the farmers feel that they have a choice and they have some sort of safety net because it's difficult sometimes to change. It's just something they've done their whole lives, 30, 40 years. They're like the 20th generation Mexican who's growing corn or how many, because this is part of Mexico's heritage. It's just not profitable to do it. And then the other thing is with NAFTA and the tariffs coming down on corn also, it's made life even more difficult for them in terms of the pricing that they can get for the corn.",
