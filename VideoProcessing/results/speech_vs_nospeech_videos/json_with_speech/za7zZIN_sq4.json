  "text": "Watermelon's one of the coolest crops to grow in the summer and the crop that takes up a lot of space a lot of time A lot of love so let's figure out how to not make these mistakes when you're growing them This watermelon right here, which I have lovingly named Eric because so many of you think my name is Eric and I don't know why that is so comment down below if you know why You think of me as Eric and not Kevin But this guy right here is one of the biggest watermelons I've ever grown because I've never really grown it before because I've never had the space those are you long time epic Gardening followers, you know I used to grow in a small front yard urban garden if I grew a watermelon I mean look how much space this takes up it would have taken up half my whole garden I couldn't have grown almost anything else so I've had success this year We'll see at the end of the video I'm gonna cut this open and we'll see if my money is where my mouth is and this is actually a delicious watermelon But cultivate that like button and I will bless you with abundantly Juicy watermelon and let's get into the video mistake number one that you can make is overwatering Which seems classic, but it's a specific phase of the plants life where you can overwater And it's right about at this point when the watermelon is coming ripe It doesn't need a lot of water at this point kind of counterintuitive But what that can do is once it gets to its final size the size that it's genetic sort of Predeterminate to be it's not going to get much larger And so if you're pumping more water through the plant tissue, it's gonna burst it you don't want that So that's problem number one that can really ruin the watermelon completely But number two is that you can actually dilute the flavor because the more water that's in the tissue the less Concentrated the sugars are which means you have a less sweet watermelon hold up Is this an avocado in my watermelon patch? No, in fact what it is is just simply an un pollinated fruit This happens a lot with different plants that have a male and female flower Sometimes that pollen just doesn't make it from the male to the female So there are two ways that you can deal with this one is manual one is somewhat automatic The manual one is just a hand pollination method All you'll do is grab pollen with a toothbrush or q-tip something like that from a male flower when you see it open and bring it over Manually to the female flower and brush it inside that'll guarantee pollination And then what you can do is what I've done here and just put in some pollinator Attracting plants like these sunflowers are fantastic really so many different plants We have videos on that here on the channel But that'll do it automatically because they're going to be here buzzing away Drinking of the fruit of the sunflower and they will say hey look there's a male flower Let's go ahead and pollinate and job is done mistake number three has to do with disrespecting the watermelons name water Melon water those melons guys you can underwater them. It is certainly possible They are 90% water and it seems obvious that this would be something to avoid Nevertheless what happened to me here in this patch? I underwatered my water melons and they got off to a slow start So there's a couple things that you can do to mitigate this of course Maybe your soil mix is a little bit off you might need to fix that But something that we've done here at epic gardening is we created mounds we watered in a mound So we created like a little hill here and then made a depression and sewed our seeds in that depression And then also mulch the depression So you're kind of creating a volcano with a crater at the top and then you're going to put Five six seven eight nine ten watermelon seeds in here and once they germinate You'll then call it down to about three maybe four and keep that nice and well watered I don't really feel that there's a huge need to mulch the entire patch But I do think mulching the inside of that basin with some straw or some micro bark or something like that Can really help keep these well watered especially early on in their life They need a ton of water to throw out all these vines all these leaves to generate enough energy To create those big honking monsters back there mistake number four What if you actually do get some watermelon fruit, but they are small and tiny like these? Well, these ones are actually a small variety, but in your case it might be that you're letting too many fruit per Viner per plant generally speaking you're gonna want to let maybe two Fruit per plant up to four if they're smaller variety So for this one here I can let four go because they're about I mean honestly They might be just an inch more in diameter than that size at their final size That's totally fine for the one that you saw earlier in the video to per plant on that one Maximum and then another thing that you might be doing is Overcrowding your actual planting so watermelon is a plant that you don't plant one per X feet You usually plant them in a mound like I said two three maybe four I'd say two or three is a good rule of thumb And then you let them all grow right next to each other and then you space them out roughly four to six feet Per mound so it's a perm mound type of planting But a lot of people will plant five six seven and then just let them all grow per mound And they're kind of competing with each other and crowding themselves out mistake number five What happens if you're not even getting any flower and fruit formation in the first place? There's three sort of ways that you can go wrong here first one Which is really common for a beginner gardener is just planting out of season So watermelons are a quintessential summer crop. They want a long season with a really High amount of Sun eight plus hours of Sun per day So quintessential summer crop don't think you can kind of squeeze them by in a shoulder season Probably not gonna work out too well for you another thing is if the temperatures are too low above 70 degrees Fahrenheit ideally even sometimes in the 80s and Low 90s is actually okay for watermelon so they can do completely fine there too second reason is if it's a temperature issue So above 70 degrees Fahrenheit. That's what they really prefer They want to get a little toast to even up above 80 degrees Fahrenheit is totally fine for them The third and final reason you might not be getting fruit is Because you're fertilizing in an incorrect manner specifically if you're pumping too much nitrogen into the soil They do need a lot of nitrogen early on when they're throwing out all this growth that you see sprawling around here But I mean look at this hunker look at Eric here Eric needs a lot of other nutrients that are more conducive to flowering and fruiting like phosphorus and potassium And so if you are doing some fertilizing I would definitely dial your nitrogen back as soon as you start to see or as soon as you start to know that Fruiting and flowering is upon you mistake number six the one you've probably been waiting for how do you know when your delicious? voluptuous juicy Succulent watermelon is actually ready to harvest and you don't harvest it too early. You don't harvest it too late I'm gonna show you three different ways to know the first one is a classic You want to give it a thump a little thump test. This is good if you're in a grocery So let's do it right now Has a bit of a hollow sound the thump test one way to know the second way to know is to look at the difference between the stripes Now this is a different style of watermelon different cultivar The one you see over here is closer to a more classic look when you see it really shiny Then that's a good sign It's not ripe yet when you see it dull and the difference between these tones from dark to light Starts to get a little bit more mellow Then it's a good indicator another way to know is to check what's called the field spot So the watermelon is just sitting like this until you decide to move it And so it's going to develop a different color on the bottom of it like this And so when this starts to turn a little bit more yellow and cream It's kind of there right now That's how you know it's right if it wasn't right this would be more of a pure white color Here's a fourth bonus tip take a look at this watermelon So you've got the stem that's connecting to the fruit You have this little spoon leaf right here, which is all dried up And then you have this tendril right here next to it that is kind of spiraled and wonky when this starts to go full brown That's how you know it's absolutely right. So let's go ahead and do the moment of truth the magical cut Okay The moment of truth is Here Did I make a mistake on this watermelon? Where am I living the dream of dreams by growing my very first massive watermelon probably not the best place to cut this But I don't really care. Let's go in. Oh I'm seeing something I like guys. I'm seeing something. I really like Hold on Are you ready? Are you ready? Oh, yes Look at that Okay, we got a taste test it we got a taste test it here we go Look at the color. Oh, yes. All right Sweetness oh, it's field warm. Mmm. That's so good That's actually and when you grow it yourself, you know, you know cultivate that like button for delicious juicy sweet watermelon I'm gonna do a full guide at some point in the future right now I'm gonna eat this entire thing and then eat that entire thing and then live my best life So I'm gonna leave doing that. I hope you guys enjoyed this video. I just ate a seed Good luck in the garden and keep on growing",
