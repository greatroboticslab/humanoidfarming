  "text": "Millions of people across the developing world are dependent upon agriculture. Horticulture impacts their lives both in terms of nutrition and income, but changing rainfall patterns and poor storage often put crops at risk. Still, technology offers many solutions, and a center here in Bangkok showcases some effective answers that thousands of farmers already adopted, from Thailand to Bangladesh. We are in the field lab of Horticulture Department in Bang Ken campus of Kaseh-Sat University. We have fields to teach students, we have plans to do research, and we also have demonstrations of horticulture equipment and activities. We organize trainings for different people. The easiest is to train the students. Then we do a lot of training of the trainers from all over the countries. We also train farmers. We have trained the people who come to visit our agricultural fair every year. Well, KUBAT is a simple control system that full the air conditioning. It has a small heater to keep heating the temperature sensors of normal air conditioning. Normally, when the temperature gets to a certain point, the thermostat will kick in and stop the power. In order to keep the temperature lower than normal 20 degrees Celsius, we use the cool-bottom to heat the temperature sensor of the air conditioning and fill it. Then we can set it to 10 degrees Celsius or even 1 degree Celsius. I guess more than 50% of the normal commercial home air conditioning unit can be modified using the cool-bottom. I'm familiar with vegetable and seed production. So I think a cool-bottom can be a good choice for small-holder to store their fresh vegetables. And if we apply dehumidifier inside the cool-bottom, it can be a big container to store the seed also. Cool-chain can improve the shelf life of vegetables and produce. Definitely can even double its body quality that we can maintain using the cool-chain. I think it's the most important thing. In Asia, we lose a large percentage of produce through post-service loss. And the loss is not just the quantity loss. The biggest loss is the quality loss, the loss of vitamins and minerals. And then we have the problems of food safety, the contamination. I think when we quantify it, it's really worth it to invest in cool-chain. There are two types of solar dryers. One is the FAO recommended type. And the other one is excellent idea. Solar dryer is produced by Professor Michael Reed from UC Davis. It simply adds chimney to it and it creates airflow that would work very well, especially in Thailand and in the hot humid. Because humidity inside the system can be very high. You need to find a way to vent it out. System is really nice, I believe. You can use wood, you can use bamboo, PVC, whatever you like. So it's really flexible. The solar pump is very simple. It's a 12 volts or 24 volts pump. It can be connected to the solar cells that produce electricity. Or if you want the pumps to work at night, you can install the batteries. Rainfall in the tropics doesn't come every day, but the plants need water every day. So water must be there. The system of the solar power irrigation can be linked to the drip irrigation system. This is one of the best combinations because we know that the drip irrigation saves a lot of water. These technologies, one thing is very much common among them is the low cost and indigenous knowledge. They can be repaired in house, they can be maintained by the local artisans. So this is very good. And the cost is relatively low, lower than their competent alternative products. In the dollar, if you ask a small farmer, will he or she be able to invest? The answer is quite likely yes, because the amount of saving these farmers can make is very good. And that is the decision making point for the farmers in favor of adopting these small technologies. A lot of things can be done with small investment, with innovations in order to help the farmers so that they can live better life.",
