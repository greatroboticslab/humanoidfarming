  "text": "in central Iowa, about halfway between Iowa City and Des Moines. My lead's, four acres of land, I have about two acres in production, in real production. I sell May through December, and my main business is CSA. I used to do it for some farmers markets. I shifted to online, but I call online farms too, so I'm directly through my website. And then I do some online consumer co-ops and increase the number of whole sale. I've been growing for ten years. I also worked for three years on a certified organic farm in Ontario, which is very close to where I now farm. And I'm not currently certified, but I am depending on certified. This season, and I've always been organic, managed, familiar with organic standards, and I've always tried to follow them. Just some pictures of the farm, and this kind of shows. I'm going to talk about the different parts of our farm, how we manage them. We have high tunnels that we manage in a certain way. We have what I would call more intensive market garden style beds that we manage in a certain land. And then we have more, what I might call broad acre plastic culture beds that we use. So those are all parts of our rotation and cropping system. And we'll do the CSA share that we had this past year. So I feel like it's always been the start of a presentation with some explainers about what information I can and can't give you. So this is just what worked on our farm so far. And this system will continue to evolve, but I've seen how much it evolved in the ten years on the farming. And so obviously all systems are so inter-regional over time, and you can obviously just campaign a system on one farm and draft it on your farm. And then you can add the data to your social services and to your personality into lots of different things. And what I found is that even small variations in location and climate and soil type can make huge differences in whether a production system is going to work for you or not. So obviously something that still works in Northern Minnesota may not work in Central Iowa. But even something that works in Northeast Iowa may not work in Central Iowa. So that's don't take any sort of production system and think, well this is it. Because you have to adapt it to your particular circumstances, which are always going to be different. And then this is something that I really got kind of started to learn at this conference. I'm going to talk about that on the next slide. Don't let the perfect beginning be good. So I think with crop rotation, especially early on, I thought I'd have to have a set crop rotation. I'd have to have this figured out right away. And the truth is that most farms do not have their crop rotation figured out, and that they're changing it over time. And that's not a problem. It's that you're slowly moving towards your goals. And so there's always going to be a gap between your plans and your actual living reality. And that's not a problem. That's just normal. And I went to a presentation by Kay Jensen here that was probably 10 years ago around the time I was starting to farm. And she mentioned this idea of the fibonacci spiral. The progress is not linear. We tend to think of progress as being a line before we just move from A to B. But actually, if our goal is to center that spiral, we're kind of spiraling in towards that goal. And so she gave an example of day one when you start your farm, you're not going to necessarily have written, standard operating procedures for your workers. That's not necessarily realistic goal for the first day you start farming, but maybe by like 10 years you might have that. So it's just a good way to think about, especially if you're starting out, that you're not going to have things perfectly set from the start. You're going to have to figure things out as you go. So I feel like it's always good to sort of interrogate the assumptions that we're thinking. Obviously in organic standards you're supposed to rotate crops, so I understand that. But the question is why should we rotate crops? And it's everyone's favorite answer, which is yes and no. Because I think there's circumstances where we don't rotate crops, and there's circumstances where we do. And I think in particular, almost no one rotates crops in high tunnels, even in organic systems. Most organic growers I know are growing tomatoes in their high tunnels every single year, which is not what you're supposed to do, but they're still doing it. And so why does it still work? Well, disease pressure builds up over time, so growers are usually using greenhouse specific, hybrid varieties that are very disease resistant. People are moving into grafting in order to deal with disease pressure. And I've also heard that you can do that for like 10 to 15 years, and then after that point it starts to get more difficult. Or you can start to see depletion in your soil that maybe is not apparent at first. So obviously the most immediate reason why we rotate crops is because of disease and soilborne pest carrier within your year. That's at least on my farm. That's my immediate concern when I'm thinking about where do I put my broccoli this year. It's I don't want to carry over the guat rot from last year's broccoli into this year's broccoli. And I just want to throw out there that I've been exposed to this conference and others about ideas around you can actually prevent disease and pest pressure if you build up the biological activity in your soil and you have to take nutrition for your plants. And I think we're all kind of trying to work towards that. But it's not necessarily a realistic, again it's not a realistic goal from day one to have that be the situation. So we're all still dealing with these and pest problems. And so yes we need to continue to rotate. So I think the reconsideration for crop rotation are our timing. So I think rotating different lead-time gas crops. So is it an early crop? Is it a mid-season crop? Is it a late crop? How far through the season does it go? What kind of window is there for a cover crop before or after that? And how will that influence what you can have there afterwards? So for example, if you have an early crop and then you plant an overwintering cover crop there, you probably don't want to have another early crop there the next year because you're going to have dry or something during a termination spring. So the sequencing of how you sequence cash crops and cover crops and being able to alternate timing is part of what you're thinking about with crop rotation. And then there's obviously the fertility and the soil to reconsideration. So there's the whole schematic of heavy beater, light beater, light yield. So you have certain types of crops that you need to line a nitrogen, certain types of crops that you need to move it to nitrogen and then crops that produce their own nitrogen. And now that's not a realistic quotation for most of us because most of us are way over-representation of the heavy feeders, particularly the other stuff about crops that are always being over-represented in a lot of vegetable crop rotations. So we're obviously not going to grow like people on ounce of each of those, but it's something to think about. I think of another consideration that I like, there's crops that are easy to weed and crops that are hard. So like carrots and onions, our crops are very susceptible to early wheat pressure. So you probably don't want to put those in your weediest field. You may want to think about what was the weed seed load like there last year that I let a lot of weed seed fall on the ground. That last year I probably didn't want to put my carrots there this year versus potatoes. That's an easier crop to control beans in, a little more taller than weeds. So those are things to think about. So this is a map of my farm that we, I think this particular map we actually drew up this past year. And this shows our field system and kind of how our farm is set up and how we rotate through these different fields. So just to show you what's called the short field and what's called the short field south, those are what I call the market garden intensive production type beds. So those are 100 feet long. The beds are four feet to four and a half foot on the center. We tend to manage those by hand generally like in terms of where we do no-tow on these beds, which I'll talk a little bit more about. We tend to use a BCS walk-behind tractor for preparing the soil, although I am increasingly setting them up for tractor spacing. And they're bare soils. We manage them as bare soil. And then we also grow crops that are higher value and higher turnover in those beds. The long field, west, long field, east, and then the far field, those are set up for tractor cultivation and they're set up for laying plastic mulch. And so they're longer. Those are 265, 274 beds. So I kind of have a hybrid system on our farm where we have both what I would call like intensive market garden style production. And we also have what I would call more like a broad acre plastic culture tractor-robotillar type system. So as I mentioned in the short beds, we do shorter maturity, higher value crops. So lettuces, spinach, carrots, beets, things that we can double crop. So our goal is to get two crops in here at least. It's not free. So there tends to be a higher labor input per crop because we're going in there, we're holding it in my hand. We're laying compost potentially. So we're doing a higher labor in the lower line to get a higher revenue. In those fields, we tend to use compost as a basis for our peculiarities. So we're laying a significant amount of compost. And that's part of what we've been doing with our no-tilt trial that Hannah and I did over the last few years where we actually tested out no-tilt management versus rototill management. And I did that in these heads. And so as part of that, we were laying down really thick layers of compost. And we were using that as basically a mulch that we were then planting into without rototowing. We use overhead irrigation in this section. And that's partly because we're doing a lot of hand cultivation. And if you have a new irrigation and new chemical cultivation, it's really, really annoying. You don't have to work around irrigation or have to move it out of the way and move it back. So we moved to doing overhead irrigation in this area. And also, we're doing a couple of germinating seeds. So like carrots in particular, we've had really two really dry summers. And both those summers I've germinated my carrots entirely under irrigation. Whereas in the past, I germinated those with a rain ball. And so that's been a really big part of being able to control more of our seed germination, especially in that summer when we're in the winter. And as I mentioned, we do weed control by hands. We use a lot of wheel hoses. We've set up our spacing so that we can use different types of wheel hoses. You know, so we tend to do things on two or three rows mostly, so that our spacing is sort of standardized. And it's easy for us to go into wheel hoses and just wheel hoe the entire field. So the long beds, longer maturity, lower value crops, I'm going to show a crop list in the next slide, but potatoes, brosicas, froth, the frost sprouts, the onions, garlic. We look at that as we're trying to get a single cash crop and a single cover crop per season. So we're trying to basically rotate cash crop, cover crop, cash crop, cover crop. And so the cover crops are the basis of our fertility in those fields. We're looking to use those rather than compost to recycle nutrients. And so we can use plastic mulch in those fields. I'm not set up for cultivation. I don't have a cultivating tractor. I have one tractor that I use where the only cultivation I can do is wine cultivation, so it's not very good for actually weeding crops. I can weed the tire trunks in between the plastic bed, but that's a big reason why we use plastic mulch. It's not something I necessarily see in a practice that we use forever, but I have to get to the point where I have the cultivating experience to be able to get rid of it. In those beds we use drip irrigation because we just put them under the plastic bed. We lay them at the same time as the plastic mulch. And then, like I said, we'll use the tractor to cultivate the tire trunks between the plastic. We'll also do the vultures within the entire tract so it lands right down there, straw mulch. Or we'll use wheelhouse if we have time. So the picture on the left is our Pets germinated carrots like it sometime in August. And so that's our 100 foot beds with a more intensive mark garden style production. And then on the right that's our harvesting overwintered onions, and then on the left is our fridgered onions in June. And so there's also you can see the garl of onions on the other side of my workers there. And so those are the plastic beds and that's going to look at how those two different types of fields look. So this is the kind of the, this is traditionally, then our crop roasters say traditionally is in the last few years. This is then what we rotated through those different beds. So as I said we cluster crops, we grow certain types of crops in the short beds, and then we grow certain types of crops in the long beds. And so they're mentioned in the short beds, the emphasis is on shorter season. Generally things that are 60 days, no more than 60 days would be, you know, green beans and some of these things are a little bit longer than that. The idea is that we could grow two of these crops in a season. And then the long beds, the goal is just to only get a single crop per year, remove the plastic and put cover crop down or have cover crop and then fill that in and relate plastic. So one of the big changes we're making this year is we're really carrying down what we're growing. We're trying to increase the amount of diversity of crops that we're growing. We really focus on the crops that we grow. We grow well, have a good demand for them, and we can actually grow properly. We've been dropping crops from our crop list. So the bolder ones are the ones that are still growing, and then the ones that are not bolder are the ones that decided to drop. And by drop I mean we're just not growing them at all, or we may need buying them from another producer who has a better system than us. So for example, we're getting sweet potatoes from someone who grows like six acres of sweet potatoes. They got tractor systems set up for planting in cold baby. They just have a much better system than us. And so it doesn't really make sense for us to try to grow sweet potatoes given our scale of your own equipment. So this is a modeling part of our farm, but this is just kind of showing you what we're still growing and what we've dropped. It does make crop rotation a little bit more challenging. In some ways we've been growing larger amounts of fewer crops, and so we've got bigger blocks of crops to rotate through the field versus having more diversity of what we can rotate smaller groups of crops in the field. But what we're looking at is this is kind of how I look at crop rotation. We have families of crops that we rotate through. This largely has to do with disease. You know, there's a disease that affects certain families, like for example, black rot is a disease that affects the Roscoe family, it doesn't affect the Curvits, it doesn't affect the quality of the soil. So that's largely what's that based around. It's also based a little bit around fertility, for example. So there's similar fertility needs within the Roscoe family, and similar fertility needs within the Carrick family. So that is another part of why we're clustering together. But when I'm looking at actually making a map of the field and where things are going to go, this is how I'm clustering things. And then within each of those clusters, I might say, okay, the crop is going to go exactly here, the potato is going to go exactly here. But the first step is just kind of figuring out what block of crops is going to go over there. And I would say it's more important than the long beds, that kind of rotation, or really mapping that out. The short beds, it tends to be, because there's so much turnover in those beds, it's a little bit harder to have a set rotation plan for those beds. So I still think that through it is a little bit more fluid in those beds than it is with the long beds. So, and then just to mention the high tunnel. So I have one 30 by 96 high tunnel. And so we rotate that. We have basically three seasons in that tunnel. We have a spring season where we plant the next few weeks. Typically we plant spinach and lettuce, although we do also sometimes plant arugula and kale. And then in the summer we have tomatoes in there, generally just tomatoes. I also have tried other crops in there, and they try other crops in the future. But generally it's just tomatoes. And then in the fall, we'll rip out the tomatoes, and we plant spinach and lettuce. And then we generally will harvest that up through December, and then the spinach will harvest in January and February. So that's kind of the rotation that we have in the high tunnel. So you can see it's not a, it's the same crops every year. And so part of the problem is with having only one high tunnel, it's difficult to have an actual rotation. So I'm hoping over the years to add more tunnels and be able to do more rotation. And then having more tunnels would also allow us to potentially have a fallow period. So for example, we could take one tunnel, let's say we have like three tunnels, we take one tunnel every year, and we just grow a cover crop in there. So to give it a rest, to break up these cycles, to break up these cycles. But currently we have only one tunnel. We're doing this, it's working so far. I mentioned there's some pitfalls to that, but I'll kind of frost that for you when I come to it. So these are the crop families that were rotating within the tunnel. Functionally, we're really just rotating lettuce, spinach and nightshade. And like I said, the tomatoes were just growing. It's been the same, the same place I've been. This is just a schematic that I came up with recently to show how we flip the tunnel from one season to another. So on the left, what you're seeing is, this is what it looks like when we have small, we have fall and spring greens in the tunnel. And so the black strips are landscape fabric, and the green strips are the planted bed. And then kind of each row in this spreadsheet is a foot. So you see it's dirty clean. So this is looking across the tunnel. And so you can see on the edges, we have three foot fabric. Along the edges, that's kind of a permanent walkway. Some growers like to row all the way up to the edges of the tunnel. I'm a six foot eight. It's really hard for me to move right up to the edge of the tunnel. And so I like to have a walkway where we can walk all the way around. And then you can see we have the four foot beds. And we plant with a paper pot transplanter. And that's how we plant our lettuce and spinach. So we use six rows of four foot wide bed, which is about eight or nine inches between rows. It's about as close as you can get to paper pot transplanter. Between just going down the bed. And then we actually generally remove the landscape fabric. So we have a one foot bare soil bed. Or sorry, bare soil pathway between the beds that will just wheel hoe for free control. Okay. So that's fall and spring. When we flip into our summer production, which is tomatoes, we roll out landscape fabric onto those pathways. So we roll it right over the center of the pathway. And so we're covering that one foot pathway plus we're covering it for 90 years side. And so we're narrowing our beds down to two feet wide now. Two foot wide strip. And that's where we're planting our tomatoes. And most recently we've been planting them in a single row and doing a double and training them to a double leader. So we have a single row, we have a space one foot apart with a double leader going to a wire that runs, the wire would run right here and right here. So right along the edge of the bed, running all the way down the length of the high tunnel. And so we're training the tomatoes up to that wire. I think that I'm, what I'm going to do this year is I'm actually going to do a double row of single leaders. Because I think I might have, basically I think the system I've been using is more for a grafted tomato and I'm not grafted. And so I'm moving more towards a double row single leader. So I'll be planting, instead of planting the tomatoes right down the center, I'll be planting them like in a diamond style on the inner side. So they'll be more directed on the wire. And then when we flip back into fall production, we rip out the tomatoes, take out the landscape fabric. Usually we irrigate because the soils quite dry at that point and it's been compacted from us walking up and down the pathways. And then we'll broad fork, lay down a bunch of compost, and then we'll plant our lettuce as an image into that. And so we've been managing up the high tunnel and no till for the last several years. I think it's worth any really important. Any questions so far about this or anything else that I've talked about? We'll also have time for questions and put them in the comments down. I probably like should be showing this from a book. But I got this from Andrew Methods book. This is where I got this system from. So if you're interested in that, I don't know if they have that in the bookstore, but you can go check it out. It shows how to do this for a bunch of different products. So I'm reading that. And sorry about that. So why, when you say you think that's for graft, can you say a little bit more of wire? Is it the yield? It's that the tomato basically doesn't have enough productivity to maintain two stems because the photographic variety has got a much stronger root stock. And so it has a stronger root system so it can really produce on two stems and from conversations with other growers. And actually if you read the recommendation as both, that's exactly what he said. I just kind of skipped over that and didn't do it for a few years. So I'm going back to what the recommendation is, which is you're not grafting, you're a single-leader because the plant will be able to produce more proof on that single stem versus if you're trying to train it to two stems. You're kind of like overtaxing the plant. It's my understanding that it's grafted. Yes, when you're pulling out the tomatoes and then you kind of pull that landscape fabric off and you're going back into your fall production, you said you'd be using a paper pot transplant here. So what are you doing beyond raw forking to prep the planting area in a way that's adequate for the paper pot transplant? So yeah, the sequence is, I'm remembering it correctly, the sequence is we irrigate, then we broad fork and then we lay down the compost and then we will either wheel hoe or tilt to use the tilter to basically get enough loose soil to be able to run the paper pot transplant. And I run the paper pot transplant on the shallows depth. I found that works best, especially in a double-till system because if you run it on a deeper depth of shoe, it's just going to catch any clods that are going to be underneath there. So that's worked for us. Do you need an accessory or a tool to ensure that those paper pots are varied if you're putting them in the shallows you are? Usually we do it as a two-person team and so all of us run the paper pot transplant and then someone will just come behind me and they'll just kind of kick the soil in around there or use their hands. So that's just what that looks like, what the high tunnel looks like. With the landscape fabric, with the tomatoes in a single row, we did some inter-planting of beneficial plants of borage, marigold, basil, some other things in there, so that's what you're seeing. There's some weeds in there too. And we run a double drift tape right along the tomatoes and I just like to double it, it just gets more water down more quickly. And so you can see we use the tomahooks, which we don't actually use that system to actually lower the tomatoes, but I like that for just being able to get it on the wire easily and then we use the plastic tomato clips and we come in and we'll prune the lower parts of the tomato and we'll prune off any suckers, so we're just training the tomatoes to two and like I said, I'm going to go to just training them with a single beater. And then we're pruning kind of throughout the season, usually up until about part of the time and then we kind of run out of time and stop pruning at a certain point, but it's to just increase the airflow and make sure that it's not a jungle in there. The last time I worked on it, we would kind of stop pruning in like May and so we would go in there and it would be like going into a jungle and it would be extremely humid and hot and you'd cover it in tomato pollen. So I try to avoid that, but the pruning labor is sometimes difficult to balance with everything else we're trying to do on the farm. And then this is what it looks like in the Springer Fall configuration. This is this fall. So you can see there's roughly half spinach and half lettuce. I've got some kale in there. I'm going to stop doing kale because we don't plant it early enough to actually get good yield from that. We would need to plant it probably in late August or early September to really get nice sized plants. So I planted, ended planting it too late and then you just have small kale plants and they'll produce. But spinach and lettuce work really well in the window that we need to plant in, which is generally we'll plant in the end of September or early October. So we're ripping out those tomato plants and replanting the fall greens in late September or early October and then our aim is to have greens in November, which is around the time that we have to stop harvesting outdoors. So we try to harvest outdoors as long as possible and then we move into the house on our own. So with your pathways being so narrow, are you starting at one end and harvesting down or are you able to harvest in the present? You've got a lot of prefetchess issues. No, we don't do like the path man style of like plant the whole tunnel out. So we do have the pathways to walk down and the plant rows are a little bit into the bed. So it's the pathway and even though you're not just walking the bed, it functionally the pathway is more like 18 inches between plants. But yeah, it's a little bit difficult with the getting the harvest towing. Generally we kind of harvest and then we're dragging the toe over when we've just harvested. Because it's actually hard to get our tokes down, the pathway itself. But it is a little awkward. We have hoops in here too and hoops get in the way. So it's always a little bit awkward harvesting in this kind of style. But we want to maximize the non-grown area. I haven't yet found the motivation to try to move towards that kind of path man style, which is what that means is people will plant the entire tunnel like wall to wall. There's no pathways. And then you just harvest your way through the tunnel. So you just walk over what you harvested. And that's the way it's got the ends. And then as many greens as possible into the high-salt space. So some of the challenged crop rotation I think just growing different amounts of the different families. Like brostocas are always overrepresented on those special farms. It's always hard to rotate brostocas with other things and not grow brostocas in the same spot over here. And then for me, my production levels change from here. And the part of that being a beginning farm is that you actually, as you're growing, or as you're changing your markets, the amounts you're growing, your things are going to change. And that's why that idea that well I'm going to have a set crop rotation. I'm going to use that. Well, you could have a set crop rotation one year and then your market changes or your size changes and you're going to have to change that. And then I think there's always the unexpected adjustments and the reason for us soil conditions we've got to get this in right now. And so we're going to plant it somewhere where it maybe wasn't in the crop rotation plan but it was just because the soil conditions are right. Sometimes you run short on transplants or you know, some plants one less bed if something would be in the transplants. So all those things can change. And then I think there's always a question about growing things in blocks. So all the brostocas grow here, all the algae grow here versus growing them as a more heterogeneous distribution. So like, you know, some brostocas here, some not easier. I think the block system is easier to scheme out. It's easier to like plan that way. But also you're concentrating potential pests and disease problems in a single block like you're making it very easy or pests that have moved in and be able to like move from crop to crop to all the crops in a single family are together. And I've been working in a two acre field so it's not as though I can really spread things out that much. But even just having something like for example in that map I showed you in the far field versus in, you know, the field that's farther to the west. I see differences in how, like if I plant my spring cucurbits in one field and I plant my fall cucurbits in another field it takes a while for them to move from crop to crop. So for example, like they basically will destroy the spring and zucchini and cucumber, talking about cucumber, yields and squash blocks. And then once that crop is destroyed or I've ripped it out then they'll be the next one. Whereas if they were right next to each other I don't know what that would happen. I think they would just spread right between each other. So yeah, there's probably more to say about that. I think there's also considerations of, you know, being able to inter-plan with beneficials to break up lots of crops which also can complicate your crop rotation. But these are just some basic principles that I try to follow. So I mean, at the very least you're not growing the same thing in the same soil every year. I mean, the high-tonging is an exception. You know, at least every other year, better yet three years, I think is a minimum. There's different recommendations for different diseases and different crops, you know. Some people will say three to five years, but in general if you're breaking up a extra disease cycle over a single year, I think that's, sometimes that's the best you can do depending on how much space you have. Being aware of edges where diseases can transfer, so I changed the orientation of my fields. So they used to run east-west and I changed them to run north-south. And what that meant was now all my beds for one year ran across the previous year's beds. And so like, there was no way for me to avoid growing broccoli where I grown broccoli this year. And so what I found was that was where the slack rot transferred. So the end of the bed where, like, my current bed crossed the old bed, that's where the slack rot showed up first. And then after that year, things got better because it just was that one year where I changed the orientation of the beds. And then obviously if you have identifiable disease or pest issues that you know are a problem on your farm, learn about the life cycles of those things, it might make sense to, for example with black rot, it makes sense to tilling your residue into the soil either that fall or early the next spring because the black rot would carry over on the residue. Tillage can also help with some insects that overwinter in the soil. So if you till in the fall, not that that's generally the practice, but if you have a specific problem you're trying to address it can make sense. And then soil testing every year and for every other year is important. And then you can adjust your amendments based on the soil testing, the actual needs that the crops are growing. So actually understanding, you know, what are frosts going to need, what do the aliments need, what do you curb its need, and you can try to amend your soil based on the needs of those crops, rather than just having a media fertility program that you use for the whole farm without regard to the crops you're growing or the particularities of your fields. Because I know each of my fields has its own particularities. One field is kind of high in phosphorus. One field is generally lower in organic matter. So knowing what each of your fields, what the needs are of each of those fields, you can try to address them specifically rather than just kind of using a blanket program to address your whole farm. So just to talk a little about the record keeping and the way I do it, I come up with a crop rotation field plan and I just use spreadsheets for this. So I kind of have a spreadsheet that's similar to that map I showed you. It's in a spreadsheet form. So like each row is a bed in that system. I think I have a screen out of that next. And then I want to have my actual crop planting field map. So this is my plan and this is what I actually did. And then that crop planting field map becomes my historical record of crop rotation. So if I have one of those for each year, then I can look back and this is what I planted where in 2021, this is what I planted in 2020, 2019. So I can make actual crop rotation decisions. Because if you don't remember where you planted things, you can't actually make the crop rotation decisions. And so this is just what that looks like in the spreadsheet. So you can see I've just taken the columns and merged them across the rows. And so each of these columns are the bed. And I have a little code for the bed. So that's Longfield East, the bed 24. And then I've got, this is actually part of my plan for this year. So what crop I'm going to grow. Sometimes I'll also put in cover crop that I'm growing in there. But this is the plan. And so then I'm going to want to capture the actual planting that I did this year. Because if I just have the plan and I'm going to plan for next year, I don't necessarily know if I actually followed the plan or not, or if I had to make adjustments. I'm going to just provide a different farm example of all the way that we do both of these crops. So my farm is Humboldt and Tarvis. I'm in Decor, Iowa. I mean, I've had five years on this. So this is a picture from our first or second year. And yeah, so we have a two acre field. And it's laid out in six sections, 150 foot beds, about one bed per section. And so that is kind of the new landowner to grow the edilocks. Can you turn up the volume a little bit? Oh, I think we're going to see how it's hard. But with the shield, I can just take it off. How about that? Wait, oh, you're the better. Okay. Yes. So this is a picture of planting garlic. So garlic is our, we have six sections. We're entering into year six of our farm. So we'll have gone through every single section after this year. And then we'll be restarting next in 2023. We'll be restarting the cycle. So allians is our first section. And so we plant our garlic, we plant onions, shallots, leeks in this section. It's the least number of beds that we need to use of any section. So sometimes we stick in, maybe if you want to plant some corn, popcorn or something for fun, we'll throw them in the allian section. But otherwise we can cover crop about half of the section during the year. This picture is actually of our no-till system, which we started just a couple of years ago. We started transitioning our farm to no-till. So that means we, yeah, this year with garlic, we actually put furrows in our no-till beds and then covered those, once we plant to the garlic, we cover it with samples. That was our method of covering the furrows. And then we launched after that. But yeah, our no-till system is basically compost-based. We fill up a bed. We kind of dig out pathways that we can, that are permanent. And then we can add compost to the bed, add to the no-till. And then we can fill it up. Can you hear me? Can you hear me now? No. I think I have batteries. Is that enough talk? No. It's good this last session. It's good. It's just a little fatty in the last year. They've been having problems. I'll just talk really loud. Can you hear me in the back? Great. Kind of. Okay. I'll be as loud as I can. Yeah. I think that's enough on the no-till situation. So alliums, most of them come out of the field pretty early in the fall or late summer. And so we are then able to cover crop almost immediately for a developmental fall. So we either put in oats of peas or a rye and vetch mixture depending on whether we went to overwinter the crop. Oh, yes, in fact. So if we want a cover crop that's going to extend into the spring and grow in the spring, then we use rye and vetch. And if we want to be able to work those around immediately in the spring, we use something that winter kills like oats and peas. We also are usually able to get around a buckwheat in, which is a summer crop, and we'll die at first frost. We're usually able to get around the buckwheat in after the avidems. Yes. Those are our garlics coming up. So this picture is of our cucumber section. We follow our alliums with cucumbers. And this picture is basically, which is washed, will spread over many beds. So we have to think about what we're going to do with the ground that is in between these rows of cucumbers. So that here, this picture, is when we planted a bunch of lettuce in between those of the cucumbers before they spread out so that we could kind of get two different crops out of the same zone. And of course, it gets complicated. You have to get the lettuce out before it starts getting overwhelmed by the vines because otherwise it's really a mess to walk around in there. Our next zone is roots. So roots for us include carrots, beets, turnips. So a bunch of different crop families, the carrot family and the basket family, the turnip side. So that's an interesting thing because the roots are basically, that's basically the way we cultivate the crops, the way they're grown, the way they're seeded, rather than what family they're in. So that's the way we think about our roots. And this is our rosic section. So it's the most full of any of our sections. We fill it up every year with cabbage, kale, broccoli, collards, Brussels sprouts, and whole robbing. And so, but I think it's the most beautiful of the sections. And again, thinking about cover cropping, we basically are able to cover crop size by bed. So our whole robbing comes out pretty early in the season. We're able to put in a lucky cover crop there. Or we're able to even double crop the whole robbing before. We don't have the same black crop problem that you're starting to have. So we're able to kind of fit things in. And then always thinking when we plant our fall cover crops, okay, is our next crop going to need to go in in the spring? Or can it wait until June? And in which case we would plant broccoli, or something that would really come up with the organic matter and grow in the spring as well. This is a totally messy picture. So our tomato section, we also do our beans in that section because they kind of have a similar season. We want to plant them after all the year in the crop, after the soil's worked out. And we put in several different sections of beans. So we've been figuring out, just kind of trial and error over the years, figuring out ways to kind of manage the architecture, I guess, of our section so that we can harvest the tomatoes easily and the beans won't be too much in the way. So we've started kind of alternating tomatoes and beans to just add more variety and more kind of ability to move around in that section. Yes, and then the final section is our green section. So our lettuce, our mustard mixes, our spinach, and then we also put our peas in the green section, again because they kind of match the timing of greens. We put them in the spring and get them out kind of fairly early in the season. So we can also double crop in our green section as we need to. That's my co-founder also in the green section. This is the picture of black bean cover crops surrounding a weeding parsley patch. Just thinking about the timing of cover dropping is a really interesting question that we're always working out and making sure everything is accessible and that we can just get as much stuff growing as we can as possible but without overwhelming our eye-woods of parsley. Yeah, and I believe that is it. So we have plenty of time for questions. How are you breaking down your cover crops doing complete no-till variables? Yes, so the question is how are we breaking down cover crops, especially when we're doing no-till agriculture? So a number of different ways, we try to number different ways. So we try just like pulling them out of the bed, like we're getting them out, which is not actually as bad as it sounds, but it takes a lot of time. The other big thing that I think those two are going to be trying is silencering and using silencer to break down cover crops. Can I ask about that? Sure, yeah, so, yeah, I think the way that I've done that is I have a flail mower that goes on a BCS, and it's all flail mowing and then lay the tarp down. And we've talked about this and I've talked about this and you don't get all that much residue breakdown we found. That's sort of how, so I'll try to result to us, I guess, or something, as we get a lot of residue breakdown, but I find that's not so much the case, it just kind of kills what's there. And it will start to decompose a little bit. I'm actually interested in possibly using clear plastic to try to get more residue breakdown. But yeah, because you don't get the residue breakdown, I think that like for me, if I want a direct CD or paper pot into it, I need to then like break that residue off or do something with it after I pull the tarp off. Yeah, we definitely have just covered the bed with compost, like just like kill it with a xylistar, fill the cover crop, and then just cover the bed with compost and then land directly into that. And yeah, we don't use a paper pot transmitter, we just transmit by hand, so it works for us. What have you found for no-till systems in direct seeding? Is that something that you find that you're able to do or is that kind of a, you have to transition more heavily into the transplant? Yeah, so my co-farmer manages the direct seeding and she hates using seeders. She just makes a burrow and directs you with her hand into it. And so we can do that in the no-till system, no problem really. What we have found, we actually found that our germination was best when we would make a burrow and just like the picture with the gar, like we make a burrow, we seed into it, and then we just cover it directly with compost and that was the best germination we could get. Jordan, I'm curious to know why you switched your bedroom key from people's headphones. It was really just to orient things more to the tractor because if you have 100 foot beds and the turnaround doing it with the tractor is terrible, so I didn't have to do as many turn-arounds with the tractor. So it wasn't necessarily like oh, north-south and better, it was more just because of the way my fields were oriented. I'm curious with the... I'm just going to pull you in the color graph with this and which part, what was your weed kill like? Yes, the question is what's the weed kill like with a silo shirt? I mean, it kills the angel weeds very well. I think the issue is typically carnials. So like we both have some issues with thistles, I'll even have some animal issues. So yes, carnials, it does not kill carnials unless you need a place for an entire season. But it will kill, the very effective kills, angel weeds. The question is it will kill the existing growth, but as soon as you pull it off, it's more weeds in germination. So I think sometimes in a tillage situation, people will till first and then put the tarp down because they want to flush them out before they tarp because in some part of the situation, when you kill the existing leaf growth, but then there's a whole another generation that's just going to come off as soon as it's triggered by pulling off this tarp. Yes, and I'll add that we have a fissile problem. So yes, we found that our annual weed pressure is not as bad in the ecosystem because we're using compost as a whole. But our fissile problem is huge. They just keep coming back and so we try to tarp any part of the farm that doesn't have something growing on it. In a, for like a three-week chunk of time or more, we try to put a tarp on just if those fissiles stop for a second. Have either of those experiences with living mulch and your permanent rows, have you ever thought about doing that? Have you ever thought about doing that? I have not. I have not done living mulch. I do use Dutch white clover in other parts of my farm and that's one, I'm sorry, I do use Dutch white clover in other parts of my farm and that's one that I've seen other people use in that situation but I've not personally tried it in my growing beds. I use it in my tractor pathways, like my access roads. Yeah, I've also never tried a living mulch other than once I tried some clover and had a bunch of re-servanated with it and it just didn't make sense so I just wheeled it in. But I'd love to figure that out. When you guys use the tarps to suppress the cover crops, does the temperature affect the effectiveness of the tarp? I think it's early spring versus the middle of summer. That's a good question. I don't know. I think there's definitely a heat effect with the tarp that can, I think that might have an effect on the residue breakdown potentially, although I was saying I'd still feel a little bit of a sadness in the summer but I think the main way the tarp works is by excluding light. So I think in the case of the tarp it's not so much that it's heating up the soil is that it's excluding light, which that's what's killing things. With clear plastic it's the heat that is actually killing things and breaking down residue. So when you're doing your crop rotations in the sections that you're doing double cropping in you're rotating at the end of the season, right? So if you have all of your crops that cook in one section you know, like some of us have longer seasons so if you're double cropping multiple times you're not worried about rotating into a different section at that point you're kind of looking at it from a season perspective are you both looking at it that way, those sections? I definitely am. You're by your grasp as go here and nowhere else. Yeah, well in the place that I'm double cropping I'm usually changing families but my understanding is like, I kind of had this question too it's like, is crop rotation always between crops or is it just between seasons? And I think, I don't know, maybe that's best practice would be yes between crops but I think there is some leeway where like yes we could rotate like you could grow lettuce twice there might be reasons not to do that for other reasons but like, you know, in terms of an overall crop rotation I think that's fine to grow things in the same to grow the same family and same dead same fields in the same year. Yeah. So you might do multiple crops with salad and salad in the same bed or you do? I haven't done that but it's like, again, because I want flexibility I can have myself do that if I have to I try not to, I try the best I can to rotate between crops as I can and usually I don't be able to do that but it is something that I would do if I had to. In your greenhouse when you said after tomatoes when you go you bring in a ton of compost how many yards of compost in there? What does a ton mean? Yeah, yeah, so it's, I think it's pretty quantifiable it's, we usually lay about an inch over the top of soil all across the bed surface and we do it, we move with a tractor bucket and then we'll dump it into, because we can't put the tractor in the tunnel we dump it into the wheel barrels so we line up three wheel barrels dump the compost into those three wheel barrels and I'm trying to think, I have this written down I'm going to say, what's that? Yeah, I think we're using probably three to five bucket loads per bed if I remember correctly and in general I think I've quantified it that we end up using about a cubic yard per bed it's in general that we're doing that thick small layer so we get it delivered, we have 40, basically 40 ton loads and that will cover about 40, that's your, yeah that's about the rate we're using to get that one inch thick like heavy mulch, yeah, but the only answer that I know for pleavidals is just to grow cover right when you land the crop, just cover it and with row cover that doesn't have any holes in it and not exceed the pleavidals I'm actually trying to figure out the problem when we grow cover for pleavidals is it's often on grass because they're going to float really fast especially with that hot row cover so that's hard to negotiate but yeah, I have a good feeling about it My understanding is if it's a flying insect then unless you're able to isolate long distances the rotation isn't going to matter for that because the pleavidals are just going to find their crop they don't necessarily overwinter in the soil or if they do they'll just come up and find the crop so that is less of a crop rotation issue than what Hannah said it's just more of a physical exclusion and I think that's the case with other pests like cucumber beedles they're just going to come find your due curve it doesn't matter if you rotate them Is that really crop rotation related but you were talking about the row cover do you have an issue of it blowing off and how do you secure it or not let it rip? How do we secure row cover? In my obsession with exceeding pleavidals I have gone into burying the side of the row cover and so just continual dirt on all edges of the row cover and then the problem is if it's a rooble or something and harvesting multiple times actually if like pinning it back down under that row of dirt after every harvest yeah the other problem with row cover that I've noticed is that it creates this micro climate that's really kind of luscious and the Asians love it and they get all over the crops and that's kind of gross I have a question for you where do potatoes and sweet potatoes fit into your rotation? We put potatoes in our potatoes section Okay I just wonder about that Sweet potatoes We don't Okay, I treat them as a night shade so simply I treat the potatoes so the other is sweet potatoes One thing I also want to know from person to person but I was going to say about how we've done direct seeding with no-till so it's similar to what I talked about with the high tunnel where we're trying to get enough till to be able to run that via pot transplant through and we did have issues where the seeder is skipping so we're pushing a seeder to the soil it's like hitting a hard-hand layer just kind of skipping but this year I switched to using a jane seeder and it's a lot heavier and it's been a lot better for no-till because it can just kind of plow through sections where an earth way is very light and we'll just kind of skip so that's one thing I found that really helps with direct seeding into a no-till situation or any kind of situation where you have tighter soil or more residue it's just a more robust, heavier seeder Jane, it's a jane seeder J-A-N-Jane there's probably some vendors who sell back here that you can look at When you're planting your cover crop do you broadcast those We broadcast our cover crops I broadcast with a little earth way chest and then I have a cul-de-bacquered so I generally will cul-de-bacquered that in or sometimes I'll dis-gid him I've also instilled it into the road but I'm not wild I would like a better system because it's a lot of passes over the field it would be nice to be able to do things in a single pass rather than having to do it in a pass Cool, any more questions? Do you guys transplant in the residue of the cover crop that you're doing until it gets... Yeah, we have... so... Yes, okay I didn't do it The question is do we transplant into the residue of the cover crop We would only transplant into the residue of a dead cover crop for sure and we would add a compost mulch over it so there would be a lot of tilt of that compost as we transplant it so it wouldn't yield a very residue And I would still wouldn't transplant because generally I'm not using cover crops in those short beds although I'm kind of moving in that direction and I would do similar things to what I was doing like tarting it Yeah Yeah, so the question is how do we get brassicas like Brussels sprouts and stuff that has heavier stock out of the soil we're not tilling it in and we have tried multiple things we've tried just pulling the whole thing up and it's awkward because it's like frozen in the fall and by the time we're like pulling the... by the time you... Oh, hello Hello, hello By the time we're pulling the brassicas out it's like the soil is like frozen and it's really challenging so we switch to just chopping them off at the soil level and leaving that roots just in there to kind of rot and because we're rotating I think our roots come next after our brassicas and so we're direct seeding so we just make it frozen and it has worked out just...",
