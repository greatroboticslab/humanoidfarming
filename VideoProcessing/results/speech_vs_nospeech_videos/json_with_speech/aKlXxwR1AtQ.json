  "text": "So I'm just getting my containers ready here to plant up some squashes. I've used my new Hori-Hori knife here to work up these pots from last year. This thing works great for loosening the soil, digging out old plant roots. I just gave it a bit of a wedding with some water, but it can see it's super dry in here so we will have to give it another good drink once we get the squashes planted. So I've mixed up this soil here to add to my container. So this is some of my sifted compost, peat moss, perellite. I threw in some worm castings and some organic fertilizer. Just some 444 basic fertilizer. I'm just going to top up each of these containers and then we will get ready to plant up some squash. So because we're planting containers you want to make sure you've got nice loose soil, you want to have good water retention because it will dry out a lot faster than planting in the ground. So hopefully the peat moss and the perellite will help with that, help retain some of that moisture. So the first squash I'm going to try planting up. I got two zucchini started in here. I'm going to see if I can gently separate them and get two going in this container. I know squashes really don't like to have their roots disturbed too much, but we'll take it out of the cup here and see how it looks. See there's a lot of roots going there. If it breaks apart easily or not, it's going to be good. Another great feature of the Hori-Hori is digging out your holes here for your plants. When you're planting seeds you can even use the measurements on here just to check your depths. This doesn't need to go too deep. Try to get them spaced as far apart as possible in this container. Give them some growing room. So with these containers I'm going to either use maybe a tomato cage for the zucchinis because they do grow up nicely. The other squash I might just let them drape over, let them grow on the ground such as the spaghetti squash or the butter nut. So in this container we're going to try some spaghetti. This is my first time planting pumpkin. I have some size plants here and actually a third one just popping through. I'm just going to see if I can just stick it in with one of these guys and whether it comes through now or not, I'm not sure. Just try to gently tease the roots apart not to upset them too much. So in here we're going to do some sunburst squash, also known as the patty pan squash. I got two plants coming here again quite close together. I might just put them in the center and just kind of let them grow together. So the last squash I want to plant up today is the butter nut. And I'm not sure if butter nut have a longer germination period, but as you can see here, compared to the rest, this is what my butter nut squashes are looking like. I'm sure it's been over three weeks since I've started these. And these two butter nuts just started to pop through about two days ago. So I'm not going to plant them up yet. I think I'll give them a couple more days, get a little bit stronger. This one, I'm thinking there's not going to be any germination. And maybe what I'll try is just throwing a couple of seeds directly into the container here and see how they do. So the depth is only about three quarters of an inch. So that's, you know, barely just a little scraping like that. When you use your little Hori Hori here, that's one inches right there. So they don't need to be planted very deep. I'm just going to throw three in here right now, see what happens. I did just buy these seeds this year, so they should be fairly good seeds. I'm sharing these squash plants with my daughter. So if these ones take off, I can give her these ones in the cup and she can plant them up at her place. There, I'm just going to throw three in there right now, see what happens. So once I've got these well watered in, I'm going to protect that moisture and protect that soil with a light layer of chopped up straw. So this is barley straw. I was able to get a few bales out of my husband here from the farm. And I just ran over it with my mulching lawnmower a few times just to chop it up a little bit finer. So it's easier to work around these small plants. So always mulch. I always mulch everything. It just is so much better when you're using container gardening. Keep that moisture in. I don't have to deal with a lot of weeds, of course, with a container gardening, but it does help suppress. And then when I'm watering with my well water, hoping that maybe this straw maybe filters out some of those minerals that are in our water. OK, so this is what the squash containers look like all planted up. As you can see here, they have a nice space here of straw, kind of mulching the ground, keeping the weeds down so that they can trail out of the containers and sprawl out on this ground here. So thank you for joining me while I'm planting up my squashes here in my container garden. I hope you will give this video a like. Leave some comments and don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss out on future videos coming to the channel. Thanks for watching. Happy gardening.",
