  "text": "By the way, maize farmers, have you asked yourself this question? How many number of bugs do you produce in your small piece of land? Do you produce such number of bugs because you assume you know how to farm maize? Or it's because of ignorance to learn new knowledge on how you can grow much better? Well, I don't know if you can answer me that but today we are focusing on the basic on how you can manage to grow maize and get higher from planting to harvesting including the best soil for maize farming and we are going to jump right away on the best soil for maize farming. Maize drives in fertile loam or sandy loam soils supplementing these soils with cow or sheep manure can enhance growth and when it rains this mixture retains moisture for the promoting growth. Conversely, clay soil can has poor drainage and can lead to flooding which starts growth and results in noah weeds. After getting light on the best soil for maize farming now let's focus on which are these best varieties of maize that you can plant in Kenya and get good weeds. Now the suitability of maize varieties varies by regions. In the north reef region where there is only one maize season 5 month maize varieties are the best. These varieties have high yields producing over 50 bugs of 90 kg per acre. Some of the recommended varieties include pionia vat 2.53, pionia vat g. 90, h6.14, h6.28, h6.29 It is crucial to plant these varieties during the long range season for the best results. In regions with 2 maize seasons, farmers should opt for 3 month maturity maize varieties. These fast maturing varieties such as 1.31, h6.31, h6.31, h6.31, h6.31, h6.31 h6.31, h6.31, h6.31 tibukare hiru danaverij of 25 to 35 90 kg bugs per acre and matures within 75 to 90 days. After getting light on the best maize varieties then how well do you plant these seeds? Before planting ensure the land is clear of weeds. Farmers can either weed manually or you can use non-selective herbicides such as Kausha or Roundup. A recommended planting spacing of 60 cm by 30 cm compared to the traditional 90 cm by 25 cm increases crop population per acre requiring a seed rate of 11 to 12 kg per acre and of course the yield. If you think a maize plant can calibrate it fast for precise spacing. After planting this crop needs to be fed with the best fertilizers and then that's why we give you the best maize fertilizers. Yudzpa acre are influenced not only by the maize variety but also by proper fertilization. High crop populations require adequate sebum. To bless with DAP 18460 on the 10th day after sowing to promote faster growth A v stage the maize plants have developed strong roots that can absorb nitrogen and phosphorus effectively. Usin fertilizers during planting is not effective and seeds do not utilize them leading to reaching. DAP is preferred of NPK2320 due to its high phosphorus content which supports a rapid root growth. NPK2320 should be top-traced on the back of the day after sowing or CAF fertilizers should be applied 55 days after sowing to enhance seed formation and weed to gain. After planting you need to control the pest. The full armyworm is a significant pest in maize farming responsible for more than 50% of crops. To control fall apply MRONDAT-TSC or escort and ideally 21 to 40 days later that is after sowing. We should be combined with a sticker such as Integral or Aquelet and a booster for your feed. This application is most effective when done in the late evening when the full armyworm is most effective. When you've done this you need now to control weeds. Keep the farm free of weeds at all times. This is essential. How much can choose between money-weding or using selective herbicides such as Tengatinga, Gavana, Maguguma, Adiamine 24 days when trail sale. All these simplify the work of controlling weeds. Also implementing zero-tunit can help conserve moisture thereby promoting faster growth. Now with all this you have a complete guide that you can follow step by step and manage the yield more from your small base of land. Let me know on the comments section if you have any question or query about Maze farming and also Maze management and paste a control.",
