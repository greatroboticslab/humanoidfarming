  "text": "Many gardeners may think they don't have enough room for a garden, but I'm going to share a few tips with you on how to have a successful container garden in a small space. So some things to keep in mind are to make sure that you're using high quality soil, make sure you have adequate drainage, and to match the container to the plant type that you'll be using. So in a small container, it would be best to use a potting soil type mixture. In a larger container, you may be able to use some garden soil mix with compost or a top soil mix. If you're watering them by hand, it will be easy to get the soil too wet, so having drainage on the bottom is going to be very important. Another thing to consider is that these containers will likely dry out more quickly in the summer, even with regular watering. So keep them adequately watered. In addition, it's important to match the type of plant to the container you'll be using. So for plants like raspberries or some of your root vegetables or even corn that have very large roots, you want to use a deeper, larger container. For some of the things like spinach or lettuce or your greens that have very small and shallow roots, it's okay to use some of the shallower containers.
