 Now we're over at our neighbor's property. We got a real nice neighbor who's a Vietnam veteran and he lets us cut hay on his place for free. It supplies us with hay and it keeps him from helping to maintain his fields. Anyway, let me show you what we're doing. We got a nice setup this year. We're bailing with our John Deere 5065. We got our old New Holland hay baler. I think it's like a 1960s model maybe. And then our newest addition is this awesome hay wagon that James completely rebuilt, repainted everything. This is nice. And shout out to my dad, James' Uncle Darren, obviously James, my amazing husband, and James' dad, Donnie, who I call Donald Duck. Happy Hay Day!
