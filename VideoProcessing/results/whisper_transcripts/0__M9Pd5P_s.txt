Howto & Style
 So we move the cows every day from paddock to paddock. So these cows just came in here this morning. And we move them every day from paddock to paddock. So they've got a fresh grass. They were here. This is actually the third grazing of this field this year. This is the third time it's been grazed. So they're only on a given square foot, maybe five to seven days in a whole season, any one square foot or square yard foot. Between those grazings, the grass is allowed to go through its blaze of growth period.
