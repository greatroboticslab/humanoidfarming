 This process is called forming cotton cups. Farmers use a special tool to create small cups filled with nutrient-rich soil, which are placed inside germination trays to provide an ideal environment for cotton seed growth. Carefully selected cotton seeds are then planted one by one into each cup, covered with a layer of soil, and gently watered. After planting, the seeds begin to germinate inside the cups.
