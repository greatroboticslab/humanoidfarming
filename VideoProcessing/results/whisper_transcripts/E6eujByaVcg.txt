Grazing on Perennial Greens

 Do you know what I mean when I say perennial greens? I mean greens that stay all year round. So you put them in the ground once, walk away, and they're there. And you can go back and eat them and eat them and eat them. Sweet potatoes. You can harvest the roots and the leaves. Chaya. That makes them. There's one of the cooking competition entries, the one I entered. It's made with chaya, right? It grows into a giant tree, and it's really high in iron and calcium and a lot of minerals. It also happens to have some hydrogen cyanide in it, or just cyanide actually. So you definitely want to cook it, but once you cook it, these molecules are broken down and no longer dangerous to us. And that's something you find with a lot of tropical plants. Because there's so many pests, they need ways to defend themselves, so they've evolved different mechanisms to prevent being eaten raw. Taro with its calcium oxalate crystals. But once you cook them, you're fine. So perennial greens, I want to encourage all of us to put more of them in our diets, because they're higher in vitamins and minerals. They have deeper root systems, because they're there all the time, that allows them to draw up more vitamins and minerals. They are easier to maintain. And so the only thing that I can think of as to why we don't eat more of them is just because we're not used to it. And we're addicted to the things that we're used to. So it's just a shift, look at what you can grow, and figure out how to implement it better. So with that, does anybody have anything they want to add? Lynn? Just to add, like the growing tips of chayote, or pumpkin, or any of your curcubits are really great also for these as a breed. Can't you eat papaya leaves also? You can. Cooked and raw? Pardon? Cooked and raw? They're better cooked. Papaya leaves? Yes, I would cook. Can you name some more of them? Shizu spinach? Edible hibiscus. The Shizu spinach, you can eat it raw, but it's kind of tough and fibrous. It's much better cooked. A quick little saute or a dump in a soup is really yummy. Little tiny leaves, they like shade. You can get it started from little tiny cuttings. There was a bucket of them on a table. If there's any left, probably not. I don't know. Yeah. You can get them started really easily. They'll make little mats. You can harvest them. Oh, kutuk. Yes, kutuk is kind of a sticky wrangly kind of plant that will grow really tall, or you can prune it and get it to bush out. It has a... It's a little asparagus. There should be a bunch of kutuk cuttings over there, help yourself. In the bucket, and it tastes nutty. They have a nice nutty flavor, and you can eat the flowers and the seeds on the kutuk as well. And the beauty about these plants, kutuk, you grab the stick, you walk over somewhere, you shove it in the ground, and you walk away. It's pretty easy, and it likes shade. Moringa. Yeah, moringa. And curry meat. What about the growing tips of noni? Growing tips of noni? I don't know. Anybody eat those? I know. It's not good. There you go. Raw, raw, raw, raw. No, no, no. Raw? Raw, raw. Raw. Raw, raw. Raw, no. Raw, no, no. Raw, no, no. too, the perennial greens have a lot less frequency of contact with slugs because they're so high up, you know, whereas the garden garden will be all awesome. For a lot of them. The edible hibiscus, though, we find that the slugs really like that one. They go for it. They go for it. So even though your edible hibiscus is 10 feet tall, still make sure you check those leaves really well. Yeah, I just topped one the other day. It was six feet up. It had a slug on it. Wow. They like that one. And the edible hibiscus is a great one. It makes these giant leaves. They're kind of mucilaginous, so they're kind of slimy as it is. So with the whole slug scare, I personally have stopped eating it a hibiscus raw simply because once I start chewing it, I can't tell if I'm eating the Libra slug. It kind of wigs me out. But when I cook it, it's great. And it makes a great lasagna. It makes a great stir fry. Lots of ways you can deal with that. One of the best ways is to make a chip out of it. So you like put it in the oven just on really low. Or a car. Huh? Or a car. Yeah, yeah. Put a little garlic and salt on it. Oh my God. So, so yum. Way better than the chip. Lots of different ways to eat these things. Last one to mention is Okinawa spinach. It's a really pretty one. You can use it as a beautiful ornamental. And it's also slightly mucilaginous, but not that much. And it's really yum. It's my favorite to put in smoothies because I can just drop it in the bucket. It's all good. Also, cassava greens and hona hona is actually really nice. Yeah. Last year, somebody brought a hona hona salad and it was divine. It was really good. Is it raw? Yeah. Raw. Distirtium, absolutely. And then if you really want to get turned on to taro greens, you cook them enough, right, so they're the puree and they don't itch. And then get some of that really nice local coconut oil. Somebody's making this really choice coconut oil or you can buy the stuff from Thailand or wherever, but they're really good stuff. And then you just put that on the taro greens when they're hot, mix it in. If you really want to go overboard, you could use a little bit of homemade cheese or hard cheese grated on. But just the coconut oil and the taro greens is just so delicious. I mean, if you haven't really got turned on to taro greens, then just try that. I personally use wild pig fat, but the coconut oil is really good. I thought that'd be less controversial. Do you tell us how you cook the leaves? Yeah. The quickest way is to pressure steam them. I do 10 PSI for about 40 minutes or you do just steaming for an hour and a half. Oh yeah. And some recipes call for taking the rib out. Forget it. You don't need to. No, no, no. Or you can peel the stems and then chop them and put them in stews and soups. And it gives a really interesting, nice way. Yeah. Do that separately though. If you're going to make the leaf, just do the leaf. Do you use all age of leaf for a particular age? The younger the better, as long as they're fully opened. And it's nothing to do with the size. I mean, a healthy taro plant that's six or seven feet tall has a brand new leaf that's that big. And they're absolutely delicious. They're not a perennial, but hey, you can plant them all the time. Once a month. Taro leaves and coconut cream. When I first, when I first, right, but the, the, the cream I found it, I like to make it like a soup. So I'd take the leaves and I'd steam them for a long time and then cut them up. And then take the coconut cream fresh and raw and just cover it while the leaves are still hot. It was so good. You can add pretty much anything to it, but it's just so delicious. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
