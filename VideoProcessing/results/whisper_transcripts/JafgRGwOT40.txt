 What's up Farm Talk? There's four nice round balers for sale behind me just in time for hay season. Check these out. Here in northeast Kansas on Hiwath Edmonton's lot is three nice used 560Ms ranging from $36,000 on up to $43,000. And also if that's not your flavor, New Holland Roll Belt $560. I want $39,500 I believe for it. They take trades. Prices are somewhat negotiable. Probably can line up shipping if that's something you need. I also have a new 561M. It's the first one of these I've seen. Just at first glance doesn't look like they've changed too much on them but at any rate give Hiwath Edmonton a shout. Mention Ironman Ag and get yourself some nice balers just in time for hay season.
