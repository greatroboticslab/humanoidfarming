 Welcome to Harper Valley Farm, where we started with a one-acre property with just a couple of goats and learning to be self-sufficient. But with all our ups and downs, we are now back at our family farm, or shall I say, my parents' property, where we have doubled in size with our sheep and goats and everything else, where we are learning to homestead and be more self-sufficient. Follow us as we document our real and raw homesteading journey. So we moved the milking girls back into the shop for now while we were gone. We headed to Alberta to go see some family and get a lot of feed. So these girls came into the shop and then the girls that were in the field came back to the barn. So it's a lot easier for my mom to take care of everything. Care! Care! So the milking girls are back into the shop here. I'll be moving them out shortly here. But while we were gone, we took off to Alberta to go see some family as well to get some feed. So while my mom was taking care of everything, we put the girls in here because it's much easier for her. And we brought the girls that were in the field rotationally grazing back to the barn. So they're getting hay fed. So we're going to move those girls again today. I've got to take a look at the greenhouse. And I've got to get a couple other things organized because we bought something. And we have absolutely no idea what to do with it. All I know is I'm on my way to become a poor excuse of a better one. I've come to realize time goes by on its own. I am stuck here without a phone. I am stuck here without a phone. I am stuck here without a phone. Because we are working so hard, it's a little short here but it gets thicker here. We have only used half of our field this year. And our plan is to hay all this and try to get it back to hayland again. So we know that we won't get a good crop this year. But at least we'll get it cut. So this is going to be fun. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. You know it is cutting. This is our first time doing this so... It's cutting. This is our first time doing this. Wow. So this field has not been taken care of in many, many, many years. So we're so happy that we finally got it to this stage. So hopefully, as we go, the grass will get better. I think we do plan on putting manure on the field in the spring just to get this grass, and we're going to reseed it. Look at all that grass, hey? We're getting there. It was almost done. All done. It's pretty good. So, we can do the bale? Woo-hoo! So we raked the other day. It's been super hot. And I think we're going to bale today. I wonder how many bales we're going to get. How many do you think? I would say 30. You think 30? I'm thinking 50. How many do you think, Andrew? 60. 60? Okay. I said 45 then. Adelaide, how many bales? 60. I'll make them really light. How many, Adelaide? 60. 60. She said 60 as well. I'll leave it on the part. It's pretty thin here, but it actually gets pretty thick, like throughout most of it. Okay. Well, we should go to the thick part and go see if that's pretty dry, too. I'll start it up so you can see the whole thing. Just while it's sitting. Okay. Are we ready to bale? So I'll start it up so you can see the whole thing. Just while it's sitting. Okay. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Watch out. We're just kidding. Oh, that's funny looking. And then our next one. Because I accidentally tapped the thing. It's super tiny. It's just this big. It's big. Here's the end. Love it. So I had to take a quick run to Kamloops to go pick up something. And they did all the baling and everything without me here. So I'm a little bit upset with that. But we got 67 bales out of that field, which is pretty darn good. We thought we were going to maybe get 30. So we're pretty excited about that. So they stacked the bales and everything already. So pretty happy with it. Hay doesn't look too, too bad. It is going to have a bunch of weeds and rose bushes and stuff like that. Because this bale, bale, this hay field hasn't been hayed in probably over 20 years. So we've been working on this hay field for quite a bit since last year. And we're happy that it's doing really well. Yeah, it doesn't look too bad. Pretty happy with it. Cool. Apparently there's still one more bale out there that he says that he can't quite pick up because it's so heavy. So let's go get it. Get it? Okay, everyone. Well, thanks for watching the video. Hopefully you enjoyed it. We're excited that we got to hay our field for the first time ever. Don't forget to like and subscribe. And we'll see you in the next one. Baby. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
