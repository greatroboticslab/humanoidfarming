What Is Precision Agriculture?

Science & Technology
 Precision agriculture means using exact science and methods to produce more for less. It involves observing multiple changes in the environment and its effects on all the growing stages of produce in all past experiments. See pre-technology was limited to the amount of data points one person could physically observe. In the past, by the time a farmer saw that some produce was undernourished or didn't get enough sun, it was too late to reverse the damages. However, in the 21st century we have sensors that we can now measure all the parts of all the environment and AI which can make sense of all the data it receives and show us the next best course of action. The result is producing higher quality and quantity of produce while wasting a lot less. And the best part of all these systems is that AI systems learn from past experiments, meaning every future experiment gets even better. Precision agriculture involves using agricultural technologies to measure big data through systems including soil health and temperature, oxygen amounts and air temperature, water amounts and water amounts, insects and pesticide use, slopes on the land and even proximity to other types of produce. Even the age of soil, the spatial variability, carbon levels and different colours of sunlight all affect the growth development in different stages of the produce growth. By knowing exactly where it is and where it needs to be and what stage in that development, management can make more educated decisions. This is known as precision ag. For example, in some cases fields only needed 20% more water to produce nearly twice as much crops in yield. It already had enough soil, sun and nutrients. So just by introducing this one element, we can double the yields instead of having to double all the elements individually. Precision farming is a concept based on observing these factors and more to produce more quality produce for less. Some other examples of precision agriculture are the following. The yield uses stationary sensors to measure the soil, nutrient, water and surrounding air. It uses AI to produce the best course of action and relay this information to the farmer. This can mean increasing fertilizer to one part of the land instead of the entire farm, thus saving the farmer money, resource and time. Farming management finds this type of data collection increasingly valuable as we enter a stage where we need to produce more food to feed the world while wasting less. For more, check out the yield on the link below. Number two is variable rate technology or VRT, also known as variable rate applications, which allow fertilizer, chemicals, lime, gypsum, irrigation of water and other farm inputs to be applied at different rates across the field. This allows farmers to not have to manually change rate settings on equipment or have multiple passes over a certain area. The input costs are low, allowing major savings for the farmer, while also allowing the soil to be less contaminated. Number three is geospatial technologies like GPS, GNSS, remote sensing and drones that are all playing an important role in identifying the location of problems, optimizing resources and maximizing yields. This includes using satellite imagery to see which area the farm gets the most sun or drones to take time lapse photos for the farmer to see which produce is increasing or decreasing and why. Number four is post harvest. Post harvest uses sensors and AI to store produce and cool room longer, measuring over 10 different types of environmental factors and putting them all through an AI system which can measure the health of the produce in real time and predict when that produce will ripen up to nine months in advance. It also has 24-7 warnings of produce corruption, allowing cool room operators to only intervene when something is really wrong. There are many companies which are focused on producing more for less, and precision agriculture is all about optimizing that process from software to hardware, from farm to fork. There are fewer farmers now, 50% fewer than there were 10 years ago. In the United States there's growing evidence to show that in the next five years there will be another 50% less. We need to learn how to waste less, and precision agriculture is the way we're going to do it. See, we need to feed our planet with fewer resources, less land, less human labour and less water if we hope to remain sustainable. For more information about sustainable technologies check out this video we did right here, and as always like this video. The more likes we get, the more these types of videos, sustainable videos, get shared to other people. So, by hitting that green thumb and turning it go blue, you help our planet go that much greener. So thanks so much, and have a great rest of the day. See ya.
