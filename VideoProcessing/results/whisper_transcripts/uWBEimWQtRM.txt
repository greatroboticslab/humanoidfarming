uh sunflowers here they're looking good this is an isis candy uh cherry tomato here this is a oochita blackberry look at all these blackberries i mean this thing is just loaded we planted this thing in the fall of 2023 it's loaded with blackberries it's not gonna take long when these things are all gonna be ripe i mean look at that look it up in there it's crazy okay moving on i made little tags for each of these tomatoes for my tomato lovers out there please like this video if you are a tomato lover because i got you covered i got you covered you know i do guys all right here we go sorry my uh my little my little labels are wearing off because of all the rain we've gotten guys we've gotten like 20 inches of rain in the last month that's no kidding all right this is an isis candy cherry despite that he's not looking too bad he's got a little something something going on here it's not great but he's gonna be all right isis candy cherry i have a blue cream berries right here blue cream berries next one is berries crazy cherry right here and here we have a prairie fire he's a little bit up against the fence he is uh all these tomatoes are stressed out because of all this rain that we've gotten guys it keeps on raining and the it's just it's always just sort of overcast so not getting the sun that they need to it's very wet it's very moist here so we got a prairie fire here they are blooming because they're stressed out but we're gonna leave them be all right moving on we got mortgage lifter here he's blooming we're probably gonna pick those off what do you guys think i should do should i pick the blooms off let them get bigger or what cherokee purple uh that one these cherokee purples are very hard to germinate i think i've planted four seeds i only got this one really to germinate well we have a thorn burns terracotta and this is sweet maple ridge actually is standing uh behind me here so if she has anything to add to any of this uh please do thorburns terracotta i am excited for this one if y'all have tried or grown thorn burns terracotta please let me know down in the comments what you think of it and if any of these tomatoes that i'm showing you guys if you've planted them before if you like them or you hate them when you plant them again when you're not planting them again also let me note it out in the comments one of my favorite tomatoes of all time this one very identifiable with the the uh potato uh looking leaves uh this is the one the only the brandy one i'm only planting one of these this year though here's our skates i will put a uh you can go ahead and just look right up here and i'm sorry i said skates this is garlic i'm gonna put it right up here you can watch that video and there's also onions in here so once we harvest our garlic we're gonna fill the rest of this with more onions uh we have trouble with getting our onions to keep if you have tips about getting your onions to keep put it down in the comments but i'm trying to do some progression planting or succession planning with um our onions here so that uh we can just harvest them as we go as we get into the latter half of the summer i think this might be the first time we've seen the sun yes and it's still a very diluted sun but it's still the sun nonetheless so wow very thankful for that okay moving on we have a berkeley tie-dye pink here this is new never grown that uh they are starting to uh flower there a little bit berkeley tie-dye pink we have a rose to burn looking forward to that one we have a berkeley tie-dye green i am very much looking forward to this one honey trail farm says that this thing is amazing and i can't wait to try it we got a here's a granny cantrell i understand that these might have been uh uh started in west virginia somewhere i might be wrong on that uh these are jalapenos and red bell peppers here coming on down here we got another berkeley tie-dye green i planted two of these this is normally my brandywine area so i've replaced the brandywine with the berkeley tie-dye green super excited to see how uh these turn out all right coming on down here we have some cucumbers what variety are these i think these are um i think they're called market more yeah i believe yeah i think you're right market something 76 it's just a slicing cucumber and then on the other side we have um national pickling cucumbers um we've had some trouble getting these to come up this year just i i'm guessing because of the rain we've also had a lot of slugs this year and they're not helping anything and guys you can see another thing that we've installed here instead of using our regular uh hose down here we've installed actual drip irrigation i might do another video on that i'm not really sure but i installed this sort of hastily uh so i haven't installed the drip yet but i'm going to okay coming on down here this is our traditional regular globe tomato section here with the exception of one so i have wisconsin 55 thank you to great northern views for recommending that wisconsin 55 wisconsin 55 and i'll tell you it has been like i said wet rainy cold there was a time when did we get back from arizona um the second of june we got back from arizona the second of june and when our airplane landed and we got home it was 38 degrees here 38 degrees so all these tomatoes everything here has withstand 38 degree weather and 20 inches of rain in the past month but i'll tell you these wisconsin 55s look at them they're the best looking tomato in the whole garden you could tell that they are no stranger they were bred for colder weather cooler wetter weather just like uh you see in wisconsin and and honestly guys they're looking great now i gotta install a uh trellis above here to get these up off the ground one of the ones i'm most excited about is this woolly cape yellow now take a look at this this might be the coolest tomato i have ever seen this is a woolly cape yellow and i just think that the way that this looks is so neat it's it's definitely the most unique looking tomato probably the most unique looking plant in our garden but that's a woolly cape yellow all right moving on over here i have another granny cantrell and i have mortgage lifter right here he's looking good too and i have two paul robeson's right here uh people really really seem to love paul robeson uh variety of tomatoes so if you've ever grown a paul robeson let me know down in the comments what you think look how good these guys look all right all right coming on over here we have four san marzano's one two three and four san marzano all right coming on over here we got four romas one two three four sweet mrs sweet maple ridge loves to make tomato sauce she makes outstanding spaghetti sauce it's just incredible what uh what she makes out of these sauce tomatoes if you have a famous sauce tomato and you'd like to share it please put that down in the comments we would love uh we'd love to know what you do with them if you're new to the channel please subscribe we really appreciate it okay coming on over here uh this is a romanesco uh zucchini over here very very small they're just now coming up i think we had some trouble uh germinating these and uh miss sweet maple ridge is uh plant transplanting these because a bunch of them came up all right we're coming on over here we have some zucchinis do you know what variety uh i think they're just called black zucchini black zucchini there you go okay we have one heck of grapevine here y'all and look at all these grapes there's grapes everywhere miss sweet maple ridge any idea the this variety here is a very small grape i will put it right here i don't remember what it's called next here this is a different grape variety i don't know what this variety is i'm sorry but they're all table grapes they're all seedless grapes this is a concord grape uh that i'm sorry that is a canidus seedless grape uh seedless grape yep and then this one here is a concord so guys if you look over here they're covered they're covered with grapes and we're very much looking forward to our grapes here okay we have some brussel sprouts we have in here a whole mess of hose that i have to deal with um this is all moonshine corn sweet corn all moonshine sweet corn that's the name of the variety of corn yep not what we're using it for more tomatoes this is a blue beauty uh i don't know what any of these are except they're there's nothing unique they're all varieties that i have planted elsewhere in the garden one of them's a rose to burn i think one of them's a mortgage lifter i'm not sure but we're gonna find out we have more um what are those things called sunflowers over there you want to talk about the beans this is definitely your jurisdiction yeah first we do have some brussel sprouts growing i think they're speedio speedia speedio speedia speedia this is our first year growing brussel sprouts so we're gonna see they've again the slugs have done a bit of a number on them but we're optimistic um in terms of beans we also are trying some new varieties of beans these this is called a vermont cranberry bean so it's going to be a dried bean next to it we have midnight black beans oh and then next to our green beans they are a provider green the best the best they're just a bush bean not a pole bean um as you can see they're struggling a little bit i've had to replant um where we're having some gaps so hopefully those will come up we also have some um red potatoes that we grew i think they're red pontiac i think it's the variety of um potatoes that we have but we again because it was so wet um unfortunately we had some of our seed potatoes rot in the ground yeah right in here the water kind of sits and pools you can see it's sort of a you know a low spot here and i i think the sea potatoes just rotted pretty much yeah so i put some onions in um because i didn't have any more seed potatoes so i put some onions in where they were and then the rest of this row will also be more provider green beans but having some trouble getting those coming up so let us know if anyone else is having a problem it's been a bit of a it's been a rough go of it this spring just because the weather hasn't been cooperating hey guys we also want to turn your attention to these sunflowers here now this is all fenced in so nothing can get in here and we're confident of that but every time we come in here the sunflowers are bit off by something does anybody know what would do this to sunflowers it's it's no it's not a rodent or anything because they can't get in here they don't come in here but they're all bitten off you can see this one here they're bitten off here also so i'm not really sure what's going on there but let us know if you might know what that is this is our new asparagus garden last year we did have a lot of strawberries we've moved that to their own bed this is mary washington asparagus i want to direct your attention to this blueberry bush and this thing is just killing it this is a jersey i believe jersey and then this guy over here this is a blue crop he is not nearly as happy i think we're going to replace him with uh something else this is our tobacco here uh this is what it looks like when it's withstood 38 degree weather 20 inches of rain in the past month hardly any sunshine low temperatures just awful and you can see in here we're we're gonna uh spread some uh spread some uh straw out here but you can see how much rain we've gotten there's water sitting so it's not great we do have a couple more tomatoes uh planted down there and it's just been so wet we can't even mow down in here guys it's just been uh it's been wild so uh that is our garden tour we do have a bunch of fruit trees back over here we're gonna do a separate video about those so make sure you like and subscribe so you don't miss any content at all this here is this row here is virginia gold the row here and i will do a separate video on um you know the resiliency of this plant here but uh this is sweet air xl and then this is canadian bold here so i'm gonna do a separate
