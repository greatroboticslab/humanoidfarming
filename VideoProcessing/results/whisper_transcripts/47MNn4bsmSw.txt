We were quick like a mouse. Can you be quick? Quick, quick, quick, and slow like a snail. Quick, quick like the mouse. And slow like the snail. Good job! Can you pretend your little thumb is a mouse? And then your other hand is going to be the house. A quiet little mouse in a quiet little house. When all was quiet as quiet can be. Shhh, shhh, shhh. Alpha T! Hahaha, what a silly mouse. Let's try that again. That was so silly. The little mouse surprised us. Good job. The musical word of the day is tempo. Can you say that? Tempo. Great job. Tempo is how fast we can get. A quiet little mouse in a quiet little house. When all was quiet as quiet can be. Shhh, shhh, shhh. Tempo. Great job. Tempo is how fast or slow music is. First, let's pretend we're a fast green dinosaur. Fast green dinosaur, fast green dinosaur. Give a roar, give a roar. Running on the ground, running on the ground. Go explore, go explore. Good job! Good job. Next, let's pretend we're a slow orange dinosaur. Because orange is the color of the day. Slow orange dinosaur, slow orange dinosaur. Give a roar, give a roar. Go explore, go explore. Walking on the ground, walking on the ground. Go explore, go explore. Great job. If we were a little dinosaur running away from a big T-Rex, would we want to have a fast tempo or a slow tempo? Yeah, we wouldn't want to run fast. Let's pretend we're a fast green dinosaur as fast as we can. Fast green dinosaur, fast green dinosaur. Give a roar, give a roar. Running on the ground, running on the ground. Go explore, go explore. We got away. Good job! Yay! That was so fun learning with you today. We learned so much. We learned about animals and animal sounds. We learned about who, what, when, where, and why questions. And we learned about colors and counting. We also learned some shapes. I love learning with you. You're so smart. It's great being your friend. Bye-bye! Songs for the littles. Songs for the littles.
