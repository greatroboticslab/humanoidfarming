 No one likes bugs on their blossoms. White flies, aphids, spider mites, spiders. Ernie Wilkerson at Laura Kay's nursery is in a constant battle to keep the pesky critters from chewing up his inventory. So what's his secret weapon? We always just use Dawn. Yep, you heard that right. Dish soap. It's cheap and it's organic, so it's not going to hurt anything. Wilkerson says using detergent is simple. You spray it on and then rinse it off. You want to leave it a few minutes and then you want to rinse it off because it will leave a sheen on your leaf and if the sun gets on it, it'll burn. Oils are another organic alternative for your garden. And it'll coat them and they suffocate. The eggs, you'll coat them where they can't hatch out. Wilkerson now uses organic products like this neem oil not only for the environment but for himself and over concerns over long-term exposure to pesticides. Some of the most effective pesticides, systemic pesticides, are also the most toxic. Systemic means it's absorbed into the plant. Okay, well if it's absorbed into the tissues of the plant, it's got to absorb into my skin too, go into my blood system and go to my liver. So that can't be good. And you know, and you know it builds up. That's why these less toxic alternatives are Wilkerson's go-to for slaying bugs. For Fox 10 Modern Living, I'm Matt Barentine. We'll be right back.
