 I have too much organic matter in my soil, well what would I do? I'd pull out the mowboard plow. Go back in history, look a hundred years ago, people started plowing, and then over time you saw organic matter levels decrease. Now I know it seems a little bit contradictory because you go, well wait, there's all this residue in the soil surface, I'm putting it down below the soil surface, that should build my organic matter. No, it doesn't. What you're doing is you're introducing so much oxygen, so much air into that soil, that it speeds the process of breakdown so fast that you burn up that organic matter quicker. So, if you want to lower your organic matter levels, do lots and lots of tillage, and oh yeah, that organic matter, it will go down in time.
