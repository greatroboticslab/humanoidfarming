You know, and you know, or for instance opportunistic sometimes you have periods and then going back to the desert example with rain where plumes of methane or high methane in comparison to 2 ppm is generated and if you are a methanotroph that has been like waiting in there and you have that high concentration then you consume consume consume increase biomass and then wait until the next uh next rain next plume or whichever else right but we don't have a a high clarity on exactly what is the right mechanism for these different places so so for the ecosystem services though we know when we can measure that they do exist that they do happen we just don't have yet enough knowledge to understand how we can maximize it how we can favor it how we can harness the power of nature ideally in large surface areas so then we can truly make a difference in the current uh a goal to remove this diluted pool all right so we're gonna move to can i just say one other thing because i i didn't really differentiate it so in all of these sectors especially oil and gas you have what i would call routine emissions they're the things that just generally happen just in the course of an engineered system but what we're finding more and more and the satellites have been amazing at helping us do this um carbon mapper is one of the point source satellites that's that's been spectacular in this regard is finding super emission events these are more likely the non-routine events that can happen and they couldn't put out huge hundred kilogram an hour thousands of kilogram an hour and they the problem is that it's very hard if it's geopolitically you know if this might be because of a war in ukraine it's hard to always stop these but you don't want them to persist and so you really want to be have eyes in the sky that can make the invisible visible and stop this and there might even be a way you know as as since we was talking i was thinking there might even be a way someday because there's such large concentration events to actually deal with that if they're not lit on fire sometimes these turn into fires and explosions which make them even harder to deal with but many times this is just sheer gas that's just pouring into the atmosphere and actually that'd be that's a great transition so i do want to talk about next steps in the future but one of the things that you touched on a little bit in your introduction that i do want to come back to about you know we we there's the climate impacts of the methane but it's not just the climate what else you know it's methane is coming out of these leaks but it's not just methane and methane itself is a precursor for ozone smog what what else is coming out with this gas yeah so remember the gas is underground depending on the geology underground it's picking up lots of things there's hydrogen sulfide which in very small concentrations is deadly in a lot of this gas you just get it anesthetized your nose you can't smell it and this is has been a very big safety problem in the oil and gas and the and the coal mine sector for a very long time but there are loads of carcinogens that go along with it toluene xylene you get these different carcinogens that get picked up with it as well and any array of volatile organics and that's a big big part of the smog problem so there are issues we call it gas or even natural gas we associate it with methane because in many cases that's the largest in pipeline gas coming to our homes it's like 98 percent methane so if you get a leak there you know pretty much what's in the pipeline but if you get a leak at the field it can be 60 percent methane and 40 percent other stuff and we don't have good information around the world of the composition of gas as it's produced and in these gathering lines before they become processed gas which is when we have a much better sense of what we've turned them into and that is a very big unknown when there's a leak you really don't always know what's leaking yeah i think i was hearing also benzene which is a known carcinogen being one of those and actually even into the distribution lines into our cities and homes um that this is something that uh just is important to be aware of all right so i think we've laid out a good picture of the current situation um let's let's talk a little bit about about the future um and where we go from here and and hinsley i'm gonna go back to you to to maybe um lay out a little bit more you talked about some of the ecosystems but um for for you the atmospheric methane removal technologies you know do they exist yes uh excellent question so they do they're promising uh there are components that need to be worked and tested right for instance bioreactor and we have a lot of colleagues that are working on bioreactors right uh there are like a process of um gas exchange limitations energy investment limitations etc but they are people actively trying to solve those and and and at higher concentrations the technology with bioreactor is well established right biotransformations high value products etc and the idea is that they are now driving it to the lower concentrations with new materials new catalysts for instance and and and trying to get into uh a reasonable output reasonable speed reasonable rates of removal right um there is also a chemical processes uh like the um a photo catalyst approaches where you can use different lights and you can uh destroy directly uh methane or you can make it react with cover uh substances etc and there is also the the maybe perhaps in an earlier stage with more unknowns the manipulation of atmospheric chemistry right and that one atmospheric chemistry is a beautiful complex system that there is so little information and hard to constrain so then like i'm trying to understand not just the different reactions uh different uh movements dynamics priorities etc so so they're all they are in different stages of development with different unknowns uh but uh we do have this broad categories to which i invite our audience to actually check those details that we have listed in the report right to especially understand where is the biggest knowledge improvement that we need but we need it now like these technologies all the four of them are have a reasonable propositions with variable levels of understanding right and and but if we were to make all of them function we will have a shot to truly make that difference to truly remove the enough level of methane for to gain you know some time in the next decades or decades to deal with the co2 which is the constant problem right so so the methane is our quicker and speedier path to do at um um again in time towards the solutions that we all are looking not just in the methane space in the co2 space or also in the nitrous oxide space which uh you know i very much agree with debbie when she mentioned there is nitrous oxide and you know that's a problem and i'll tell debbie that that's also a problem coming from natural environments in and in large uh amounts and areas right so so yes these different categories uh are all progressing in different stages but we do need the immediate action of the scientific community uh of practitioners community as well through all of this process and perhaps i i i almost did not emphasize one final component and then then i'll i'll move gabby which is when we think about these solutions to remove methane they all tend to be at large scale uh large areas large materials uh types of processes well it will have a connection and interaction a consequence to the communities to uh the people living in the areas uh policy makers etc so as we develop these uh technologies we must do it in an integrated fashion with the social economical safety component that all of these technologies uh require yeah thanks this is actually a really important uh concept of this idea of responsible research and how really being uh intentional uh intentional especially when we're talking potentially about modifying some systems um like the atmosphere which we were doing unintentionally but uh this is this is where there's a lot um you know this is not just a computer program where you can tweak some knobs um and so let's i think before we go to um to audience questions uh just a rapid question for each of you debbie what do you see as the biggest opportunity in addressing methane in the coming years well i mean in order to answer that i think that i have to first say that the biggest concern i have right now that leads to the biggest opportunity is that climate change itself is starting to drive energy demand in massive ways and that energy demand thankfully is somewhat being met by renewables but a lot of it when you package in artificial intelligence and data centers and everything else is natural gas like we're going to be potentially using hugely more gas in our future which then means that you know my biggest takeaway is that dealing with the leakage of this gas and keeping it in a pipe becomes the biggest opportunity out there i mean it has always mattered but it is only going to matter more in in the years ahead thanks hensby i think it's very hard to rank because we need to do this multi-approach however if you if i were to pick i say we have the agricultural land management that will not require terrible changes to enhance this capacity to remove methane and the other one is like the forestry space because we are actively engaged in significant investment in reforesting in managing land in managing land in uh taking our resources from the forest right so those are very accessible activities are happening and adding the value the proposition value of methane removal it's very within our reach to make a significant number difference in terms of like the area process all right all right and so um we're gonna switch we're gonna go now to the audience q a section so just a reminder to the audience to please add questions to the slido um and we are uh we'll try we'll try to get to as many as we can here um i think uh just to get one of the distinctions i kind of want to get at that's between the mitigation and removal side we talk about atmospheric methane removal one of the distinctions we make is that atmospheric piece we're talking about already in the atmosphere 2 ppm very low concentration but we talked we touched on briefly some of these other sources that are higher concentration um and um hence with your work in landfills can you talk a little bit about what are the the options for for reducing emissions or capturing emissions uh from some of these uh agricultural landfill sources absolutely and i think debbie also have strong connections to some of the industrial practices because uh so the landfill is this big you know pile of decomposing material that it can it is actually engineered in many cases is now you have this engineer landfills where you can control processes that you not only now let it rot no you can have different layers of extraction uh from the landfill or pumping air or removing or removing or adding uh solutant solutions etc so you can think of this for the for the landsfills that i've been looking at you can think of this in two ways operations right leakage uh a different active or not or not active waste and then the next one is the long-term management and in the long-term management you could uh either promote uh methane uh methane uh limit the emissions you can promote the limit the emissions or you can do removal as well so think about after closure of the landfill uh you put a cover and the cover you can manage the type of vegetation the type of surface mounding or not mounding that you can have with that and that will make a difference for trapping uh what is coming from the bottom so carbon emissions or a can make a difference from what is surrounding which is also removing methane right so so that's once the landfill is closed the long-term post closure and then in the operations you can actually have a system in which i think there is a practice now where you reduce organic matter input right so you do that reduction exactly exactly composting you know and it's perfect it helps everyone we should all do composting for instance but even at the at a higher industrial level the the some landfills are starting to to do some level of reduction of organic entry right uh but after that happens you could also manipulate by the way the level of water just by recirculating a water in the landfill um and you could potentially alter the electron availability which leans to the metabolic activity of producing or not producing methane right or does that make more m2o uh that will be the the challenge then you you have to play this how much strength do i put into the repressing this system and what happened with the other output and if you find the right spot where you limit both of them then you could so so there is this there is significant a bottle level lab level testing and they all meet the challenge of can you run this at a whole landfill level you know and and that is scaling up right so so for instance we've been playing with some manipulation of metals uh which will lead to either enhance the pool uh for methanogenesis but in a way that is connected to high and effective removal right so you uh you actually turn that into a a opportunity to make a benefit to increase the methane so it's higher concentration so you can transform it uh or a you can just go all the all the way around which is a like just limit the ph and the sonogenesis will be very heavily challenged and then into production will also be challenged by a low ph uh what can you use that is an innocuous way to lower the ph that is where the the details start you know coming to be okay let's let's keep figuring out these these particular components that are viable and not too expensive and and so on so microbiologists biochemists there is work for you out there lots of stuff along with the engineers exactly uh debbie just did you um did you want to weigh in on that or um i've also questions for you on measurement yeah just a couple of thoughts on the landfill so carbon mapper in collaboration with the satellites um they're also seeing a lot of super emitting landfills it's been i think that was a little bit of a surprise how much methane leak can leak from and from a landfill but it also helps in being able to um differentiate the landfills which ones are failing and are they systematically failing and is it just a one-off failure or is this a constant failure so it can help actual experimentation i think in that space and then the only other thing is the feedback mechanism of food waste which is really the food waste that creates the methane and so the idea of um and that feeds into agriculture and the methane that comes from agriculture you know just trying to true up these systems as the world's population grows is just a good thing it starts to become virtuous if you do it right nice i like it and i'm going to pick up on that you mentioned what carbon mapper is seeing and of course there's now an array of additional satellites and observing uh platforms i think methane sat also launched last year and we've got a few i think the emit instrument on the space station um i was wondering if you could uh i think there's a great uh rma graphic on this that came out recently if you could talk a little bit more about uh the the technology the cost and the implications for moving from all right there's data that's an observation all the way to action and accountability yeah the very first thing becomes affording to collect the data and i think this is true for the non-profit satellites especially with carbon mapper and edf's methane sat because it's a costly endeavor you know not just to launch a satellite build build instruments and launch a satellite but to then take the data manage the data and turn it into something so i think that that procurement of data and it leads to the usefulness of that data which is incredibly helpful and then the data finds its way into decision making in very odd ways sometimes because companies and countries are very competitive that's helpful who wants to be the best who doesn't want to be the worst that is very helpful and then into the economy when it comes to pricing had the waste emission charge that epa put forth for methane been implemented and the super emitter program been implemented you could see that you would finally get a carbon tax out there which would be on methane and you could use this data to do that and then the third way is that especially in the oil and gas space these are markets you know buyers have certain purview over the market to say i don't want to buy high leakage gas i want to buy low leakage gas and so it starts to change the way the trade is done in the world and china's starting to lean into a lot of this to be you know cleaner and better than much of the world especially in renewables deployment but then also in how they manage and purchase different resources so i think that this data finds its way into so many aspects of policy making of economics of the way trade is done and mostly because once you can see it you can't really deny it i yes i'm gonna i think there's there's work that needs to be done to convert that and i think that there is actually you know the international methane emissions observatory and the i think the the value of some of these approaches that you're talking about like the european methane performance standard you know just internalize the cost right like that any good economist um for these things uh makes a lot of sense um i do want to pick up on um something that is a question from the audience and hints me go to go to you on on this question which is um around trade-offs and the how um the you know is it is the potential and scale for atmospheric methane removal how does that relate to other anthropogenic emissions and is there a risk of unintentionally prolonging uh emissions from oil and gas sector for example or other anthropogenic sources um or encouraging you know one of the risks like you know shift towards more more intensive agriculture where you have the potential to concentrate some of the gases how do you think about those kinds of interactions yeah that's an excellent and hard question right because on one end we do want to contribute to the solution of removing methane earning more time being able to uh you know improve conditions or avoid the conditions getting worse uh and on the other end we do want significant change right we do not want the sources that that made us wanted to start removing the methane and that made us have to restart removing methane we don't want them to continue we don't want to also intensify some of those practices at all right so so the the rationale will be as this is if you were not to take action now uh in both fronts in both or not just one not just removing right uh we will uh overpass the capacity uh that to to hold or to handle the current changes which i think we we have very limited capacity by the way and so so that's a along with the removal progression the progress in removing we do need to work just as hard or sometimes even harder on cutting the sources on on managing the sources better with the current tools current technology and all of that so we'll need to tackle both of them um that i yes thank you i think this is uh one of those kind of scale time issues and trade-offs and i think debbie you were talking about um it seems like future projections tend to agree about demand for oil plateauing but those projections actually range a lot more in terms of natural gas future demand and in a world where we need to manage actively all sorts of things moving water cooling and heating you know spaces all of those things um speaking of one of the solutions um that uh for uh shifting away from uh fossil fuel uh fossil fuel especially in in industry but also in electricity generation or at least um usage is hydrogen and wg i was wondering if you have had any thoughts about um currently most hydrogen is produced through natural natural gas steam reforming um what what are those interactions and and or is this something that you that you've thought about yeah and there are other i have um colleagues that work a lot on green hydrogen which is produced from water um but there are many shades of hydrogen and like you said the i don't know what we call it black hydrogen the hydrogen produced from methane itself from gas where it's or gray hydrogen where they where they it's a double whammy because not only do you need to get the methane the gas which can leak along the way of the supply chain for making that hydrogen but you have to blast it with steam and you make the steam with gas you heat up the water with gas and so it's really um an amplifier and it's from the 1930s that technology used a lot in oil refining that's where it was it evolved from because they used a lot of hydrogen in oil refining and they had gas wasted gas so they would blast steam at it and create the hydrogen so you know we're now nearing 100 years of very old technology and i think that there are real questions of how we would want to deal with you know and and get hydrogen and go more into there's a blue hydrogen space which is a blend of gas um of natural gas and hydrogen and how you re-inject a new carbon you know you capture the carbon sequester the co2 that comes out of the steam reform methane and you get you get your hydrogen that way but two things come to mind with hydrogen one is the systems can't leak you know hydrogen is even more explosive so we need to clean up our gas systems you know for natural gas now for the methane if we're going to do hydrogen big time anyway so we might as well get ahead of that and then another one just to be mindful of is that though it's weaker hydrogen is also a greenhouse gas so we just don't want to leak it comes kind of comes down to that wherever we go yeah and in hinsby you touched on one of the technologies approaches for atmospheric methane removal is to enhance the atmosphere's capacity to oxidize and remove methane and to debbie's point about leaking hydrogen you know one of the things we i think we touch on in the report is that competition for that that that oxidative capacity um and just i was wondering if you could um talk a little bit more about um removal technologies are there we talked about are they ready are there any that are that are shovel ready in your mind uh yes um so i'll address this question in two ways right like sources that uh i very much agree with uh the avoiding leaks and working extremely hard at avoiding rigs for the hydrogen technology because as as the book also reflects as the report reflects it will compete with one of the largest natural sinks of methane in the atmosphere it will take the same reactant right and by reacting and removing the availability of that reactant now the methane will have a longer lifespan and continue with this higher warming very nice ground uh a graphing a blanket right so so we have to be very very careful on that uh and because there is at least as far as we understood and analyzed we do not have a good shovel rate technology to mediate that type of uh reaction and ameliorate that type of reaction etc right so it will be one more challenge um to to the removal of methane even under the natural dynamics now of all the different technologies uh perhaps the ones that are closer right uh are are the the ecosystem services type uh in the sense that they will have a potentially less a lower number of unknowns with risk to it uh that also have a significant large areas to work that have in different levels active efforts that perhaps were not a focus on methane but that can be expandable to include methane um but i i do want to touch on on on one combination of of this uh reducing emissions plus a a improving removal enhancing removal right so so for instance yes i i have significant experience with engineer landfills and they're like marbles of technology as well but there is in many places landfills that have a more basic structure that do not have linings necessarily that are not highly complex with technology etc uh because there is a broad global population right within it's to manage the waste so and how do we in those places for instance reduce our emissions so so my proposal is is uh something that can access known technology as we discussed right organic matter is the source of your methane and composting is something that we understand well very effective and all of that but how do you demonstrate to let's say a local community somewhere in the tropics where i work a lot how do you demonstrate to them like this is beneficial financially better and environmentally like an outstanding approach uh so if you can establish a accessible monitoring point where you can literally see the method and we do this when we try to talk to local authorities like we can show you the method fluctuating from very little and to a huge plume of thousands of ppm right and and you could demonstrate in not in a long term term period you could demonstrate that if you start excluding the organic matter in that active phase of the landfill your emissions reduce quite a bit but not only that is what you can demonstrate you can also demonstrate that with the composting and the materials generated by the composting you engage that into your reforestation efforts and now you have more vigorous trees that also can remove the methane that you avoided that you were not able to avoid to emit right so so not only you reduce emissions but you also start capturing whatever was emitted either by your landfill or by surrounding other activities other areas so so i think that's very demonstrable we can work with local authorities in different parts of the world etc we just need the determination and the programs to be able to start doing this to address these different forms in which emission avoidance and removal can also work together and benefit each other nice debbie do you have anything to chime in on that one or i have i was going to pick up on the remove the lifetime question which i think is actually one that comes up a lot with methane that we didn't actually dive into at the beginning but one of the key concepts around uh how we think about methane and that i think a lot of people get stuck on is the idea that methane is relatively short lived compared to carbon dioxide so once carbon dioxide is put in the atmosphere it sticks around for you might cycle between the ocean and the the atmosphere and the surface ocean and the biosphere quickly but generally that's that carbon is going to that co2 is going to be there for centuries to millennia whereas methane is reactive and has an effective lifetime on the order of 10 years um what how do you debbie when you're when you're talking to people and trying to get them to uh think about why why methane won't solve itself it's going to go away in 10 years what what is what what what is is this an argument that you've heard and how how do you respond to that you know it's interesting i almost feel like we're in round two on climate action here you know we started 30 years ago on co2 and maybe we're just progressing as long as co2 lives it seems like the conversation just keeps going and going and the progress has been maybe slower i would argue than it could have been um i don't know if we've learned from that or if we're evidence there's more evidence of climate change around us but and the disasters that are happening pretty much you know all the time it's becoming more observable for the human eye for people and for you know local communities and disaster relief etc i feel like there's been a lot less pushback on methane and mitigating methane and having this conversation on methane removal than there had been on co2 for mitigation and removal i feel like that was a very long conversation that continues must continue and hopefully will really bear the fruit but methane has struck a chord in a good way i think it's really struck a chord maybe it's because it's partly a commodity it's recognized as a natural gas maybe because we now have satellites maybe because experienced what we went through with co2 maybe it's because we're seeing more disasters um it's seen as and maybe because it's short-lived you know get on it like you there's no waiting this is as immediate as it you know reacts very powerfully you need to stop it very quickly so i feel like there's been um there's way more to do but i feel like the attention from parties all different stakeholders is there which is why we're having this conversation yeah hensby do you want to weigh in on that i actually got distracted thinking about agriculture right thinking about how agriculture it's something we've been doing for a long time and release methane and methane may last a long time or not but you know in which other ways we can use agriculture to reduce the life of of methane and long long-term practices like tillage not tillage in agriculture uh or water management or even the type of crops crops combinations all of that is something we've been doing for for a while for significant times right but the the direct connection of that to methane life plan we have not done that so so i i've lately been very very attractive very um wanting to test and learning from my colleagues especially the the implications that the different practices that agriculture have and i'll give you a a simple example on that and reducing the lifetime of methane through removal right uh i live in phoenix arizona where water is very important and water management in a in an area where you have two crops or two harvest in a year it's a very active agricultural area right uh there are recent studies recent evidence where when you manage the water and actually reduce the the whole consumption of it so you say water in in the west uh you get similar crop yields with a significant reduction and added consumption of methane right so consumption of methane from those methanotrop those natural methanotropes the natural methanotropes that are in the soil however we do have to remember then we can add the next complexity which is well which type of crops and which type of crop management right because it's also having demonstrated that as you do land transformation uh into agriculture the natural methanotropes start dropping down right you drop the numbers and and that has to deal with the type of metabolism addition of fertilizers etc etc that displays them uh out of their energetic uh growth space right so so then then then the next question is like okay so not only it's a matter of managing water uh but it's now a matter of managing the geochemistry of agriculture how do you do that right and there are for instance like mineral additions mineral additions mineral surfaces that will enhance have been shown in a small scale to enhance the activity of these methanotropes to help perhaps the recovery in in in the advantage or disadvantage that they lost when the agricultural system came in right so so tillage and not tillage has a significant effect on co2 and that has been shown uh through different research uh tillage and not tillage would have a connection as well to how more or less challenge are uh methanotropes in these environments uh but it wouldn't be enough it wouldn't be sufficient to just change between different regimes uh it will be now a multi uh a drivers process to help us uh do both again like they reduce emissions avoid emissions and at the same time create the conditions that in the other periods they are removing as well so so yes i'm i'm uh i'm too excited about that type of a like potential area that agriculture moves and how we need to be putting more efforts on that and but i'm certainly that's affecting some level the lifespan of methane in the atmosphere excellent and so just i think we are coming close to the ends i want to give you each a time to to give some last thoughts i think um uh debbie went on that lifespan and you talked about the blankets before and i think i used the blowtorch example one of some of the examples that i'm hearing is actually the short lifetime is a benefit in terms of the speed at which if we reduce emissions if we actually can see a reduction in concentration we actually can get that climate benefit quickly and a lot of people don't realize that methane is actually contributing about a half a degree celsius to current warming so even though it's uh 200 times by volume less concentration in the atmosphere because it's so potent even though it's short-lived because we keep emitting it it actually is a very significant source of warming today but also potentially i think you're talking about kind of a throttle or an emergency break option as we work on the marathon of the energy system transitions to reduce co2 and so basically as that as a prompt i want to give you each uh starting with you debbie just a last minute uh what what are the key things that you you want want the audience to take away from our conversation today well first thank you so much gabby and to the national academy for even doing this and the fact that there are about a thousand people signed up to listen to this really does give me hope that there's so much interest in the varied questions like there's interest in every aspect of methane's mitigation and removal from all different sectors because i think it's that broad awareness for something that's invisible and odorless and is largely a waste product um it's it's really heartening to know that there are so many people thinking about this and i am very encouraged by the upcoming cop in brazil i think there's going to be a lot of discussion on methane there um and every climate action week i'm getting ready to go to london climate action week there are so many panels on methane i'm just um i'm i'm heartened by the awareness and the action out there but thank you for hosting this that's great hensby oh same it's such a pleasure and so exciting to to to have so many people interested in methane to have the national academies uh provide this avenue to to enhance this discussion um i would say that methane has been biologically produced since the beginning of life on earth really early records right methane has been a process to that microbes have mastered long long before we start started any industrial uh modifications of our atmosphere and thus the natural capacity to flux in a dynamic way this pool has existed uh but due to our activities imbalance our excess right we have now pushed it to a ways in which a we need to go back to nature and pick a lot of its potential a lot of its capacities but we need to support that we cannot continue emitting first we need to work uh with as many alternatives as possible provide the information that is needed to evaluate how do we reduce emission which is you know what we need to be doing along with our emergency break along with let's gain time with uh the capacity using the capacity of our technology or our ecosystems or our practices to also enhance that leverage that we can on this very dynamic faster turned type of gas so so i'm very excited and i do make a call of action to all our audience today to either interact with your local stakeholders policy makers scientists or industrial partners to take the available opportunities that there are around this subject around this discussion so i'm super excited to hear all the panels or the discussions in the next uh next large or global meetings for instance so thank you for the opportunity as well thanks cinsby and thank you to the national academies for giving us a chance to talk about reducing and removing methane emissions i think we've learned a lot about the different sources and some really exciting removal and just again all praise to the methanotrophs and microbes and all the amazing nature and ecosystems and uh but with the recognition that we are not going to be able to remove our way out of the problem alone that we need to also be putting in place some of these really available mitigation strategies from fixing leaks to composting uh to address this this super pollutant of methane and back to you fantastic thank you so much gabrielle for moderating today's informative conversation and all your work in this space deborah and his be thank you also for sharing your incredible insights to everyone who joined us today thank you again for your interest and excellent questions we did receive a few questions about hydrogen so i want to plug um our climate conversation from last june on this topic uh for our viewers we review all your feedback so please take time to take the survey linked below and let us know your thoughts on today's programming this conversation was recorded and will be available to view on the same page immediately after we end so the climate conversation series will be taking a break in july but please come back in august for our next climate conversation on educational pathways for a climate ready workforce keep an eye out for the registration in the climate newsletter thanks again to my colleague brent hurd on the board on energy and environmental systems and as always a big big thanks to all my national academy's colleagues and staff who supported today's event behind the scenes take care and we'll see everyone in august win Thank you.
