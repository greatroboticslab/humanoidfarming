 When I bought a farm in 2018, the person I bought the farm from actually had four tractors that were on a John Deere lease. And they had been kind of sold to someone and lease payments weren't being made. And so I negotiated a deal with John Deere and was able to take those lease payments over. And that worked out well for me because I had just bought the farm and I was trying to finance the press. And it probably wasn't a very good idea to take a bunch more debt on it.
