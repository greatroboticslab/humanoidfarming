Howto & Style
 I will never eat store-bought tomatoes again after learning these tricks. Homegrown is the way to go. Let me show you how. First, pick a sunny spot. Tomatoes love sunshine. Next, plant them deep. The deeper you go, the stronger the roots. Water them in the morning, not at night. Nobody likes soggy roots. Add mulch to lock in moisture and keep weeds away. Pinch off the bottom leaves so your plant focuses on growing fruit, not just looking leafy. And remember, talk to your tomatoes. Okay, maybe that last one's just for fun. Happy growing, and get ready for the juiciest tomatoes ever.
