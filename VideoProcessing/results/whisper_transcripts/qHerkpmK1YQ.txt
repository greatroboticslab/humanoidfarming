Howto & Style
 Did you know that you can use two buckets to make your own compost in the kitchen? Bokashi is a Japanese word which means fading away. It's a great way to reduce your food waste using an anaerobic fermentation process which works in any indoor space with no smell, no pests and you can compost almost anything. You can use the liquid as a nutrient rich tea for your garden or houseplants and you can donate the waste to friends, family or community gardens which will happily use it to add nutrients to the garden.
