Mowing More Hay

 Alright guys, so it's the same day as that previous video just later in the evening. The forecast for Sunday changed. Looks like it's going to be nice all the way to Wednesday. So I made the decision to just get as much cut as I can. So I am knocking down a lot of hay. Now, for some guys it's not a lot, but for my operation while I do things it's pretty much. So, I'm going to try to get this one cut too, but not yet. Oh, well I almost gauged it perfectly. I'm going to shut the hay bine off for a second here. I almost gauged it perfectly. I only have a little slice through the center. That gets to be a pain when you try to go back and try to straddle your two ends without dragging lumps through. What I usually do when I just have a little slice, I just let the hay bine cut about that high off the ground. That way you're not dragging what you already mowed through it. With a disc bine, I don't know if that's an issue. I can't remember. But as I'm working into the center, I try to take a little more or less, depending on what I have left. So there's the soybeans are looking good. And this corn is hit and miss. This was the one that had a terrible stand on this end. Got a lot of weeds coming up. But it does look better than last year. Now let me... I'm going to get off and walk around here. Oh, that field takes about three hours to mow, if I had to guess. Whew. Foxtail. This stuff is not easy to control. And I'm not the only guy that has it. My neighbor was talking about it. He's tried different stuff. And I think he has more than I do. He was trying to control it. I haven't been. And I think he has more of it. But I'm seeing some grasshoppers. But not a terrible plague. So what do we got here? This was the corn that I was kind of upset with in the spring. We got some there. Let's just walk in here. While I'm up here... Yeah, this is all... This is what I don't like. This open... This open area. You can see the weeds. You had no canopy. And if you look at the ground... Hopefully the camera is picking up all of the... All the rocks. That probably has something to do with the stand here. Walk out here a little bit. Yeah, there's... This is a real shaly spot. You see all the weeds coming up in here. I don't know if it's worthwhile to come in here with the backpack sprayer or not. I don't know. And it's funny. You get... It's like here. The planter started working again. And then here there's nothing. And then out there you can see... I don't know. This is a little bit of a dip. That could have something to do with it too. Crows are working on it. And what do we have in here? Crow damage. Yeah, and when you have exposed corn like this that the crows can get into... They have a lot harder time getting it down in 30 inch rows with the leaves. They can't get to it. Usually they only pick the outside rows. And when you have open space like this they have room to maneuver and start plucking corn on you. So I'm surprised though how tall it is. This ground was poor. I consider this ground poor. So if I'm there 6 foot 2. What do we got there? It's probably 9, 10 feet tall. If it wasn't for the rain... I was just thinking while I was mowing... Guys that... Don't believe in fertilizer probably made out this year. And guys that do believe in fertilizer... Like myself... Now I didn't get to go as wild as I wanted to. I really wanted to fertilize... I want to be somebody that fertilizes heavy. I'm trying to work up to that. I can't just go all in in one year. It has to be gradual. But guys that do fertilize heavy... I think with the amount of rain... They lost a lot of it. So some things... Some fertilizers don't move in the soil. You put them there. They will stay there. They won't leach. But like your nitrogen and stuff like that... Is going to move around. So yeah... I don't know. This will be... I'm not going corn on corn with this field. I'll probably go back to beans next year. Yeah, we got a lot of weeds. And then where it's shaded... It's not bad. So... Hey, it is what it is. Rocky ground here. It's still pretty wet. So yeah, we got a weed patch here in the middle. Alright, let's look at some beans while I'm out. I'm kind of... I didn't take much footage of cutting this field. And I think you guys have seen... My hay making process... Pretty well in depth this year and last year. I just have that one little strip to go... And then I'm about finished. I might head tonight yet too. I don't know. I'm pretty tired. I was up at 3 a.m. today. But... Try to leave the hay in the field... Instead of dragging it back down. So we'll look at some beans here. Here you can see the... Last strip... It's probably going to look a little ugly. I didn't judge it quite right. But... It's going to be wet for a while. But I'm pretty confident in the forecast. And if it gets rained on, it gets rained on. I'm... Pretty well... Burning out on hay making. But anyway... Oh man, these are nice beans. I try to... I'll kneel down here and just... Well, maybe I'll just walk in the row and... I can't even find... 15 inch rows. I can't see where they're... If I can find a row here. There's a row. They're at my belt line. Man, these beans are nice. These are the nicest beans I've ever had here. You can see the... Probably the grasshoppers have been working on them. And the pods. Oh my gosh. If I can get... The camera. Starting all the way at the top. Panning down. Man, they're just loaded. I... I don't know. The rain was kind of a... Mixed blessing. I mean, this is... This here is probably going to be 60 or... 65 bushel beans. Now, down in there. You can see there's... Where the water... Had washed... Through with all the rain. And I noticed when I was cutting... There's a nasty yellow spot down in there. I don't know if that's where the water was sitting. But man, these are nice beans. Just can't get over how tall they are. I want to check this wash out here. The waterway project is going to happen. I... Tried to get out of it and found out you can't really. Yeah, you can see where the water... You can see where the water washed. But the beans here... For the most part... Now, these aren't gonna... Maybe. I think... If they can... We need a windy day to stand them back up. But... This waterway is gonna happen. I tried to get out of it. Like I say, it wasn't my idea. But... There is no getting out of a government contract. I found out the hard way. So, yeah. There's some hole... Yeah, there's some grasshoppers. But it's not a... I'm not gonna get too excited. I've seen grasshopper damage on some farms. And... I've seen when they really get bad. And I probably should start thinking about... Spraying them for them. But... I don't know. I'm not up on my pesticides versus the herbicides. And I don't want to kill any ladybugs. Because if you remember my soybean tour video... These plants were filled with ladybugs. But... Boy, these beans are just wonderful. And the weed control is excellent. Boy, if we get half-decent prices in the fall... Should be a Merry Christmas. And, hey... The money will be spent already, I'm sure. I need lime. Lime. If you remember, I was gonna put some on every year. So, we need lime. I want to try to get double what I put on last year. These fields were limed. But... Going to a lot more corn acres. Corn has a lot more upfront costs than hay. Hay's already here. It's already planted. But, again... I can't sell the hay that I'm making. It's not selling. Versus the corn, which can be sold every year. Plus the time that it takes for the hay making. Hey, I'm gonna keep some. Don't get me wrong. You're always gonna see PA Farms making hay. But... Just not to the scale that I'm on now. So... Yeah. It's... Shaping up to be a half-decent year. As long as we don't get a hail storm or anything nasty. Still room for improvement. The corn needs some work. Mainly with the stand. With the planter. So, all in all... Feeling pretty good how things are looking. So, like I say, the rain was a mixed blessing, I guess. Or mixed curse. Whatever you want to call it. And with these two fields now mowed, I'm probably about a quarter of the way done with the hay making. So... Gotta keep an eye on the forecast. Gonna ted this apart maybe tonight. So it's all laying flat. Ted it tomorrow. See what Saturday looks like. Maybe we can start baling. Uh... Like I say, this is sold. So you can't beat that. So let me, uh... Mow this last little strip here. And I talked for over 11 minutes in this clip. Alright guys. Have a good day. I'll see you tomorrow. I'll keep the videos coming. Keep you updated. And I'll let you know where we're at. Cheers! Cheers! Cheers! g Cheers! Cheers!utt nail drafted rick rick
