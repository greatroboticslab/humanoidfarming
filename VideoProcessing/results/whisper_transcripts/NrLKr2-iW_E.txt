 What's going on gardeners? In today's video I'm going to show you how to make free drip irrigation for your garden and potted plants. Drip irrigation has been a game changer for me in my garden. Drip irrigation has three distinct benefits. Number one, drip irrigation is more efficient than overhead watering because you can target the root areas at each plant instead of watering empty space in between rows and plants. Number two, drip irrigation doesn't spread disease like overhead watering. By targeting the soil only you will keep your plants dry and discourage bacterial and fungal growth. And number three, drip irrigation slowly introduces water to soil which waters your plants deeply. Overhead watering often rushes away from soil when it becomes dry which only provides poor quality shallow watering. Now the downside of drip irrigation is a full setup can be expensive and complicated to set up but did you know all you need to make free drip irrigation is leftover gallon milk or water jugs? You simply fill the jugs with water, gently puncture the bottom of the jugs with a firm pin, and the jugs will provide a slow steady stream of drip water to your plants for hours. These jugs can also be filled with a soluble fertilizer that can provide a slow steady drip of nutrients to your plants, watering them more deeply than you can with any kind of overhead watering setup like a watering can full of fertilizer. These jugs can be placed next to your plants in your garden rows or even placed inside containers to provide a slow drip of water to your container garden. I've had instances where I've had to leave my house for long weekends. Many of my container plants cannot survive two to three days without being watered but by placing these jugs in the pots they provide a slow enough drip to keep the plants moist for an entire extra day stretching how long I can be away without watering them. Using these leftover jugs you can save time, save water, increase the amount of time between watering your garden or your container plants, and water and fertilize them more deeply than you could before. All completely for free.
