Howto & Style
 Most people don't harvest their herbs the right way. So I'm going to show you how to do it in a way that gives you more herbs the next time you harvest. Let's look at this thyme. This is the center of the plant. But as thyme grows, the stems actually put roots down on the surface. I trace the stem down close to the base and cut. That makes it easy to strip the stem, giving me my thyme. And I can even cut off the tip, strip the tip, and place it back in the soil to root up. Now let's move on to basil. The idea with basil is to harvest as much as you need while shaping the plant at the same time. So cut right above two sets of leaves. Now I've taken off this vertical height and this will go to the left and this one will go to the right. So I have a bunch of fresh basil and the plant is nicely shaped to blow up with more growth. What about something like garlic chives? Well, you could just pull one small bunch out. But in this case, it's better to trim it like a hedge. Now you've got a bunch of chives, but the growing centers are untouched. These tips help me keep an herb garden well-maintained and productive at the same time, all without taking a whole lot of work.
