 Preserving philodendron white wizard tissue culture plantlets. First, I'm separating the cluster of plants. Moving them over to the first solution. Now coating them fully still in solution number when using a pipette and forceps. Moving them over to solution number to seal them. After 15 minutes, you can remove them. Final product can be preserved in a fridge for up to a year. Would you try it?
