 Look, this handy tool is a manual corn thresher. No need for fuel, just your hands. It works like a table sharpener, easy, compact, and perfect for small farmers. It handles one dried corn cob at a time, so while it's not the fastest, it's a reliable backup if the mechanical thresher ever fails. In rural villages, bagging corn usually requires two people. One shovels the kernels while the other patiently holds the bag. But with this device, one person can do it alone. Plus, the wheels make transport a breeze. This hollow shovel separates kernels from the cobs with ease. No need to bend down or manually pick them out. Your back will thank you later. Lastly, the iron sieve. Think of it like the hollow shovel, but with finer holes. Perfect for sorting kernels or even sifting sand and gravel. Separating the cobs and other unwanted plant material manually couldn't be easier.
