 Pesticide is the collective term given to insecticides, fungicides and herbicides and they're used to control pests and diseases and weeds. Organic Principles and its farmers take a nature-friendly approach to farming, managing pests and diseases and weeds without the use of chemicals. Nature is really good at combating pests and diseases and organic farmers on farms of all sizes work with nature to avoid using pesticides. Despite this approach, in a small number of circumstances due to a lack of current alternatives, organic farmers must still rely on a very small number of pesticides under strict conditions of use. We'd all like to see the elimination of pesticides from organic farming and through innovative farming research, through the opportunities of biological controls and the campaigning work that the Soil Association does, we really hope that we can move towards a pesticide-free organic future.
