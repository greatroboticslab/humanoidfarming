 Music John Deere has taken the worry out of haymaking with five new models of disc mowers ranging from five to ten feet in cutting width. Stronger components and enhanced features mean you can cut with confidence and get more uptime. Even in the cleanest fields, you'll find old metal fence posts and other debris that can damage the cutter bar. That's why our new disc mowers come with great features to keep you running. The new breakaway feature absorbs the impact on the mower when the cutter bar impacts an object, reducing damage. In the event that you do impact the cutter bar, we've made servicing your machine easier with a new easy-to-remove quill. We've also designed new high-capacity bearings to increase the life of high-wear components so you can cut with confidence under heavy crop conditions. And to make using these disc mowers even easier, we've added time-saving features that will take the pain out of making hay. For example, our new larger cylinder, coupled with a heavy-duty cutter bar, allows you to mow at steeper angles in uneven terrain so you can cut more easily in fields, ditches, and terraces. With the new optional transport tilt cylinder, there is no need to leave the cab when entering transport mode, saving you valuable time in the field. And lastly, our new heavy-duty cutter bar reduces the need for oil changes, increasing your uptime, lowering the cost of your operation, and minimizing service done on the machine. With all these improvements, you can be sure our new lineup of disc mowers will be easier to use, faster to service, and stronger in the field.
