 The first thing you need to do is prepare your space. Then it's just a matter of setting your bales in place with whatever design that you want. You can do asymmetrical shapes, spirals, lines, whatever. Just do not put any more than two bales side by side. And you want to make sure to have the cut ends facing up. Now you season them. This is the method in which you put a high nitrogen fertilizer on slash in these bales for a certain amount of time while keeping them well watered throughout the whole process. You're also looking for a change in color. You want the bales to become darker. Mushrooms are also a really good sign. Now that your bales are seasoned and you've checked the temperature and to assure that it was under 100 degrees, now all you do is plant those vegetables you've been dying to get in the dirt all winter. And that is it. You have successfully become a straw bale gardener with no tilling, no weeding. All you got to do is water the whole year.
