 This spring I drove my brother's tractor 100 miles from his farm to my field. We're using a 12-row John Deere Planner ground drive and this was my first time planting on my own. I was planting Pioneer and Wiffle's corn seed at roughly 2.5 to 2.75 depth. The corn emerged in 7 days at a fairly good population of 32,000. And the first few weeks after planting were quite dry, but now recently we've got some good rains and the field total is sitting at 7 inches since planting. So now the corn is really starting to take off and things are looking good. I'm excited for harvest.
