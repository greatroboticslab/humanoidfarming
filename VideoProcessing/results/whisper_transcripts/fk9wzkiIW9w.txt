 Farmers have never backed down from a challenge. No dawn too early, no hours too long. Farmers grow possibility from the ground up. They face every challenge with resilience. Even as the population increases, weather changes, and threats come from every direction. Corteva Agriscience is creating tools to support farmers and food security worldwide, using scientific breakthroughs to strengthen what farming has always done. Persevere. Advance seed breeding to create higher yield potential. Crop protection solutions to combat threats new and old. And nutrient maximizers to make crops planted even more efficient. Corteva is devoted to supporting farmers around the world through whatever challenges come their way. Because farming is never about just one hurdle, and it's never about just one harvest. It's about creating sustainable solutions for decades, battling threats that change continuously, and a global food system that starts with farming. That's why Corteva is endlessly innovating new ways to support those who support us all.
