 Unraveling the mystery of crop circles, hoax, hidden energy, or something not of this world? Just people being silly. And then I watched a whole documentary about how the energy that bent these things over caused these nodes to explode as if they had been cooked in a microwave. Correct. What? And then you find out that the actual stalks are woven together. Correct. It's not that they're pressed down. They're woven together. And that these are complex geometric designs that would have taken people weeks to map out. And there's no footprints leading up to it. There's no roads, no machinery, no evidence of any use of any kind of machinery. And these things appear like that. Like people have flown over an area and then flown back an hour or two later. And there's immense football field size, perfect geometry that no one can explain how it was created. Correct. So the nodes in the stalks, a node is like a knuckle on your fingers. So those are there for phototropism to bend toward light. So what you're talking about is these things are bent over. They're bent over at right angles. It can only be done with high energy. But also around these crop circles, they're finding microscopic metallic spheroids in around the circle. And that's not a conspiracy theory. They're finding them. And there are these magnetic fields around the circles. And you can see videos online of people going into these crop circles and their hands start to get red. Things are happening to them. So I went into crop circles thinking it was all guys with boards. But then when you watch people with boards make a crop circle, it's a mess. They can't do this. And you cannot bend the nodes of reeds and weave them together in a perfect...you can't do it. So that was as I'm doing the research, I'm like, all right, 99% of them are fake. But there's this 1% that I cannot explain. The famous video where you see the orbs circling around the field in England, and then the crop circle slowly starts to emerge. Has that been debunked? Semi. It's controversial. Because the guy released that video, I don't know his name offhand, allegedly went to a visual effects house. Oh boy. And released it, but they somehow put that thing together in a matter of hours, which is suspicious. So in my episode on it, I said, all right, here's what the skeptics say. But in the 1990s to do that kind of VFX work, because it looks real. I don't know. To me, I'm on the fence about it. It's very convenient that they got the footage. It is. It is. Operation Blackbird was a famous operation in 1990 to try and capture the footage live by a great researcher named Colin Andrews. And he's the guy that does the books on crop circles, right? Yes. He's all in. He's all in. And he got a lot of support for Blackbird. And not only did nothing happen, he was totally embarrassed by it. And it was all streaming live. And a lot of people were involved. He's embarrassed. We find out later that while they're waiting for the circles to happen, just a few miles away, there's a top secret military operation doing whatever they're doing. He doesn't know why. And then he gets a knock on the door from someone, you know, men in black, whoever it is, that first offers him money to stop his work, then threatens him with whatever, threatens his family. And he doesn't know who this guy is. They go back and look at the tapes and he sees the guy in the background of like one of the TV crews. So the theory is some type of intelligence was embedded into Blackbird, made to discredit him. And that was kind of the end of Colin Andrews because he was a legit researcher at that point. Now he's fringe. Now he's pseudoscience. But I get into that in the episode. That was something I discovered. I never knew that there was intelligence involved. I didn't know that there was a military op, which is confirmed. It's wild. So do you think they discredited him on purpose? Yes. I don't know how to make the crop circle thing, but like what is the crop circle thing? Like what is the out of the belief? What is the best theory? The believers is that it's a way to message craft or it's a landing site or it's some type of communication. Why would they do it in wheat? I don't know. It doesn't make sense to me. If you have the technology, just, you know, pick up the phone. You know, there's better ways than just mowing wheat down. But I don't understand. Do you know the one about the Mandelbrot set? I've seen it. Yeah. I think that one is really weird because I think it coincides with the fractal creation of the Mandelbrot set by these people that are into this kind of geometry and fractal. They're like someone made the Mandelbrot set, which is essentially an infinite fractal of like spectacular design. And this is before Lorenz and the Lorenza tractor. I think it's before that, isn't it? I don't know. Before it was mainstream. Yeah, before it was mainstream. Yes. And then when this thing appears and people are like, well, what is this design? And then they connect it to this Mandelbrot set, which is someone would have to have some very esoteric information. And it's the Mandelbrot set using Fibonacci numbers. Yes. And the fee, the golden ratio. And it's accurate. And it's accurate down to inches. Yeah. You can't do that. Well, maybe you can, but like how and how long would it take and how much planning and how many people and what would you use? Like what is the technology they would use to bend those things over that way and weave them? And it's like, I think it's weird stuff. It's weird. Because it's these, you know, the way these fractals work, it's this ratio in the, in the geometry is like their specific sizes. This one is half the size of that one, which is half the size of that one, which is that and it goes on and on forever. And when you see it all, see if you can find the Mandelbrot set. It's maybe the most spectacular crop circle. It's weird. It's really weird. Cause it's fucking enormous. You know, and it seems so stupid. Wow. There's a whole bunch of them. The Mandelbrot set is the one with the look like a heart about that one right there. Yeah. That's it. That's the Mandelbrot set. Yep. And there's some other fractals there as well. I was looking at an article that says these two guys took on the challenge and did it for a TV show on the BB. They did. If you watch them do it, it's clumsy AF. Yeah. It doesn't look as good. Like, like, cause I know they always say that these guys did it, but like, you can't really see it there, but those flattened reeds, they're, they're woven together. So the, the, some of the weirder ones go back to other crop circles. You had some other images before that. There was some other ones that, those ones, those spirals. Right. Like that one right there. Yeah. Yeah. That is. That's wild. Like this is multiple football fields long and wide. So how make that one a little bigger, please. And one of these, I don't know if it's that one in particular showed up right next to Stonehenge. Like, like a tennis ball throw away. Like that is great to not, first of all, if you're on the ground, all right, just the measurements alone to make each one the equal distance between circles, you know, in the whatever, six different blades that you have that stem from the center. They're all the same distance. They're all the same size. The small circles are the ones that are most interesting because how hard is that to do? Right. Right. And they're uniform. And it's like, what is that? Like what the fuck is that? And who's do, if that is a hoax, it's so bizarre that it's only these two goofballs that were making really shitty ones with boards and string. And yet there's hundreds, if not thousands of these like really complex ones. Yeah. Those are the guys that are on, you can see them doing it live. And with those guys, there's no way they had enough time to do all these things. And it looked terrible. It was Yankee. Look, he's just trampling it. I mean, look, you can certainly make crop circles with a string and a board. You certainly can make crop circles, but you're, and you know, it always gets connected, like believing in aliens and everything else, but it's not, no one's even saying aliens. Like it could be some sort of energy from something that we possess, something that humans possess that they somehow or another aim at these areas. Like what is that one above it? Go, go that one right there above, like right, right there. What the fuck is that? Look at that. They are in the same count. 80% of them come counting. Which is also weird. Now people will correct me in the comments, but I believe that middle piece of geometry is a hybrid, isn't it? Isn't that a four dimensional cube? I don't know. A tesseract? What? How long would that take? That seems like that would take a long time to do. Stonehenge is under constant surveillance and circles show up overnight. Very tough. There's an interesting conspiracy to crop circles that we can get into later. Wiltshire has the most crop circles. Yes. And it's mostly in England too, which is also. And it's mostly in Wiltshire. Is there some sort of a theory by the kooks? Ley lines. Ley lines. That they're happening on these segments of energy that intersect. What is that black and white? Click on that one. It's just a different. No, no, no, no, no. The one, that. What the fuck is that? Wow. On a mountain. That's great. It could be in sand, I think. Because this is like sand. Is that what that is? That's great. I've never seen that one. I mean, just the amount of time that it would take. So, ley lines. So this is the theory? That's the theory. Have you heard about ley lines? Kind of. It's this alleged grid of energy that circles the earth. And almost like how magnetic fields work. And these energy lines have intersection points. And on these intersection points are things like Stonehenge, Giza, Snow. Wow. Oh. Where are the tracks in? What? You know, it. Okay. What the fuck is that? So this is. No footprints, no tracks. Footprints right here. Yeah, but that could be. Where? That could be the people that discovered. Right. Oh, this is the guy that did it though. Oh, the guy. The artist that did this. These aren't crop circles. This is an artist doing it. Oh, I see. Fucking incredible. An artist did that? Yeah, it has the guy's name on that first picture we had here. Amazing. Simon Beck. So the artist's angle is a conspiracy angle. There's a man named John Lundberg who was part of a group called circlemakers.org, which is an art project and also a sociology experiment. He would make fake crop circles to see how people would react. Years later, Lundberg and some associates create a documentary called Mirage Men, which is an excellent documentary. It's mostly about Richard Doty and his disinformation campaign on behalf of the Air Force to discredit the UFO community. Drove Paul Benowitz nuts. Bill, Bill Moore, who's the, who's the guy who essentially brought Roswell out to the public. Bill Moore was taking payments and being fed information from Doty to muddy the waters in the UFO community. He finally came clean in 89, was booed off the stage at MUFON and everything just unraveled. So it's all this info. They booed him off the stage. Because he finally said, look, I've been working with the government. A lot of the stuff I've been saying, they told me to say. Majestic 12, all this stuff was coming from Doty and they didn't want to hear it. They didn't want to hear it. His career was basically over that day. Bill Moore, he, there was no Roswell story before Moore, before his book. And you know, that was Doty. So the documentary about Doty was directed and put together by Lundberg and his associates. Lundberg was one of the original circle makers that would make these fake crop circles to see how people act. I just thought it was an interesting connection. But it's interesting because clearly some people are making, but like, what was the origins of it? Because I'm sure you've seen that image from the newspaper of the devil with a scythe. You know what I mean? And they're talking about crop circles like back in like the 17 and 1800s. Yeah, 1600s. Wow. First crop circle ever reported was in 1678. According to the story, farmer, a crop mower, were arguing about the cost of harvesting the farmer's oat field. The farmer was furious at the mower's price and stormed off swearing that the devil himself should harvest the crop. That night a dazzling light lit up the oat field and in the morning, the farmer discovered perfectly round circles in his crop. He was so frightened by the circles which he thought could only have been so neatly mowed by the devil or some infernal spirit that he abandoned any attempt to harvest the field. You're scared of circles. Uh, really though? If there were crop circles in my backyard, I would be a little nervous. I would be curious. It's not terrifying, right? Mm-hmm. They're not something that would scare me away from harvesting my crop. No, I'm more afraid of the government than I am of, you know, that stuff. Yeah. Crop circles don't seem to be killing anybody. No. But it's like, what are, so ley lines. So these things are to differentiate areas so they could see them from the sky? Is that the idea? The ley lines are the energy lines. Mm-hmm. Whatever, a mystical energy. It's not a scientific energy. And where the lines intersect is where you see sites like Machu Picchu, Giza, Stonehenge, all these ancient sites. There's the ley lines. Oh. But ley lines is, you know, it's semi-debunkable because if you connect enough lines, you're going to find patterns. You're going to find geometry. Right, right, right. You go looking for it. Right. You go looking for it. They are real close. You do make a with an image that you've got here. You should set off the reactions when you're sending photos on some of any of the space of data. See, sure, what gives you a picture of you? Stop learning the language. Let's see if you're in a race. Don't get a path over there. You can see your camera. No. But mayor jonah has got a hyd Economics at Bayonic Takewater. You can see your دیک hacerlo, despite that. So maybe tie your develop hue or something, like, have created Any Thief?
