Howto & Style
 Do you remember when I shared this video about my rotting potatoes and how I planted them in the garden to grow new potatoes? Oh my god! Well I'm ashamed to tell you this but it's happened again. These ones have been chitting aka sprouting for a while. Some with sprouts long enough to braid. I promise I'm not proud of this but at least I can regrow them. Each eye on the potato can be planted individually. Just cut it into sections. Now this time I'm using an old laundry basket to grow them and lining the sides with cardboard but really any container with drainage will do. Add a few inches of soil followed by your potato entree and then water them in. As they grow you just gradually add more soil until you eventually fill the container. Have you ever regrown your own potatoes? Let me know in the comments.
