 Having a small garden doesn't mean you can't have big harvest. Here's some tips for getting the most out of your space. The first tip is grow up. Growing vertically can save a lot of space in the garden, especially with big vining plants like cucumbers, melons, and squash. For bigger things like watermelons and squash, you can make easy slings to help support their weight. The second tip is to grow lower growing plants under taller ones. I stake all of my tomatoes and I prune off the stems 12 inches from the ground, so there's a lot of empty space underneath. I use that space to grow things like carrots, green onions, basil, dwarf cosmos, and marigolds. And the third tip is to plant closer together. Good spacing is important for some plants, but others don't mind being crowded. In fact, they can grow better. Things like lettuce, spinach, kale, cilantro, and parsley. If you plant these closer together, as they mature, they'll shade out the soil underneath. This creates cooler soil temperatures, which these crops prefer.
