 Has no one actually noticed? Farmer Rick is nothing but a puppet. He never intended to save the cloned Mortys. We've all been deceived by this Morty. While watching the latest Rick and Morty episode, did you happen to notice this cloned Rick? He said to Farmer Rick, we only shot you a few times. You didn't need to go this far. Maybe you think this line isn't odd, but think again. The reason Farmer Rick chose to destroy New Rick City wasn't because he was attacked. It's because when he returned to his farm, he found not only had his house been burned down, his beloved alien pig had been burned to a skeleton, and even the photo of his favorite female singer had been defaced with graffiti. This was the last straw for Farmer Rick. Connecting the dots with the cloned Rick's previous actions, Farmer Rick concluded that they were responsible for all of this. But this Rick claimed that they'd only attacked Farmer Rick. So who was really behind all this? You'd never guess. It was this Morty from the general store. If you don't believe me, think about why he knew that Farmer Rick was going for revenge. When did he sneak into Farmer Rick's car? More importantly, look at the Morty beside him. When talking to Farmer Rick, this Morty stuttered nervously, clearly hiding something. This makes it clear that the ones who destroyed Farmer Rick's home were these two Mortys. And their reason was simple. To use Farmer Rick to destroy New Rick City and regain their freedom. And Farmer Rick was the only one on this planet who could do it.
