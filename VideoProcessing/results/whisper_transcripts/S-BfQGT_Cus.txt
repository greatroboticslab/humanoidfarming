 For me, it was going from 50 to 30 series John Deere's was really a big jump. So what I did is I got on Tracker House and I found two 30 series in Ida. We paid like 79,000 for it. High hour at about 7,000 hours a time. So I ran almost 20 years with older equipment. I still felt like I couldn't afford it, but I knew that I had to make a change.
