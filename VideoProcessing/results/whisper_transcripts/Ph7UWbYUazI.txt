 This is China's duck army, where the Chinese raise hundreds of thousands of white ducks on their farms. When the ducks are small, they are released into the crop fields to eat weeds and insects. This benefits farmers immensely, as they don't need pesticides or fertilizers to protect their crops, resulting in a significantly higher yield. Once the ducks mature, the farmers collect and sell their eggs by the thousands. The farmers also profit from selling the ducks themselves.
