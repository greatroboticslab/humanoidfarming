 The lovely thing about agriculture is it really is a small community and everyone knows each other. I'm Hardy and I'm training manager here at UQ Skills. Yeah so my background before working here at UQ Skills was I was in secondary education for around 15 years but before that I worked in animal health and veterinary sciences and have completed a number of different jobs along the way which has been great experiences that we can give our trainees. So for example I was a firefighter for a number of years and that diversity of experience allows us to give real-world exposure for our students. Training at UQ Skills is a fantastic opportunity for us to be able to give back to industry. Industry has been so supportive of our graduates but one of the things that keeps me training and keeps me passionate about our students and our programs is that we can train best practice here at UQ Skills keeping it not only ourselves current but also our students undertaking current learning. So when they go back on the farm we know they're not only improving farm safety which is a massive national issue but it's also ensuring that where our students go they take best practice with them. It's really lovely being part of the agriculture sector. UQ Skills has a massive number of industry relationships and on a daily basis we engage with industry along with our students who not only can undertake industry-based training and work-based program learning but we also can relate to those industry-based partners ensuring that our students are really well renowned for that pathway into their future careers. So the agriculture industry is a really dynamic industry and yesteryear we had a large workforce that was low-level work. Modern agriculture is changing and our programs are trying to keep up with that and making sure that our students are ready to walk out with that paraprofessional and technical knowledge that they're going to need to hit the ground running.
