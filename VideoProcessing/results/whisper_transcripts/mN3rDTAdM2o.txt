 My winter nights are taken up by static stress and holiday shopping traffic But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else Just like magic In my heart is a Christmas tree farm where the people would come To dance under sparkling lights Fundled up in their mittens and coats and the cider would flow And I just wanna be there tonight Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon, mistakes are forgiven And everything is icy and blue And you would be there too Under the mistletoe Watching the fire glow And telling me I love you Just being in your arms Take me back to that little farm Where every wish comes true In my heart is a Christmas tree farm There's a light in the barn We run inside out from the cold In the town kids are dreaming of sleighs And they're warm and they're safe They wake to see a blanket of snow Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon, mistakes are forgiven And everything is icy and blue And you would be there too Under the mistletoe Watching the fire glow Telling me I love you Telling me I love you Just being in your arms Take me back to that little farm Where every wish comes true And when I'm feeling alone You remind me of home You remind me of home You remind me of home Oh baby, baby Merry Christmas And when the world isn't there I pretend that we're there Baby, baby Merry Christmas To you Under the mistletoe To you Watching the fire glow To you Baby, baby Merry Christmas Baby, baby Baby, baby, Merry Christmas When it's come true I love you
