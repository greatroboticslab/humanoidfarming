Nonprofits & Activism
 So today I've got an hour to distill all of the world of principles, practices, and barriers into 60 minutes. And again, as with most of this stuff, I'm still learning every day. And I feel like I know about this much about principles, practices, and barriers, because there's so many experts out there that know so much more. So it's okay to feel like you don't know what you're doing and just absorb what you can and become conversant and inspired, right? That's really the goal for you to become messengers and to help other farmers that you're working with to be interested in the stuff and to do the learning that they want you to do. So what we'll talk about today, principles, practices, barriers. I'm going to come back to the four soil health principles that we touched on yesterday. And we're going to dive a little bit more into those principles. So what are those principles? Hold on a sec. I'm not quite seeing the right screen here. There we go. Okay. So minimizing disturbance, we're going to talk about why it is that we want to minimize disturbance and what is minimizing disturbance? What does that even mean? Maximizing soil cover, maximizing biodiversity, maximizing continuous living roots, what that means, and what that means about adapting to context, adapting to the farm, adapting to the unique system. We're going to get into a bit of that today. And there's a whole world beyond that. So we will just kind of touch on it. But hopefully give you the basics so that you can have that conversation with the next landowner that you walk out on a farm with. Now, as you will hear from Stan, optimize is maybe a better way to talk about disturbance and soil cover for grazing systems. I will let him get on depth in that to whatever extent he's planning to. But the key message here is that in particularly our annual cropping systems, there's way too much disturbance and way too little soil cover biodiversity and continuous living roots. Now, with grazing systems, we're a little better off. And I'll talk about that. But there's still a lot of opportunity for improvement. Now, why is it? What about those four principles? What do they even mean? Basically, it's all about caring for your below ground livestock as you would for above ground livestock. So for those of you all who work with grazers, at least those folks know that they're livestock owners. Most crop production folks don't know that they're livestock owners. But everybody's a livestock owner. If you have a potted plant, you're a livestock owner. If you have a backyard, you're a livestock owner. Your livestock are just, in some cases, very small. Right? And so the four soil health management principles are all about taking care of your below ground livestock. They have two basic needs. They need a home. That home needs to be protected so that they have good soil structure. They have access to water, but not too much. They have access to air, but not too little. Right? They need all of that. So we need to protect their home to be a nice, solid home that they can do what all of those organisms do best. They also need food. So we need to feed our below ground livestock a diverse year round diet. We can't just starve them for six months out of the year. And that needs to include all of the energy and all of the nutrients that those organisms need. So that's in a nutshell what those four soil management principles are about. And that's why they need to be a bit adapted depending on whether somebody is an urban grower on a couple of square feet, or whether somebody has 40,000 acres of rangeland in New Mexico. Right? Those are very different scenarios. But I would argue that the principles hold for all of those scenarios. But the way that you adapt those principles on the ground on a particular farm, there's a lot to unpack there. And that's the part that all of us will continue learning and none of us will ever know it all. Now, if you want the amusing color book version of Soil Health Management Principles, we did put out Mighty Mini Microbes tail back in, I forget exactly when it was, sometime after 2014 when I went to headquarters to run the soil health division. And that publication is available for free. So you can go ahead and download a PDF. And I believe you can still contact NRCS and they'll send you some paper copies. So if you've got kids, or if you're a kid yourself and really enjoy some coloring, I welcome you to find that because it's kind of fun and to pass it out to folks who might enjoy it. But back to our principles. Right? So we're trying to feed diverse continuous stuff to our microbe friends. And that means carbon sources, energy and nutrients. So when we maximize living roots, the reason that's important is because living roots are continuously growing, and that means they're continuously putting carbonaceous, nutrient containing, energy containing stuff into the soil. And that's where the photosynthetic stuff that all that underground livestock needs, that's where that comes from, is it gets photosynthesized by the plant up above ground using sun's energy, using CO2. And then that gets translocated down into the roots and out of the roots into the soil. And so we want to maximize living roots, both quantity in the soil at any given point, and maybe more importantly, consistency in there being living roots growing year round. Now, annual production systems have a big challenge there, because a lot of farmers are not even cover cropping. So there are these large times of year where there's nothing growing unless you've got some weeds. In our grazing production systems, that is not as much an issue. There are generally roots in the ground. But as you will learn from Stan and Richard today, there's a lot you can do to stimulate that root growth so that those organisms are getting that diverse, sufficient diet that they need. When we're talking about maximizing diversity, for grazing systems in particular, we're talking about diverse forage plants. For annual systems, we've got so much monoculture, and not really any animal integration, you can just imagine the the vast difference already between an annual production system that grows nothing but corn, versus a grazed system, even if it's poorly grazed, and then going all the way to a really well grazed system. There's a big difference there. A good analogy for maximizing diversity would be, okay, well, do you want to have just the burger bun, just the burger bun, right, that would be one heck of a diet, just, you know, white bread every day? Or do you want that standard burger? Or, well, you know, some prefer to have the turkey burger, and some prefer to have the bean burger, and some prefer to have lettuce and tomato galore, and some prefer to maybe also have some onions, right? You want a diversity because all of those organisms that are in the soil are different from each other, and very numerous, and they eat different things, and so different microbes will do better with different things being available, and of course, there's the whole food web where if you have enough of one microbe, then that means the other one can eat it, right? So we want a huge diversity, and there's a lot more we can do with grazing systems than we can do with annual production systems in a lot of cases. So lots of opportunity to feed diverse materials to our livestock. In terms of protecting habitat, we're really looking at protecting those aggregates, making sure that the rain doesn't just slake them apart into a muddy mess, making sure that there's not enough traffic and disturbance, whether that's grazing traffic, or machinery traffic, or tillage traffic, right, all of that kind of disturbance. We need to make sure that we don't break up those aggregates, because those are basically the bricks of the house. We want those rooms to stay open. We want those pores to stay open, and that means we have to have stable aggregates. So good structure that allows for water and air to be maintained at adequate levels for all those organisms, and also there's a lot to temperature maintenance, particularly in hot climates. If you've got adequate soil cover, and you've got adequate minimized disturbance, then if you have a really hot day, the rest of the soil will stay fairly cool. It'll stay a good temperature for all those microbes. But fields have gotten up to 120 degrees, 160 degrees Fahrenheit, if they're just bare fallow fields on a hot summer's day. So that's not a temperature that I would want to live in. That's not a temperature that most of these microbes would want to live in. So those are the basics, sort of talking about the principles. Now you'll hear me talk about soil health management systems, and there's a lot of talk about soil health management systems at NRCS and the various partners that NRCS has worked with, and we at AFT talk about soil health management systems. What is that? We defined it as a collection of management practices that focus on increasing soil carbon levels and improving or regenerating soil health by addressing all four soil health management principles, right? So the idea is basically you build a system of practices that addresses all four principles. That means that the approach of one management practice only is one to definitely question. Sometimes people will ask you, well, which one is the best management practice? And I always respond to that with, well, you know, it depends on what system you're in and what works for that system. And there are a lot of different practices that can be used to address these principles. So some years back when I was still at headquarters directing the soil health division, we put together this this technical note that is linked right here. And we basically listed out the main conservation practices that NRCS has that contribute to the soil health principles. Now, that doesn't mean that there aren't others that can also be added. Also, there were missing 338, the new soil carbon amendment practice standard that allows for application of biochar and other soil organic amendments. But this kind of gives you an overall idea of each practice standard helps address certain principles. And some of them are more comprehensive than others. So for example, pest management, you know, kind of helps with the chemical side of minimizing disturbance. Nutrient management helps with the chemical side of minimizing soil disturbance. But some practices like conservation cover, cover crop and forage and biomass planting and prescribed grazing are kind of the kings of all these practices, they really kind of address a lot of principles. And so depending on what system you're in, if you're in a grazing system, gosh, that's fantastic, because you plant forage and biomass crops, and you do prescribed grazing. And well, if you do it right, you've got all your principles covered. Now, how to do it right, and what that means, and what kinds of things to look out for, that's going to be the content for both Richard and Stan's talks today. So quick overview, though, of those principles, I just want to put this in light of, okay, what might one see out there? And how do we see that these work, right? Because sometimes the question you'll get is, well, how do you know that these practices work? How do you know that these principles work? Well, our colleague Barry Fisher, who, by the way, is the lead trainer for advanced soil health training courses, he got this aerial image of one farm where a farmer was asking him, what, what is that dark green strip that goes down the field? That's not some kind of soil variability. What is that? What's going on there? That's things are growing a lot better there. So this is an aerial image of a cornfield in the middle of summer when things are growing well in some parts of it, but not in others. And basically what it turned out to be is that long ago this had been its own parcel and there used to be a fence line and that fence line got taken out. And so the soils were still much more higher function right in that fence line. And so therefore, that soil was producing a much better crop. Now, why was that happening? Well, because very shortly ago, the soil health management principles had all been in effect. And so that soil there was still much more resilient. It had been built up to a higher level because for many years that fence row had had maximized biodiversity, maximized living roots all around the year, maximized soil cover and minimize disturbance, right? Those are all the things that you have in a fence row. Now, gosh, that sounds a lot like a grazing system, right? You have generally all those much more in place than you do in an annual system. So in an annual system, right? Cornfield, here's a field of a farmer who is practicing cover crops and no-till and several other things and is doing really well. And here's the field next door, same climate, same soil type, same weather that year. Cornfield, but you can really see the difference between these two cornfields and that's based on management. We can think about that in the grazing world. When we look at an annual cropping field, right? We are really doing a lot of damage. There tends to be in conventional crop fields, there tends to be a lot of disturbance, very little soil cover for a lot of the year, very little biodiversity. Often it's a monoculture and very little in terms of continuous living roots. You know, you basically have corn roots for about half the year and that's it. You go to a graze system. If it's kind of poorly grazed, you nevertheless have less disturbance than you did in this scenario. You have much more soil cover because that soil cover is generally there year-round unless it's a really muddy field where nothing's growing anymore. Or, you know, a feedlot, okay? You can't really grow stuff there anymore because there's so much hoof traffic that is all turning to mud, right? But in a grazing scenario, there's still some grass there. It's just over grazed, but at least you have soil cover. You have more biodiversity than you did in this field. You have more continuous living roots than you did in this field. But there's still room for improvement. With adapted grazing, much better grazing than sort of an overgrazed, continuously grazed scenario, you can get to much better growth because you're really optimizing disturbance in soil cover and maximizing biodiversity and living roots. So those are some visual examples of those principles. Now, we can talk about principles, but then we also want to talk about practices. And I'm going to zoom kind of quickly through the practices because most of them are applicable to annual crop production, but they're sort of a practice that really kind of captures everything that's called prescribed grazing. That's the whole grazing world. And Richard and Stan will talk a whole lot more about all of those nuances. But when we're talking about protecting, habitat, right, minimizing disturbance, maximizing cover, what are we talking about there? Right. We're talking about minimizing disturbance, which means physical disturbance. So tillage, grazing, compaction, heavy equipment. Also chemical disturbance, non-optimal fertilizer, pesticides or organic amendments or other amendments of any sort. Biological disturbance like overgrazing, non-grazing types of systems like fallow systems, monoculture plant communities, that kind of thing. And so there's a lot of potential to really lose habitat and lose soil structure here. And so some of the practices that can be used to address that then are what NRCS calls residue and tillage management. There's no-till and reduce till basically reducing tillage, right? Conservation cover, nutrient management, integrated pest management, prescribed grazing, right? Those are all practices that can help reduce the various forms of disturbance. Maximizing soil cover, right? We really need our soil cover for a lot of reasons. We want to reduce erosion. We want to increase infiltration. We want to reduce evaporation. We want to moderate soil temperature, improve habitat for soil organisms, food for biota, mitigate compaction from machines and livestock, right? These are all good reasons to have plenty of soil cover. How do we do that? Well, it depends on the system. If you're in an annual production system, you use cover crops. You can actually graze cover crops. And that's something that Stan will talk a bit about. And that's a really neat opportunity for livestock growers that have livestock, but they also have some annual cropland. There's some really nice win-wins there. Again, for increasing soil cover, you can reduce your tillage. Conservation covers, mulching, controlled traffic, forage and biomass planting, prescribed grazing, right? Prescribed grazing you're going to see everywhere because it really contributes to all of the principles. When we talk about feeding the diverse livestock, we've got maximizing the presence of living roots, right? We want the roots to be there for as long as possible. And so how do we do that? Well, in a nutshell, we need to grow or graze crops or cover crops in the off-season for annual cropping. So we don't want bare ground. We really want something growing there all the time. We want to avoid any kind of bare fallow. We want to avoid overgrazing that leaves the soil totally visible and denuded and exposed to the elements. We want to increase time in perennial crops wherever we can. So wherever you can pair an annual crop production person with a grazing person, right? That might be one way to get some more cover on those lands. And again, what practices, right? You're seeing some of the same ones. Conservation crop rotation, conservation cover, cover crops, forage and biomass planting, prescribed grazing. Also for maximizing the presence of living roots. Soil carbon amendment. Biochar, for instance, really helps roots grow better in situations where, for example, the pH is low. That biochar brings up the pH. It also adds some nutrients. It also provides really good habitat for microorganisms that are beneficial to those living roots. So that's why that is out there now. And I'm maximizing biodiversity. How do we do that? We want diverse cover crops and legumes and crops too. We really want to diversify what we've got out there and not just diversified plants, but also diversified other organisms, right? We want to diversify our biota in the soil. We want to diversify in terms of bringing some livestock in wherever that is an option. So really integrating livestock is something that can really help with getting better soil health. Livestock sometimes get a bad rap. You'll hear all about that from Richard and Stan. But the reason for that is not that it's the livestock's fault. It's the way that we manage that livestock. If we manage livestock well, if we manage forage production and harvest well, then we're going to get much healthier soils. And it can actually be a really positive thing to integrate livestock into a rotation from a biodiversity standpoint and all the other standpoints as well. And again, here's that list of NRCS practices. So lots of opportunities, right? Things that some folks haven't seen when you're thinking of your conventional agriculture, freshly plowed field. Well, here's somebody roller crimping a very large rye crop, and then you can plant directly into that. You never even see the soil. You just plant your transplants, your vegetable transplants or whatever it may be, or your corn directly into a rolled crop or into a sprayed crop, depending on the kind of system that you're in. There's various equipment out there now. Some folks here in Western New York have experimented with high clearance cover crop interseeding and side dressing. And so that's really, you know, one of the things that's up and coming. Lots of exciting things happening in that world. There's a lot of diversity in cover crop opportunities. Zone-till equipment has really taken several steps. It used to be very difficult to do no-till. There were a lot of hurdles to overcome, but the equipment has improved so much that people can really zone-till very effectively, which means you disturb just a small slot that the seeds get planted into. It gets firmed up around, and then the rest of the field is left not disturbed. And then biochar is really kind of up and coming. A lot of people haven't heard of it or have heard of it sort of as the silver bullet, woo-woo, does it even work? But no, there's really actually science behind biochar being a really great tool in the toolbox. And all of those practices can be integrated into grazing operations and vice versa. So really kind of bringing our livestock back together with our annual production is something that I see as a high potential benefit that we really need to work towards. I'm not going to talk much about poor pasture management versus healthy pasture management. I'm going to leave that to Stan and Richard, except to say, gosh, there's a lot of impact from poor pasture management on soil health. Right? We get uneven fertility. We get poor productivity. We get weeds. We got poor quality pasture species and therefore less feed. We get compaction and erosion problems. Grazing can be a really significant issue for the environment if it is done poorly. But when grazed well, when you allow the forages to fully regrow and you have adequate rest periods, it means that you're distributing manure very nicely without having to use a bunch of diesel fuel to get it out there. You're distributing nutrients really well and giving really good feed to those underground livestock that really need that because they love manure. They love having access to those nutrients when they're coupled with carbon. And so you're going to get better aeration and better aggregate stability. You're going to alleviate or prevent compaction when you do it right and tackle some of the temperature and moisture issues. So lots of opportunity when done right. How do you do it right? That'll be a standard Richard in a little while. So I wanted to bring back this this upward spiral, right? Our win win that we're trying to achieve. We talked about this yesterday. If we increase biodiversity, increase rooting, increase soil cover, decrease disturbance. We're going to bring our soils to higher and higher levels of soil function as all of those practices start to influence the way that the soil functions. And that function basically builds on itself, right? If you're building up aggregate stability, you're no longer going to lose all that water. So your crops are going to grow better, et cetera, et cetera. And we talked about that yesterday. So I won't go in depth now because I want to leave some time for other things. Tomorrow we're going to talk about taking your soils to the doctor. And just in a nutshell, I want to bring this in here for a moment because it ties into what we just talked about, right? Ideally, we want to improve awareness of soil health and its benefits and opportunities. And with soil health assessment, what that does is it really helps us understand and diagnose constraints or resource concerns that we'll talk about tomorrow. And we want to do that beyond nutrient limitations and excesses, which has been very common. We want to really look at what are those physical and biological constraints that a soil is showing. And then how do we target management practices in a way that fits for that operation to really alleviate the identified constraints so that we can feed and shelter that underground livestock that all of us have. So that's a bit about principles practices. I want to get into barriers in the remaining half hour, but I want to take a moment and see whether there are questions, whether there are any key concepts that are popping out at you. Maybe we can have five minutes or so of discussion and then we'll go through some barriers to adoption and then we'll have a bit more discussion. So any questions out there right now? And feel free to either jump. I'm not seeing any hands raised, but feel free to put a question in the chat. Actually, now I am. So Aline, Aline and then Lisa. Hi, I'm sorry I can't turn my camera on due to Internet stuff, but I thought that on a previous slide you had listed a field being fallow as a form of disturbance. Did I misread that or can you elaborate? Yes, I think I had it under disturbance. It is certainly going to be damaging for biodiversity. It's going to be damaging for soil cover. I could zoom back through. I don't know whether I had had it under disturbance. But if you have a fallow field, you're really going to be damaging the habitat and damaging the ability to feed microorganisms because there's so much of that time where now there's not living roots growing. And you don't have that soil cover and you're really not supporting those soil microbes in a way that that is really needed by them. I think. Yeah. Thank you very much for that. I think in my I had a working definition and maybe not a proper definition of fallow. I'm thinking of fallow as like an old field where it's grown up and there are grasses and others. You know, I'm thinking about saying like exposed soil and it's empty. And yeah, yeah definition. Okay. Thank you. Good clarification. I that word is used in probably both ways out there. And so that can be confusing. So I should have clarified that what I mean definitely is sort of the fallow field as in the field is bare. You're not letting anything grow. Some farmers will even go in and either use chemicals or use tillage to keep weeds at bay. It's a good weed management strategy because you're you're letting weeds sprout and then killing them. But it's really bad for soil health. So. So, yeah, that was what I was meaning. Now, if you have a fallow as in you have an old fallow hayfield and everything's growing under the sun, you might actually have a really great soil health management system there. So that's that's a whole different story. Thank you for clarifying that. Great. Thanks. So let's go to Lisa Hein and then Alicia Trexler. Yeah. Hi. So I live in Iowa and big ag country out here. And I am probably more of a comment than a question. Oh, really appreciate the presentation. It's very clear and it's really cool. I think the challenge we have is credibility because farmers listen to ag dealers and farm organizations and things like that. So maybe this will be a conversation that we have throughout the course of the next couple days. But I think that's one of our biggest challenges here. And tying back to the slides, it's really I really appreciate how it's laid out and very clear. Maybe it's something that could be part of our education and training. Thank you. And that's such an excellent comment. And it's so very real. I think things are changing out there. Back when I was at USDA, there was a state con who was really pushing soil health. And we went from almost no soil health work in Iowa to there being, I think, four area soil health specialists that NRCS had. We were doing a lot of trainings. One of our division specialists was going there and doing a lot of trainings. And so I think we really made a lot of progress. But like you say, Iowa is big. I mean, that's millions and millions and millions of acres of just corn. And that's what's economically viable right now. And that's we'll get into that a little more when we talk about the barriers. And so, yeah, I mean, the ag retailers have a lot to do with it. We do have that project. I don't know if you were there for my presentation yesterday. We do have a project with Land O'Lakes True Terra. And we will be working with ag retailers to really help them understand soil health so that they can integrate that into the way that they do business. So we're hoping that we can really kind of catalyze some impact by working through that system to change the paradigms within that system to one where soil health management systems can be part of that toolbox, where it's not all about selling product, but where it's also about selling knowledge, selling understanding, selling services to help farmers be resilient and productive in the long run. Great. Great. Thanks, Bianca. That was an excellent question. Alicia, to you. Hi. I'm West from Pennsylvania. And you were talking about a concept of incorporating grazing in, and if I was hearing right, with traditional cropping as well. And that concept, I'm thrilled on that concept, and I didn't know if we were going to go into more detail on the steps of how to get your standard corn alfalfa person to incorporate some livestock on those fields, or are you talking about them as next to each other? I think there's kind of models all under the sun. You know, it's, there's a lot of potential options. We have a project in Virginia, led by Jacob Gilley, who's AFT staff working with a lot of folks in Virginia and we're piloting this approach of pairing somebody who grazes livestock with somebody who grows annual crops and is interested in integrating cover crops and making them the match of can we get that livestock onto those cover crops and basically have both parties benefit from that exchange. So that's one model. There are other models where a farmer might take on livestock production, but not every farmer wants to have above ground big livestock. That's a whole other world, right? But yeah, there's a lot of opportunities to pair in one way or other. And it's a space that I think is ripe for more exploration because there would be a lot of benefits. So health wise, economically, resilience wise, in making that happen more. Cool. Thank you. Bianca, one last question that was put into the chat from Tessa Dowling, who asks, what role, if any, does planting native plants play in helping the micro communities? That is a great question and not my area of expertise. I do see that Stan chimed in and said that some non-native species can detrimentally affect mycorrhizal fungi, bacteria in our care communities. Stan, I don't know if you want to speak up and say a few more words about that. I think you work with native species a lot more than I have. Stan, you're on mute. Jamie, I don't know if we need to unmute Stan. The one is funny Christy, DNA is at least really important as something bad. But here in my opinion, Rebecca has easily dominated me, though. It can be more interesting than I can tell you, not be�ing악, anymore. There is something that I can't do in, here, something like that, is really kind ofotional survival. And you can hint, let me try this adult. I can just try to wave your classes to lead to the Completely 800. Thanks. Command. Thank you, Jennifer. in canada where uh non-native species had a detrimental effect on bacteria and i've seen some stuff where archaea is is almost eliminated in some cases where the species uh switch to non-native you know so it it does impact um it can impact not all non-native species are are detrimental necessarily and they have different impacts so like kentucky bluegrass impacts the community differently than smooth brome for for example so but it but it is a consideration so native species typically uh play better is how i put it with the mycorrhizal the native mycorrhizal fungi that are there and so i i tend to encourage that whenever possible but thanks um that's bianca that's all the questions that i see at the moment great well i was thinking that's probably about time to go on to the next part of the presentation i wanted to do a little bit of sort of broad brush what are the barriers to soil health adoption and then i know both stan and richard will be able to address that much more in detail for grazing type operations so generally what are we talking about when we're talking about adopting soil health practices that takes a lot right and it's not just that it requires an understanding and willingness to pursue a totally different management system from a physical standpoint right you have to understand physically what resources you have how your production system works and how it is that this difference in management is going to be you know better but then you have to be willing to implement it that might mean new machinery it might mean costs that you're not used to that you didn't have before so there's a lot to that but then there's also the social considerations right if you're the odd one out if you don't feel like you can go to the coffee shop anymore because everybody's going to laugh you out of the out of the coffee shop right that's that can be pretty tough and some farmers really thrive being the innovator and being the odd one out but a lot of us are very much herd creatures and just kind of like to do things the way that our community does so that we get the understanding and a lot of farmers really don't have that social support and then there are economic considerations where you really if you if you don't know what that return on investment is of making that change that might just be too risky some people are risk takers and they want to try it out but you just really you know that's that's a really big barrier we're going to get a little bit at all of those throughout this training so for example michelle's team will talk a lot about some of the economic considerations i believe that richard will touch on them some um and we're talking a lot about sort of the the knowledge the technical aspects of it of course and we're talking a fair bit also about sort of the social implications um so all of those pieces are important and so for you all to understand that there are those human social economic considerations in addition to the the technical knowledge i think that's really important so that as you become conversant and inspired and you pass on what you're learning here you can also be acknowledging that this is not just a simple easy you know just wave your hand this way versus that way kind of thing right like it's it's it's a major change and we're asking people to make a paradigm shift and then wholesale change their business that's funding their family right so we're asking for something pretty big we want to make that easy we want to make it clear that it is actually worthwhile so what does adoption look like when we look at a population right there's always those innovators those are the folks that try it first about 2.5 percent of a population will say here's this cool new thing that i want to try out and nobody's ever done it before and i'm i'm all there then there's the early adopters that look at what the innovators do and as soon as it starts to look like yeah that's that's pretty good i think i'm going to try that they're there where we want to get with soil health is to that early majority because generally when you get the early majority in then the late majority follows and what that means is basically those people who really want to see good proof that it works they really want to know there's a good return on investment they want the data but then they're ready to jump in well then once half the people are doing it the rest of most of the folks say okay you know this is what everybody's doing now i guess i got to do it too you're always going to have those laggards that are never going to pick it up and a really great example that i like to hold up for that is you know if i could see all of you in an audience right now i would say who here had a cell phone 20 years ago and chances are there's few of you that would raise the hand i wouldn't be raising my hand i was dead set that i was never going to have a cell phone and then what do you know a couple of years later i had a cell phone and now my cell phone runs my life and sometimes that's not a good thing but in lots of ways right it really facilitates things i can be in touch with anybody around the world 24 7 if i want to be i can have my dictionary in my library in my pocket it's amazing to have these phones that are no longer even just phones right my son doesn't even know what a what a dial phone was and that's what i grew up with things change a lot right and these days you walk down any street and you're going to see people on their phone and it is the new normal it's the new conventional for phones now that's what we're trying to achieve with our agriculture right when i talk about the new conventional agriculture i'm talking about let's get that early and late majority into the fold on soil health i think that at this point we're past just the innovators we've got our early adopters that are taking on cover crops that are taking on no-till for biochar we're definitely still in the innovator category a couple of these other practices we're definitely still there i'll let richard and stan speak about where we're at in terms of really good grazing practices um but we're not really at early or late majority yet we're not we don't have a new conventional where there's just a few laggards that are still doing it the old way um but that's what we're trying to get to so what are the stages of adoption first somebody needs to gain awareness and i think this is where you all can really play the biggest role is to help farmers become aware that there's all these amazing win-win options that they really want to be pursuing then you can help fuel their interests so if for example you are doing field days or you're thinking about doing them as part of your soil health action plan right um you might fuel their interest by bringing the right speakers by by telling that farmer as you're walking their field with them hey you know we're going to do this field day i'd really like you to be there you've got some interesting things going on do you want to present or whatever that might be right um bringing farmers to that helping them evaluate connecting them with the right resources that they can safely maybe on a backfield try out something new so that they can understand how it does and doesn't work tweak it safely so that then as they're trying it out they can get to a point where they really feel like wow this really works i think i'm going to do this more i think i'm going to do this on my whole operation right and that's where you get to full adoption is when somebody has tried it out enough that they feel confident that this is the new way for them so some barriers to adoption right broadly in a nutshell what are those there's social or psychological barriers there's technical barriers there's financial barriers there's probably a lot of other barriers that i haven't even listed here when we're talking about social psychological barriers we're talking about that paradigm shift right going from i'm doing things the way i'm doing them because it makes sense or because that's the only way that i know how or that's the only thing i'm willing to think about too gosh there's these other options why should i do that okay now i have good reasons that's a pretty big mental shift and that shift has to happen and i would argue it can only happen by somebody engaging with the ideas and understanding why it matters they're not going to just do it if they don't have an understanding of why that would be better than what they're doing right now and so broaching that has to be safe it can't be a situation where they're feeling like they're not respected they've been doing everything wrong all the time i mean maybe some people change that way right but ideally we go the inspiration route that tends to leave people more energetic and ready to tackle new things um there are some other barriers like landlord tenant relationships we work a lot with non-operating landowners helping them understand why soil health matters because that way they can put it into their lease or they can talk to their uh to their farmer that is renting their land about it um often there's a lack of land tenure for a farmer who's renting and therefore they think of it as well if i build up soil health it's not mine right so that's not really valuable to them um there can be a lack of community support if everybody's still doing things the same old conventional way not having that social support can be really difficult for a farmer um also some farmers have tried it but not with enough guidance right there's still not enough technical advisors out there which is part of why american farmland trust has multiple projects um of in the partnerships for climate smart commodities we're really tackling that angle of there need to be enough technical advisors that means we need to catalyze there being enough of those that means we need to train influencers we need to train people who will then go out and train more people and be there as that sounding board so that we can help those farmers who are trying something out recover from those failures or we can help prevent those failures from happening in the first place risk aversion right that's a big one if you think this thing that somebody's telling you to do is really risky you're not going to do it so a really good way to start is to say okay well you've never had cover crops before you don't even know how they grow well you might want to plant some on an acre in that field back there that way it's a very low risk it's just this interesting new thing that they might try out or going to a field day and learning from a fellow farmer who's got the same system except they're doing cover crops and they're doing it successfully and they've got really good things to say about it that helps address the risk aversion also understanding more about the economic benefits that's something that michelle perez and team are going to talk about more there's a lot of economic benefits and we're starting to have a much better understanding than we did even five ten years ago technical understanding is a big deal right really understanding the soil and plant processes and how it is that management influences that and how to successfully actually change that system that can be pretty difficult right if you don't have background in cover crops you don't just go throw a cover crop out there because you might have some serious downfalls and it might actually make you lose hundreds thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars depending on the size of your farm the size of your trial right so you want to make sure as a farmer that you have enough information that when you first do this you do it as correctly as possible or as safely and on a small scale as possible and then having a peer network of other farmers who are also experimenting and who can share their challenges and share their successes can be really beneficial for farmers because farmers listen to other farmers and really having people that are sounding boards for that technical aspect of how do i need to adjust my planter so i can plant that cover crop when is it that i kill that cover crop how is it that i roll it down if i'm an organic farmer so that it doesn't pop back up right there's a lot of key challenges there and having a network that you can tap into as a farmer where you can help solve those problems prevent failures recover from them is really critical um financially of course that really ties in right lack of information on economic costs and benefits and risks has been a really big deterrent but we're making some progress on that side so that's really exciting um there's often investment costs right needing new equipment needing the learning time for you to even start doing something new and then when we're talking about actually changing the production system so that what is being sold is no longer just corn and soy but you're adding other crops to it well there's a whole other level of complication there right because if there's no market for barley if there's no market for rye if there's no market for you know whatever your your new agroforestry crop if you don't have that part taken care of you're probably not going to go down that route also there's a lot of policy impacts and that's another key piece that aft works on really making sure that policies don't get in the way of farmers adopting these new practices and having success is one key place where we all can have an impact so that's a broad sweeping overview right what can you do about it i think one of the key places where land trusts and similar organizations can make an impact and you can consider this for yourself action plan is in moving farmers from awareness to adoption that initial awareness building that and then helping build networks is really key so for example you might work to develop relationships with producers so that you become a trusted advisor in their network you might pursue opportunities for helping producers educate themselves on soil health you might invite them or accompany them to soil health related events you might organize some yourself you might organize a peer network of all of your landowners to talk to each other about soil health in some kind of a coffee coffee shop type format or in social media groups or all those combined um you might invite them to have a conversation in the field and do the assessment right there you might do that for it with just one farmer or you might have a couple of farmers come to this farm and then come to that farm and do some of these assessments you might conduct demonstrations like doug peterson and ray archuleta's demonstrations that we saw on video yesterday you could do those at field days you could do those at auctions at fairs at people's farms right there's a lot of opportunities to kind of get into the awareness piece and then beyond that facilitating those paradigm shifts is really a lot about building relationships and building networks i would say mentors are key there's a lot of research out in that space gabrielle and team have a lot going in that space and we'll be putting out some more information about peer-to-peer networks and their effectiveness over the coming months as part of our climate smart commodities projects and so mentoring networks you know building those networks helping farmers talk to each other about soil health is really key and then connecting producers to whatever the available resources are wherever they're lacking right you could help connect producers to help them do their own learning help them do their own experimenting connect them to technical assistance networks connect them to financial assistance networks help them get access to more agronomic skills and knowledge help them transition successfully by connecting them to the right people who can provide that technical advice and the economic advice so that they can really make the decisions in ways that are successful for them so i would say there's a lot of opportunities and your entity will have certain opportunities that others don't i think you all are very unique in what you easily can do and what's maybe more challenging and so we look forward to seeing your action plans and helping kind of refine those and helping brainstorm what some things are that you might do and we've seen some land trusts do some really exciting things over the last year so that's been great a couple of things to remember adopting soil health management systems is really a long-term investment it's not like fertilizer where you add your phosphorus and then it's there right it's not as simple as day-to-day suddenly there's a change but in a lot of systems you can make a really significant change with just a couple of years two three five years of management you can really start to see that change but soil degradation didn't happen overnight and so improving soil health will also take some time it's really rebuilding all of that biological function that that takes some time there are agronomic benefits that result in economic benefits and they may not be always easily easily measured right so there's things like reducing risk of yield variability you won't see that every year but if a drought hits five years into successful soil health management that farmer is going to have much better results than a farmer that didn't implement all those practices and then i'm going to reiterate it's really about systems right the greatest benefits are from soil health management systems rather than a single practice and those systems really need to be adapted to what that farmer needs to their climate to their soils to their production system to their context of what resources they have what things they see as feasible for their life and their work of managing that farm so there's a lot of adaptation that has to happen on a unique day-by-day basis but all in all i would say it's really worth it because here's all the benefits that we can get from managing for soil health right we get all of these things when we manage for healthy soils and that's a pretty long list it's a pretty good list right there's a lot of benefits there um they are real these are documented in the scientific literature and i would say that one of the reasons why soil health has been taking off so much is because we got from the place of all this research being done really kind of panning out to now farmers are and a lot of farmers had been trying it sort of the the niche farmer right but now it's really turning into many more farmers are taking the old conventional and saying look there's a new way to do this and i'm going to do it on 40 000 acres right that is actually happening which is really exciting so i want to leave a few minutes for more question answer any kind of discussion you want to have i'm curious to hear what your perception is of your of soil health in your community whether there are particular barriers that popped up for you as oh yeah that's definitely happening where i am or oh we don't really have that issue and whether you have solutions in mind that you think your organization could participate in
