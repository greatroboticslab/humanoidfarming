 Hey everybody, it's your girl, Herba Farms, Lester. Good evening everyone and welcome. I'll wait a few seconds for everyone to get logged in. I know it's a delay. But tonight we're going to talk about something very interesting. We're going to talk about an actual grant that you guys can apply for. It's probably currently not open now, but since a lot of you are going to be farming and things over the spring and summer and part of the fall, it might be a good idea that you guys learn about these opportunities so when they arise in fall, winter, you'll have the experience and things racked up to where you're able to apply for these certain opportunities, especially these grants. Grants, they're different than loans. They're money that doesn't have to be paid back, but it has to be used for a project or something specific. And so the grant we're going to talk about is the SARE Farmer Rancher Grant. Let's see here. Get this a little quickly. All right. So a little bit about myself. My name is Nadia Ruffin and I'm located in Cincinnati, Ohio. I'm an entomologist, scientist, farmer, researcher, educator, and retired disease investigator. I have two degrees. I have a bachelor's degree in agriculture from the Ohio State University. I also have a master's of science and entomology from the University of Nebraska. I'm owner and founder of Kiwi Produce and AgriAcademy Inc. I'm also co-owner of AgriAcademy Labs here in Cincinnati. I have years of experience in floriculture. My family actually owns a flower shop here. They've owned that flower shop for about 42 years. And then I also have a background in veterinary medical research and public health. As I said, I used to be a disease investigator here in the county that I live in. Being a disease investigator, I would have been doing the investigations kind of like what's been done over the last year for the COVID-19. So that's what my position was. I retired from that and started doing my farming and research and things full time. So I'd like to thank all you that are my contributors to my channel. If you'd like to support my channel, you can do so by sending donations and things to my PayPal at NadiaRuffin at gmail.com. You can also use Cash App at MoneySignNadiaRuffin or you can go to my Patreon at www.patreon.com forward slash urbanfarmsista. You can become a $5 patron. It's real easy. You just sign on and then each month it'll contribute that $5 that you would like to use to support my channel. Also, if you'd like to support AgriAcademy, which is sponsoring this actual YouTube live, you can do so by going to agriacademyeat.org. One of our projects is Farming is Essential. We're trying to buy some new farm equipment, in particular a newer tractor. We have an older tractor, but we have recently accumulated 10 acres of land and we want to use a better tractor to actually maintain that land. One of our projects in AgriAcademy that we just wrapped up was the Black Empowerment through Agriculture. For this project, we had 159 students enrolled in our eight-week online course where we taught 16 different classes about 16 different industries in agriculture that someone that lives in the 6-night tri-state area could actually get into and actually start a small-scale farm. Up on completion, the enrollees will receive a certificate and a select group of those students will set up their operations on our plot of land. To be considered for this course, you had to meet the following criteria. You must have been a minimum age of 10 years or older, and you must identify as Black or African American, and you must live in a 6-night tri-state area. There were some individuals that did not live in this area. They were allowed to enroll, and all these classes took place online. We have a wait list now if people want to sign up, and you do not have to live inside the 6-night tri-state area. But if you want to sign up and you meet the other criteria as far as the age and the demographic information, you can do so at agracademyeat.org forward slash beta waitlist. We still haven't figured out when we're going to actually start the next cohort, but it will be coming up soon. So if you're interested in that, please sign up. Also, starting in mid-April, we have another project coming up, and our seed potato just came in today, but it's called SPUD's Youth Potato Farming Project. This is a hands-on project that will teach youth 7-13 about farming white potatoes as well as sweet potatoes. If your child is interested in participating, please visit our website to register and also find out more information. Criteria, again, you must belong to one of the socially disadvantaged ethnic groups whose members have been subject to racial or ethnic prejudice because of their identity in the agricultural industry. You must live in the Cincinnati tri-state area. You must have transportation to Loveland, Ohio. The age ranges, again, are 7 to 13 years old. If you can't participate because you're not in the area, you don't have a child that can participate, you can also donate to this project at www.agracademyinc.org forward slash SPUD's. But, yes, we would like to have at least 20 students enrolled, so we still have space available. So if you're interested in having your child participate, please enroll. Registration will close on April 10th. All right, so tonight's outline, we're going to talk about what is actually SARE. We're going to talk about the Farmer and Rancher Grant, and then we're going to do a walkthrough of my 2019 proposal that was actually granted funding. We're going to discuss those different sections that you have to, you know, fill out and things on that application. We're going to go through that whole application on there. And then we're going to review. Chandler Glover is our program manager for AgroAcademy. He also was granted a 2021 SARE grant this year for the Farmer Rancher, and we're just going to look at his proposal and see, you know, because he has a whole different project than what I had. And then we're going to have Mr. Brennan Washington. He's actually here on the platform, but he's going to come in and talk about – he's actually a SARE outreach coordinator for the Southern SARE, and we'll talk about what Southern is and all that stuff in a second. He's going to talk about – because he used to be on the review board and things that would actually look at these proposals, and he's going to tell you, you know, what they look for, what things in the application gets them granted, as well as, you know, why some applications are rejected and things like that. So thank you guys for tuning in. Hello, everyone that's sending messages. Hi, Perkins. Good evening. But we're going to get started now. So what is SARE? All right. So SARE – about SARE. It was established in 1988. It's a Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education, or SARE for short, is a competitive grant education program operated in every state and island protectory. This program was established by the USDA agency, the Cooperative State Research Education and Extension Services. So this is a USDA program. When you're applying to this, this is one of the USDA – the USDA has hundreds of different branches of things that they, you know, are part of or they've created and things like that. And if you don't know what the USDA stands for, that's the United States Department of Agriculture. All right. So what is SARE? This is the website that you would go to to find out about SARE. It's www.sare.org. The purpose of the Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program is to encourage research and outreach designed to increase knowledge concerning agricultural production systems that, number one, maintain and enhance the quality and productivity of soil, conserve soil, water, energy, natural resources, and fish and wildlife habitats, maintain and enhance the quality of surface and groundwater, protect the health and safety of persons involved in the food and farm systems, and promote the well-being of animals and increase employment opportunities in agriculture. So SARE is divided into four different regions that operate as separate entities and run grant programs for their own – for their states that are under their region. So we have the north-central SARE, which is located in north-central area. Then we have the northeast SARE. Then we have the southern SARE. And then we also have the western SARE. I am located in Ohio, so I fall under the north-central SARE. So most of the stuff from this presentation will be coming from the north-central. Every region has their own way of governing and doing things. So what I might talk about here in north-central may be different in southern SARE and may be different in northeast. They even have different names for some of the same type of grants, and then they have different criteria that you have to meet for certain grants. All right. So SARE offers competitive grants to fund research and education projects that advance sustainable agricultural practices in the United States. So who can apply to these? So it can be farmers and ranchers. It can be researchers. It can be extension agents and other educators. It can be graduate students. Grants are available for projects within the United States and the U.S. protectorates only. So you couldn't do a project outside of these areas. Like, you couldn't do a project outside if you're going to be, like, a Puerto Rico, Guam, and things like that. You can do projects there, but say you want to do a project over in, like, Ghana or somewhere, you will not qualify for that because that's not a U.S. territory. So there's a number of different grants offered. Like I said before, each region offers different grants, and these are some of the examples. So there's a research and education grants. There's graduate student grants. There's professional development grants. There's producer grants, and there's on-farm research grants. So over here on the right-hand side, I have the North Central SARE grant opportunity programs, and this is how they go about naming them. These are the ones that they offer. So they have research education, farmer rancher, graduate student, youth educator, professional development, and they also have partnerships. But we're going to only focus on the farmer rancher because a lot of these other ones, sometimes you either have to be, like, for the youth educator, you have to be some type of teacher. So everybody might not qualify for that one. Professional development, you might have to have a business, a partnership. You might have to partner with, like, a university or some other large agricultural entity to actually get that. And then, like, the research education, sometimes you have to have a lab or you have to have where a researcher would come onto your farm, and they would do research on your farm and things like that. But the farmer rancher grant, some regions they call it the producer grant. But basically the farmer rancher grants are for innovative, sustainable agriculture research or demonstration education projects. They are not for everyday farming expenses other than those directly related to the grant project. So you couldn't use these grants to go buy land. You can't use these grants to, you know, pay off your bills and things. The money was to specifically have to go to actually carrying out these projects. So if you're deciding you're going to apply to this, you need to go to your region's SARE website, and it will tell you when you can apply for this grant and what is their criteria. Here in North Central, if you identified yourself as a farmer rancher, you can even be a new farmer rancher, you could apply. Now, in the Northeast, they said that you have to have accumulated $1,000 in gross revenue. That actually considers you a farm no matter what size land you have. If you gross $1,000 annually from products that you produce on your farm or your property, you are considered a farm. So that was one of their criteria. North Central didn't have that criteria. So every region has their own rules and regulations. So you need to check their website to see when you can apply for these particular farmer rancher grants or producer grants. And they need to look at the criteria and make sure that your operation is meeting what they're wanting. So how do you apply for the grants? You will go to projects.sare.org. And this is where you actually apply for the grants no matter what region you live in. This management system that we're going to go to in a second because we're going to log in and we're actually going to look at my application and my proposal and things. But this is where you would go no matter if you live in North Central, Northeast, Southern Sare, or Western Sare. You would go here. You would log in. If you haven't already, you would create an account and then you would log in. And then you would go and you would start your application. So what we're going to do, we're going to talk about my project, which is the one up here on the top. It's called the use of bacillus thuringiens, the species of biological controls for small hive beetles and wax moths inside beehives. I was actually granted a funding in 2019. And my project is still ongoing because of COVID. It got extended and things like that. But I was actually a winner of one of these grants. So what we're going to do, we're going to talk about the project abstract. We're going to describe. You got to talk about your operation. We're going to talk about what are project objectives. We're going to talk about activities and timelines, materials and methods, outreach, sharing your project information. Then you have to do like a previous research review. So you have to see if this project has been done before. And if it has been done before, then you have to use that information in your research review to say, like, are you improving up on something that somebody has presented? Or are you, you know, introducing something new that maybe, you know, these other projects have not actually looked into? And then you're going to measure your benefits and your impact. So how can you measure your benefits and impacts? We'll talk about that. And then contributions to sustainable agriculture. We'll talk about the letter of support. We have budget justification. And then I have a livestock care plan if that's applicable. So livestock is anything that has a vertebrae. So I didn't have to do a livestock care plan because even though I have living organisms, they are invertebrates. They do not have vertebrae. But things like cows, chickens and things like that, if you're going to do a project with them, you would actually have to fill out this care plan. And then we're going to go over Chandler Glover's project. It was just recently awarded funding this year. And he will actually start this month. He actually started his project. And so he's getting into the whole thing of setting up his thing and, you know, waiting for his funding and stuff to come in the mail. But it's a process. You know, you fill out this application. You submit your proposal. And then you have to wait. They have people review it. And then if you're selected, you send an email saying that you were selected. Then they send you a contract in the mail. You have to sign the contract. Send over tax forms and things like that. So if you're a farmer or rancher, it would be a good idea to, you know, look into this possible grant. But now I'm going to switch over to the actual online platform. So. Can everybody see that? Okay. Yeah, I think it's broadcasting on there. Okay. So when you pull up projects.sare.org, you'll pull up this window and it'll have where you can search for projects. You can log in. You can reset your password. You can create an account. So a lot of you would be new to this. So what you would do is you click on the create an account. You have to put in your name, password, things like that. But I already have an account. So I'm just going to log in. And then what happens is it pulls up your account here and it'll say, like, if you were awarded a grant or things like that, you can pull up your project here. Or you can go manage my accounts or you can start a new grant proposal. So say you wanted to start a new one. You would go here and you would check out which region you live in or which region you're going to do your project in. And you would fill this out. So say you live in North Central, these are the grants that are available right now that you can apply for. And it tells you the close dates and the times and things like that. And so, you know, if you lived in Southern, Sarah, they have the Southern Graduate Student Grant. They have the Southern Research Education Pre-Proposal Grant available. And so you just go here and you click on this and then you would start the whole application process that will actually allow you to submit your proposal. So we're going to go to this one that was approved. And you'll come here and you'll see a checklist. So when you're creating a new grant, these won't be checked off until you fill in all this information on the left here. So you have to have general information, which is going to open up each one of these tabs. You have to have the grant proposal information, the budget justification. And if you have livestock, then you will have to have that on there. So this is what the general information will tell you. During that year, they had $600,000 that they were allocating for this particular grant. And then they were telling you that the project must be completed in 24 months. Again, that's been extended because of COVID. But usually they give you two years to work on your projects here in North Central. It may be different in another region. Then it tells you, you know, some of the sustainable projects that they're looking for. It also tells you if you're going to apply as an individual or a team or a group. Now, these amounts are different based on each region. And this is where I was telling you you need to look and see what the criteria is because it's different based on each region. I was looking at North East and they were offering $30,000 maximum for a project where North Central, if you're an individual, you can get up to $9,000. If you're a team, you can get up to $18,000. And if you're a group, you can get up to $27,000. So you need to look at that and you also need to make sure that you qualify as a farm based off whatever their criteria is in this discussion. And then right here, it'll say sustainable agriculture. And these are some of the categories that you can apply in or, you know, your project may fall under one of these. And then it just tells you a history about the farmer rancher grant program, things like that. And so then you go down here and you'll start to fill out this application. You'll say what state you're in. And then I live in Hamilton County. And then you ask you, are you a farmer rancher? Of course, I say yes. But if you're not a farmer rancher, you probably won't be able to apply for this. But say you're a beginning farmer rancher, you could apply for it. Now, if you're like a nonprofit organization, they have another grant that they recommend that you apply for. Instead, it would be the partnership grant that you actually work with a farmer and rancher. And so, you know, we're at AgroAcademy. We're actually going to apply for that non-government partnership grants here. When they come available to help the new farmers that we're actually trying to develop here in this region, because we don't have a lot of black farmers here. We're going to actually apply for that so that we can actually work with farmers so they can actually, you know, qualify for these grants and things. But then you say what type of grant it is. For this particular one, I was an individual. So I didn't have to fill out all the stuff about the team members and all that. But my proposed start date was April 6th. I was dealing with B, so I had to start when I was able to actually go out and work with them. My projected stop date or end date for my project was going to be September 30th. But now it's been extended to September of this year. And then I, you know, I said how much I was applying for as far as the money. And have I submitted, you know, a proposal similar to this? I said no. So, um, had I received, um, grant, um, have been funded grant in the past? At that point, I had not been. Um, and so then I have to say, like, what, what am I going to be, uh, farming or what am I going to be researching? In my case, it was honeybees. So I had to say animals, including bees and fish. And then, you know, you fill out all the information and you go to the next section. So then the next section, um, you're, this is where you get into the meat potatoes of your actual project. So you're going to have to do a project abstract. And I know if some of you have never, like, worked in research and things, this might seem kind of weird because it's actually a research paper that if you keep working on this project, it could actually be developed and it'd be published in, like, some scientific journal and things. Um, so you want to make sure that you understand this terminology, uh, you know, reach out to somebody that may be a scientist, hint, hint, that can help you write this stuff up, uh, make you, help you understand what a project abstract is. So basically it's like a summary of your proposal. Um, it would be a number of, it's a certain number of words. They don't want you to exceed, and they only want you to cover certain things in the abstract. It's just to give the person a basic understanding of what you're trying to do in your project. Um, so mine was, um, about wax worms as well as, uh, hive beetles. These are two pests that infest, uh, beehives, um, and they can cause a lot of problems as far as, you know, honey, soaring honey. And then also, um, uh, you know, hive beetles, they can actually cause hives to up and leave. They can cause problems with brood that's developing and things like that. So my abstract was wax worms, which are the larvae of great wax moths and lesser wax moths, and small hive beetles are parasites and scavengers of honeybee colonies. Apis mellifera. Apis mellifera is a scientific name for bees. All three are very destructive to beehives and overall affect bee colony health. While there are numerous mechanical and chemical controls available on the market for these pests, they still are wreaking havoc on the beekeeping industry. Implementing the use of bacillus therangyntus species as a biological control for these three pests, it adds another line of defense against them. The overall goal is to improve honeybee colony health and prevent colonies from asconding, which that means they up and leave, are being killed by the infestation. With healthier eyes, there should be an increased profit for beekeepers because damage caused to honey and other products should be reduced or eliminated. So when you're doing an abstract, you're just trying to do a quick summary of what your whole project is going to be about. So then you're going to describe your operation. So they're going to ask you about your farm. Again, to be considered a farm, you just have to have, you know, a thousand dollars generated revenue off your facility. So farms can be indoors. Farms can be outdoors. Farms don't have to be hundreds of acres. There's different size farms. That does not, if you have a hundred acres or if you have just a backyard, but you have it registered as a farm, you can do these projects. You're considered a farmer. But basically, I described my operation here in this answer. You know, Kiwi Produce is an urban farm located in Cincinnati that operates on a 7,500 square foot lot inside a 2,000 square foot warehouse. The local urban farm was started in 2013. Crops that are grown are tomato, pepper, green squash, and kale and zinnias. And some produce is grown outdoors during the season, but we also grow produce indoors year round. And I also keep bees. I don't really sell my honey. I keep bees more as a research. I'm an entomologist, so I'm a person that studies insects, so I do a lot of studying of them. So I don't really sell their honey, but, you know, they're on my farm. I also have chickens and things, too. So after you describe your operation, then you want to say what your project objectives are. Project objectives, these are the major things you plan to accomplish during the project by carrying out research, demonstration, or education activities. Focus on the piece of the project you can reasonably complete during the 24 months of the grant. If major objectives will take longer than 24 months, include what you hope to accomplish short-term, during the grant, and long-term. Some examples of their objectives will identify three cover crops, potential use of intensive vegetable production, evaluate the usefulness of five crops, share findings through field days and websites and social media conferences. So this is my objectives. I want to identify if the Bacillus therangyentia species can be used as biological controls against wax worms and small hive beetles. So I have, you know, bought different types of BT bacteria, and, you know, I was using it, and I was spraying it in the hives, and I was testing it out. And then I also did an in-lab test on those same BT bacteria in the lab, testing it on wax worms. And I still have not successfully done it on hive beetles because I have not been able to keep a colony alive outside of a hive. But once I'm able to do that, I'm going to test it on them in the lab. And then, of course, we go out in the field and we test it in the actual beehives. But I had to, you know, when I'm writing up my objectives, I had to say that. Then I had to say, then I said I'm also going to develop a youth beekeeping entomology club. And then I want to share my findings in workshops and via social media. And so as I've been progressing through my project, that's what I've been doing. And so then you have to create a timeline. And then each one of these sections, they usually have a maximum word count. So you can't get too wordy and you can't write novels. You have to pretty much summarize it and put it into a form that is compact, but it covers all the information that you want to cover. So here you're going to provide a detailed description of the research, demonstration, and education activities you will carry out to complete this project. Include who was leading and participating in the activities. And so you're just making a timeline. So this is their example one and then this is mine right here. So in January 2019 to April 2019, I tried to rear small high beetle colonies. It wasn't very successful. I was doing okay. And then I left them outside and the sun kind of cooked them. And then I was not able to find any more after that for that whole year. So I have another little colony that I'm actually growing in my shed right now. And they seem to be thriving. So we'll see when I get the opportunity and I'll take pictures and all that stuff and I'll put it on my social media page that I have dedicated to this project. Then in May 2019, I'm going to set up my hive. So I, you know, we're going to talk about the budget in a minute, but I had to buy beehives. I had to buy bees and things like that. I had to buy all the bacteria and all the stuff I was going to use for the project. So I set the hives up in May. Then from June to September, I was monitoring the hives, you know, checking the bees. And, you know, the first, this first, that first year, it was a bad year. We had a lot of rain. And so it affected even my farm operation to the point where I didn't get a lot of flowers to grow. The bees didn't do so well. They kept trying to re-clean themselves. So it was a lot of stuff going on. And so, you know, you're going to have to write a report at the end of that first year. You have to send in, you know, how's the progress of your project going and things like that. And then, you know, after you write that report, your payments from your grant are broken off into three different payments. So you get your initial payment to start. And then once you write the report, you'll get a second payment. And then the last payment is going to be here in North Central, you get a reimbursement. So, you know, that first year, I wrote, you know, I wrote my report up saying all the issues I encountered and all the things I was able to accomplish. You know, I was able to start, you know, trying to develop that youth entomology club and things like that. And then October, 2019, December, I would hold workshops and present findings, compile data, write up progress reports and things. And then from January to April, I would hold beekeeping workshops. And then again, I would, you know, again, test out the BT sprays and things like that. But between January and April, that's when COVID hit last year. So I was not able to carry out as much of my project as I wanted to. So when I wrote my report up again, I had to ask for an extension. So they extended everybody, pretty much everybody that was awarded something in 2019. Their project was extended into 2021. Then again, you know, April 20th, September 20th, a monitor. And then you have to have a write a final report up when your project is done. So anybody have any questions right now before I go over materials and methods? I see we got some comments over here. So I'll write these. I'll post them. Let's see. Black Voltron says, good afternoon. Good afternoon, Black Voltron. I'm Oakland. Appreciable Assets says, hi. Hello, Appreciable Assets. Bebe says, hello. Melissa says, thank you very much for presenting this information. Currently in Annie's project spring cohort. And this is great. And then Divine Holland says, thank you, sis. Terica says, thank you for the tag. And Williams, Antoinette Williams says, my pleasure, sis. This is excellent information. So anybody have any questions so far about anything that I presented? If not, I'm going to move on. And then if you have any questions, just put them in the comments and I'll post them. All right. So the materials and methods section. This is 300 words. Briefly outline the steps or process involved in carrying out the project and the logic behind the choices you made. For example, your research project describes the type of field or livestock trials involving the location. So basically, you're going to talk about what materials you're going to use and the methods you're going to use to actually carry out your project. So, again, if anybody has ever wrote up, like, a lab report or they've ever taken a science class, say they went to college, they took biology or chemistry or something, you would have to, like, lab reports up. And you would have to do your materials and methods section where you would explain, like, you know, we use this burner, this glassware for this reason, blah, blah, blah, blah. And we got this. We're not even talking about the results yet. We're just talking about the actual project carrying it out itself. And then you're going to collect data during that same time frame that you're doing the project. So this was my materials and methods for the field project. Initially, four BT species will be tested in the lab to determine which BT will be more effective against the pests. There are two that are recommended for caterpillars and two for beetles. Wax worms will be purchased and tested against each of the two by applying BT to feed and determining which one is effective against the larvae. The same will be done for the small hive beetles. Adults will be collected and reared on honeybee protein patties. They will be allowed to mate so they can reproduce. Once there are larvae, BT feeding trials will be conducted on the adults and the larvae since they both feed. The results from this lab experiment will determine which BT will be used in the hives. A total of seven hives will be set up on the urban farm. Two controls with no BT at all, just normal treatments used against pests. One with just caterpillar BT. One with just beetle BT. And three with both BT strains. Hives will be inspected biweekly with pests removed and counted. This data will be recorded. And then for the workshops, the entomology clubs will be hands-on. Material used in the field products will be presented at both. And I would demonstrate how frames and hives are treated with the BT. I would also demonstrate how to prepare BT solutions, where to purchase wax worms, and small high beetle specimens will be present so individuals know what these insects look like. Because we had a lot of people, you know, that have never, you know, kept bees. They don't know, they don't know a lot of, like, what actually shows up in these beehives and things. And then they'll learn about their life cycle and the damage they cause. And then the entomology club students will actually spend time at the hives learning about beekeeping. Any videos or photos I will take during the project will be used in the workshop. And entomology club, I will also present an online webinar presenting the same information presented in the beekeeping workshop. There's a question in the chat. Okay. Let's see. I have a question here. Hello there. Thank you for the awesome information. I would like to know about grants that are awarded to startup gardens and farm projects. Um, so this would probably not be, uh, this particular grant would not be for that. I would have to look at, look into that for you and I can get back to you. Um, if you're looking like for things to like buy supplies and things, if it's not a research project, if you're not trying to improve up on something, improve up on, you know, some type of agricultural, uh, process. And, uh, this is probably not going to be the grant for that. Um, this one, you already have even, you even have a, an established, um, operation or you're establishing an operation, but it's usually going to be a commercial operation. Gardening isn't really commercial. That's more of like a personal type thing. Um, so, um, this is probably not going to be the grant for that. Um, and then like most grants are not going to really fund you starting something. They really want you to have it already started and then they will fund like maybe a part of it. Like say you need to purchase something to repair or something like that. That's usually what grants will do. Uh, let's see. I am specifically concerned about the projects that do not have financials that can be presented to funders because the funds are needed to literally get off the ground. Yeah, they don't, a lot of grants are not for that unless you're like a nonprofit organization. Sometimes you can get grants like that, but if you don't have a nonprofit status or you're not some type of university or something like that, a lot of times you're not going to be able to get these grants. This is just, this, this grant right here is an exception, um, because you don't have to have the, uh, like a nonprofit status, but you at least have to be an operating firm. Um, so preachable assets as what is BT? BT is a bacteria called Bacillus therigensis. Uh, this is the bacteria that, um, there's different BT bacterias. There's some that affect caterpillars. There's some that affect beetles. There's some that affect flies and things. Um, you know, um, so there's different types of BT. They all, um, can, you know, disrupt a insect's, um, life cycle. A lot of times it'll either kill them or, you know, um, that's what it really does. It kills them. It gives them a bacterial infection once they feed and things, uh, once they have to feed on it. Um, so I was using BT that would affect caterpillars. Uh, wax worms are actually caterpillars that infest hives and be, um, the BT for the beetles, the hive beetles and their larvae, they actually feed on a number of different things in a hive, including sometimes they can feed on the larvae themselves, uh, the bee larva, honeybee larva. And so, um, that bacteria would not affect the, uh, bees, but it would affect those two insect, uh, pests that are in there. She said, uh, Antoinette Williams said, yes, we are a nonprofit and we like to be a community garden. And thank you so much for your reply. Yeah. I, um, are you, where are you located at? Are you in Cincinnati or what's art? What state are you in? I don't, you might've said that and I just missed it. Um, I'll send you, I'll put my email in the chat. Okay. And you can, uh, send me an email to tell me more about your operation, see if I can actually find something that might help you. Okay. Um, back to the, uh, proposal. All right. So the next part we'll talk about is the outreach. So all these, uh, former rancher grants, they have to have an outreach component where you actually, uh, take it out either into the farming community as well as into the, um, the general population, uh, to educate about this. So, um, all projects must have this included into there. So my outreach, you know, I was going to try to recruit 10 youth, uh, into my beekeeping club using social media and to present the lab in, in the lit at laboratory story to BT. Um, then we're going to do a hands-on beekeeping class for youth. And then we're going to present project data hands-on, uh, to actual beekeepers, uh, adults as well as children that may be beekeepers as well. And then just do a general, uh, webinar presenting the data that I collected that, you know, anybody that might be interested, they may not have been local to this area. Um, and they couldn't attend those workshops and things, um, but they could still see that data that I was actually collecting. And so then the next part you're going to do is what I call a previous research review. You're going to briefly summarize research that has been done on this topic by others. So has anybody done a research project similar to the one that you're doing? And if they have, you need to do a summary. Um, this is just like, uh, if you were in, you know, graduate school or something, this would be like a peer review. You would actually research and look up, um, research actual papers and journals and things and see if people have actually, uh, you know, did the same project or something similar. Um, and then you would, you know, explain, uh, how it correlates to what you're actually going to do. So, you know, I found some different papers where they were testing BT strains on, uh, some beetles and some of it was effective. Some of it was not effective, but they only kept their project in lab. They didn't actually go out in the field and actually use it in the hives. So my project was going to take it a step further and put it into the hives and test the effectiveness in the hives. Um, then you want to do part. The next part, which is measuring benefits and the impact. Sarah grants are intended to increase knowledge of sustainable and agricultural systems that enhance environmental quality, uh, sustained profitability and improve quality of life. And so what do you want to do is you want to be able to, how can you measure your results? Um, and so down here, uh, what I was going to do is, you know, I was going to measure the effectiveness of the BT and it's a reduction of pest burden each week by doing biweekly inspections and then counting to see if the number of actual, uh, you know, pests was reduced by applying these treatments. Um, the data was kept in spreadsheets and in an electronic journal. And so you have to have what you're actually, um, going to go through and collect data because that's very important. Uh, you want to make sure that your, your project is, you know, effective or if it's not, what, where, where can you make some changes in things? Uh, and then you want to explain how this contributes to sustainable agriculture. Um, which means you want to make a meaningful contribution to sustainable agriculture. You want to summarize how your approach or solution will affect other farmers, ranchers in your community and the North central region, economically, ecologically, and socially. And you want to address all three areas if your project focused mostly on them. And so, uh, you know, you know, I talked about the overall impact of my project was to use an environmentally friendly and sustainable method to reduce pest burden and beehives using BT bacteria. Um, so, you know, whatever your project is, you're going to have to say, you know, how's that sustainable? How's that, uh, keeping, you know, improving the environment, fixing the environment, things like that. And then you're going to have a letter of support. So you're going to have to have submit one letter of support from a community member, not a family member who explains why this project is needed and how it's benefit benefits the community. Um, so my letter of support actually came from a magazine I used to write for. I used to write entomological, uh, articles. Um, and so the, the, um, the editor and the, uh, the creator of the magazine, she wrote the letter for me because, you know, I was her official entomologist for her. Uh, it was a gardening magazine. Um, so I would write all these entomological, which are insect articles explaining how to, uh, you know, control different insects or how to, you know, get insects to come to your gardens and things like that. So she was able to write me an effective letter. Um, and so again, I was, I was granted, uh, funding for this project. So after I filled all that out, um, then I had to go over here and do the budget justification. So you have to come down here. It's also called a budget narrative where you have to explain each, each item that you're going to, uh, need funding for. You have to explain what it is and why you need it. Um, and so this, this is, this is, gives you the total amount of money that you're going to, uh, request. And so you had to say what materials you're going to buy. Like I was going to buy beehives, bee suits. Um, you pay yourself out of the grant. Um, and then you have my, you know, my workshops, uh, the BT bacteria, the wax worms, the small hive beetles and things like that. And then I had to justify why, you know, why I needed that amount. So I'd say, you know, I was going to buy seven beehives and they cost this amount times seven. And I needed 10 beekeeping suits. Then I needed 20 hours, uh, uh, a hundred, $30 an hour, 180 hours. Um, and then the workshops, then I had an assistant project assistant that would help when I was setting up the beehives and things. And then I had to buy the wax worms and, you know, then I had to find a small hive beetles, uh, that I was using for the project. And then if you had a livestock care plan, which I did not need one, but if you did have one, you would have to fill all this out. You would have to explain your feeding schedules and all that for the animals that you're using. If you're going to slaughter them, uh, what's the slaughtering plan, uh, veterinary records and things like that. Um, so, uh, this, this is a, uh, a, um, a proposal that you can just write up like overnight, unless you're very efficient at writing things and stuff like that. Um, but you know, I was, I was granted a, uh, um, a grant for my project and I've been, you know, working on my project. And so I'm just going to show you really quickly before we get to, uh, Mr. Brennan Washington, um, the other project that was recently funded through, uh, Ag Academy. Um, hold on. Share. So there's one more. Um, this is from Chandler Glover. Like I said, he's our program manager for Ag Academy. Uh, he submitted a application back in December. Um, and then he received notification notification that he was awarded a grant, uh, um, this month or actually last month. And then, uh, he, he just received the paperwork to, uh, finalize and get his checks, his first check and stuff mailed. Um, but he's actually doing an aquaculture project. Um, he's going to be, um, raising, uh, oysters indoors. Um, and so his project, he had to do the same thing I did. He had to go through that whole proposal, uh, doing a summary, abstract summary and abstract are the same thing. Um, project objectives. And then, you know, these are his different objectives and things like that. Uh, he had to do his budget. I can't access this from that link because I, he would have to log into his account. But basically he was awarded a grant, you know, I showed him how to write it up and things. And then, you know, I went through and I showed him like what needed to be eliminated. We had to make sure we stayed in the, the, uh, word counts and things like that. And then he submitted it and he had to do his own little research for the, uh, peer review part and things like that. So anybody can, anybody can do this as a farmer or rancher, or, you know, you have a idea that you want to start farming, um, that will help other farmers, ranchers, uh, either in your region or, you know, nationwide. Um, aquaculture is a, uh, aquaculture is a up and coming, you know, industry because of all the pollution and things that are out in the, uh, waterways, oceans and things like that. Uh, that, um, we're going to have to start farming our own, uh, seafood if we're going to want to have it available. Cool. Um, so I just want to show you guys that his project. Um, and then, you know, once it's, once you're awarded, it's listed on their website and then they'll, they'll, uh, do a, uh, um, well, they'll broadcast it out. They'll send like a newsletter and they'll say all the new, uh, grant recipients for this year and things like that. So it's a big deal. And again, these projects, they can be, you know, you're getting the initial funding, but you know, if you're growing something and then you can get more funding, eventually this whole project could actually turn into something that could be, uh, published in journals and things like that. All right. Last day here. Now let's go back over here. So I'm going to go back to. Um, so now we're going to speak with, uh, Mr. Brennan, Washington. Uh, he's an 1890 land grant liaison and limited resource minority farmer outreach specialist. Uh, Brennan, Washington works in close liaison with limited resource minority outreach farmers and organizations, including NGOs, community groups, and cooperatives across the Southern region, as well as 1890 land grant institutions and promoting SARE grant, uh, programs. Um, Southern SARE grant programs provide sustainable agriculture, educational resources, enhancing quality grant recipients, networking with regional partners and building new relationships. Uh, Brennan travels extensively across the Southern region, working with producers, NGOs, and community groups regarding sustainable agriculture. If you live in the Southern region, uh, and you want to, you have want to find somebody to contact, he's a great source to contact. Um, here's his contact information. Um, and then once this broadcast is, uh, you know, put on the Facebook and things, you can go back and watch it again. If you don't, if you're not able to write it down now. Um, but he's located in Georgia. Um, and again, he, he covers the Southern SARE region. So I'm going to add him to this broadcast. Yes. He's been waiting so patiently. Hello. Can you hear me? Yes, I can. Yes, I can. Welcome. Welcome. Thank you for having me. Thank you for having me. And that was an excellent overview of the, the procedure for the North Central, um, SARE grant, um, uh, process. So you, you talked a little bit about me. I always like to tell people I'm a farmer. My wife and I have had a in suburban farm since 2005. We're located right above Atlanta, Georgia. Um, and all of our farms, only two and a half acres. We practice highly intensive farming. We've run up to a 80 person CSA off of our farm. Uh, we currently have two high tunnels, a greenhouse and another structure that we're going to be using for aeroponic production. Um, and we keep a flock of laying hens and we're putting fruit trees in our front yard as we speak. So, um, Ms. Nadia gave you a good rundown. And so I became involved with the SARE program. I want to say about 2008, 2009, because I wanted to know why nobody sold anything beside watermelons and cantaloupes at the farmer's market here. And, um, you know, I was mainly interested in growing some of the European and Asian varieties, which smaller, um, where you don't have to, uh, have to eat watermelon for a week. If you have a small family or, you know, a 10 or 20 or 30 pound watermelon wasn't going to work for you. Uh, and every time I asked somebody, they said, well, you just can't with her in the South and you just can't. Well, why can't you? Well, you just can't. And somebody turned me onto the SARE program and I wrote a, I had never written a grant before. So for those of you who have never written a grant proposal, um, listen to this closely, I had never written a grant proposal before. Uh, I, I followed the instruction as, as Nadia laid out and, and when she was explaining her project and I got awarded $9,500 to do a test scroll out for a one year project. To, to test my ideas. Um, so Nadia, um, got, went over, you know, the basics of, of the mechanics of putting, um, uh, putting a application together. It's a couple of things. First thing I want to tell you in order for me to help you understand how SARE reviews these projects and it's a little bit important that, you know, a little bit more about, um, the SARE organization. So, although we get our funding from USDA, we are not a USDA program. The funding is initially given to the national Institute of food and agriculture. And then that money is split in four, uh, um, split in four equal amounts and given to a land grant university in each of the four regions. So in the north central region, that's the university of Minnesota and the west region. And don't hold me to this because they, uh, they recently just changed. I think it's Idaho state. Um, up in, it's a university of Vermont up in the, um, northeastern region. And in the southern region is the university of Georgia. So that sets the, um, those are the organizations that are responsible for actually running the program. And sometimes they do it in partnership with other organizations. So for example, in the southern region, they work closely with Fort Valley State University. And also with the Kerr center, which is a sustainable ad nonprofit in Oklahoma. Um, the important thing for you to understand is that each. Sarah region is governed by what's called an administrative council. And it's very important for you to know about the administrative council. So when you submit your application, if you submit it, you're not going to be reviewed by PhD. There may be a PhD or two in the room, but you're mainly going to be reviewed by farmers and ranchers, your peers. So each administrative council, um, has at least six to eight farmers and ranchers on the administrative council. And one of their primary, uh, responsibilities is to review farmer rancher grants. So in our case, we call them producer grants. Um, we do have representatives from, for example, NRCS, um, EPA. We've got representatives from, um, the 1862 research and 1862 extension. And this, in the case of the Southern, Southern states, we, we also have the same representatives for the 1890 universities. So that's one thing you should know as you're, um, if you're contemplating putting an application in is that. You're not going to be judged by a room full of scientists. You know, you're going to be judged primarily by people that's getting their hands dirty and doing the same type of work that you do. Um, so, um, Nadia told you about the actual getting in, but even before that, the very first thing you should do with any CRAMP is read the call for proposals. That's the official announcement. That tells you we're now accepting applications for whatever program let's stick with the, uh, farmer rancher. We're now accepting applications for the farmer rancher grant program. And these are all the conditions. And these are all the requirements that you need to meet in order to apply for this grant. And it'll tell you, for example, um, we're a little bit different. I think we just say that you have to be a commercial grow. I don't know if we put a dollar amount in our region, but in, in the North central region, if they're putting a thousand dollars, it'll be included in there. It'll be, it'll tell you what's allowable and unallowable costs within the budget. So most USDA programs, uh, Sarah included do not allow you to, um, include most equipment, you know, usually if the equipment's under a certain dollar amount, um, you can go ahead and include it, but anything above, usually it's $5,000. You typically can include that in your budget application. But once again, that call for proposals will tell you, um, what you can put in your application. Uh, as you look through the call for proposal, um, when you think of research, don't think of research as you get, you're sitting in a lab. So, you know, my, my project was, you know, I just wanted to know why the heck nobody was growing European type melons in the South. Um, it could also mean other things. It could mean, uh, Nadia's, uh, project was on, um, pest controls and, and, and, and pest mitigation and, and beehives. Uh, but some other things you could look at, let's say you are, um, you are a grower of herbs, and you want to find out if there's a market for certain type of herbal tinctures and what that market looks like. And, and, um, you know, how large that might, and could it be a profitable market for you? That certainly is a, uh, uh, an allowable study. You know, it just doesn't have to be, you're going to be studying dirt, soils, animals, or pests. You know, that, that could be a, uh, a study. One of our R&Es that we gave out, um, just recently when we closed our research and education, there's a couple of nonprofits that's going to look at the impact or the lack thereof of technology on black farmers in the South. So it doesn't have to be where I'm going to, uh, I'm going to study pest control. I'm going to study animal health. So just keep an open mind when it comes to that. Um, in terms of the budget, I told you about equipment. One of the things that Sarah is very, very big on, I think why the program is so successful is that it's very farmer centric. So, um, in the case of the, the farmer grant, farmer rancher grants, uh, if you're doing the work for yourself, you should include a salary and you should include a paycheck in there for yourself. If you are asking someone else to another farmer to do work with you in partnership, you certainly need to have a line item in there for how you're paying that farmer. Uh, and if they're not charging you, you need to get a letter or something from them saying that they're doing this work for your charge or they're providing it as in-kind services. What you don't want to do is, um, uh, either write yourself in for a bunch of hours or bring in some, uh, some, some outside farms to work and not explain that a, you don't have to pay them or, or, or, you know, what their payment rate is. So that that's extremely important. Um, uh, like I said, we, uh, my three areas, uh, that's a graduate student grant. Um, so, um, it, it always helps if, if you're, if you think your project is going to require, um, some, some, some, a lot of analytical abilities that you don't have, it's always wise to approach your, your land grant or your 1890, uh, you're either 1890 or 1862 for help. So I don't know what the relationship is between, um, especially the black nonprofits, uh, that, the nonprofits that serve farmers of color and BIPOC communities. I just don't know the area that well. I will tell you that North Central Sarah invited me up there. This was in 19 invited me up there, uh, up to, uh, uh, they were having their administrative council meeting in South Dakota. And, um, they invited me up there because they don't feel that they're reaching out and having an impact on communities of color in the North Central region. Um, my position's unique, uh, no other Sarah position, no other Sarah region has a position like mine. Um, so a lot of stuff I can tell you that I could do for you if you want to Southern region, that may not exist in the Northeast or the North Central or the Western region. Um, um, my position because of the, because the large majority of the 1890 universities, and these are the Tuskegee's and the Virginia States and the Ford valleys of the world, because the overwhelming majority of them was in the South. And when, when all the Sarah regions were at one point centered and headquartered in Maryland, they said they was going to push, um, the operations back out to the, uh, to the various regions and let the regions run them. Um, one of the conditions for the Southern region was that they create an outreach person for the 1890 universities. Um, it is a reimbursement program. So you can know that, but there's ways you can, I mean, you can pay yourself, you can stick in an invoice for your time, uh, and get paid. Now, a lot of this may have changed. My grant was 10 years ago. Uh, but what I like to tell people is you, if you're new to grant writing, always use little money to, to, um, to get big money. So some of the folks that I have worked that started out with, um, uh, small farmer rancher grants. Now I've worked with them and they're now working on a larger R and E's, which go up to around $400,000. Um, they're, they're now working on that. So the thing is to get your feet wet and, and, um, do that stuff in terms of what the reviewers look for. First of all, they look for that you are not adding items that are not allowable within the call for proposals. That's why, you know, you get that call proposals, you print it out, you highlight it. Um, uh, so if you, for example, ask for a tractor, ask to buy a tractor within your, the scope of your project, that's not going to be covered. And if it's a major part of your budget, you're probably not going to get approved. Um, uh, as Nadia said, we want to see that you've, um, done some research and see what other type of research has been done on what you're trying to do. So, um, uh, and Nadia's case, she went and looked at, at studies. First thing you do is look at the shared database. It's searchable by regions. You can look at it for all the regions, or you can narrow it down to your specific regions and just put in your key row words. So I'm sure if Nadia did this, she put in beekeeping and she put in BT or BT for, for bees or something like that. And you can see what was done. If anything was done by researchers in your area, or even an entire country, even if something has been done, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't go ahead and proceed with it. Because what may work in the Cincinnati, Ohio area may not work in Prairie View, Texas, if you guys understand what I mean. So just because an idea has been studied, it may not be applicable for areas. And I'll give you an example. We, um, we funded a large multi-state study, uh, research project on cover crops. Um, uh, the North Central region probably leads the nation in cover crop research. Um, but as you try to take that research and adapt it to other regions, like to the Southern region, it just didn't work. Our climatic conditions are much different. Um, so we did it. Um, but what we were surprised to find, we had pretty much every state from Virginia all the way across to Oklahoma. Once we hit Louisiana and Texas, they didn't join the study because their climatic conditions were so different that they couldn't even be a part of a study for the Southern region. So they ended up doing their own. So just because you see that something had been done, um, don't automatically assume, well, I'm not going to apply for this because somebody did it. There may be things unique to your particular situation that makes your project different. And that's what you're looking for different, but you do want to show those reviewers that you took the time and energy to go out and look to see what research had already been done on that. And as Nadia said, either you can build upon it, you can say, well, this is a good start, but it really doesn't apply to the situation that I'm dealing with, or I'm going to tweak this research, um, uh, in a certain way to make it work. Um, not every project will be successful. And when I mean successful, I thought I'd have melons coming out of my ears. I was like, okay, I got this grant I'm going to have. And, um, as Nadia explained, you know, mother nature stepped in and said, well, wait a minute. Um, so that was the, uh, I got my grant right when Georgia was in the middle of a serious drought and also a serious heat wave. So we had, uh, uh, we had multiple days when it was over a hundred degrees. Uh, we wanted the severe water restrictions, even though I'm on city water, uh, it became very expensive to water, water our crops. So I didn't get the, um, I didn't get the, the results that I thought I'd be looking for that I thought I was going to get. But it also taught me something that those melons didn't light, um, the atmosphere and the hot, you couldn't put those melons out in the middle of a Georgia field and expect them to grow. What you could do and what we eventually did was stick them into our tree lines, um, underneath our, our, our pine tree canopies where they were partially shaded and they did fine there. So we learned a little bit, uh, right there. The three things you should think about when you approach your grant is, um, sustainable ag is always known as having a three legs. It's a stool with three legs. So your first leg is, um, uh, environmental, you know, are you, um, do, are, is your form of agriculture doing any harm to the environment, the soil, the water, the air? Um, so that's the first leg of the stool. The second leg and the leg I'm always concerned with is financial. Um, is this form of agriculture, is this project going to do anything to make a farmer more financially viable and financially viable means bringing more income into that farm or into a group of farmers, um, on a consistent basis. So that's the second leg of the stool. And the third leg is social sustainability. Um, are you, is your project by virtue of, um, it being successful or not, is it going to, um, provide some social stability to that, um, to that, to that community? So for example, will it create jobs or will, uh, by the use of cover crops, you're getting left runoff into your local streams and waters. So those are the type of stuff that, that, that you look at. Um, um, and I think from here, that's mainly it. The biggest thing is to look at that call for proposals. Um, I, you know, my biggest advice would be not to, uh, not to be afraid. Uh, I, in, in addition to the SAIR grant, I probably, I've served as a reviewer for, oh, um, five or six other federal programs. And even though the programs may be, uh, significantly different in what the goals are, and even though the money amounts may be, um, significantly different, the basic elements of writing that grant are, are the same from grant program to grant program to grant program. So I don't care if you're applying for a SAIR grant or if you're applying for a beginning farmer and rancher development program grant, you can't buy equipment. You can't buy land. You can't buy animals. Um, that's pretty much across the board for most federal programs. And with that, I don't know if you need me to cover anything else, Ms. Nadia. Uh, you know, I'll take questions if people have them. Yeah. So we have one question that says, are there SAIR grants for a for-profit business that will provide services to farmers? For example, a business that is developing an app for farmers and consumers. Uh, in the context of what that we're speaking with now, and that is farmer rancher, um, um, farmer rancher grant, the answer would be no. Uh, um, if it was a partnership grant, and once again, you've, uh, I got to put the caveat, I don't know exactly what the rules are for the North Central region, but we certainly have had, uh, uh, proposals and funded projects where, where, uh, private businesses were a part of the project. What we're not going to do is provide a private startup money, you know? So if this isn't brought up, uh, from a farmer and it doesn't have significant farmer involvement, if, if, if you're just looking for the money, for example, to start that app up, um, that's not going to get funded. Okay. Yeah. I think we have the partnership grant up here and then we have a professional something grant, professional research, professional development grant, something like that. Yeah. Your PDP grant, which is what they're called. Those are your trainer, trainer grants. So, um, uh, a perfect example is Nadia. Let's say you came out with some solid techniques and results that would, um, uh, uh, control those wax worms using the methodologies that you research. You could apply for funding to go teach, um, uh, teach that information to extension to other nonprofit organizations. Um, that's what those PDP programs are there for, uh, to, to basically train the trainer. So you're training people who eventually is going to take that information and train farmers. Okay. So anybody else have any other questions? So anybody think they're going to apply for farmer rancher grant? Um, again, look at your region to see what other grants are available. Cause you know, you may, you may meet the qualifications. Like you said, you know, prior, I had never applied to a SEER grant when I wrote that proposal up. So, I mean, I was, I was granted it. I just, I saw a problem that needed addressing and, you know, having the knowledge that I have being an entomologist and stuff, I just applied that and was able to get the funding. So, you know, if some of you are new farmers this year and you encounter some issue, see, see if there's a, uh, you know, see if somebody has addressed that issue that you're, you're, you're, you're facing. And if they have, were they successful at controlling the issue? And if not, what could you do or what could your project do to address that issue or, you know, improve upon that? You know, since we had COVID, there's a lot of, you know, opportunity now in the agriculture industry. We saw there was a breakdown in all types of systems. Uh, there's a breakdown in the food chain. There's breeze down and, and everything, uh, logistics and all types of stuff. So, um, you know, we're getting out of this pandemic now, but what is something like this comes up in the future? Um, you know, you could be doing a small project that, you know, if something like this comes up again, it can be something that can be applied and be turned into something big. So, uh, just look at that. Look at, look at what happened over the last year and the things that involve agriculture and the different industries that were involved in agriculture. Um, it wasn't just food. There was a lot of other things that were lacking. Um, you know, some of this stuff is still back, back. You can't get certain things. You can't get seeds. You can't get all a bunch of other stuff. So you can't get plants. You can't, you know, equipment, all types of things. So there's a lot of, there's not a room here that you could possibly use this grant or another under the, uh, you know, USDA or CERI grants, um, to address those issues. Yeah. And I would say, um, uh, the biggest thing to get over is just spirit and, and a hesitation because you've never done this before. And I'm going to be perfectly honest with you. You may not get funded the first time around, um, but don't give up. So one of the things that'll happen, let's say you apply and you're not funded. Um, one of the things you're going to be, um, uh, that's going to be sent with you to you is those reviewer comments. They're going to say that, um, you know, we liked this grant, but we thought it was lacking because of these reasons. And I'll act if you get good reviewers, because sometimes you can get bad reviewers, but if you get good reviewers, they will spell out exactly what they wanted to see in order to make your grants, um, uh, uh, more competitive. So take that information and reapply again. The other thing is before you actually applied for the grant, if you have a question, you're not sure about something, pick up their phone and call those grant chiefs. That's what they're there for. Whoever's the designated contact, um, for, for you to, uh, to speak to, if you have any questions prior to submitting that grant, that's what they're there for. You know, I always get, uh, pissed off when I go sit down in a grant review meeting and people that I know, I know, and people that know that I work for SAIA submitted a grant and it was just, there was avoidable errors in their application that they, that, that they could have gotten, uh, rid of if they had only picked up the phone. So don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't be afraid to, uh, if you don't make it the first time, do it, uh, apply the second time. And I have, SAIA right now, I know Southern SAIA definitely has this mission. I am not satisfied with the number of farmers and organizations of color that are getting, uh, grants from us. And I'm just on a mission to increase that. And it is going up since I took this position, but not to where I want it to be. And I can't get those numbers up if people don't apply. So, right. Yeah. Um, that's the same thing we're trying to do up here in North Central. Um, you know, there's not even a lot of black farmers up in this region. So we're trying to even increase that number of farmers in this area and then, you know, have them apply to these grants and things. So we can increase the number of people of color that are, you know, benefiting from these programs. Um, so a person did have one question that says, do hoop houses, wash and pack, et cetera, qualify not necessarily equipment. Uh, so I'm thinking asking if hoop houses and I guess wash and pack, I guess that's the machinery to package the produce that they grow. Uh, I don't think that's going to qualify for, it depends on your region. Yeah, it depends on your region. And it, uh, it certainly depends on how it fits into the research concept that you want to do. So for example, I'm sure Chandler had to, uh, purchase some equipment or purchase some supplies that was unique to his project. And, um, I had a farmer that I actually, I was mentoring them through another program, but the son, I mean, I don't know how, why or how it started, but he started collecting, uh, seeds from heirloom pumpkins in the North Georgia mountains. And they wanted to apply for some money to, um, to see if they can do domestically produced pumpkin seed oil. Cause for what I understand, a lot of it comes from overseas. And our biggest problem was finding a seed press that was affordable. And I mean, those things cost a lot of money. What we ended up doing is renting one for, for the duration of the project. So Ms. Hood and, and, and, and response to your question, you know, I would need to know what exactly those hoop houses and the wash and pack, how did they, they're going to fit into your research. Typically when we see hoop hoop and high houses, we tell you to go see NRCS because that's what they're set up. Yeah, that's what they're set up to do. Um, and wash and pack, I would probably send you to the local foods promotion program because that's what they're set up to do. So, uh, a lot of it depends on, on what the goals of your project is and how it fits into the, the goals of that funder, because that funders putting out these grants cause they want to accomplish certain goals for us, for Sarah, advanced sustainable agriculture for, uh, the farm, the farmer's market program, uh, promotion program and our local food promotion program is to increase the sale, the, the sales of, uh, locally grown foods and locally grown through pop products. So they're more set up for that, for that NRCS is to get, uh, to do course, uh, farmers do, um, uh, conservation practices of which, uh, hoop houses are one on your land. So once again, it was like, once you have your concept of your, um, your idea, then I would just go, uh, uh, funding shopping and, uh, Nadia, I know, uh, both Nadia and Chandler belong to a group that I have, but I'll try and send you that, uh, um, Sarah just updated the available federal funding across, uh, all the federal funding available for small to medium sized farms. Um, so I'll go ahead and send you that, that's hot off the presses. Uh, and if you compare it to some of your clientele, that way they can look and say, well, this, this will fund this, but this program won't fund that. Right. And that, that helps us identify people who are serious. Mm-hmm. Because, uh, because the grant writing process also acts as a filter, if you're serious. Mm-hmm. Right. Um, and one of the things I wanted to come on here and say is that when you, you touched, you had already touched on it. Um, you know, I, yeah, you're hearing from me now that I'm, I am awarded, but my, I didn't get awarded my first, I would say it right. But I thought that that feedback was invaluable. And we, we've also, um, we've also applied for other grants, federal grants and stuff like that for the USDA. And SEER is the most responsive. Right. So we, we did like that, um, uh, because one of the things that's, one of the things that, uh, that, uh, is limiting when you, when you're, uh, applying for grants is, you know, sometimes they don't give you that long of a timeline before they make them available. And then if something is unclear, uh, the response time to whoever's in charge, um, sometimes, um, asks to a delay to, to where even that, if that, if your project is feasible in that, or fits under the guidelines. Um, we didn't experience that with SEER. Um, you know, now I understand exactly why, um, my first, our first project didn't, um, get, um, awarded, but, um, what I did is I took that and applied those critiques came up with this project and yeah, they awarded the whole thing. So now what that did is that allowed us to think in the terms of, um, what qualifies to show up, uh, to project, you know, what we can do next. Ken, I'm curious, was the, the one that, uh, didn't get funded, was it the same, the same type of project that you got funded for? Was it something totally different? Something totally different. Okay. Um, we were, yeah, we were gonna, um, do vanilla and something else. Cause I, vanilla is my, um, I want to bring vanilla growing to the States. Uh, because, uh, for where it, where it is, um, it, it costs so much to do it over there and we can supplement some of that, uh, by some of our modern technologies. And, but a lot of the areas that we depend on, they've been hit by mother nature. They've been hit by typhoons and stuff cause Madagascar is the number, number one place. So, um, but we were trying to coordinate with two different regions and the, uh, the, the coordinators that quite understand our vision. So, um, so it would, it's easier now from their critiques to know what they need to hear. Um, in order to get that funding. Cause you know, they're, they're strangers. You don't know exactly what they need to hear. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, um, Sarah likes different, you know, um, if you came to in the Southern region and you had, you were requesting funding for a small ruminator, go to sheet project. It had better be a pretty daggone good, unique one cause we funded so much of that work. Um, right. What was unique about your project Chandler? I was like, wait a minute, is this guy, I thought, I thought this guy was in Ohio. What's he doing a project on oysters for, you know? Right. And so I'm sure they asked some of those questions, but it makes sense. I mean, we funded, uh, an oyster project through UGA and it was a small project, uh, by the university. Right. And so, you know, they're in cages, even though, uh, UGA has a, uh, a good natural oyster, um, habitat, you know, I guess they don't meet the, the, um, the criteria for restaurants and stuff. So, um, you know, being different, it's good too. You just gotta make sure that you explain exactly, exactly what you're going to do. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, we, we're, you know, we're, we're, we're landlocked, um, so to say, but, and then, you know, you want to be able to get seafood, um, to these local markets. Um, so, uh, and my thing is I wanted to create a system that I could, um, I can show other black people, um, to do in, in our Metro areas. Right. Um, because I wanted it to be duplicatable because after this, I'm going to just look for another system. Um, cause I want, I want, I want, I want black people to be able to like, like your farm was right, right outside of Atlanta, which is perfect. You don't necessarily want to live in a major metropolitan area. Right. It's expensive. Right. But that's your market, right? You want, you want to sell your stuff at those prices, right? But you don't want to, you don't want to have to bear that cost of living. Right. So if, if our people could, you know, take these systems and take farming, um, serious and do that, uh, act, uh, produce on the outskirts, um, provide to the, um, to the urban areas. Yeah. I think, I think, you know, we can empower ourselves with that. Yeah, man. And you guys seem to be pretty, I mean, this, I'm just getting to know your organizations, but it seems like you're pretty grounded in your communities. But as you start to develop like a base of farmers of color and farmers in the area that you're working on, I always put this bug in, and folks that I talked to, and I've never seen a research project that dealt with it. But if you're increasing the incidence of local food, say a particular area, does that automatically translate into a healthier population? Um, I'm going to say, I don't know. Just because you stick a farmer's market, say in the South Bronx on the west side of Atlanta, does that mean that people automatically going to get healthier? I don't know. I don't know. And I've been trying to get people to do something like that. So cool story. So one of the projects for USDA that we got turned down from was something like that. And we had to take all those metrics into consideration because Cincinnati has the second highest in the nation. Oh man, you're from New Jersey. New Jersey is number one. Okay. So Cincinnati has the second highest in child poverty in the nation, second to New Jersey. New Jersey. And so what we wanted to do is we, and we have a lot of food deserts. We wanted to use the people in those food deserts to start urban farms and stuff like that, and then pay them a livable wage. So that way, by hiring these people, you pull them out of poverty. Our target market is going to be black women because they're the number one keepers of black kids, black kids, who were the majority of the kids in poverty. Right. Well, from our studies, people aren't used to fresh food. So then you have to implement how to prepare them and then how to store them. Because people don't know the shelf life of fresh foods and they don't do meal planning according to fresh foods. They use meal planning according to foods that come in a box. So providing the food isn't enough. It's almost as if, you know, how the USDA, when Dr. Keen broke out, how the USDA built up the white farmers. You almost have to do that same thing for the black population for the fresh food because a lot of people are planning the meals like it was when we grew up. You know, when we grew up in the household, you knew what you were going to eat first. Because you know who was cooking thirst. Every Thursday you ate this so you could buy the same groceries. You know, you had to hurry up and fix this before it spoils or whatever. You don't do that anymore. We eat at much more and then we eat out of boxes at home. So you almost have to have a culinary aspect to your food production. And to people on the call, if you don't feel like you're ready to write a grant, I always suggest go be a reviewer. Once again, they're not looking for people who have PhDs. You know, if you are an urban gardener, that's one of our, that's one, when it comes to expertise, when it comes time to reviewers. We don't have enough people who are experienced and done work around urban agriculture and that type of stuff. So become a reviewer. You know, Nadia Chandler, I would suggest that the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program grant is open right now. And from the light of from what you guys, from what I've heard of your programs, that would be an excellent grant for you. I would say try and be a reviewer this year. And I can let you know who to who to talk to this year. Maybe set yourself up to apply for that grant next year. That's a fairly significant grant, you know, up to six hundred thousand dollars over three year period. And you can pay stipends and stuff out of it. Right. Okay. That's that's the easiest way to learn these grants people is to become a reviewer. Yeah. Sometimes we don't talk offline. We don't talk offline. One of our teams, they wanted you to have a lot of those larger grants tend to want you to have a large facility or something like that. Yeah. Something that generally doesn't come with black people. Right. So, so, you know, maybe there's some workarounds for that. But yeah, we'll talk offline. But yeah. Yeah. And I think Keith asks, how do you become a reviewer? It depends on the program. So it's there. You can sign up anytime. Like I said, my position is kind of unique. I'm the only one. But you can contact somebody from Sarah and tell them that, you know, tell them what your background is and they want to be a reviewer. And and they agree that your background is that they'll put you on. Like I said, North Central is really looking for more participation. Across the whole facade of of their programs by people color. You have a lot of Native Americans up in the North Central region. So it's easy to sort of get there. They have literally no connections with black community. How much of your how much of your time did they require to be a reviewer? What time commitment was required to be in review? Um, a few hours. They'll send you some. It depends on the program now. For us, they'll send you a few programs. You know, I may take four or five hours. Some programs. Most of the programs pay you. Sarah, unfortunately, does not. But I always say that your payment is you're getting that expertise on what to look for. And the reviewers talk. Um, but it depends on the program Chandler. The larger the grant program, the more time commitments. You say four or five hours. That's at what frequency? Oh, when the when the grant comes out. So, I think the graduate student grants are open now. I think we're not just to the North Central. So it would be when I grant, um, grant, um, that that grant program opens up and what they do, you wouldn't be, you wouldn't have to review all the grants. They'll that divvy them up to, um, a brand viewers, uh, specifically looking to place reviewers with the requisite experience on the, um, on a particular proposal. Cool. All right. Does anyone else have any questions? We're trying to make it to where, uh, if you're serious about, um, uh, being a farmer rancher and, um, going forward, um, because these are one of the hidden hands. And, um, and farming that, um, that our, our black farmers will take advantage of that. That keeps some of these other, um, groups of farmers afloat, you know, when they'll work with these universities and the universities use their farm, then they are the recipients of this PhD level or graduate level research that innovates, um, production, you know, and they'll often found leave them there with the tools. Um, there's, there's a program like that going to the university of Florida right now. Um, they found out how to make strawberries sweeter, um, without, you know, using sugar or anything like that, just, um, by adding a certain spectrum of light. And they can pick like three farmers to do it on. So those farmers are the hit of the game. So we want to be able to do that, have that feedback loop with black farmers and black, uh, universities and things of that nature. So anybody else have any other questions? I don't know. It's a slight delay. Um, and even if you're not in my region, um, you can certainly reach out if you have some questions, you know, or I would say, go, you know, contact the people in your region. But if you just feel comfortable talking with someone who looks like you, um, I could at least listen to you and, and, and, and give you my opinion. Yeah. Brennan, you've been invaluable. I really appreciate you. That's a, and, and, you know, I, hopefully people, you know, even if you're a little timid about this, you know, for a long time, our people didn't get this information, you know, it just wasn't disseminated to us, you know, even people that was of the same race as us always didn't, uh, tell us about this stuff. So, you know, I, I see that as my responsibility and, um, you know, all I ask is that, you know, people take it and do something with it. Right. Take it and run with it. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. All right. Yep. All right. We'll schedule a follow up call where we could just talk about some larger issues. Okay. Nadia and Phamla. Okay? Yep. Yes, thank you. All right. Nice meeting everybody. All right. So anybody else have any other questions before we sign out this evening? Uh, thank you guys for tuning in. If not, you can send me an email or you can put a comment in the comment section of this video. It'll be streaming live right now on Facebook and YouTube. And then the actual video, once it's rendered, it'll show up so you can watch it later. But if no one has any other questions, we're going to end the broadcast. And I thank you guys for tuning in. Here's our contact information. If you guys need to get in contact with us, there's our email addresses. Like I said, you can also put a comment in the comment section of the video for wherever platform you're streaming it from. So you guys have a good night. Thanks again. And we'll be back soon with some more pertinent information as it pertains to agriculture and black people. All right. Good night.
