 Hi everyone, today we're talking about starting a solar farm where the owners generate annual income thanks to their solar lease with pivot energy. With rocky soil and dry conditions, portions of the land aren't ideal for farming, but they can be perfect for a solar farm. First, let's talk about land requirements. A successful solar project needs at least 10 to 15 acres. In addition to being an appropriate size for this type of solar project, solar farms also need to check other important boxes. The land is mostly flat and no big trees or buildings in the area to cast shadows, making it a great candidate for ground mounting solar panels. We're confident that this solar farm will get plenty of sunlight throughout the day. In addition to inspecting the land's topography, we're interested in its proximity to existing electrical infrastructure like power lines and substations. Being near these can significantly cut down the cost of connecting a solar farm to the local grid, making the entire project more viable. We share detailed information on the best places to build solar farms in this video, starring yours truly. Go watch it after this one. Also, if you are interested in learning the latest news about solar energy, don't forget to subscribe to our newsletter. The link is down below in the description. So let's say that your land passes the size, topography, and infrastructure proximity tests. How do you finance your new solar farm? If you go out alone, developing a solar farm can come with high upfront costs. But if you lease your land to a solar developer like Pivot Energy, you have zero upfront costs. Pivot Energy handles the initial project financing and permitting, and you simply enjoy the ongoing financial benefits. And the upsides of a solar land lease don't stop there. In addition to handling project financing, Pivot Energy takes on all technical responsibilities, including construction and maintenance of a solar project. As the owners of a solar farm know, solar leases are a hassle-free way to secure a predictable and steady income for 20 to 40 years, which is the typical length of a solar project. This is a great way to generate extra income for properties with underutilized land income without the headaches or physical tool of farming or finding new tenants. For businesses looking to go green, working with Pivot to develop a solar farm can significantly decrease your carbon footprint. A solar land lease supports your renewable energy goals and positions your brand as a leader in sustainability. So let's dive back in and look at how leasing land for a solar project actually works. Pivot finances the entire project, so the landowner incurs zero upfront costs. And you can check out this video where we had a conversation with Eric Davis, one of the landowners working with us in Colorado. Pivot communicates with the utility company navigating their specific requirements and procedures for interconnecting a new solar farm to the grid. This includes obtaining permits, conducting studies, and ensuring compliance with local regulations. On average, this process can take several months. Once Pivot has cleared the project with the utility company, construction proceeds quickly. The duration of construction will vary from project to project depending on the size of the solar farm, the location, and other factors. However, on average, construction can take as little as six months. The construction process entails site preparation, panel installation, and compliance with safety and regulatory standards. We will have a video sharing how a solar farm is constructed and what landowners can expect from the construction process. Subscribe so you don't miss it. When the project is developed and energized, we can finally discuss what you likely care about most, the new revenue stream. Solar farm lease rates can vary depending on the size and location of the land. Every site is unique, so getting an evaluation from a professional is key to finding the best lease rate for your land. As the solar developer, Pivot Energy is responsible for operating and maintaining the solar panels. This means that landowners can rest assured that their solar investment is in capable hands. Additionally, Pivot incorporates agrivoltaics and regenerative agricultural practices whenever possible, maximizing land use efficiency while providing the ultimate diversification and income opportunities for the land. Pivot Energy is happy to help you turn your land into a profitable solar venture. Click the link down below or contact any of our team via email to get started.
