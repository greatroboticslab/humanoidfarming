Howto & Style
 It's a farm we found. The whole farm was in one chunk except for four quarters. Being right close to Lake Diefenbaker, the potential for irrigation is huge. Just the vast size, the amount of trenching to be done, the timeline given. We're trying to beat the weather. Yeah, we started three weeks ago. We've never done anything to this extent. Couldn't done anything better or bigger. Never really thought I'd do something this big. Everything has gone really smooth. Probably couldn't plan it to be working better. We're actually part of it. It's not that somebody's doing it for us. We actually get to be involved in making it happen. The Claussen's themselves have thrown an awful lot of sweat equity into the project. And they're hard working people. They are doing most of the fusing of the pipe, the poly pipe. They're doing all the unloading. They're stringing wire. They're doing everything they can. We have crews out here building pivots. We have another crew here fusing the larger diameter pipe. A lot of different steps to make it come together. So seeing it actually happen is a big step and pretty exciting for us. We won't get the smile off of our face when the water starts going. Yeah, it'll be a big step for the operation to have that going. I'm looking forward to seeing water come out of the machines next spring. When it's ready to run next April, it'll be fully automated from the Wi-Fi system with security cameras down at the main pump stations, the booster stations. Everything will be able to be run off a phone or a computer. You can only have something like this happen if everybody works together and everybody's a team. So hats off to everybody. It's pretty cool watching the family work together. We all have our moments and have our days, but it works. Yeah, we get her done. We've had one creek that we crossed in a neighbor's field that the construction guy thought would be a challenge. I thought it would take two days to get through and it took actually four hours. So I guess so far no challenges. Delta irrigation has been awesome to work with from day one and they've just been very accommodating from day one. This is one of the biggest projects in Saskatchewan, 16 quarters of ground, somewhere around 53,000 feet of pipe. Our biggest risk out here is drought. And so, I mean, when we have water, that takes our biggest risk away. It's been awesome. It's been very well organized. Honestly, it's been great. Scott and Rob came out and they got it started for us and they kind of took care of anything, any requests we had. They just did it. They didn't question why we wanted what we wanted. They figured out what we wanted and they just made it happen for us. So it's been great. Yeah. And awesome guys too. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Thank you. You have not yet. Awesome.
