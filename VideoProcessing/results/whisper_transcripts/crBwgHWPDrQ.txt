 Ivan the Inspector! Hi friends! I'm Ivan the Inspector and today we're going to be inspecting milking cows! Won't you come along and learn with me? That's great! We've got a cow right here! Look at this, it's a baby cow! We call this a calf! Hi buddy! Oh isn't he so cute? Oh no, come back here bud! Can you believe this calf is only a few days old and he's already huge! Hey come back here bud! Hey! Don't you want to be on YouTube? Yeah it's okay bud! He's a little bit skittish. That's okay! Oh watch out for that bud! Alright he's gonna hang out over there! Come back here, I've got to show you some more things! So this is called a calf barn! It's a barn where we keep the smaller cows! So come on in here! Look at this! We've got a bunch of food and... We'll start over here with the tiny ones! Hi guys! Hey! Look at these calves! Aren't they cute? Hi! Oh no he did not like me at all! That's okay! Hi bud! Do you see the thing hanging from their ear? These are called ear tags! They've got a number on them so they can keep track of which cow is which! Because believe it or not they all kind of look alike! Except for that one over there! That one's brown! That one looks very different! But look at all of these different calves! They hang out in here for a couple of months! Hi guys! Hi! Do you want to be my friend? Hi! Oh they look so cool! Wow! Now look over here! This has to be the coolest thing I've ever seen! This is a feeding area for the calf! So they come in and on their ear tag, they've got a special little chip that tells the computer how much to give them! Isn't that incredible? So it's like an automatic feeder! So this guy's in here getting some milk! That'll make him nice and big and strong! Wow! That's so cool! Alright, let's come back this way! So we've got the tiny calves over there, right? And then we've got some bigger calves over here! Look at this! Hi guys! Look at them! They're eating out of this trough! Hi buddy! How is the food? Does it taste good? Well, it looks like they might need a little bit more food! Here! Let's grab this shovel! Look at this! And we're going to take a little bit of food! Here we go! And we're going to put some in the trough! Moo to you too! Oh, there we go! And we'll keep going down, keep going down! There we go! Enjoy the food, guys! That's so much fun! Now, look at how big these calves are! They're still pretty big, right? Well, guess what? Cows can get even bigger! They're huge! Come on, we're going to look at some of the bigger ones! So look at this! Here's the machine that feeds the cows milk! Isn't that cool? Such a cool machine! All right, come on in through here! So at a farm like this, it's a dairy farm, they've got cows that make milk, right? And they've got hundreds of cows at this farm! Isn't that awesome? All right, come on, look at this! We're going to see some really big cows in here! Come on! Whoa! Hi! Look at how big he is! Hi buddy! Can you see them in there? Wow! They're gigantic! They're tall and they're big! Hi buddy! They don't want to be our friend, I don't think! Hi! Wow, look at that! Whoa, look at this! What is this thing? It's a robot! What are you doing? Look at that! He's cleaning the floors! Can you believe that? That's amazing! That is so cool! Well, hey, I got an idea! Before we check out more of the cows, why don't we take a dance break? Come on, get up and dance with me! Come on! Come on, get up and dance with me! Come on! Wow, I feel so much better after that dance break! Don't you? Well, look at this! We've got a bunch more cows in here! Like I said, these are all dairy cows! That means that they make milk! Have you ever had milk before? I love milk! Well, guess what? They come from cows! Isn't that cool? The milk comes from the cows! Now, look at all of these cows. They are all here. This is called the parlor. This is where they actually milk the cows. So they come through that thing over there. That's called a chute. You see that little fin area over there? They come in here and then they get put in these places right here so that they can be milked. Isn't that cool? So we've got a bunch of them! How many do you think we have? Let's see, we've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12! That's right! We've got 12 cows over here! Another way of saying that is a dozen! We've got a dozen cows that are going to be milked. Alright, come on over this way. Now, we've got all of the cows set up here. And we've got this nice walkway here. Look at that! You can see my friend over there. He's working on milking the cows. Isn't that cool? So you've got this whole area so that you can walk through. So let's look at some of the things we've got here. We've got some rags and some cleaning stuff so that we can make sure the cows are nicely clean. And then come on over here. Look at this! This is called a milker. So you hook up the milker to the cow's teat. And then it sucks the milk out. Look at that! That's amazing! You can see the milk coming all the way out! That's so cool! So come on, look at this! Every single one of these cows has a milker on it! Isn't that amazing? So this giant machine can milk 12 cows at a time! What a time saver! Isn't that great? So each one of these cows are being milked. The milkers are hooked up to the teat or the udder. And then it shoots all of the milk out. Look at that! And then if you look up here, all of the milk goes into these tubes! And we'll show you where that goes later. Isn't that cool? So these cows actually need to be milked. If they're not milked, it can cause some problems! They really love getting milked! They get milked twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening! Isn't that amazing? Good job, guys! That's amazing! So cool! Before we milk some cows, let's take a chance to talk to them! Look at all these cows! Hi, friends! My name is Ivan the Reporter, and I'm here to ask you, how are you doing today, cow? Okay, he was not a fan. Okay, we'll try the next one. Hey, friend! How are you doing today? Okay, oh, this one wants to get in. Here we go. Number 226. How are you today? Oh, my goodness! Look at the cows! They're so much fun! They're huge! They're utterly amazing! Oh, look at this one over here! Hi, friend! Will you let me touch you? No? Okay. Number 1676. He's not a fan of me. But look at all of them! They're all ready to be milked! Hi, friends! Well, hey, speaking of milking, how about we go milk a cow? Come on, let's go! Are you ready? We're gonna milk a cow! Look at this! All right, so we're gonna reach in here. We gotta clean off the teats. All right, looking good. There we go. We'll put this aside. All right, so next thing we gotta do is we gotta grab the teats, and we gotta pull. All right, let's see. Come on, buddy. You can do it. Look at that! The milk comes right on out! Well, I think that might take too long, so let's try using one of these. All right, here we go. Ready? So we're gonna pull this down. We gotta get these attached. Oh, there's the first one. Looking good. All right, here we go. We gotta get the second. Oh, no! It fell off! It fell off. All right, here we go. I know. I'm sorry, buddy. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Hold on. Here we go. First one's up. There we go. Here goes the second one. Here goes the third one. Very nice. And here goes the fourth one. Whoa! Look at that! We did it! Can you believe it? Look at all the milk coming out. That's so much faster than if I was just using my hands. That's amazing! Follow these tubes. Look at that. They go all the way up here. And then let's see where they go. Come on! We've got all of these tubes. Let's see. And it goes up there to the ceiling. And all the way over there. Look at this! We got tubes coming all the way over here. And then they come even through here. And then over to here. Whoa! Look at this! This is called a milk tank. It's huge! It's even bigger than I am. Look at it! Wow! So all the milk comes out from the cows. It goes all the way over to here into the milk tank. We've got this computer that tells us how warm it is or how cool it is. The farmers hold all the milk in here. And then look at this down here. A truck will come and put a hose up to this. And it will take all the milk away. Isn't that amazing? That's so cool! Well, hey, thank you so much for coming along and learning about milking cows with me!
