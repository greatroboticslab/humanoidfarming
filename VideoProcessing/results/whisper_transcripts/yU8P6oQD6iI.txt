 Water is the number one issue for everybody, for people living in cities as well as people involved in agriculture. In the lower Rio Grande Valley there's population growth occurring and that creates competing interests for the water that is available there. The future of irrigated agricultural farmers in Texas is going, there's going to be tremendous demand on their water. The rate that the Rio Grande Valley is growing, municipalities are going to require much more water. There's going to be a lot of pressure on the agricultural community to better utilize the water and in some cases their water rights may be reduced or taken away. A lot of the state economy is dependent on agriculture and irrigation is a vital portion of that, particularly here in the valley. What can we do together to make water available for the future? We have to find ways to be more efficient and to be able to irrigate our farmers' lands with less water than we've had in the past. There are some things out there that agriculture is doing on water conservation. But the reality is if we want to see water conservation and agriculture, state policy needs to focus on infrastructure changes. I hope that the information that comes out of this project can be delivered to those legislators, those policy makers that when they start making rulings on how we deliver our water and who has the right to that water, they take into account the importance of that irrigation water to the Rio Grande Valley. One way that we can assist the districts is through developing education programs targeting those producers to help them to change to more efficient irrigation practices. That's what the Ag Water Efficiency is all about is demonstrating to the farmer which technologies we've found, which vendors we've found, which systems we've found actually are cost effective in the future. We've found that the government will return not only a savings in water, but an increase in profit. We need to continue to have research in water use efficiency because we need to keep a sustainable agriculture because you don't want agriculture to go out of any community, particularly here in the valley. I think it's our job as people getting educated to go out there to the world and try to change how we do things. We have to build a better future for ourselves and our kids. Conservation is not an option in the future of irrigated agriculture in Texas. It's absolutely mandatory. So now is the time for us to seize the opportunity to create awareness, to educate the public, to tell the producers and the districts about ways that they can conserve water now and for the future of Texas. So, let's read about a solution here. If those countries tiffen the inflation rates and you'll find the support of if your family is either willing to know where you might explode on your field up in some 재밌 more information, whether you'll see what happens last week, depending on peppering for the food fibers.
