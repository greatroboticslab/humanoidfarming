 In today's video I'm going to teach you guys how to train a barn cat. So this is Lil Barn Cat. So some awesome friends of ours named Nick and Zia rescued Lil's mom who happened to be pregnant at the time. They found her in some abandoned house and she ended up having a bunch of little kittens and we got to be the lucky ones to adopt one of those kittens. We've decided to name her Lil. You know maybe it's short for Lilith, maybe it's short for Lily, maybe it's short for Lillian, we're just not quite sure. So her name is Lil Barn Cat. Barn Cat, just to define it for people, is a cat that lives outdoors. It has the barn as its primary shelter. People usually have barn cats to keep down the rodent population around their farm. Here at our place we have a fair amount of mice. You know I made a video the other day about how I how I trap them but the by far the best deterrent has been adding Pablo Barn Cat to the mix. The way to train a Barn Cat is actually relatively straightforward and simple. All you need to do is you get to get a cage, like a good size cage for a like a large dog, you know the type that you would you know keep them in as you're crate training them. And you got to keep them in there for about two or three weeks. That part might be a little bit heartbreaking. It's obviously not the cat's favorite place to be. Once they get used to it they become much more chill. So you keep them in the crate for a couple of weeks. The reason this is important is it teaches them that the barn is their home and it gets them very used to that one specific spot. And once you do this after a while they will not go away from home. They will basically stick around. And that's an important thing because you don't want your Barn Cat to drift off into the far reaches of the pasture. You don't want your Barn Cat to drift off into the woods where you know things like foxes and coyotes and bobcats are there to get them. For little Lil here though we're going to try to actually keep her indoors in our mud room for probably a couple more months. As you can tell she's so gosh darn tiny. So she's much too young to be an actual Barn Cat. It's really important to make sure that even when you're crate training your Barn Cat they get plenty of exercise. So Pablo is one of the friendliest nicest Barn Cats you'll ever meet. An absolute killing machine, but very soft and cuddly too. Sometimes you'll find people who have Barn Cats that are very standoffish and skittish and more feral than pet cat. We've spent a lot of time trying to train Pablo and spend time with Pablo and make sure that he feels like he's got a lot of love and intention. The reason if you guys are wondering too why we don't actually just have a cat in the house if we like these things so much is I'm crazy allergic to cats. I'm going to have to take a shower and change my clothes and wash my hands once I get done shooting this video because probably within about 20 minutes but having this little girl here this close to me I would just start sneezing my head off and my eyes would turn bright red. Now some people will wonder is the Barn Cat a working animal or is it a pet? And I'd say it's actually somewhere in between. It's like a good farm dog companion. Somebody just that you can play with and pet and give a little love and affection to and not eat like a lot of the other farm animals. But at the same time they have a very distinct job and role here at the farm. So with Pablo I still feed him twice a day. Not a ton of food because you know for Pablo for example he's getting a good chunk of his diet at this point from rodents. But we feed him twice a day just to have that ritual of him feeling like he belongs at this house and this is his home and the barn is his home. So beyond that there isn't too much more to how we train our barn cats. It's just give them some love and attention. Make sure you give them food. Make sure that they have a safe place in the barn that can be their home. Make sure that you let them know where home is and then just take care of them. Because I gotta say I'm not a cat person at all but somehow these two little barn cats have wormed their way into my heart in a very weird and unexpected way and I'm pretty happy about it.
