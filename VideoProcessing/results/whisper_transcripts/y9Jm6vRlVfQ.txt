 Growing carrots at home is actually really easy. As long as you respect this one trick, you'll be pulling monster carrots from your garden in just a few months. Two things are stopping your carrot success and the first is compacted soil and the second is dry soil. If you're growing in raised beds or containers, you don't have to worry about compacted soil, but for in-ground growing, make sure you fork the ground first until you get that nice crumble. Loose soil is what allows you to get these big thick carrots, but dry soil is what stops your carrots from growing in the first place. To fix it, we're going to move the mulch aside, deeply hydrate the bed and then make some nice straight furrows using this board. Next, crease your seed packet and then tap the back of your wrist for easy, even seed spacing. Once those seeds are in, cover them up with a little bit of soil, water again, and now for the secret ingredient. Cover your carrots entirely with whatever cardboard, old fabric, a random piece of wood, or giant leaves you have on hand. Doing this stops any water from evaporating, which means that those seeds can't dry out. Just give them a spritz of water every few days for insurance and after 10 days, check daily for signs of growth. Once you see a little bit of green, get rid of the cover, sit back, and enjoy your trouble-free drawing.
