 What's up guys what's growing on so I've got a ripe rack of bananas ready to harvest let's go get this thing We're here in 9b just north of Tampa Florida and there's a thousand different varieties of bananas I grow almost about 40 different varieties here. This one's a dwarf Cavendash The one we're going to be cutting down is an Orinoco it gets to be about 15 foot a lot of people think a banana is a tree But it's actually an herbaceous plant once this is done fruiting We're going to chop this up and just lay it back down around the tree and you constantly have a baby coming up underneath it Two tools we're going to use to cut up the banana machete and a handsaw So we got our bananas this variety is a Orinoco variety and the best way to actually hang these is this way on the back porch I say the back porch is inside of a screen. It'll keep the bugs away These can get really black and they're like a dessert banana or they can be used green like a plantain That's why I use that handsaw I kind of cut this down about six inches below the soil And i'm going to dig out a little hole in the center here And the beetle that actually bores into these bananas is very very common They usually come right after you cut it. So in brazil, you know, they've learned to cut these holes in here by tomorrow This is going to fill with water So if that beetle does come that beetle does lay those eggs those eggs are going to drown and die So ideally we want three bananas on a banana clump and we want to really manage the mat. That's what that's called You have one at a fruiting stage One at mid height and then a baby coming up and you can see I just cut this one out of here That's going to take that energy and put it towards this big one We want to kind of focus that energy into the big banana tree this way that clump will come a little bit faster And like I had mentioned, you know, this is all just fertilizer Just constantly feeding it back to the banana another pro tip One of the best things you could feed a banana would be ash off of a fire. It's really high in potassium Obviously bananas produce lots of potassium so feeding them what they produce really helps out all the manure you can give them hardwood mulch You can't overfeed a banana can't give it too much water Yeah, guys i'm constantly learning too, so i've done a couple of banana videos for you I just got back from a class in costa rica and I learned the pro tip you guys might have saw me cutting these You know these stems in half and you're probably like why is pete wasting time doing that But I found out while I was in costa rica from the guys in brazil When you actually leave the whole stem intact laying on the ground, there's an off gas that starts to come off and actually poison the soil You can chase worms away and different beneficials in the soil so ideally you split these stems in half And you lay them down flat on the ground if you noticed when I was cutting up these leaves I also cut them up into smaller pieces if we lay big large pieces down on the ground It's not going to allow that water and that rain to get through so that's why I chop it up a little bit smaller Allowing that water to come down through there Ideally these go down on the ground first laid flat that's going to hold moisture It's going to feed the soil and we put those leaves down on top of it Like I mentioned you can't over feed a banana any type of manure Any type of ash like I'd mentioned broken down wood mulch compost you cannot over feed these guys You really can't over water them, but they don't want to be in standing water So with organic agriculture, you know, we're feeding the soil we're feeding the microbes the only thing organically That can be sucked up like that for a banana would be like a fish emulsion or urea I know that kind of sounds kind of gross But if you have a clean diet like pee on these trees You will notice a huge difference in the growth. I do this for clients all the time You know, we put 10 bananas in the backyard I tell them about this the one closest to the house is always first to fruit and it's always the biggest banana on the property All right guys, like I mentioned We hang these bananas on the back porch inside of the screen cage and when they're growing on the tree They grow like this but when they get really wiped ripe, they have a tendency to hang down and break off So by hanging them upside down, it extends that hanging life a little bit I'm actually sending my man Lennon home who's editing this video and filming for me with this hand right here So we call this one hand off the rack of bananas This variety is an Orinoco. It's a really old cracker variety. It's been in florida for a long time I think I had mentioned these can be eaten green as a plantain yellow as just a regular eating banana But when they get black they actually turn orange on the inside and almost become like a dessert banana You can freeze them for smoothies do whatever you want Really easy to grow obviously amazing grow bananas
