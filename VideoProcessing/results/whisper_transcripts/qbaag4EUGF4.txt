 First bell of the year. About to start feeding hay. Got to get the net wrap off with the cows so they don't sit there and congest it at all. Is anyone else feeding hay this year already? Or is everything going good for you? You always got to put the hay rings on the bells or else the cows will just tear them up and they won't eat them. Usually we're doing this about winter time. Not right now. This is very early for us. The hay is not good this year at all. The grass is all dying. This way leaves us no choice.
