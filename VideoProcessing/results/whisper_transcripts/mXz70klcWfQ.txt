 Modern agricultural machinery is amazing. Planters can be wider than two lanes on a highway, and combines can cost almost half a million dollars. Some new tractors can drive themselves thanks to satellite connections. For most of mankind's history, farming was exclusively manual labor, and a farmer planted crops one row at a time. Improvements in farm techniques were one of the highlights of the Industrial Revolution. The McCormick Reaper was invented in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley in 1834. The first steam engine used in farming was invented even earlier, in 1798.
