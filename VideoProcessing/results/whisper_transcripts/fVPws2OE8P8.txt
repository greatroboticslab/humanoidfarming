 Music Hello my friends, are you ready to witness some incredible moments in agriculture? In today's video, we will explore some impressive scenes during the harvest season together. In 2023, California continues to be the leading cantaloupe producing state in the US. The peak harvest season runs from May to October. Alongside machinery, some farmers harvest by hand to cater to markets like Canada or Japan. Music Not all melons in the field ripen at the same time. Hand harvesting allows farmers to return multiple times to pick the ripened fruits. Music Farmers pick tomatoes while pushing carts along the aisles inside greenhouses. During this process, farmers can separate high quality tomatoes from those with slight imperfections. Music A closed loop system ensures tomatoes meet high quality standards. Music In Europe, the Netherlands and Spain are the largest tomato producers, thanks to advanced greenhouse technology. Music From July to August, Japanese farmers are busy harvesting peaches. Music Peach harvesting is also a complicated process, as the fruits are picked by hand from the trees. Music Farmers do not care to stack the peaches on top of each other in order to avoid bruising. Music This makes peaches difficult to transport, so they remain quite expensive even in Japan. Music Around 214 acres of bamboo forest in Fu Ling district, Guangjing city in southwestern China have entered the harvest season. Music At peak times, the daily output of bamboo shoots can reach up to 440 pounds. Music So far, bamboo shoots have generated a total revenue of $82,000, increasing the income of local farmers. Music The sight of lush green gourd trellises with bitter melons hanging down creates an impressive landscape. During harvest season, farmers skillfully use knives or scissors to cut the stalks, ensuring the fruits are not damaged. Music This type of harvest typically takes place early in the morning to maintain freshness. Music Bitter melons are sorted in the field based on size and colour. Music This is the off-season dragon fruit harvest for Vietnamese farmers. Harvesting during cooler weather allows the fruits to remain fresh for longer. Music Off-season dragon fruit production helps maintain Vietnam's position in global markets. Dragon fruit is one of the country's key export products and is projected to reach a value of around $171 million. In Japan, the moment of harvesting pumpkins is an essential part of agriculture, especially in autumn. The process of harvesting and transporting pumpkins is done with great care. Music Hokkaido leads the country in pumpkin production. With an annual output of approximately $179 million pounds, it accounts for around 46.7% of Japan's total pumpkin production. Music On large farms, farmers use cabbage harvesters to supply the fresh vegetable market. As the harvester passes through the cabbage rows, a special blade cuts off the leaves and roots of the cabbages. Music After cutting, the cabbages are moved onto the conveyor belt on the machine. During this process, workers inspect and remove cabbages that do not meet quality standards on the spot. Music Harvesting machines play a key role in the development of Brazil's coffee industry. The country accounts for nearly 40% of the world's coffee production. Music As the machine moves through the coffee trees, its vibrating components are adjusted to gently shake the branches. This process causes the ripe coffee cherries to fall from the trees. The machine is designed to target only the ripe cherries, minimizing the collection of unripe ones. Music When kimchi making season arrives in South Korea, farmers in Hainok County become busy harvesting cabbages. This region is the country's largest cabbage producer. It is estimated that the average price for 22 pounds of cabbage is around $5.73. Music They typically cut each cabbage gently, ensuring that the leaves remain intact since the cabbage needs to maintain its shape for kimchi processing. Music This is a machine assisted carrot harvest. The harvester loosens the soil and then gently pulls the carrots out of the ground. The tops are removed while the carrots are transferred onto a truck. Music The harvesting machine can cover a large area in a short period. Farmers can supply carrots to supermarkets, food processing factories or for export. Alfalfa harvesting usually takes place just before the blooming stage. The best time to cut alfalfa is in the morning. If seeds or high quality hay are desired, farmers will harvest during the early flowering stage. Music For high protein livestock feed, alfalfa is harvested as early as possible, during the sprouting stage. Music There are approximately 700 pea farmers working across England. They supply over 2 billion portions of peas each summer. Music The harvesting machine gently pulls the pea pods from the ground and separates the peas from their pods. On a 28 acre field, around 123,000 pounds of fresh peas can be harvested. Music Durham wheat has high gluten protein content, making it an ideal ingredient for pasta production. This crop is typically harvested in late summer, mostly using combine harvesters. Music Canadian farmers have grown 6.34 million acres of Durham wheat, from which they harvest 11 million pounds annually. Music About 3 months after planting, this is the time when farmers can harvest papayas. Thailand has a total cultivation area of approximately 43,000 acres, yielding around 440 million pounds of papayas annually. Before packaging, farmers inspect and remove any damaged fruit. Papayas are packed into carton boxes with foam liners to protect the fruits from impact. Music This is the process of harvesting cinnamon bark, one of the most valuable spices in the international market. Farmers typically use knives to cut the bark vertically along the tree trunk. Music After removing the outer layer, the inner cinnamon bark is harvested. This inner layer is rolled into cinnamon sticks. Music The United States is the largest producer of Christmas trees in the world. With an annual output of around 25 to 30 million trees. Prominent states for tree farming include Oregon, Michigan and North Carolina. Music The trees are cut at the base, but care is taken to not damage the parent tree. Farmers select trees ranging from 4.9 to 10 feet, depending on market demands. Music Next, let's head to the world's largest cork forest to see how Portugal produces 40 million cork stoppers every day. Music Each summer, harvesters strip the bark using techniques that have been passed down for centuries. Music The bark can only be harvested once every nine years. And harvesters must wait 33 years to obtain the best quality cork. Music Harvesting pine wood is a technical process that requires precision to ensure the quality of the wood. Farmers typically use chainsaws to cut the pine trees at the base. Music The trees are cut into long logs, depending on the requirements of processing plants. After cutting, the logs are transported out of the forest using trucks or specialised vehicles. Music In addition to pine trees, eucalyptus trees are an economically valuable species for the plant. Music India is a major producer of eucalyptus wood, with an estimated output of around 4 million cubic metres in 2023. Music Eucalyptus trees are typically harvested when they reach maturity, between 5 and 10 years old. Unprocessed eucalyptus wood ranges from $30 to $100 per tree. Music The harvest time for pheasants depends on market demand. Music Typically, pheasants reach the required weight and maturity. Pheasants reach the required weight and maturity at around 6 to 12 months old. Music Each harvest requires around 10 people working together to gather the birds into cages. The catching and transportation process is done carefully to minimise stress on the pheasants. Music Before transportation, all sheep must undergo health checks to ensure that they are free from diseases. For lambs, they are weaned 14 days before long-distance transport. Music Australia exports an average of 2 million live sheep annually, primarily to Middle Eastern countries. In 2023, Australia's sheep industry achieved an export value exceeding $2 billion. Ducks typically lay eggs around midnight to early morning, which is also when farmers are busy collecting them. Farmers use flashlights to illuminate the surrounding areas. They move gently and search for eggs in spots where the ducks usually gather. The eggs are often scattered across fields or grassy banks. Each year, Vietnamese farmers harvest around 4 billion eggs. Music After gathering the ducks in centralised areas, they are weighed in groups of around 10 to 20. Weighing helps determine the total output for pricing to traders or processing plants. Music Vietnam's duck meat production reaches around 7 million tonnes annually. Duck meat is consumed domestically and exported, primarily to South Eastern Asian countries and China. Music This is a critical step in the pork supply chain, as weaned piglets are transferred to growth farms until they reach slaughter weight. Traditionally, weaned piglets are sold at 6 weeks of age when they weigh between 19 and 20 pounds in order to maximise their value. Each piglet is priced between $40 and $70. This is an important source of income for pig farming operations. Music When it comes to the nut industry, almonds and walnuts take centre stage due to their large production scale and high global demand. Recent reports show that almonds are the most widely grown nut, with California producing 80% of the world's supply. This state, along with China, dominates the walnut market. Music On top of that, cashews are another nut with a very different harvesting and processing method compared to almonds and walnuts. Mainly because they contain a poisonous chemical in the shell. Music That's why they're quite expensive when exported to the US, with one pound of whole cashews selling for as much as $16. Music So how do these nut farms and processing facilities work? Let's take a closer look in this video. Music First, we will visit the almond farm. California almonds owe much of their success to the temperature difference of about 58 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit between summer and winter. Experts estimate that it takes around one gallon of water to produce a single almond. So with modern irrigation systems in place, it's no surprise that California produces over 2.5 billion pounds of almonds every year. When harvest time comes, specialised machines, called shakers, clamp onto the trunks of each tree and shake it vigorously. Causing the almonds to fall like rain to the ground. Music The farmers then let the nuts dry naturally for 4 to 7 days. Before running a sweeper machine over them to gather them into rows. Music This helps to repair the nuts for a different collection machine. Equipped with sensors that remove most of the dirt and debris. From there, the almonds are sent to large stockpiles. Where they are fumigated for around 2 days. Then to be stored for processing. This facility's daily task is to handle over 20,000 pounds of almonds. Once the almonds are cleaned of dirt, rocks and twigs, the shelling process begins. The nuts are vibrated and rubbed repeatedly. So that the almonds inside easily separate from the shell. Then they pass through holes designed so that only the almond kernel can fall through. This process is repeated around 8 times. With progressively smaller holes to ensure the shell is fully separated. After that is the sorting process. Which is done both by machine and manually. The almonds are sifted through vibrating screens to sort them by size. Again using the same hole filling method as when separating the shells and then an optical sorting machine. Once approved, the remaining almonds are packed and shipped to various fields. To create a wide range of almond products. Do you know why they're dumping millions of these crushed almonds into the chocolate? Why it's to make the outer coating for millions of ice cream bars? We're at an ice cream factory. And nuts are essential for making the ice cream more delicious. And the eating experience more interesting. This chocolate nut bath is very cold. So once they're dipped in, the coating instantly freezes. After that, the ice cream will be packaged. To prevent the ice cream from melting, the entire ice cream production process must be kept at a very cold temperature. Would you like to try a day working in an ice cream factory? Along with almonds, walnuts also thrive in the Mediterranean climates like those found in California and China. However, unlike almonds, which rely on bees for pollination, walnuts are wind pollinated. Another key difference is the walnuts must be shelled right after harvest. Rather than being stored in stockpiles like almonds. At the end of the hot season, when the husk of the walnut begins to split open, farmers start the harvest process. Once again, the shaker machines are used to clamp onto the tree trunks and shake thousands of walnuts loose in just a few seconds. After they fall to the ground, they're swept into rows by a sweeper machine and then collected by a harvester. Each plant typically stores around 1.6 million pounds of walnuts during the harvest season. Using a similar vibrating hole sorting system, the plant separates whole walnuts from walnut halves at the end of the production line. The walnuts are then thoroughly cleaned and dried in large air dryers to reduce moisture to around 8%. This ensures that they stay fresh throughout the packaging and export process. Now we will explore the nuts that you have been waiting for. Unlike almonds and walnuts, cashews thrive in tropical regions with warm temperatures and consistent rainfall throughout the year. That's why countries like Vietnam, India and the Ivory Coast dominate global cashew production, contributing nearly 70% of the world's supply. But, without intensive, precise processing, these nuts wouldn't be edible at all because of their toxic shell. Farmers collect them by hand or with simple tools. Then they lay them out in the sun for a few days to allow the caustic liquid to dry before the processing begins. Then the cashew nuts are steamed. After steaming, the outer shells are removed. In the past, this was removed entirely by hand. But the chemical would burn the skin. So today, most large cashew processing facilities use machines to shell the nuts. Then the cashew nuts are dehumidified. After dehumidification, the inner shell must be removed again because it can cause throat irritation when eaten. And cashews with the shell removed also sell for a higher price. Today, only large factories can afford the shelling machines. Smaller operations still rely on workers for this job. It's important to keep the nut intact without breaking it, as the price is higher for whole cashews. After shelling, the cashews go through multiple rounds of sorting by size and colour, and are also quality checked by both humans and machines. In 2022, the world consumed 1.99 million pounds of cashews, making it one of the most popular and valuable nuts globally. Worth over $8 billion today. Most of the nuts are made into nut butter. This creamy spread is a staple in many households, and offers a convenient way to enjoy the nutritional benefits of these nuts. The journey to creating nut butter begins with roasting, which gives the nuts a rich and nutty aroma. This step also helps loosen any remaining skin, especially for nuts like peanuts, almonds and walnuts, which are often blanched before processing. Once roasted, the nuts are cooled and funneled into grinding machines, along with seasonings. These industrial grinders operate at high speeds, breaking the nuts down into smaller and smaller particles. The friction from grinding generates heat, which naturally releases the oils within the nuts, creating a creamy consistency. Almonds and cashews achieve this texture more easily because of their higher oil content. Factories often test random samples from each batch to ensure they meet food safety standards. The finished product is then transferred into sterilized jars, sealed and labeled. These jars are vacuum sealed to maintain freshness and extend shelf life. In 2023, the nut butter market was valued at over $6.7 billion, with almond butter alone accounting for a significant share. In addition to traditional nut butter, there is a growing demand for speciality blends. Almond chocolate butter, walnut butter mixed with honey or even protein fortified options are gaining popularity in health food markets. Another popular nut product is nut milk. This type of milk has become a go-to alternative to dairy milk, especially for 65% of people worldwide who are lactose intolerant. California, known as the Golden State, is not only famous for its beaches, Hollywood and Silicon Valley, but it's also a powerhouse in U.S. agriculture. California, California, contributes over $55 billion annually to the U.S. economy. That's not just a statistic. It's a livelihood, a community and food on your table. So how does this diverse and high yield system grow over 400 different crops and provide jobs for more than 420,000 people every year? Let's answer that by exploring some of its most iconic products. First, we'll dive into nuts. California is the global leader in almond, walnut and pistachio production, producing 80% of the world and nearly 100% of the U.S.'s supply. Each of these nuts pumps over $5 billion into the state's economy every year. From August until November, farmers start to prepare for the harvest. Nut farmers use tree shaker machines for this task and leave them to dry for around 5 to 7 days, depending on the moisture content of the kernel. For almonds, each machine can handle 30 to 60 trees per hour, allowing billions of pounds of almonds to be harvested every season. Then, the nuts are swept into a window to prepare for collection by the harvesting machine, which can filter out the nuts from the dirt and soil. In 2023, California harvested 2.6 billion pounds of almonds, 1.65 billion pounds of walnuts and 1.36 billion pounds of pistachios. Rising labor costs are also driving the use of advanced technologies, like automated sorting and shelling machines at processing plants that can sift through thousands of pounds of nuts per hour. In addition to nuts, California's grape industry is another giant. The season varies by type, but table grapes are harvested from May until January, while wine grapes peak from August until October. For high-end wine grapes are often harvested at night, when the cooler temperatures help preserve sugar content and flavor. This rule is strictly followed, especially during heat waves. The wine industry generates over $70 billion annually for the US, so harvesters also join in with skilled pickers who hand-cut each cluster under the headlights. The state grows over 6 million tons of grapes every year, and 81% of those are used to make wine. That translates into billions of bottles of wine exported to over 140 countries. In contrast, table grapes and raisins are harvested during the day. Have you ever eaten these premium moondrop grapes? They are more expensive than any other type, so workers here pick them more carefully. They even trim out the bad grapes before moving on to other bunches. The table grapes are often packaged at the vines right after harvesting, to make sure they are washed thoroughly before eating. California grows 99% of raisins in the US, with more than 185,000 acres dedicated to raisin grapes, mainly in the US. Each bunch typically weighs between 1 to 2 pounds, and is laid on the ground for days to dry under the California sun. Then workers collect them for washing and packaging. However, California's vineyards are increasingly under threat. Every time there's a wildfire alert nearby, the vineyard workers have to race all day and all night to save grapes from approaching fires. Sometimes, more than 20,000 pounds of grapes must be harvested in just 8 hours. Hence, mechanized harvesters are also becoming more common for this type of grape. Next, let's explore another special vegetable. California tomatoes. Tomato harvest season here runs from late June through October. The state produces nearly 26 billion pounds annually, mainly grown in the Central Valley and the Sanguelkin Valley. Giant tomato harvesters equipped with optical sensors distinguish ripe red tomatoes from unripe green ones. These machines can harvest up to 120,000 pounds of tomatoes per day. In 2023, California's tomato crop reached over 22.3 billion pounds, valued at more than $1 billion. Tomatoes aren't just a staple in the US food market, they're a global export. California accounts for over 95% of the nation's processed tomatoes and nearly half of the world's supply. In 2023, the state's tomatoes were shipped to over 60 countries, including Canada, China and Japan, as ketchup, soups and sauces. But California doesn't stop there. Broccoli from here is known for its vibrant green color, firm stalks and tight, compact flower heads. They're around 0.75 to one and a half pounds. Harvesting broccoli remains a manual job. Workers move down each row, quickly cutting their heads off with sharp knives and handing them off to packers in the field. Yield averages around 12,000 pounds per acre, depending on growing conditions. Broccoli is harvested year-round, extending from late November through April in cooler regions and into summer for some areas, like the coastal city of Monterey and Santa Barbara counties, where 92% of the nation's broccoli is grown. In 2023, California produced 3.6 million pounds of broccoli, worth around 820 million dollars. Much of that is exported to major markets, including Canada, Mexico, Japan and various countries in Europe and Asia. Next, let's visit California's dairy farms. Dairy is the state's top agricultural commodity, so they have the best milking system. Tulea County is the largest milk producer in the state, accounting for around 27% of California's milk output. Automated robotic milking systems are used here to milk 360 to 420 cows per hour, ensuring their comfort with only three workers required. With 1.7 million dairy cows, California produces over 40.5 billion pounds of milk annually, accounting for around 18.5% of the nation's supply. While California sets the gold standard for specialty crops, Iowa dominates the major crops like corn and soybeans. Iowa leads the nation in corn production, growing 20% of the country's total, or around 2.6 billion bushels annually. Over 90% of the state's farmland, which is equivalent to 12.5 million acres, or 5.05 million hectares, is used to grow corn. These fields not only provide food, but also fuel, with 47% of the crop used to produce ethanol. In addition to corn, Iowa ranks second in the nation for soybean production, just behind Illinois. With nearly 620 million bushels harvested from nearly 10 million acres of soybean fields every day, soybeans are crucial for everything from livestock feed to cooking oil and biofuels. China is the largest importer of Iowa soybeans. Eggs are another Iowa specialty, making up around 15% of the nation's total egg production. With nearly 60 million chickens, Iowa produces 15 billion eggs each year, making it the leading producer in the U.S. Highly automated facilities ensure efficiency and sustainability, with conveyor belts, climate controlled barns and automated feeding systems. These systems keep Iowa eggs affordable, while meeting strict safety and quality standards. In addition to corn, soybeans and eggs, potatoes are also a major crop in Iowa. Here, potato harvesting begins in July, and runs through October. About 4,500 to 5,000 acres are dedicated to potatoes, with mechanical harvesters collecting thousands of pounds per hour. The state produces around 500 million pounds of potatoes annually. After harvesting, potatoes are stored in large warehouses, before being washed and processed into crisps, fries and mashed potatoes.

Using a similar vibrating hole sorting system, the plant separates whole walnuts from walnut halves at the end of the production line. The walnuts are then thoroughly cleaned and dried in large air dryers to reduce moisture to around 8%. This ensures that they stay fresh throughout the packaging and export process. Now we will explore the nuts that you have been waiting for. Unlike almonds and walnuts, cashews thrive in tropical regions with warm temperatures and consistent rainfall throughout the year. That's why countries like Vietnam, India and the Ivory Coast dominate global cashew production, contributing nearly 70% of the world's supply. But without intensive, precise processing, these nuts wouldn't be edible at all because of their toxic shell. Farmers collect them by hand or with simple tools. Then they lay them out in the sun for a few days to allow the caustic liquid to dry before the processing begins. Then the cashew nuts are steamed. After steaming, the outer shells are removed. In the past, this was removed entirely by hand, but the chemical would burn the skin. So today, most large cashew processing facilities use machines to shell the nuts. Then the cashew nuts are dehumidified. After dehumidification, the inner shell must be removed again because it can cause throat irritation when eaten. And cashews with the shell removed also sell for a higher price. Today, only large factories can afford the shelling machines. Smaller operations still rely on workers for this job. It's important to keep the nut intact without breaking it, as the price is higher for whole cashews. After shelling, the cashews go through multiple rounds of sorting by size and colour, and are also quality checked by both humans and machines. In 2022, the world consumed 1.99 million pounds of cashews, making it one of the most popular and valuable nuts globally, worth over $8 billion today. The first step is to make the nut. Most of the nuts are made into nut butter. This creamy spread is a staple in many households, and offers a convenient way to enjoy the nutritional benefits of these nuts. The journey to creating nut butter begins with roasting, which gives the nuts a rich and nutty aroma. This step also helps loosen any remaining skin, especially for nuts like peanuts, almonds and walnuts, which are often blanched before processing. Once roasted, the nuts are cooled and funneled into grinding machines, along with seasonings. These industrial grinders operate at high speeds, breaking the nuts down into smaller and smaller particles. The friction from grinding generates heat, which naturally releases the oils within the nuts, creating a creamy consistency. Almonds and cashews achieve this texture more easily because of their higher oil content. Factories often test random samples from each batch to ensure they meet food safety standards. The finished product is then transferred into sterilized jars, sealed and labelled. These jars are vacuum sealed to maintain freshness and extend shelf life. In 2023, the nut butter market was valued at over $6.7 billion, with almond butter alone accounting for a significant share. In addition to traditional nut butter, there is a growing demand for speciality blends. Almond chocolate butter, walnut butter mixed with honey or even protein-fortified options are gaining popularity in health food markets. Another popular nut product is nut milk. This type of milk has become a go-to alternative to dairy milk, especially for 65% of people worldwide who are lactose intolerant. California, known as the Golden State, is not only famous for its beaches, Hollywood and Silicon Valley, but it's also a powerhouse in U.S. agriculture. With more than 45 million acres of farmland, making up nearly 40% of the state's total area, California contributes over $55 billion annually to the U.S. economy. That's not just a statistic. It's a livelihood, a community and food on your table. So how does this diverse and high yield system grow over 400 different crops and provide jobs for more than 420,000 people every year? Let's answer that by exploring some of its most iconic products. First we'll dive into nuts. California is the global leader in almond, walnut and pistachio production, producing 80% of the world and nearly 100% of the U.S.'s supply. Each of these nuts pumps over $5 billion into the state's economy every year. From August until November, farmers start to prepare for the harvest. Nut farmers use tree shaker machines for this task and leave them to dry for around 5-7 days, depending on the moisture content of the kernel. For almonds, each machine can handle 30 to 60 trees per hour, allowing billions of pounds of almonds to be harvested every season. Then the nuts are swept into a window to prepare for collection by the harvesting machine, which can filter out the nuts from the dirt and soil. In 2023, California harvested 2.6 billion pounds of almonds, 1.65 billion pounds of walnuts and 1.36 billion pounds of pistachios. Rising labor costs are also driving the use of advanced technologies like automated sorting and shelling machines at processing plants that can sift through thousands of pounds of nuts per hour. In addition to nuts, California's grape industry is another giant. The season varies by type, but table grapes are harvested from May until January, while wine grapes peak from August until October. For high-end wine, grapes are often harvested at night, when the cooler temperatures help preserve sugar content and flavor. This rule is strictly followed, especially during heatwaves. The wine industry generates over $70 billion annually for the US, so harvesters also join in with skilled pickers who hand-cut each cluster under the headlights. The state grows over 6 million tons of grapes every year, and 81% of those are used to make wine. That translates into billions of bottles of wine exported to over 140 countries. In contrast, table grapes and raisins are harvested during the day. Have you ever eaten these premium moondrop grapes? They are more expensive than any other type, so workers here pick them more carefully. They even trim out the bad grapes before moving on to other bunches. The table grapes are often packaged at the vines right after harvesting, to make sure they are washed thoroughly before eating. California grows 99% of raisins in the US, with more than 185,000 acres dedicated to raisin grapes, mainly in Fresno. Each bunch typically weighs between 1 to 2 pounds, and is laid on the ground for days to dry under the California sun. The vineyard workers collect them for washing and packaging. However, California's vineyards are increasingly under threat. Every time there's a wildfire alert nearby, the vineyard workers have to race all day and all night to save grapes from approaching fires. Sometimes, more than 20,000 pounds of grapes must be harvested in just 8 hours. Hence, mechanized harvesters are also becoming more common for this type of grape. Next, let's explore another special vegetable, California tomatoes. Tomato harvest season here runs from late June through October. The state produces nearly 26 billion pounds annually, mainly grown in the Central Valley and the Sanjuelkin Valley. Giant tomato harvesters, equipped with optical sensors, distinguish ripe red tomatoes from unripe green ones. These machines can harvest up to 120,000 pounds of tomatoes per day. In 2023, California's tomato crop reached over 22.3 billion pounds, valued at more than $1 billion. Tomatoes aren't just a staple in the U.S. food market, they're a global export. California accounts for over 95% of the nation's processed tomatoes and nearly half of the world's supply. In 2023, the state's tomatoes were shipped to over 60 countries, including Canada, China and Japan, as ketchup, soups and sauces. But California doesn't stop there. Broccoli from here is known for its vibrant green color, firm stalks and tight, compact flower heads. They're around 0.75 to one and a half pounds. They're around 10,000 pounds per acre, depending on growing conditions. Broccoli is harvested year-round, extending from late November through April in cooler regions and in the winter. And into summer for some areas, like the coastal city of Monterey and Santa Barbara counties, where 92% of the nation's broccoli is grown. In 2023, California produced 3.6 million pounds of broccoli, worth around $820 million. Much of that is exported to major markets, including Canada, Mexico, Japan and various countries in Europe and Asia. Next, let's visit California's dairy farms. Dairy is the state's top agricultural commodity, so they have the best milking system. Tullea County is the largest milk producer in the state, accounting for around 27% of California's milk output. Automated robotic milking systems are used here to milk 360 to 420 cows per hour, ensuring their comfort with only three workers required. With 1.7 million dairy cows, California produces over 40.5 billion pounds of milk annually, accounting for around 18.5% of the nation's supply. While California sets the gold standard for specialty crops, Iowa dominates the major crops like corn and soybeans. Iowa leads the nation in corn production, growing 20% of the country's total, or around 2.6 billion bushels annually. Over 90% of the state's farmland, which is equivalent to 12.5 million acres, or 5.05 million hectares, is used to grow corn. These fields not only provide food, but also fuel, with 47% of the crop used to produce ethanol. In addition to corn, Iowa ranks second in the nation for soybean production, just behind Illinois. With nearly 620 million bushels harvested from nearly 10 million acres of soybean fields every day, soybeans are crucial for everything from livestock feed to cooking oil and biofuels. China is the largest importer of Iowa's soybeans. Eggs are another Iowa specialty, making up around 15% of the nation's total egg production. With nearly 60 million chickens, Iowa produces 15 billion eggs each year, making it the leading producer in the U.S. Highly automated facilities ensure efficiency and sustainability, with conveyor belts, climate controlled barns and automated feeding systems. These systems keep Iowa eggs affordable, while meeting strict safety and quality standards. In addition to corn, soybeans and eggs, potatoes are also a major crop in Iowa. Here, potato harvesting begins in July, and runs through October. About 4,500 to 5,000 acres are dedicated to potatoes, with mechanical harvesters collecting thousands of pounds per hour. The state produces around 500 million pounds of potatoes annually. After harvesting, potatoes are stored in large warehouses, before being washed and processed into crisps, fries and mashed potatoes.

Hello my friends, are you ready to witness some incredible moments in agriculture? In today's video we will explore some impressive scenes during the harvest season together. In 2023, California continues to be the leading cantaloupe producing state in the US. The peak harvest season runs from May to October. Alongside machinery, some farmers harvest by hand to cater to markets like Canada or Japan. Not all melons in the field ripen at the same time. Hand harvesting allows farmers to return multiple times to pick the ripened fruits. Farmers pick tomatoes while pushing carts along the aisles inside greenhouses. During this process, farmers can separate high quality tomatoes from those with slight imperfections. A closed loop system ensures tomatoes meet high quality standards. In Europe, the Netherlands and Spain are the largest tomato producers, thanks to advanced greenhouse technology. From July to August, Japanese farmers are busy harvesting peaches. Peach harvesting is also a complicated process. Peach harvesting is also a complicated process. The fruits are picked by hand from the trees. Farmers do not care to stack the peaches on top of each other in order to avoid bruising. This makes peaches difficult to transport. So they remain quite expensive even in Japan. The harvest season is a big part of the harvest. Around 214 acres of bamboo forest in Full Link District, Guangjing City in southwestern China, have entered the harvest season. At peak times, the daily output of bamboo shoots can reach up to 440 pounds. So far, bamboo shoots have generated a total revenue of $82,000, increasing the income of local farmers. The sight of lush green gourd trellises with bitter melons hanging down creates an impressive landscape. During harvest season, farmers skillfully use knives or scissors to cut the stalks, ensuring the fruits are not damaged. This type of harvest typically takes place early in the morning to maintain freshness. Bitter melons are sorted in the field based on size and colour. This is the off-season dragon fruit harvest for Vietnamese farmers. Harvesting during cooler weather allows the fruits to remain fresh for longer. Off-season dragon fruit production helps maintain Vietnam's position in global markets. Dragon fruit is one of the country's key export products and is projected to reach a value of around $171 million. In Japan, the moment of harvesting pumpkins is an essential part of agriculture, especially in autumn. The process of harvesting and transporting pumpkins is done with great care. The market leads the country in pumpkin production. With an annual output of approximately £179 million, it accounts for around 46.7% of Japan's total pumpkin production. On large farms, farmers use cabbage harvesters to supply the fresh vegetable market. As the harvester passes through the cabbage rows, a special blade cuts off the leaves and roots of the cabbages. After cutting, the cabbages are moved onto the conveyor belt on the machine. During this process, workers inspect and remove cabbages that do not meet quality standards on the spot. Harvesting machines play a key role in the development of Brazil's coffee industry. The country accounts for nearly 40% of the world's coffee production. As the machine moves through the coffee trees, its vibrating components are adjusted to gently shake the branches. This process causes the ripe coffee cherries to fall from the trees. The machine is designed to target only the ripe cherries, minimising the collection of unripe ones. When kimchi making season arrives in South Korea, farmers in Hainam County become busy harvesting cabbages. This region is the country's largest cabbage producer. It is estimated that the average price for 22 pounds of cabbage is around $5.73. They typically cut each cabbage gently, ensuring that the leaves remain intact since the cabbage needs to maintain its shape for kimchi processing. This is a machine assisted carrot harvest. The harvester loosens the soil and then gently pulls the carrots out of the ground. The tops are removed while the carrots are transferred onto a truck. The harvesting machine can cover a large area in a short period. Farmers can supply carrots to supermarkets, food processing factories or for export. Alfalfa harvesting usually takes place just before the blooming stage. The best time to cut alfalfa is in the morning. If seeds or high quality hay are desired, farmers will harvest during the early flowering stage. For high protein livestock feed, alfalfa is harvested as early as possible, during the sprouting stage. There are approximately 700 pea farmers working across England. They supply over 2 billion portions of peas each summer. The harvesting machine gently pulls the pea pods from the ground and separates the peas from their pods. On a 28 acre field, around 123,000 pounds of fresh peas can be harvested. Durum wheat has high gluten protein content, making it an ideal ingredient for pasta production. This crop is typically harvested in late summer, mostly using combine harvesters. Canadian farmers have grown 6.34 million acres of durum wheat, from which they harvest 11 million pounds annually. About three months after planting, this is the time when farmers can harvest papayas. Thailand has a total cultivation area of approximately 43,000 acres, yielding around 440 million pounds of papayas annually. Before packaging, farmers inspect and remove any damaged fruit. Papayas are packed into carton boxes with foam liners to protect the fruits from impact. This is the process of harvesting cinnamon bark, one of the most valuable spices in the international market. Farmers typically use knives to cut the bark vertically along the tree trunk. After removing the outer layer, the inner cinnamon bark is harvested. This inner layer is rolled into cinnamon sticks. The United States is the largest producer of Christmas trees in the world, with an annual output of around 25 to 30 million trees. Prominent states for tree farming include Oregon, Michigan and North Carolina. The trees are cut at the base, but care is taken to not damage the parent tree. Farmers select trees ranging from 4.9 to 10 feet, depending on market demands. Next let's head to the world's largest cork forest to see how Portugal produces 40 million cork stoppers. Each summer, harvesters strip the bark using techniques that have been passed down for centuries. The bark can only be harvested once every nine years, and harvesters must wait 33 years to obtain the best quality cork. Harvesting pine wood is a technical process that requires precision to ensure the quality of the wood. Farmers typically use chainsaws to cut the pine trees at the base. The trees are cut into long logs, depending on the requirements of processing plants. After cutting, the logs are transported out of the forest using trucks or specialised vehicles. In addition to pine trees, eucalyptus trees are an economically valuable species grown widely around the world. India is a major producer of eucalyptus wood, with an estimated output of around 4 million cubic meters in 2023. Eucalyptus trees are typically harvested when they reach maturity, between 5 and 10 years old. Unprocessed eucalyptus wood ranges from $30 to $100 per tree. The harvest time for pheasants depends on market demand. Typically, pheasants reach the required weight and maturity at around 6 to 12 months old. Each harvest requires around 10 people working together to gather the birds into cages. The catching and transportation process is done carefully to minimise stress on the pheasants. Before transportation, all sheep must undergo health checks to ensure that they are free from diseases. For lambs, they are weaned 14 days before long distance transport. Australia exports an average of 2 million live sheep annually, primarily to Middle Eastern countries. In 2023, Australia's sheep industry achieved an export value exceeding $2 billion. Ducks typically lay eggs around midnight to early morning, which is also when farmers are busy collecting them. Farmers use flashlights to illuminate the surrounding areas. They move gently and search for eggs in spots where the ducks usually gather. The eggs are often scattered across fields or grassy banks. Each year, Vietnamese farmers harvest around 4 billion eggs. After gathering the ducks in centralised areas, they are weighed in groups of around 10 to 20. Weighing helps determine the total output for pricing to traders or processing plants. Weighing pigs are more than 200 pounds. Vietnam's duck meat production reaches around 7 million tonnes annually. Duck meat is consumed domestically and exported, primarily to South Eastern Asian countries and China. This is a critical step in the pork supply chain, as weaned piglets are transferred to growth farms until they reach slaughter weight. Traditionally, weaned piglets are sold at 6 weeks of age when they weigh between 19 and 20 pounds in order to maximise their value. Each piglet is priced between $40 and $70. This is an important source of income for pig farming operations. When it comes to the nut industry, almonds and walnuts take centre stage due to their large production scale and high global demand. Recent reports show that almonds are the most widely grown nut, with California producing 80% of the world's supply. This state, along with China, dominates the walnut market. On top of that, cashews are another nut with a very different harvesting and processing method compared to almonds and walnuts. Mainly because they contain a poisonous chemical in the shell. That's why they're quite expensive when exported to the US, with one pound of whole cashews selling for as much as $16. So how do these nut farms and processing facilities work? Let's take a closer look in this video. First, we will visit the almond farm. California almonds owe much of their success to the temperature difference of about 58 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit between summer and winter. Experts estimate that it takes around one gallon of water to produce a single almond. So with modern irrigation systems in place, it's no surprise that California produces over 2.5 billion pounds of almonds every year. When harvest time comes, specialized machines, called shakers, clamp onto the trunks of each tree and shake it vigorously, causing the almonds to fall like rain to the ground. The farmers then let the nuts dry naturally for 4 to 7 days, before running a sweeper machine over them to gather them into rows. This helps to repair the nuts for a different collection machine, equipped with sensors that remove most of the dirt and debris. From there, the almonds are sent to large stockpiles, where they are fumigated for around 2 days, then to be stored for processing. This facility's daily task is to handle over 20,000 pounds of almonds. Once the almonds are cleaned of dirt, rocks and twigs, the shelling process begins. The nuts are vibrated and rubbed repeatedly, so that the almonds inside easily separate from the shell. Then they pass through holes designed so that only the almond kernel can fall through. This process is repeated around 8 times, with progressively smaller holes to ensure the shell is fully separated. After that is the sorting process, which is done both by machine and manually. The almonds are sifted through vibrating screens to sort them by size. Again using the same hole filling method as when separating the shells and then an optical sorting machine. Once approved, the remaining almonds are packed and shipped to various factories to create a wide range of almond products. Do you know why they're dumping millions of these crushed almonds into the chocolate? Why it's to make the outer coating for millions of ice cream bars? We're at an ice cream factory, and nuts are essential for making the ice cream more delicious and the eating experience more interesting. This chocolate nut bath is very cold, so once they're dipped in, the coating instantly freezes. After that, the ice cream will be packaged. To prevent the ice cream from melting, the entire ice cream production process must be kept at a very cold temperature. Would you like to try a day working in an ice cream factory? Along with almonds, walnuts also thrive in the Mediterranean climates like those found in California and China. However, unlike almonds, which rely on bees for pollination, walnuts are wind pollinated. Another key difference is the walnuts must be shelled right after harvest, rather than being stored in stockpiles like almonds. At the end of the hot season, when the husk of the walnut begins to split open, farmers start the harvest process. Once again, the shaker machines are used to clamp onto the tree trunks and shake thousands of walnuts loose in just a few seconds. After they fall to the ground, they're swept into rows by a sweeper machine and then collected by a harvester. Each plant typically stores around 1.6 million pounds of walnuts during the harvest season. Using a similar vibrating hole sorting system, the plant separates whole walnuts from walnut halves at the end of the production line. The walnuts are then thoroughly cleaned and dried in large air dryers to reduce moisture to around 8%. This ensures that they stay fresh throughout the packaging and export process. Now we will explore the nuts that you have been waiting for. Unlike almonds and walnuts, cashews thrive in tropical regions with warm temperatures and consistent rainfall throughout the year. That's why countries like Vietnam, India and the Ivory Coast dominate global cashew production, contributing nearly 70% of the world's supply.

Broccoli from here is known for its vibrant green color, firm stalks and tight, compact flower heads. They're around 0.75 to 1.5 pounds. Harvesting broccoli remains a manual job. Workers move down each row, quickly cutting their heads off with sharp knives and handing them off to packers in the field. Yield averages around 12,000 pounds per acre, depending on growing conditions. Broccoli is harvested year-round, extending from late November through April in cooler regions and into summer for some areas, like the coastal city of Monterey and Santa Barbara counties, where 92% of the nation's broccoli is grown. In 2023, California produced 3.6 million pounds of broccoli, worth around $820 million.

Peach harvesting is also a complicated process, as the fruits are picked by hand from the trees. Farmers do not care to stack the peaches on top of each other in order to avoid bruising. This makes peaches difficult to transport, so they remain quite expensive even in Japan. Around 214 acres of bamboo forest in Full Link District, Guangjing City in southwestern China, have entered the harvest season. At peak times, the daily output of bamboo shoots can reach up to £440. So far, bamboo shoots have generated a total revenue of $82,000, increasing the income of local farmers. The sight of lush green gourd trellises with bitter melons hanging down creates an impressive landscape. During harvest season, farmers skillfully use knives or scissors to cut the stalks, ensuring the fruits are not damaged. This type of harvest typically takes place early in the morning to maintain freshness. Butter melons are sorted in the field based on size and colour. This is the off-season dragon fruit harvest for Vietnamese farmers. Harvesting during cooler weather allows the fruits to remain fresh for longer. Off-season dragon fruit production helps maintain Vietnam's position in global markets. Dragon fruit is one of the country's key export products and is projected to reach a value of around $171 million. In Japan, the moment of harvesting pumpkins is an essential part of agriculture, especially in autumn. The process of harvesting and transporting pumpkins is done with great care. Hokkaido leads the country in pumpkin production. With an annual output of approximately £179 million, it accounts for around 46.7% of Japan's total pumpkin production. On large farms, farmers use cabbage harvesters to supply the fresh vegetable market. As the harvester passes through the cabbage rows, a special blade cuts off the leaves and roots of the cabbages. After cutting, the cabbages are moved onto the conveyor belt on the machine. During this process, workers inspect and remove cabbages that do not meet quality standards on the spot. Harvesting machines play a key role in the development of Brazil's coffee industry. The country accounts for nearly 40% of the world's coffee production. As the machine moves through the coffee trees, its vibrating components are adjusted to gently shake the branches. This process causes the ripe coffee cherries to fall from the trees. The machine is designed to target only the ripe cherries, minimising the collection of unripe ones. When kimchi making season arrives in South Korea, farmers in Hainom County become busy harvesting cabbages. This region is the country's largest cabbage producer. It is estimated that the average price for 22 pounds of cabbage is around $5.73. They typically cut each cabbage gently, ensuring that the leaves remain intact since the cabbage needs to maintain its shape for kimchi processing. This is a machine assisted carrot harvest. The harvester loosens the soil and then gently pulls the carrots out of the ground. The tops are removed while the carrots are transferred onto a truck. The harvesting machine can cover a large area in a short period. Farmers can supply carrots to supermarkets, food processing factories or for export. Alfalfa harvesting usually takes place just before the blooming stage. The best time to cut alfalfa is in the morning. If seeds or high quality hay are desired, farmers will harvest during the early flowering stage. For high protein livestock feed, alfalfa is harvested as early as possible, during the sprouting stage. There are approximately 700 pea farmers working across England. They supply over 2 billion portions of peas each summer. The harvesting machine gently pulls the pea pods from the ground and separates the peas from their pods. On a 28 acre field, around 123,000 pounds of fresh peas can be harvested. Durum wheat has high gluten protein content, making it an ideal ingredient for pasta production. This crop is typically harvested in late summer, mostly using combine harvesters. Canadian farmers have grown 6.34 million acres of durum wheat, from which they harvest 11 million pounds annually. About three months after planting, this is the time when farmers can harvest papayas. Thailand has a total cultivation area of approximately 43,000 acres, yielding around 440 million pounds of papayas annually. Before packaging, farmers inspect and remove any damaged fruit. Papayas are packed into carton boxes with foam liners to protect the fruits from impact. This is the process of harvesting cinnamon bark, one of the most valuable spices in the international market. Farmers typically use knives to cut the bark vertically along the tree trunk. After removing the outer layer, the inner cinnamon bark is harvested. This inner layer is rolled into cinnamon sticks. The United States is the largest producer of Christmas trees in the world, with an annual output of around 25 to 30 million trees. Prominent states for tree farming include Oregon, Michigan and North Carolina. The trees are cut at the base, but care is taken to not damage the parent tree. Farmers select trees ranging from 4.9 to 10 feet, depending on market demands. The forest is the largest cork forest to see how Portugal produces 40 million cork stoppers every day. Each summer, harvesters strip the bark using techniques that have been passed down for centuries. The bark can only be harvested once every nine years, and harvesters must wait 33 years to obtain the best quality cork. Harvesting pine wood is a technical process that requires precision to ensure the quality of the wood. Farmers typically use chainsaws to cut the pine trees at the base. Farmers are also used to be used to grow. The trees are cut into long logs, depending on the requirements of processing plants. After cutting, the logs are transported out of the forest using trucks or specialised vehicles. In addition to pine trees, eucalyptus trees are an economically valuable species grown widely around the world. India is a major producer of eucalyptus wood, with an estimated output of around 4 million cubic metres in 2023. The harvest time for pheasants depends on market demand. The harvest time for pheasants depends on market demand. Typically, pheasants reach the required weight and maturity at around 6 to 12 months old. The harvest time for pheasants depends on market demand. The harvest time for pheasants depends on market demand. Typically, pheasants reach the required weight and maturity at around 6 to 12 months old. Each harvest requires around 10 people working together to gather the birds into cages. The catching and transportation process is done carefully to minimise stress on the pheasants. Before transportation, all sheep must undergo health checks to ensure that they are free from diseases. For lambs, they are weaned 14 days before long distance transport. Australia exports an average of 2 million live sheep annually, primarily to Middle Eastern countries. In 2023, Australia's sheep industry achieved an export value exceeding $2 billion. Ducks typically lay eggs around midnight to early morning, which is also when farmers are busy collecting them. Farmers use flashlights to illuminate the surrounding areas. They move gently and search for eggs in spots where the ducks usually gather. The eggs are often scattered across fields or grassy banks. Each year, Vietnamese farmers harvest around 4 billion eggs. After gathering the ducks in centralised areas, they are weighed in groups of around 10 to 20. Weighing helps determine the total output for pricing to traders or processing plants. Vietnam's duck meat production reaches around 7 million tonnes annually. Duck meat is consumed domestically and exported, primarily to South Eastern Asian countries and China. This is a critical step in the pork supply chain, as weaned piglets are transferred to growth farms until they reach slaughter weight. Weaned piglets are sold at 6 weeks of age when they weigh between 19 and 20 pounds in order to maximise their value. Each piglet is priced between $40 and $70. This is an important source of income for pig farming operations. The nut industry is a big part of the nut industry. When it comes to the nut industry, almonds and walnuts take centre stage due to their large production scale and high global demand. Recent reports show that almonds are the most widely grown nut, with California producing 80% of the world's supply. This state, along with China, dominates the walnut market. On top of that, cashews are another nut with a very different harvesting and processing method compared to almonds and walnuts. Mainly because they contain a poisonous chemical in the shell. That's why they're quite expensive when exported to the US, with one pound of whole cashews selling for as much as $16. So how do these nut farms and processing facilities work? Let's take a closer look in this video. First, we will visit the almond farm. California almonds owe much of their success to the temperature difference of about 58 to 68 degrees Fahrenheit between summer and winter. Experts estimate that it takes around one gallon of water to produce a single almond. So with modern irrigation systems in place, it's no surprise that California produces over 2.5 billion pounds of almonds every year. When harvest time comes, specialised machines, called shakers, clamp onto the trunks of each tree and shake it vigorously. Causing the almonds to fall like rain to the ground. The farmers then let the nuts dry naturally for 4 to 7 days, before running a sweeper machine over them to gather them into rows. This helps to repair the nuts for a different collection machine, equipped with sensors that remove most of the dirt and debris. From there, the almonds are sent to large stockpiles, where they are fumigated for around 2 days, then to be stored for processing. This facility's daily task is to handle over 20,000 pounds of almonds. Once the almonds are cleaned of dirt, rocks and twigs, the shelling process begins. The nuts are vibrated and rubbed repeatedly, so that the almonds inside easily separate from the shell. Then they pass through holes, designed so that only the almond kernel can fall through. This process is repeated around 8 times, with progressively smaller holes to ensure the shell is fully separated. After that is the sorting process, which is done both by machine and manually. The almonds are sifted through vibrating screens to sort them by size. Again using the same hole filling method as when separating the shells and then the optical sorting machine. Once approved, the remaining almonds are packed and shipped to various factories to create a wide range of almond products. The chocolate is also made to make the outer coating for millions of ice cream bars. We're at an ice cream factory and nuts are essential for making the ice cream more delicious and the eating experience more interesting. This chocolate nut bath is very cold, so once they're dipped in, the coating instantly freezes. After that, the ice cream will be packaged. To prevent the ice cream from melting, the entire ice cream production process must be kept at a very cold temperature. Would you like to try a day working in an ice cream factory? A bit of a home for the ice cream factory. Along with almonds, walnuts also thrive in the Mediterranean climates like those found in California and China. However, unlike almonds, which rely on bees for pollination, walnuts are wind pollinated. Another key difference is that walnuts must be shelled right after harvest, rather than being stored in stockpiles like almonds. At the end of the hot season, when the husk of the walnut begins to split open, farmers start the harvest process. Once again, the shaker machines are used to clamp onto the tree trunks and shake thousands of walnuts loose in just a few seconds. After they fall to the ground, they're swept into rows by a sweeper machine and then collected by a harvester. Each plant typically stores around 1.6 million pounds of walnuts during the harvest season. Using a similar vibrating hole sorting system, the plant separates whole walnuts from walnut halves at the end of the production line. The walnuts are then thoroughly cleaned and dried in large air dryers to reduce moisture to around 8%. This ensures that they stay fresh throughout the packaging and export process. Now we will explore the nuts that you have been waiting for. Unlike almonds and walnuts, cashews thrive in tropical regions with warm temperatures and consistent rainfall throughout the year. That's why countries like Vietnam, India and the Ivory Coast dominate global cashew production, contributing nearly 70% of the world's supply. But without intensive, precise processing, these nuts wouldn't be edible at all because of their toxic shell. Others collect them by hand or with simple tools. Then they lay them out in the sun for a few days to allow the caustic liquid to dry before the processing begins. Then the cashew nuts are steamed. After steaming, the outer shells are removed. In the past, this was removed entirely by hand. But the chemical would burn the skin. So today, most large cashew processing facilities use machines to shell the nuts. Then the cashew nuts are dehumidified. After dehumidification, the inner shell must be removed again because it can cause throat irritation when eaten. And cashews with the shell removed also sell for a higher price. Today, only large factories can afford the shelling machines. Smaller operations still rely on workers for this job. It's important to keep the nut intact without breaking it, as the price is higher for whole cashews. After shelling, the cashews go through multiple rounds of sorting by size and colour, and are also quality checked by both humans and machines. In 2022, the world consumed 1.99 million pounds of cashews, making it one of the most popular and valuable nuts globally, worth over $8 billion today. Most of the nuts are made into nut butter. This creamy spread is a staple in many households, and offers a convenient way to enjoy the nutritional benefits of these nuts. The journey to creating nut butter begins with roasting, which gives the nuts a rich and nutty aroma. This step also helps loosen any remaining skin, especially for nuts like peanuts, almonds, and walnuts, which are often blanched before processing. Once roasted, the nuts are cooled and funneled into grinding machines, along with seasonings. These industrial grinders operate at high speeds, breaking the nuts down into smaller and smaller particles. The friction from grinding generates heat, which naturally releases the oils within the nuts, creating a creamy consistency. Almonds and cashews achieve this texture more easily because of their higher oil content. These often test random samples from each batch to ensure they meet food safety standards. The finished product is then transferred into sterilized jars, sealed and labeled. These jars are vacuum sealed to maintain freshness and extend shelf life. In 2023, the nut butter market was valued at over $6.7 billion, with almond butter alone accounting for a significant share. In addition to traditional nut butter, there is a growing demand for speciality blends. Almond chocolate butter, walnut butter mixed with honey, or even protein-fortified options are gaining popularity in health food markets. Another popular nut product is nut milk. This type of milk has become a go-to alternative to dairy milk, especially for 65% of people worldwide who are lactose intolerant. California, known as the Golden State, is not only famous for its beaches, Hollywood and Silicon Valley, but it's also a powerhouse in U.S. agriculture. With more than 45 million acres of farmland, making up nearly 40% of the state's total area, California contributes over $55 billion annually to the U.S. economy. That's not just a statistic. It's a livelihood, a community and food on your table. So how does this diverse and high-yield system grow over 400 different crops and provide jobs for more than 420,000 people every year? Let's answer that by exploring some of its most iconic products. First we'll dive into nuts. California is the global leader in almond, walnut and pistachio production. Nut farmers are producing 80% of the world and nearly 100% of the U.S.'s supply. Each of these nuts pumps over $5 billion into the state's economy every year. From August until November, farmers start to prepare for the harvest. Nut farmers use tree shaker machines for this task and leave them to dry for around 5-7 days, depending on the moisture content of the kernel. For almonds, each machine can handle 30-60 trees per hour, allowing billions of pounds of almonds to be harvested every season. Then the nuts are swept into a window to prepare for collection by the harvesting machine, which can filter out the nuts from the dirt and soil. In 2023, California harvested 2.6 billion pounds of almonds, 1.65 billion pounds of walnuts and 1.36 billion pounds of pistachios. Rising labor costs are also driving the use of advanced technologies like automated sorting and shelling machines at processing plants that can sift through thousands of pounds of nuts per hour. In addition to nuts, California's grape industry is another giant. The season varies by type, but table grapes are harvested from May until January, while wine grapes peak from August until October. For high-end wine, grapes are often harvested at night, when the cooler temperatures help preserve sugar content and flavor. This rule is strictly followed, especially during heatwaves. The wine industry generates over $70 billion annually for the US, so harvesters also join in with skilled pickers who hand-cut each cluster under the headlights. The state grows over 6 million tons of grapes every year, and 81% of those are used to make wine. That translates into billions of bottles of wine exported to over 140 countries. In contrast, table grapes and raisins are harvested during the day. Have you ever eaten these premium moondrop grapes? They are more expensive than any other type, so workers here pick them more carefully. They even trim out the bad grapes before moving on to other bunches. The table grapes are often packaged at the vines right after harvesting, to make sure they are washed thoroughly before eating. California grows 99% of raisins in the US, with more than 185,000 acres dedicated to raisin grapes, mainly in Fresno. Each bunch typically weighs between 1 to 2 pounds, and is laid on the ground for days to dry under the California sun. Then workers collect them for washing and packaging. However, California's vineyards are increasingly under threat. Every time there's a wildfire alert nearby, the vineyard workers have to race all day and all night to save grapes from approaching fires. Sometimes, more than 20,000 pounds of grapes must be harvested in just 8 hours. Hence, mechanised harvesters are also becoming more common for this type of grape. Next, let's explore another special vegetable, California tomatoes. Tomato harvest season here runs from late June through October. The state produces nearly 26 billion pounds annually, mainly grown in the Central Valley and the Sang-Wilkine Valley. Giant tomato harvesters equipped with optical centres distinguish ripe red tomatoes from unripe green ones. These machines can harvest up to 120,000 pounds of tomatoes per day. In 2023, California's tomato crop reached over 22.3 billion pounds, valued at more than $1 billion. Tomatoes aren't just a staple in the US food market, they're a global export. California accounts for over 95% of the nation's processed tomatoes and nearly half of the world's supply. In 2023, the state's tomatoes were shipped to over 60 countries, including Canada, China and Japan, as ketchup, soups and sauces. But California doesn't stop there. Broccoli from here is known for its vibrant green colour, firm stalks and tight, compact flower heads. They're around 0.75 to 1.5 pounds. Harvesting broccoli remains a manual job. Workers move down each row, quickly cutting their heads off with sharp knives and handing them off to packers in the field. Yield averages around 12,000 pounds per acre, depending on growing conditions. Broccoli is harvested year-round, extending from late November through April in cooler regions, and into summer for some areas, like the coastal city of Monterey and Santa Barbara counties, where 92% of the nation's broccoli is grown. In 2023, California produced 3.6 million pounds of broccoli, worth around $820 million. Much of that is exported to major markets, including Canada, Mexico, Japan and various countries in Europe and Asia. Next, let's visit California's dairy farms. Dairy is the state's top agricultural commodity, so they have the best milking system. Tullea County is the largest milk producer in the state, accounting for around 27% of California's milk output. Automated robotic milking systems are used here to milk 360 to 420 cows per hour, ensuring their comfort with only three workers required. With 1.7 million dairy cows, California produces over 40.5 billion pounds of milk annually, accounting for around 18.5% of the nation's supply. While California sets the gold standard for specialty crops, Iowa dominates the major crops like corn and soybeans. Iowa leads the nation in corn production, growing 20% of the country's total, or around 2.6 billion bushels annually. Over 90% of the state's farmland, which is equivalent to 12.5 million acres, or 5.05 million hectares, is used to grow corn. These fields not only provide food, but also fuel, with 47% of the crop used to produce ethanol. In addition to corn, Iowa ranks second in the nation for soybean production, just behind Illinois. With nearly 620 million bushels harvested from nearly 10 million acres of soybean fields every day, soybeans are crucial for everything from livestock feed to cooking oil and biofuels. China is the largest importer of Iowa's soybeans. Free dollar owners On the nation's midgross for the glaubwiki feed- pastel beans, were available. That's when asked for Iran to pay for蒜 Raspberry Pi and Donald Germanyрут. percent of the nation's total egg production. With nearly 60 million chickens, Iowa produces 15 billion eggs each year, making it the leading producer in the US. Highly automated facilities ensure efficiency and sustainability, with conveyor belts, climate-controlled barns and automated feeding systems. These systems keep Iowa eggs affordable while meeting strict safety and quality standards. In addition to corn, soybeans and eggs, potatoes are also a major crop in Iowa. Here, potato harvesting begins in July and runs through October. About 4,500 to 5,000 acres are dedicated to potatoes, with mechanical harvesters collecting thousands of pounds per hour. The state produces around 500 million pounds of potatoes annually. After harvesting, potatoes are stored in large warehouses, before being washed and processed into crisps, fries and mashed potatoes. So, let's get started. Hello, my friends. Are you ready to witness some incredible moments in agriculture? In today's video, we will explore some impressive scenes during the harvest season together. In 2023, California continues to be the leading cantaloupe producing state in the US. The peak harvest season runs from May to October. Alongside machinery, some farmers harvest by hand to cater to markets like Canada or Japan. Not all melons in the field ripen at the same time. Hand harvesting allows farmers to return multiple times to pick the ripened fruits. And, they also want to create tomatoes while pushing carts along the aisles inside greenhouses. During this process, farmers can separate high-quality tomatoes from those with slight imperfections. A closed-loop system ensures tomatoes meet high quality standards. In Europe, the Netherlands and Spain are the largest tomato producers, thanks to advanced greenhouse technology. From July to August, Japanese farmers are busy harvesting peaches. Peach harvesting is also a complicated process, as the fruits are picked by hand from the trees. Farmers do not care to stack the peaches on top of each other in order to avoid bruising. This makes peaches difficult to transport, so they remain quite expensive even in Japan.

But, without intensive, precise processing, these nuts wouldn't be edible at all because of their toxic shell. Farmers collect them by hand or with simple tools. Then they lay them out in the sun for a few days to allow the caustic liquid to dry before the processing begins. Then the cashew nuts are steamed. After steaming, the outer shells are removed. In the past, this was removed entirely by hand, but the chemical would burn the skin. So today, most large cashew processing facilities use machines to shell the nuts. Then the cashew nuts are dehumidified. After dehumidification, the inner shell must be removed again because it can cause throat irritation when eaten. And cashews with the shell removed also sell for a higher price. Today, only large factories can afford the shelling machines. Smaller operations still rely on workers for this job. It's important to keep the nut intact without breaking it, as the price is higher for whole cashews. After shelling, the cashews go through multiple rounds of sorting by size and colour, and are also quality checked by both humans and machines. In 2022, the world consumed 1.99 million pounds of cashews, making it one of the most popular and valuable nuts globally. Most of the nuts are made into nut butter. This creamy spread is a staple in many households, and offers a convenient way to enjoy the nutritional benefits of these nuts. The journey to creating nut butter begins with roasting, which gives the nuts a rich and nutty aroma. This step also helps loosen any remaining skin, especially for nuts like peanuts, almonds and walnuts, which are often blanched before processing. Once roasted, the nuts are cooled and funneled into grinding machines, along with seasonings. These industrial grinders operate at high speeds, breaking the nuts down into smaller and smaller particles. The friction from grinding generates heat, which naturally releases the oils within the nuts, creating a creamy consistency. Almonds and cashews achieve this texture more easily because of their higher oil content. Factories often test random samples from each batch to ensure they meet food safety standards. The finished product is then transferred into sterilized jars, sealed and labeled. These jars are vacuum sealed to maintain freshness and extend shelf life. In 2023, the nut butter market was valued at over $6.7 billion, with almond butter alone accounting for a significant share. In addition to traditional nut butter, there is a growing demand for speciality blends. Almond chocolate butter, walnut butter mixed with honey or even protein fortified options are gaining popularity in health food markets. Another popular nut product is nut milk. This type of milk has become a go-to alternative to dairy milk, especially for 65% of people worldwide who are lactose intolerant. California, known as the Golden State, is not only famous for its beaches, Hollywood and Silicon Valley, but it's also a powerhouse in U.S. agriculture. With more than 45 million acres of farmland, making up nearly 40% of the state's total area, California contributes over $55 billion annually to the U.S. economy. That's not just a statistic, it's a livelihood, a community and food on your table. So how does this diverse and high yield system grow over 400 different crops and provide jobs for more than 420,000 people every year? Let's answer that by exploring some of its most iconic products. First we'll dive into nuts. California is the global leader in almond, walnut and pistachio production, producing 80% of the world and nearly 100% of the U.S.'s supply. Each of these nuts pumps over $5 billion into the state's economy every year. From August until November, farmers start to prepare for the harvest. Nut farmers use tree shaker machines for this task and leave them to dry for around 5-7 days, depending on the moisture content of the kernel. For almonds, each machine can handle 30 to 60 trees per hour, allowing billions of pounds of almonds to be harvested every season. Then the nuts are swept into a window to prepare for collection by the harvesting machine, which can filter out the nuts from the dirt and soil. In 2023, California harvested 2.6 billion pounds of almonds, 1.65 billion pounds of walnuts and 1.36 billion pounds of pistachios. Rising labor costs are also driving the use of advanced technologies like automated sorting and shelling machines at processing plants that can sift through thousands of pounds of nuts per hour. In addition to nuts, California's grape industry is another giant. The season varies by type, but table grapes are harvested from May until January, while wine grapes peak from August until October. For high-end wine, grapes are often harvested at night, when the cooler temperatures help preserve sugar content and flavor. This rule is strictly followed, especially during heatwaves. The wine industry generates over $70 billion annually for the US, so harvesters also join in with skilled pickers who hand-cut each cluster under the headlights. The state grows over 6 million tons of grapes every year, and 81% of those are used to make wine. That translates into billions of bottles of wine exported to over 140 countries. In contrast, table grapes and raisins are harvested during the day. Have you ever eaten these premium moondrop grapes? They are more expensive than any other type, so workers here pick them more carefully. They even trim out the bad grapes before moving on to other bunches. The table grapes are often packaged at the vines right after harvesting, to make sure they are washed thoroughly before eating. California grows 99% of raisins in the US, with more than 185,000 acres dedicated to raisin grapes, mainly in Fresno. Each bunch typically weighs between 1 to 2 pounds, and is laid on the ground for days to dry under the California sun. Then workers collect them for washing and packaging. However, California's vineyards are increasingly under threat. Every time there's a wildfire alert nearby, the vineyard workers have to race all day and all night to save grapes from approaching fires. Sometimes more than 20,000 pounds of grapes must be harvested in just 8 hours. Hence, mechanized harvesters are also becoming more common for this type of grape. Next, let's explore another special vegetable, California tomatoes. Tomato harvest season here runs from late June through October. The state produces nearly 26 billion pounds annually, mainly grown in the Central Valley and the Sandwellkin Valley. Giant tomato harvesters equipped with optical sensors distinguish ripe red tomatoes from unripe green ones. These machines can harvest up to 120,000 pounds of tomatoes per day. In 2023, California's tomato crop reached over 22.3 billion pounds, valued at more than $1 billion. Tomatoes aren't just a staple in the U.S. food market, they're a global export. California accounts for over 95% of the nation's processed tomatoes and nearly half of the world's supply. In 2023, the state's tomatoes were shipped to over 60 countries, including Canada, China and Japan, as ketchup, soups and sauces. But California doesn't stop there. Broccoli from here is known for its vibrant green color, firm stalks and tight, compact flower heads. They're around 0.75 to one and a half pounds. Harvesting broccoli remains a manual job. Workers move down each row, quickly cutting their heads off with sharp knives and handing them off to packers in the field. Yield averages around 12,000 pounds per acre, depending on growing conditions. Broccoli is harvested year-round, extending from late November through April in cooler regions and into summer for some areas, like the coastal city of Monterey and Santa Barbara counties, where 92% of the nation's broccoli is grown. In 2023, California produced 3.6 million pounds of broccoli, worth around $820 million. Much of that is exported to major markets, including Canada, Mexico, Japan and various countries in Europe and Asia. Next, let's visit California's dairy farms. Dairy is the state's top agricultural commodity, so they have the best milking system. Talaia County is the largest milk producer in the state, accounting for around 27% of California's milk output. Dairy-owned robotic milking systems are used here to milk 360 to 420 cows per hour, ensuring their comfort with only three workers required. With 1.7 million dairy cows, California produces over 40.5 billion pounds of milk annually, accounting for around 18.5% of the nation's supply. Dairy-owned organic milk, California, and corn. While California sets the gold standard for specialty crops, Iowa dominates the major crops like corn and soybeans. Iowa leads the nation in corn production, growing 20% of the country's total, or around 2.6 billion bushels annually. Over 90% of the state's farmland, which is equivalent to 12.5 million acres, or 5.05 million hectares, is used to grow corn. These fields not only provide food, but also fuel, with 47% of the crop used to produce ethanol. In addition to corn, Iowa ranks second in the nation for soybean production, just behind Illinois. With nearly 620 million bushels harvested from nearly 10 million acres of soybean fields every day, soybeans are crucial for everything from livestock feed to cooking oil and biofuels. China is the largest importer of Iowa's soybeans. China is the largest in the country. Eggs are another Iowa specialty, making up around 15% of the nation's total egg production. With nearly 60 million chickens, Iowa produces 15 billion eggs each year, making it the leading producer in the U.S. highly automated facilities ensure efficiency and sustainability, with conveyor belts, climate controlled barns and automated feeding systems. These systems keep Iowa eggs affordable, while meeting strict safety and quality standards. In addition to corn, soybeans and eggs, potatoes are also a major crop in Iowa. Here potato harvesting begins in July, and runs through October. About 4,500 to 5,000 acres are dedicated to potatoes, with mechanical harvesters collecting thousands of pounds per hour. The state produces around 500 million pounds of potatoes annually. After harvesting, potatoes are stored in large warehouses, before being washed and processed into crisps, fries and mashed potatoes. The state is a very small part of the country. Hello my friends. Are you ready to witness some incredible moments in agriculture? In today's video, we will explore some impressive scenes during the harvest season together. In 2023, California continues to be the leading cantaloupe producing state in the U.S. The peak harvest season runs from May to October. Alongside machinery, some farmers harvest by hand to cater to markets like Canada or Japan. Not all melons in the field ripen at the same time. Hand harvesting allows farmers to return multiple times to pick the ripened fruits. Farmers pick tomatoes while pushing carts along the aisles inside greenhouses. During this process, farmers can separate high quality tomatoes from those with slight imperfections. A closed loop system ensures tomatoes meet high quality standards. In Europe, the Netherlands and Spain are the largest tomato producers, thanks to advanced greenhouse technology. From July to August, Japanese farmers are busy harvesting peaches. Peach harvesting is also a complicated process, as the fruits are picked by hand from the trees. Farmers do not care to stack the peaches on top of each other in order to avoid bruising. This makes peaches difficult to transport, so they remain quite expensive even in Japan. Some 214 acres of bamboo forest in Full Link District, Guangjing City in southwestern China have entered the harvest season. At peak times, the daily output of bamboo shoots can reach up to 440 pounds. So far, bamboo shoots have generated a total revenue of $82,000, increasing the income of local farmers. The sight of lush green gourd trellises with bitter melons hanging down creates an impressive landscape. During harvest season, farmers skillfully use knives or scissors to cut the stalks, ensuring the fruits are not damaged. This type of harvest typically takes place early in the morning to maintain freshness. Bitter melons are sorted in the field based on size and colour. This is the off-season dragon fruit harvest for Vietnamese farmers. Harvesting during cooler weather allows the fruits to remain fresh for longer. Off-season dragon fruit production helps maintain Vietnam's position in global markets. Dragon fruit is one of the country's key export products, and is projected to reach a value of around $171 million. In Japan, the moment of harvesting pumpkins is an essential part of agriculture, especially in autumn. The process of harvesting and transporting pumpkins is done with great care. The market leads the country in pumpkin production. With an annual output of approximately £179 million, it accounts for around 46.7% of Japan's total pumpkin production. On large farms, farmers use cabbage harvesters to supply the fresh vegetable market. As the harvester passes through the cabbage rows, a special blade cuts off the leaves and roots of the cabbages. After cutting, the cabbages are moved onto the conveyor belt on the machine. During this process, workers inspect and remove cabbages that do not meet quality standards on the spot. Harvesting machines play a key role in the development of Brazil's coffee industry. The country accounts for nearly 40% of the world's coffee production. As the machine moves through the coffee trees, its vibrating components are adjusted to gently shake the branches. This process causes the ripe coffee cherries to fall from the trees. The machine is designed to target only the ripe cherries, minimising the collection of unripe ones. When kimchi making season arrives in South Korea, farmers in Hainam County become busy harvesting cabbages. This region is the country's largest cabbage producer. It is estimated that the average price for 22 pounds of cabbage is around $5.73. They typically cut each cabbage gently, ensuring that the leaves remain intact since the cabbage needs to maintain its shape for kimchi processing. This is a machine assisted carrot harvest. The harvester loosens the soil and then gently pulls the carrots out of the ground. The tops are removed while the carrots are transferred onto a truck. The harvesting machine can cover a large area in a short period. Farmers can supply carrots to supermarkets, food processing factories or for export. Alfalfa harvesting usually takes place just before the blooming stage. The best time to cut alfalfa is in the morning. If seeds or high quality hay are desired, farmers will harvest during the early flowering stage. For high protein livestock feed, alfalfa is harvested as early as possible, during the sprouting stage. There are approximately 700 pea farmers working across England. They supply over 2 billion portions of peas each summer. The harvesting machine gently pulls the pea pods from the ground and separates the peas from their pods. On a 28 acre field, around 123,000 pounds of fresh peas can be harvested. Durum wheat has high gluten protein content, making it an ideal ingredient for pasta production. This crop is typically harvested in late summer, mostly using combine harvesters. Canadian farmers have grown 6.34 million acres of durum wheat, from which they harvest 11 million pounds annually. About 3 months after planting, this is the time when farmers can harvest papayas. Thailand has a total cultivation area of approximately 43,000 acres, yielding around 440 million pounds of papayas annually. For packaging, farmers inspect and remove any damaged fruit. Papayas are packed into carton boxes with foam liners to protect the fruits from impact. This is the process of harvesting cinnamon bark, one of the most valuable spices in the international market. The farmers typically use knives to cut the bark vertically along the tree trunk. After removing the outer layer, the inner cinnamon bark is harvested. This inner layer is rolled into cinnamon sticks. The United States is the largest producer of Christmas trees in the world, with an annual output of around 25 to 30 million trees. Prominent states for tree farming include Oregon, Michigan and North Carolina. The trees are cut at the base, but care is taken to not damage the parent tree. Farmers select trees ranging from 4.9 to 10 feet, depending on market demands. Next let's head to the world's largest cork forest to see how Portugal produces 40 million cork stoppers every day. Each summer, harvesters strip the bark using techniques that have been passed down for centuries. The bark can only be harvested once every nine years, and harvesters must wait 33 years to obtain the best quality cork. Harvesting pine wood is a technical process that requires precision to ensure the quality of the wood. Farmers typically use chainsaws to cut the pine trees at the base. The trees are cut into long logs, depending on the requirements of processing plants. After cutting, the logs are transported out of the forest using trucks or specialised vehicles. In addition to pine trees, eucalyptus trees are an economically valuable species grown widely around the world. India is a major producer of eucalyptus wood, with an estimated output of around 4 million cubic metres in 2023. Harvest trees are typically harvested when they reach maturity, between 5 and 10 years old. Unprocessed eucalyptus wood ranges from $30 to $100 per tree. The harvest time for pheasants depends on market demand. Typically, pheasants reach the required weight and maturity at around 6 to 12 months old. Each harvest requires around 10 people working together to gather the birds into cages. The catching and transportation process is done carefully to minimise stress on the pheasants. Before transportation, all sheep must undergo health checks to ensure that they are free from diseases. For lambs, they are weaned 14 days before long distance transport. Australia exports an average of 2 million live sheep annually, primarily to Middle Eastern countries. In 2023, Australia's sheep industry achieved an export value exceeding $2 billion. Farmers typically lay eggs around midnight to early morning, which is also when farmers are busy collecting them. Farmers use flashlights to illuminate the surrounding areas. They move gently and search for eggs in spots where the ducks usually gather. The eggs are often scattered across fields or grassy banks. Each year, Vietnamese farmers harvest around 4 billion eggs. After gathering the ducks in centralised areas, they are weighed in groups of around 10 to 20. Weighing helps determine the total output for pricing to traders or processing plants. The farm's duck meat production reaches around 7 million tonnes annually. Duck meat is consumed domestically and exported, primarily to South Eastern Asian countries and China. This is a critical step in the pork supply chain, as weaned piglets are transferred to growth farms until they reach slaughter weight. Traditionally, weaned piglets are sold at 6 weeks of age when they weigh between 19 and 20 pounds in order to maximise their value. Each piglet is priced between $40 and $70. This is an important source of income for pig farming operations. When it comes to the nut industry, almonds and walnuts take centre stage due to their large production scale and high global demand. Recent reports show that almonds are the most widely grown nut, with California producing 80% of the world's supply. This state, along with China, dominates the walnut market. On top of that, cashews are another nut with a very different harvesting and processing method compared to almonds and walnuts. Mainly because they contain a poisonous chemical in the shell. That's why they're quite expensive when exported to the US, with one pound of whole cashews selling for as much as $16. So how do these nut farms and processing facilities work? Let's take a closer look in this video. First we will visit the almond farm. California almonds owe much of their success to the temperature difference of about 58 to degrees Fahrenheit between summer and winter. Experts estimate that it takes around one gallon of water to produce a single almond. So with modern irrigation systems in place, it's no surprise that California produces over 2.5 billion pounds of almonds every year. When harvest time comes, specialized machines, called shakers, clamp onto the trunks of each tree and shake it vigorously, causing the almonds to fall like rain to the ground. The farmers then let the nuts dry naturally for 4 to 7 days, before running a sweeper machine over them to gather them into rows. This helps to prepare the nuts for a different collection machine, equipped with sensors that remove most of the dirt and debris. From there, the almonds are sent to large stockpiles, where they are fumigated for around 2 days, then to be stored for processing. This facility's daily task is to handle over 20,000 pounds of almonds. Once the almonds are cleaned of dirt, rocks and twigs, the shelling process begins. The nuts are vibrated and rubbed repeatedly, so that the almonds inside easily separate from the shell. Then they pass through holes, designed so that only the almond kernel can fall through. This process is repeated around 8 times, with progressively smaller holes, to ensure the shell is fully separated. After that is the sorting process, which is done both by machine and manually. The almonds are sifted through vibrating screens to sort them by size. Again using the same hole filling method as when separating the shells and then an optical sorting machine. Once approved, the remaining almonds are packed and shipped to various factories to create a wide range of almond products. Do you know why they're dumping millions of these crushed almonds into the chocolate? Why it's to make the outer coating for millions of ice cream bars? We're at an ice cream factory, and nuts are essential for making the ice cream more delicious and the eating experience more interesting. This chocolate nut bath is very cold, so once they're dipped in, the coating instantly freezes. After that, the ice cream will be packaged. To prevent the ice cream from melting, the entire ice cream production process must be kept at a very cold temperature. Would you like to try a day working in an ice cream factory? Along with almonds, walnuts also thrive in the Mediterranean climates like those found in California and China. However, unlike almonds, which rely on bees for pollination, walnuts are wind pollinated. Another key difference is the walnuts must be shelled right after harvest, rather than being stored in stockpiles like almonds. At the end of the hot season, when the husk of the walnut begins to split open, farmers start the harvest process. Once again, the shaker machines are used to clamp onto the tree trunks and shake thousands of walnuts loose in just a few seconds. After they fall to the ground, they're swept into rows by a sweeper machine and then collected by a harvester. Each plant typically stores around 1.6 million pounds of walnuts during the harvest season. Using a similar vibrating hole sorting system, the plant separates whole walnuts from walnut halves at the end of the production line. The walnuts are then thoroughly cleaned and dried in large air dryers to reduce moisture to around 8%. This ensures that they stay fresh throughout the packaging and export process. Now we will explore the nuts that you have been waiting for. Unlike almonds and walnuts, cashews thrive in tropical regions with warm temperatures and consistent rainfall throughout the year. That's why countries like Vietnam, India and the Ivory Coast dominate global cashew production, contributing nearly 70% of the world's supply. But without intensive, precise processing, these nuts wouldn't be edible at all because of their toxic shell. Farmers collect them by hand or with simple tools.

Then the cashew nuts are dehumidified. After dehumidification, the inner shell must be removed again because it can cause throat irritation when eaten. And cashews with the shell removed also sell for a higher price. Today, only large factories can afford the shelling machines. Smaller operations still rely on workers for this job. It's important to keep the nut intact without breaking it, as the price is higher for whole cashews. After shelling, the cashews go through multiple rounds of sorting by size and colour, and are also quality checked by both humans and machines. In 2022, the world consumed 1.99 million pounds of cashews, making it one of the most popular and valuable nuts globally, worth over $8 billion today. Most of the nuts are made into nut butter. This creamy spread is a staple in many households, and offers a convenient way to enjoy the nutritional benefits of these nuts. The journey to creating nut butter begins with roasting, which gives the nuts a rich and nutty aroma. This step also helps loosen any remaining skin, especially for nuts like peanuts, almonds and walnuts, which are often blanched before processing.
