 I'm Josh Barnaby of Mali Equipment for Independence, Kansas. I'm a solution specialist down there. Jacob Stich, Mali Equipment, another precision aggro solution consultant for the dealership. I guess as precision equipment has been out longer and longer, we're seeing the next generation of customers come out interested in the equipment. Because of that, we're seeing a demand for the used equipment. One of the ways we're trying to fulfill that demand is actually trade for it all in the used piece of equipment. By doing that, this allows us to keep the same generation of equipment together. Also, that guy that wants to buy used equipment, obviously, is trying to buy at a lower price point. You're only a guy buying new equipment. So it's hard for them to buy the used hard-on, big iron, or hard-on. The iron, as well as the precision equipment news, is a little bit of all used to have the same price points. Yeah, this allowed us to go after some of those guys that aren't as far along in technology that are either a little bit scared of it or stick with shock of the new price and the newest technology. It just gives us another opportunity for selling the new stuff to the early adopters and then just taking their used stuff back in all trade but still having somewhere to go with it. We've just tried to make an honest price, set an honest price for what we're going to trade for it. It's something that we know that we can sell it at. Obviously, it's not full value and it's not like trading for hard iron. We were a little bit scared to begin with, a little bit concerned about making sure that we just didn't get a whole bunch of a pile of used stuff built up on the shelves. But we've had very good luck with it. We've done a lot of advertising online, shipped used stuff all over the country, out of state and even out of our area in the U.S. and even overseas in some cases. We found that we were maybe a little more worried about it than we needed to be, but we were cautious to begin with and tried to be honest about what stuff would be worth and not get too far into it before we really figured out what we could sell it for. In fact, good luck with it. We stayed with stuff that we really understood and really knew about it. We still can't market it. We can't market it. Right. We just can't know all the intricacies and the nuances of every piece of different brands and different models and that kind of thing. But we really feel like we can offer more of a complete solution because we can take some of the used pieces and we can sell them with some new pieces and package them with some of those guys that maybe there's part of the new technology that they want, but they don't want to spend, they don't want to buy everything new because they might not see a benefit of having every new piece of technology, but they still have pieces of it. Especially depending on what operation you're trying to do with that technology. Even within the one customer might have a top of the line, might also have a lower line piece to do a different operation on the product. We just try to sit down and figure out where they want to go and where they would like to be in two years or five years or what equipment they might be upgrading to try to get them set up or started down the right path to be ready for that. If they think they're going to buy a new planter in two years or they definitely want to have a new tractor, they want to put on, they want to do a different operation for putting on the fertilizer. Try to get them the things that have set them up for it long term. And it helps us because we then lock them in as a customer a little bit better because they trust us a little bit more. Because we're trying to not just push the equipment that we're trying to sell, we're trying to find a solution that fits right for their operation. And it's a balancing act. Everybody's a little bit different the way they like to do things and what they're comfortable with in terms of user interface and how hard it is to use and what they're comfortable with on price. Makes it fun. Yes. Thank you. Thank you.
