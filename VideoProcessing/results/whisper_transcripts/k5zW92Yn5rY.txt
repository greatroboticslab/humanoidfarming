Science & Technology
 ORF Genetics in Iceland, grows meat protein using genetically modified barley plants. About 130,000 modified barley plants, grow in a greenhouse that measures over 2,000 square meters. The seeds are then harvested and purified, to extract the protein called the growth factor. This protein is used to create lab-grown meat. This cutting-edge approach, has the potential to lower prices, reduce reliance on live animals, and make meat more available to many people. And with the fact that meat accounts for nearly 60% of all greenhouse gases from food production, this development could help fight climate change. Can you imagine devouring lab-grown meat from genetically modified plants on your plate in the future? We'd love to know your thoughts in the comment section below.
