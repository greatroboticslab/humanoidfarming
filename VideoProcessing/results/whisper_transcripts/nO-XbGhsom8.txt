 Over 80% of Malawi's land area is considered heavily degraded due to bad agricultural practices, want on cutting down of trees. Restoration for us is not simply about planting a tree, it goes beyond that. We look at restoration as an integral aspect, looking at the soils, looking of course at the trees, looking at water. All these elements have to be incorporated. The hope to find and provide very specials, the trees at the bottom of the tree become a cone Sok Quantila grass isete, but structures, of otherarnya. Can you not change the tree this year? Yeah, thank you. You're ready to do just like this. Sorry, I was along with designing a spacesuit A special place now Your fellow scholar me now I just have a wonderful friend I want you to always know I can't passος I don't know what I am When I look at you I left diاج I fell in love and had a lovely快uve together, a fitting day of my parents, a Shahlai Cillill, and held a small queen and put her here. When I gekoists a Xinagar Hoca, I came to the island, and another door toС 1835, didn't I come to嗎. In 지난 15 years I joined Northern. After the school year I began to see whether my victimor will be, but after my imprisonment, new ailments. Thanks for your help. Now, if you buy your одну insects I was able to get a lot of people to get a lot of people. I was able to get a lot of people to get a lot of people. I'm not a biological scientist myself. I'm a much more social scientist. I've fallen in love with trees. I've fallen in love with communities who take part in restoring the environments that they live in. I realized how much people's lives are linked to the environment that they live in. And so I thought of going into work that deals much more with the environment. And that's how I found myself being involved with CASA and particularly with GLF Lirongge chapter. My role is to actively participate and facilitate restoration action within landscapes. But also much more focusing on stakeholder engagement and community engagement. Let's see. My goal is to lead to community engagement. Ewan? How can I do that? Hey. Sorry about that. I found הוא 울ong in the exploration... I foundусberg with Canada. Ida had a good idea but I found to have a good one. That I came the way I could see and have an idea of how my country is high and then I joined your village upon him. So I had to come with us this week and I wanted one accompanied with him in the causal local chapter is to connect people, is to allow local communities to learn and act together, even utilizing indigenous knowledge that has been attained over generations. But this aspect of exchanging knowledge is quite important to us. Knowledge gives people confidence. So it is in this regard that we allow different communities, like with regard to Stepper Farm, a platform for us to showcase working scientific interventions. I have a lot of people who are working with the farm, and I have a lot of people who are working with the farm. I have a lot of people who are working with the farm, and I have there are 10.1m Energiezga. When you work your career, you will have your work to follow up with this information that lies in the nature of the forest. I have a lot of videos to do now. Water harvesting trench. What? In short. The vision of Stepper Farm is to become a model farm. And so this tallies well with us because we take Stepper Model Farm as a field learning center where we can let people come and learn about different techniques or best ways of improving, for instance, soil fertility, best practices in nursery establishment and management, how to do different farming techniques. Music by corner I described a But how you are often for that, when we're used to investing the money I have dressed in democratic rice, or in last fifteen months we are until we are on holiday, we recognize that ourcies drop anything Lexi may be evolved with one step massive件, but it doesn't make everyone know us, but inveildik it doesn't make anything easy And it's Kasama Akversa who is not a Ahora This passing on, this interconnecting, that goes to the very fabric of society. So local communities will not only be at one generation, at one level, but it's something that is intergenerational. That is what can make landscapes sustainable in the end. In March分享 in the U.S. Steunes, for example, it's an incredible thing. Thank you. Thank you.
