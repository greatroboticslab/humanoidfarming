 Life on the farm is anything but simple. The endless labor, the heartache of losing crops or cherished animals, sometimes the deep pain of losing loved ones, are all part of the journey. Meredith Bernard, the face behind the YouTube channel, This Farm Wife, faced this all too well. From her roles as a wife, mother of two and farmer, Meredith has experienced life's highest joys and deepest sorrows. Today, we're taking a closer look at her incredible resilience and the emotional rollercoaster she and her husband, Lawrence Bernard, have faced over the years. One of the most heartbreaking moments Meredith ever shared with her community is when her father-in-law passed away. Back in 2019, she announced the sad news in a heartfelt video and honored the memory of Papa, as he was affectionately known by her and the children. At the age of 92, he left behind a legacy of love and unforgettable memories. Despite the grief, she remained grounded, showing both vulnerability and strength as she said goodbye. Fast forward a few years, and Meredith would come dangerously close to losing her husband, Lawrence. This time, it wasn't age or illness, but a terrifying accident on the farm. Lawrence and his friend Wally were working on a gleaner combine when disaster struck. A 1,500-pound cylinder came crashing down on Lawrence while he was positioned at the front of the machine. Thankfully, Wally's quick response saved his life. The close call shook the entire family. And Meredith stepped back from social media for a few days. It wasn't until she posted the video titled, Counting Our Blessings, that fans learned about the accident. But that wasn't the only loss weighing on the family that year. Before Lawrence's accident, Meredith had shared another difficult moment on her channel. In the video, A Hard Day, she revealed the loss of a beloved horse named Little Man. The animal had been part of the Bernard family for many years, making his passing especially painful. While the cause of death was never confirmed, Meredith mentioned the possibility of Lyme disease or cancer. Through every challenge, Meredith Bernard has shown remarkable resilience. Whether dealing with personal loss or life-threatening accidents, she continued to create meaningful content. And the channel, This Farm Wife was awarded the silver play button as the channel now has over 131K subscribers. But even after all she's overcome, Meredith now faces a new, unfamiliar struggle. One that's harder to fix with hard work or grit. A noticeable decline in her YouTube views and engagement. Once buzzing with steady traffic and loyal fans, this farm wife now sees fewer views on her uploads. It's not because her content has lost its quality. If anything, it's become even more heartfelt. But in the ever-changing landscape of social media, staying visible is a constant battle. Algorithms shift. Audiences move on. And even the most genuine creators can find themselves feeling overlooked. It's clear that Meredith is feeling the pressure. Running a farm is already an enormous task, and coupling that with the demand to produce consistent content is no small feat. Despite the dip in views, her channel still serves as a space for connection, storytelling, and community. Those who truly connect with her message continue to show love in the comments, buying her merch, and sending words of encouragement. And that, perhaps, is what keeps this farm wife going. Not viral numbers, but the real people behind the screen who understand her journey. The next question pops up on Google search is, How much does this farm wife make on YouTube? While exact numbers aren't public, it's estimated that this farm wife earns anywhere between $2,500 to $5,000 per month through YouTube ad revenue, depending on video views and engagement. On top of that, Meredith likely earns additional income through brand partnerships, merchandise sales, and affiliate links. And her farm work surely adds to her fortune.
