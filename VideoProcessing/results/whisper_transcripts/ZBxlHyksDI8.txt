 Oh hey Philip what are you doing here? Hey well I'm about to go into a meeting with some state legislators. Well so I got Stanley to cover those meetings for you because I have another job for you to do. Okay. You might want to change your clothes. Hello. Hi. I'm Matt. Hey I'm Phil Howell. I understand you're my new hire for now. I guess so. All right. Well you ready to get to work? Yes sir. Let's go. All right. Man these are some big cows. You want to stay between your back legs. Okay. And keep your fingers off these pipes. Okay. When she kicks her hawk right here will hit that pipe. Okay. So if one doesn't stay away from that she really can't hurt you. You know she might touch you but she's not going to hurt you. Okay. To milk these cows this is our pre-dip. We're going to spray this on to clean the cow and we'll dry it off and put the milk and nut on it. All right. So these just fry her and knock her down. And then you move to the next cow. Okay. You want to try this one? Sure. You don't have to touch the cow. All right. Just fry her from this one. No, no. You can't put your hands. You'll get kicked and she hits you right here. Okay. So you never put your hands where you... So I'll just go ahead and spray it. Yeah. Just fry it from this one. Get the front ones. There you go now. Over to the next cow. All right. It's gone down the line. When I first heard that the government affairs worker was coming out to to be my employee for the day I was very skeptical. I'll have to admit I'd give him high scores on his his dress. He looked the part. He's a little too clean. I'll give you some paper towels. And now we're just going to dry her off. And they're cleaner in the process of drying her off. You get about two towels. And just gently dry her off. And they're going to get clean like that. Go ahead and reach in there. You're okay. Go ahead. She's not kicking. She may dance a little. She won't kick. Okay. That's pretty good. We need to get a little drier. I was hoping to learn a lot about what our dairy farmers do in Arkansas. And I've learned a lot about that. And, um, you know, just get my hands dirty. Those were my expectations. And I got them dirty. A couple of reasons to dry them off. One is to disinfect the udder. And have a clean location to pull the milk from. And two is to, for Cal Health, you want the udder dry. Okay. While the machine is on her. So I'll just put the towel in the pocket. To activate the machine, push it on the button. Turn the machine over. And you're going to do its job. So how many, uh, how many gallons would you get? What do you usually get from each cow? About eight gallons per cow per day. How many cows do you all do in a day? About 180 or twice a day. You get half your milk in the morning, half and after night. Right. Get in with your left hand and dry her. It's usually easier. How's that? Yeah, you got that one pretty good. Nice. All right. Throw your towels in the bucket. Then you push the button to release and catch it. You catch it. You catch it. You catch it. You catch it. Turn it around. How's that one? I'll hold it like that. You hurt. Hold that one. You gotta hang your black. Oh, yeah. You hooked it in this chain. You're gonna be a little bit. So I will say, milking the cow was, uh, more automated than I thought it would be. You know, once Matt showed me how everything works, you know, just making sure I put everything in the right places and don't get kicked by the cow or don't have anything drop on you. So, uh, once I understood that process, it seemed very straightforward. Oh, yeah. She left you a present. She what? She left the present for you. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Now the trick is to dodge it. Do I roll up my sleeve for this one? I think I found my new job, guys. Sorry, Stanley. I think this is the business for me. We have to increase our speed or we won't get to milk twice today. I think this is the first time you all do it in the day. When you started, four in the morning. Oh, I changed my mind. I like my job now. I like my job now. And then there's that thing. All right. Is there a particular reason why you all do it at those times of the day? It takes you about three hours for milk, so you want to get done in the afternoon at a reasonable time. So you have to start early enough to get finished. Do you take gnats in between? At night. So when you all get all this milk, where does it go? We've got a refrigerated storage tank in the other room. As it's coming out of the cow, it's going into this small tank, and as it fills, it automatically pumps to the storage tank. The storage tank is refrigerated. And then, do you have somebody come pick it up? Yes, the marketing block comes every 23 days to pick the milk up and haul it to market. But, see, it's coming out of the cow at her body temperature, under one and a half degrees for a cow. And two hours after it comes out of the cow, we'll have it down to 36 degrees. Okay. The milk comes through stainless steel pipelines and goes into the refrigerated tank. You can hear the tank's running right now, and it's already cooled the milk down to 38 degrees. Okay. Okay, you go up and inspect the milk that you've pulled out of the cow. All right. Yeah. What's good to me? Maybe take a milk bath? Anybody ever fallen in? No, from time to time, you do have to go in it and clean it. Oh, is that what you have your sons for? Well, unfortunately, I get to do that. You can see the stalls. Mm-hmm. Hence the barn gets its name, Free Stall. The stalls don't have gates on them. The cows are free to come and go. They've got water. From the outside and the center. They can have access to at all times. And they've got feed in front of them all the time. They've got food in front of them. All the time. So, the cows that you just milked came back to the house. They're just going to be in there. That's what you're going to do. And then, the cows are going to be in there. You can see the stalls. Mm-hmm. You can see the stalls. Mm-hmm. Hence the barn gets its name, Free Stall. The stalls don't have gates on them. Mm-hmm. The cows are free to come and go. They've got water on the outside and the center. Mm-hmm. They can have access to at all times. And they've got feed in front of them all the time. So, the cows that you just milked, came back down here, and they're in their living environment. After we got started with the milking process, I showed him what we expected and how to perform the task. After monitoring the task for the day, on a scale of one to ten, I'd have to give him about a six. Well, you know, I enjoyed what I did today, but I think I'll leave the milking up to the professionals. These guys know what they're doing. But, me on the other hand, I'm happy to go back to the Capitol and advocate for these guys, make sure they can stay in business and so that their children can keep doing it. It's important to keep our dairy farms here in Arkansas. Well, Matt, thanks for having me out here. I was really excited to learn about what y'all are doing. Everything you told me went in one ear and out the other. Anyway, sorry. But I'm a- I'm a- It's not such a bad joke. You can't let that go on.
