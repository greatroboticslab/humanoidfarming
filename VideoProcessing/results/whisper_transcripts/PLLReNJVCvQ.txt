 When it comes to fertilising, there are plenty of options and choices available out there. But it's important to know that not all fertilisers are the same, or right for your lawn and your conditions. Selecting the right fertiliser for your lawn variety and your local conditions will help your lawn stay healthy and look stunning. These are the most common fertilisers available on the market. They can be broken down into the following categories. Liquid fertilisers, slow release granular fertiliser, traditional lawn fertiliser, organic lawn fertiliser. Liquid fertilisers are the easiest fertilisers to apply to lawn areas and the fastest acting. Whilst they tend to be the most expensive fertiliser product, they have the advantage of being easy to apply to both the ground and the lawn foliage itself. Granular lawn fertilisers are dry fertilisers that are made into a pallet form, often blended to get the desired ratio of nutrients needed for your lawn. Using a granular fertiliser method means you can control the exact amount of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium that's needed to be added to your lawn. Using a slow release fertiliser on your lawn once, for example during autumn, will help your lawn cope through a tough cold winter. Key features of slow release lawn fertilisers are the nutrients release slowly and continuously. All the fertiliser's nutrients are utilised following watering in. They have low application rates, which means you save money. And there is only a need to apply three times during the year, twice in spring and once in autumn. Traditional lawn fertiliser is often the cheapest lawn food choice, but not necessarily the best. They are applied in the same way as a slow release fertiliser. But unlike the slow release versions, traditional lawn fertilisers also tend to dump their nutrient load immediately after watering into the lawn, which often leads to high nutrient runoff into waterways and drains. They can be useful if you need a quick spike in your lawn, and they are the cheapest, which is their main advantage over the others. Application rates for traditional fertilisers are every four to six weeks and rely on the lawn being able to absorb the nutrients as they move through the soil. However, frequent applications of traditional lawn fertilisers can have detrimental effects on the soil chemistry and therefore health. And they're more inclined to burn your lawn if used incorrectly. A true organic lawn fertiliser is one that has been certified as 100% organic. A recommended organic lawn fertiliser is a blend of both a natural organic and synthetic manufactured fertiliser. The use of an organic lawn food and soil improver combines the features of both a slow release fertiliser as well as natural ingredients such as seaweed, fish, manure and biostimulants. It is possible to make your own by composting manure from cattle or chooks. Since organic lawn fertilisers are natural products, it is hard to over fertilise and in fact, they make your soil and plant health strong. So when it comes to fertilisers, there are a few options, but remember, use soil pH test results to choose the right fertiliser. Spend time accurately measuring the size of your lawn. Try an organic fertiliser during the hot summer months. Buy a quality fertiliser spreader that best fits your needs. Accurately calibrate your spreader to make sure you apply the right amount. And keep records of what and how much you apply and when you apply it.
