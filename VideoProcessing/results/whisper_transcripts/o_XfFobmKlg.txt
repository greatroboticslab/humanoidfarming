 Hello my name is John Heffield-Petterson, I'm the programme leader for agricultural engineering at Reesheath College. I've been at Reesheath now for seven years and starting off as an instructor, moving all the way up through course management into programme leader. With our T-level qualification, and this was a new qualification that we started in September, with the T-level we have noticed quite a lot of different students coming through from various backgrounds, including some from HGV, some from agriculture and some from non-farming backgrounds. It opens up a wide range of different study areas looking at ethics, support, business, financing, sustainability, but also it's looking at the engineering side from engines, hydraulics, electrics. This allows the students to have a very different content, but also it's making them more industry ready when they go out into the workplace. They're not just an agricultural engineer, they are opened up more for being able to run their own business. With the T-level qualification, we run that over four days a week, which includes two days of theory and two days of practical. So that opens up quite a wide range of practical skills where the learners are starting off with doing basic fabrication engines and electric, going on to more the diagnostic side in the second year. With the T-level qualification, it consists of two academic units, which is 300 and 302, an employee set project. And then for the second year, it is a 402 unit, which includes nine practical synoptics. These synoptics are where we're assessing the students practically and can pick up on their skills that they have learned throughout the two years studying the T-level qualification.
