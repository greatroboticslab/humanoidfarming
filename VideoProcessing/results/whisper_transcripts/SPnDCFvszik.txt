 We're a privately held feed and grain company. We primarily focus on owning and operating a feed mill and also a extruded soy crush plant and we handle products like GMO, non-GMO and organic. We're a hundred million gallon renewable fuel producer. We sell around 270,000 tons of distillers grains that are sold to cattle producers. Tasteful Selections is the only company in the United States that grows year-round, has the freshest potatoes that we offer in the marketplace. We harvest approximately 340 days out of the year and plant about 310. So we're planting and harvesting somewhere on the West Coast every day. In the last 10 years or so our operation has basically doubled in size. We've gone from a 50 million gallon facility to about a hundred million gallon facility and we did that by making a variety of upgrades and changes to our manufacturing facility. So it's been a really interesting journey. When I came to California and I was looking for a finance company to build our new facility, Farm Credit was first on my list. I never gave them a lot of time to be honest with you. That's how we operate. We have grown on an average now over 11 years, 41.5% per year. And so to keep up with that kind of a request for capital, you know, Farm Credit has always been there for me. You know, back in 2009, 2010, it became very apparent that we needed to look for something different. We were getting caught in between our local lender maxing out our line of credit, but we knew that we were going to have to move to another level and it was going to take some time and effort and we started. The relationship with Farm Credit just made sense. We're a corn ethanol facility and we're so closely linked to agriculture. It was a perfect fit for ethanol renewables to meet together with Farm Credit Services of America. I was attending some merchandising classes for a grain company that we were merchandising grain through. And I started looking around and I thought it was kind of interesting that the bankers were sitting in the room and I thought, you know, that's what we need. I need my lender to understand and feel what I feel so that if we need to visit about how things are changing, carry grain longer, change some things in our feed mill, that they thought that was something that they'd want to be part of and help us operate at a higher level. Their commitment to the farm and ag people is second to none. You know, I've banked with other banks over the years and I've always had my best experiences with Farm Credit. So we weren't quite to the Farm Credit system yet and our lender made a big move and created a basically a bridge note for us to get there. For us, that was a lifeline and we've appreciated that and never forgotten that. So that was one thing that I can really remember when we started. That was a big step forward. We have a relationship manager that is so helpful for us. They'll come in and check in on us once in a while just to see how things are going. I always feel comfortable discussing business opportunities that are out there and getting a second opinion. I appreciate all their staff and how quickly they get things done for me. I love the fact that with our relationship manager, I can throw out some new ideas, some new approaches of how we what we want our loan facility to look like. They're always willing to listen and oftentimes will come to a solution that better meets our needs. I've had it many times where I reach out to my lender or a member of their team and they're quickly right there. And I'm always impressed how how well they remember our last conversation and where we're at in our business and how open the are to the fact that, hey, we talked about that, but now things have changed. And what can we do to kind of prepare for that? What are some options that if this doesn't go right, we can look at? Are we prepared for that? So I've always valued it's not just one time. It's a lot of times. Working with a cooperative is totally different than working with other lenders. There's more of a family atmosphere, exchanging ideas. You're included in a group of people. You're you're all in this thing together, not to mention one of the best parts of it is you get some value back from the cooperative through patronage, through dividends. Their cash back dividend program has influenced me. Basically the most economical source of funds for for ourselves and then the ad community, I think is a big plus. The cash back dividends was new to us coming from a local lender. We didn't experience that. So for for myself, it was kind of icing on the cake. We knew that first we needed a lender that could grow with us overnight if our business changed and how that was going to react. We've used that money basically to reinvest in our business, grow our working capital or our people, equipment, technologies. It's been a really now it's something we really bank on and we get excited about. We like working with FCS America because it's a simple relationship. I know what they want. They know what I want. And we can partner well together that way. We're interviewing fillers in the density of ourami brands. l o a g o a o o h our a o
