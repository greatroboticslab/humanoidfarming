So what is the process of raising and preparing snakes like for farmers? Join me as we explore this fascinating journey. Let's explore the process of catching wild snakes to raise on farms. Initially farmers hunted snakes to supply the traditional Chinese medicine market. However, due to a decrease in supply and rising prices, they recognized the opportunity and succeeded in breeding snakes, opening up strong development prospects for the industry. Yah. Mohammad To begin farming, breeders need to collect eggs from the snakes they have caught and raised previously to initiate the breeding process. After mating, female snakes need about 30-35 days to lay eggs and each time they lay they can produce between 12-21 eggs. Do you know how the process of incubating snake eggs works? The incubation process is quite simple. First, breeders prepare a box with the appropriate humidity. Then, a layer of fine sand is spread evenly on the surface of the box and the eggs are placed on top. After about 70 days, the eggs will automatically crack open, marking the birth of the baby snakes. Then, a layer of fine sand is used to be used to be used to be used to be used to be used to the eggs. Caring for snakes is not just about feeding them. It also requires attention to temperature and humidity. Choosing the right enclosure is a key factor in creating an ideal environment for the snakes. The enclosure needs to adjust the temperature according to the season, with good ventilation in the summer and a heating system in the winter. the enclosure needs to be used to be used to be used to be used to be used to be used to the next day. Incorrect adjustments can be dangerous for the snakes. What happens if the snakes escape? Leave a 1 and stay tuned until the end of the video to find out how the farmers handle it. The nutrition regime for snakes is an important factor in their care. The food is adjusted according to the needs of each type of snake, which can include chickens, ducks, frogs, or other types of prey. One thing to note is that when providing food for snakes, care must always be taken when handling their enclosures, as any accidental contact could pose a serious risk. The farming environment is designed in a honeycomb shape with many separate enclosures, each for one snake. This structure helps prevent unwanted conflicts between the snakes, creating favorable conditions for their growth. When they reach adulthood, snakes are not only used in the medical industry but are also consumed domestically and exported to countries such as Germany, Japan, South Korea, and many other international markets. The venom of snakes is a complex mixture of toxins, consisting of various powerful proteins and enzymes. Some types of venom can directly attack the nervous system, causing dangerous symptoms such diseases such as paralysis, respiratory failure, seizures, and even death. But have you ever wondered what would happen if these snakes escaped? According to statistics from the Ministry of Health, in 2023, there were over 10,000 reported snake bite cases, including 300 fatalities. This number has caused fear and anxiety in the community, especially in rural areas. In addition, snakes also hunt poultry farms, especially chickens, due to their docile nature, making them an ideal target for snakes as an easy food source. The contrast between the slow movements of chickens and the agility and danger of snakes creates a dramatic confrontation, posing a significant threat to the poultry flock. Even the mightiest and most ferocious eagles cannot withstand the power and brutality of snakes. The most important thing is to do is to protect the virus from the virus. Although snake venom is often seen as a deadly danger, in medicine it is considered a valuable treasure. With its ability to coagulate and prevent blood clotting, snake venom can help eliminate platelet clumps and even offer hope in the fight against cancer. The battle against the invasion of snakes when they escape on farms has become more intense than ever. Controlling the snake population in the wild plays a crucial role, requiring proactive and cautious efforts to detect and capture species that could pose a danger to humans. Are you curious about what happens to these snakes afterward? In China, snakes are not only a part of the cuisine but also an integral part of ancient traditions. Every part of the snake is used creatively, offering unique and special dishes that reflect respect for nature and its resources. Snake meat is a high-end delicacy in many restaurants, prepared with finesse into unique dishes. The trend of eating snake meat is not limited to certain regions, but has spread across China, becoming an important part of the country's culinary culture. To be continued... To be continued...

But did you know that in rice fields, ducks diligently hunt for snails and insects, helping to protect the crops? Let's explore the beauty and wonder of nature through this image. We will begin our journey with the incubation of millions of ducks, a fascinating and crucial step in duck farming. First, we select the perfect eggs, discarding any that are damaged, to ensure the success and life of the ducklings about to be born. Every step in this process is filled with hope and meticulous care. Has anyone ever told you that incubation areas need to be placed in quiet environments with a stable temperature of 37.5 to 38 degrees Celsius? To ensure the eggs develop healthily, we also gently spray water daily to maintain ideal humidity levels. This is a special resting period, lasting from 28 to 35 days, where these white pearls gradually hatch, carrying new life and hope within them. Have you ever imagined the perfect combination of duck farming and rice cultivation in a natural ecosystem? This model not only helps protect the fields, but also brings sustainable economic benefits. Ducks help control pests and weeds without the need for chemicals or antibiotics, keeping the soil clean and the natural environment free from pollution. At the same time, duck manure becomes a natural fertilizer, providing essential nutrients for the rice plants. development room is nearly 4.01lor quelquominaί Tens of thousands of ducks are hunting across the rice fields, creating a fascinating sight. Thai farmers take advantage of these special guests, known as field-chasing ducks, to clean the fields after harvest. They eat snails and leftover rice husks while trampling on the stubble, flattening the soil, and helping with tilling for the new season. Let's explore how farmers care for the ducks. They provide nutrient-rich food and ensure clean water to keep the ducks healthy. Meticulous management of the ponds creates the best living environment for them. Raising ducks in rice fields not only cleans the fields, but also reduces weeds, pests, and improves production efficiency. Based on word recipe ofujemy ilverILYarden. First name is Volkswagen. Ian Chain Wright and Drew I have never seen anything like this before. A flock of ducks can lay nearly 14,000 eggs in just 24 hours. Duck farming provides great economic value, not only supplying nutritious meat and eggs to meet consumer demand, but also creating strong export potential. Duck feathers and skins are used in the fashion industry, while duck manure improves soil. Promoting sustainable agriculture. The duck farming industry also creates jobs and attracts agricultural tourism, contributing to the economic development of local and national economies. The mother, the cat roof for经 cut 68% of the economic development Thank you. Did you know that during a laying cycle, a duck can lay between 5 to 12 eggs? This number varies depending on factors such as the duck's breed, age, weather, nutrition, and living environment. To ensure the best egg quality, proper care of the ducks is essential. Ducks need to be provided with a well-balanced diet rich in protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals to develop healthily and lay high-quality eggs. Thank you. You already have a Meauальish one of the data that requires diet rich in tan stock. When raising free-range ducks, the farming period can last from 3 to 6 months or even longer. In a natural environment, ducks are free to move around, which not only helps them grow stronger but also improves the quality of their meat, resulting in a fresher and more nutritious flavor. When ducks are brought into the processing line, each step is carried out quickly and efficiently. From quality inspection, feather removal, and meat and organ processing to packaging, everything is automated and precise.
