 Music Rolling down the boulevard, sun hitting my shades Riding low and slow, this vibe never fades Palm trees dancing in the hazy sunlight glow West coast rhythm, let the good times flow Cruising, grooving, feel that funky breeze Talk about the singing, setting spirits at ease From the hills to the shore, ain't no second guessing In these Cali streets, we count every blessing Double Dutch beats bumping, trunk rides smooth Neighbors nodding heads, they catching the groove That's right Chrome rims spinning, reflections of dreams On these west coast streets, nothing's what it seems Hey, hey Let me see your hands up high Hands up We vibing now, till the moon hits the sky Talk box wailing Talk box wailing I'll see you next time.
