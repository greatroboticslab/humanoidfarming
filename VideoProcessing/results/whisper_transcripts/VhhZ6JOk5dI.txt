Howto & Style
 Hey everybody it's Brad with the Big Family Homestead and in this video I'm going to show you a super sweet $45 or less micro hay barn that we built. Well actually two different kinds so without any further ado let's get cracking. So here at our homestead we're limited in space. We have only about one acre, well right at one acre. We've got a cow, we've got goats, loads of chickens, tons of rabbits, all kinds of yada yada and yippie skippie but we don't have a lot of space and we don't have a lot of money. So that being said we have to come up with creative solutions to solve our problems and well we needed to get a bunch of hay through the winter so we had to come up with this. No this monstrosity is not a piece of modern art. It's our makeshift put together hay, thingy, barns. And it was cheap. I'm going to show you another one that was even cheaper but let me give you a view of what what we did here with this. So what you can see here is we had a dog kennel that we basically took a couple hog panels and wire tied them as a canopy over the top and wire tied everything together. We've got a pallet wood floor that keeps the hay up off the ground and we just put basically a $5 harbor freight kind of tarp over the top of this. It tears down easy you can move it easy and well doggone it's cheap and it's effective and it's working great. And another cool thing it's really nice and warm in here especially it's really cold out I think it's in the 30s. I'm kind of adult I didn't wear a jacket my nose is red my fingers are cold but anyway also to point out that this little structure even though it's small it can hold about 80 bales of hay so yeah! Okay so that one's cool and all but let's go in over to the other side of our little pen here I'm gonna show you the one that's even cheaper pallet wood frame yeah! So as you can see this one here over there right there that one has a framework of the pallets now you get those pallets for free you just gotta ask you know whatever Rural King or or you know a tractor supply store they have these things all the time for free you can go pick them up and we just put the hog fence over the top just like the other one we've got the wire it's all wire tied together some of its nailed down but we got all that junk sorry I'm confused junk in front of there like a swimming pool that's just to keep these yahoos from getting in there and eating it up because they keep trying but we will thwart their plans so now once again these are not permanent structures nor were they designed to be this is a quick fix because we had to get some hay we got to get it in there and winter was coming we had the hog panels and we got the pallets for free unlike the other one where the the kennel was basically the foundation or the the structure the framework rather but they're never intended to be permanent but bottom line is this stuff can be done cheaply you don't have to spend a lot of money you can get creative and well solve your problems if you just kind of scratch your head and go all right how can I fix this so anyway I hope you like the video if you don't mind please do like and subscribe it does help our family out I'm Brad with a big family homestead and I'm freezing so this video is over cuz it's like 30 degrees bye so here on our homestead we only have sorry the goats are down here goats are getting at me hi goats bye goats what are you gonna do
