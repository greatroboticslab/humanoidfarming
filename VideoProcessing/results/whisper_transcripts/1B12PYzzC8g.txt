 Shoo! We are back at the auction folks, okay? It's loud as heck in here. We're starting the day off looking for... Well, we're not really sure. We did not. I will say, we didn't bring the trailer. Look at these guys. He's 4-H friendly. Oh, he's friendly. He's friendly. This is the goose I actually wanted. I wanted the African geese. And we ended up getting whatever. They're loud. They're mad now. You know? Look at that guy. Hey. Pipe down there, buddy. It is so loud in here. I apologize. I'm going to try talking loud for you guys. But, like I said, we did not bring the trailer. So, we're looking for something like... Like these guys. Look at them. They're hanging out. But we were talking about taking our current geese and taking it down to the pond. They don't really guard anything, to be honest with you. I don't think it's really worth it. But, they've got peacocks here. They've got quail. They've got runner ducks. The world's largest cock. I mean, turkeys. They got everything. Pigeons, quail, pheasants. They have so much stuff. So, we're going to go around. Look, we got old guineys. We used to have those things, then they died. What are those? Oh, that's pigeon. Oh, the brown guy. The old fan-tail pigeon. Those are kind of cool. We talked about getting pigeons since we fixed up the predator-proof enclosure. We thought about getting some type of bird. Oh, that's breakfast. You get a free egg with them. Yeah, you get a free egg. It doesn't fit. Oh, rev. So, we're going to run around. I mean, they've got peacocks, more peacocks, lots of peacocks. I see some quail over here. Oh, look at this guy. Oh, that's what I'm saying. The old brown guy. That guy is cool looking. I want a Tom. If you guys remember, OGs remember Tom? He was mean. He was awesome. He would chase you around. He'd peck you. But then he got KO'd. So, we need to find life. Oh, is that him doing that? I got him to do it. There's so many turkeys, but look how busy it is. So many people here. Like, for this, to get to this cage is the last one. We're going to be here for like five hours. Yesterday, we spent like nine hours here, and we bought a frickin' ram. His name's Quattro, so if you missed that video, you'll have to click it down in the description or go check it out on the channel. We'll show him a little bit later, but we've got a... Look at that yellow guy over there. Oh, yeah. Is that a pheasant? Yeah, it's a pheasant, I think. Yeah. Isn't that a yellow, golden pheasant or something? That's sick. Oh, yeah. Dude, there's so many birds here. This is absolutely crazy. So, we're going to go around like I said, and try to pick out some stuff, preferably on the other side, which is where they're starting, but look at that. Yellow, golden pheasant. He killed his friend in there. RIP! There's a dead one. Oh, fat RIP! Just some regular ass chickens, I guess. There's an albino peacock. There's these pigeons in here. We got more geese. So, we're looking for birds. Something to put in our predator-proof enclosure. So far, our chickens have not died that we put in there. So, now I feel comfortable adding to it. Now, we might get something big like a peacock, take out the middle divider and have a big... What's wrong? Oh, that looks like Tyrone. Someone stole him. I missed him. Someone stole him. Red. Can we get another call duck one day? Really? I'm not a fan of ducks. They make a mess. I just... Yeah, I like shooting them, but... And eating them. But I don't really want to take care of any ducks. So, ducks I'm not too sure about, but more like peacocks. Stuff we've... I want something we've never had. Yesterday, we bought a ram, which we've never had before. So, today's objective, buy something we've never had. Mandarin duck. 2020 Mandarin. I've never seen one in person. Do you know where they're wild at? Nah. I don't know where they are. Is that a real thing or no? Nah, I don't know. I don't know where they come from, but that's... That's what Banjo wants. But, like I said, I'm not a huge fan of the ducks. The ducks, they just... They don't do nothing. They make a mess with their water. It's just... I want something bigger than a duck. Or at least multiple of something. Bro, look how big that is. Why is it so large? Massive. Like, absolutely terrible. Look at these guys. Fan-tailed pigeons. Yeah. There's a whole bunch of them. I've always wanted some pigeons. We've never had pigeons before. We got rid of them. And I feel like those are cool ones. They're cooler than, like, normal pigeons. They're like eggs in there. Oh, they laid eggs? I gotcha. You good? There's a wide load coming through. I think those are kind of cool. If we're gonna get pigeons, I feel like getting the fan. It's like a turkey. A turkey, a turkey, a turkey, a turkey, a turkey, a turkey. It's like a turkey. It's like a turkey. It's like a turkey. Turkey mixed with a pigeon. You have best of both worlds. Oh, look at- Hey, Tom. How you doing, Tom? You nice? I kind of want another one of you. And, oh, we got more pigeons. Oh, that guy looks kind of cool, too. A bunch of pigeons right here. And some turkeys. Is he mad? Is he mad? I don't know. I want a mean one. I only want the mean one. Look at these peacocks right here. Dude, those are so sick. We have had peacocks and they like died. Well, they flew away. But we have an enclosure now that we can keep them in. So, I don't know. Peacocks would be kind of cool. You could get like a breeding. What's up? Hi. How's it going? Good. What's your name? Quentin. Nice to meet you, dog. What are you buying? I got a baby lamb and my grandma got black whale. Nice. Nice. Good job. I think like $80 a pigeon. Yeah. You gotta get more. You can't just have two. You're buying? I bought our entry fee. $5. Deal. Alright, we got five of them. Why are they just so damn expensive? I just made like $300 on pigeons. You can get something down. That was the dumbest purchase I've ever made. Fan tail pigeons. $80 a piece for two of them and then $50 for three of them. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? I don't know. That's like over $300 in pigeons. Why do I bring Banjo? That's so funny. That's the most expensive bird I've ever bought in life. I bought five of them. Well, we're already here. We might as well stay and buy some other stuff. I don't know what's happening. I think someone did right after you. He was looking at me the whole time. I know I didn't find this. I thought he was done so then I raised my hand telling him five, which should have counted for another bit anyway. I just got screwed over there. I just got screwed over there. I got another pitch. I got another pitch. I got another pitch. I got another pitch. We lost to Turkey. How'd that have no sense? I think I just paid like $200 for more pitches. But they're not like the cool ones. They're like the normal ones to pitch, right? They won't have you both get the same pitch if they do. So now we've got like 25 pitches versus five. And now I spent like 20 at the sun, and I think I just got a little bit of a pitch. I got to raise my hand telling him five, which should have counted for another bid anyway. Yeah. I just got screwed over there. We lost to Turkey. I got to try and see how I'm going to give you a good pitch. I got to try and see how I'm going to get a good pitch. I got to try and see how I'm going to give you a bad pitch. I think I just got like $200 for more pitches. I got to try and see how I'm going to earn my pitch. Both like get the same pizza they do. So now we've got like 25 pigeons versus 5. And now I spend about $500 for pigeons. This guy. Shoo! We are back home, folks! We ended up spending $500 freaking dollars on some birds. That was freaking sick. I tried to get a turkey for you guys, and I guess I don't know how auctions work. I've been to a few of them before. And my buddy is like, ah, 55, 55, 55, yep, 55. He looks at me and points at me, and then no one else bids. Apparently somebody else gets it. That's how it works, I guess. I don't know. I guess I'm new to this thing. Anyways, we got some pigeons. World's most expensive pigeons, but we got to get an update. Where's Quattro? Oh, there's Quattro! Oh, he's just, see, he's nice. Carol, are you friends with Quattro, buddy? That's Quattro. We just bought him. Hey, how's it going, Dale? He's nice. Look at him. Ralphie. See, Ralph won't even come over here, though. See, Ralph thinks that we're about to feed, so look. See, Ralph's scared. Look at him. He's not too sure. Dale, what up, big boy? How's it going? How's it? You getting old? Dale, you're getting old, buddy. Ralph, you don't have to be scared of Quattro, buddy. Quattro, what are you doing? Look at him. He's just big, chilling. Well, that's the new ram named Quattro. That's what we bought on day one. Day one was Quattro. Day two, we got the old pigeons. I think Ralph's a little scared of him, but when we pulled in, Quattro and Carol were, like, basically hugging, so I think, oh, Carlos is scared of him. Did we get you a friend, finally? It's your boyfriend. Imagine that. That's the duo right there. Imagine he knocks her up. Yeah, a cow comes out with four horns. Rip. A cow comes out with four horns? Oh, legendary. That would be pretty cool. So, all right, we need to get this ready. I think what we're going to do is we are going to put the pigeons over here just to, well, actually, the other reason why is because we have chicken, most of the chicken wires on this, because otherwise the pigeons just fly out. Oh, that's true. Yeah. There's maybe a little miss. Oh, we might be okay. Oh, there's just a little gap. There's a gap in the middle. Barely, though. Okay. We could probably pull that down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They ain't going nowhere. So, this is the side that has most of the chicken wire on the top. The other one just has a lot of panels. So, what you do with these guys, normally they've got like a nesting, like nesting boxes and purchase. We do have, you don't think it's going to fit, D. It's going to be close. I think the roof might be too wide. I think because the bottom of the hutch, yeah, let's try it first. So, there's a rabbit hutch that we built over a year ago for rabbits that we never got. But the way it's designed is actually pretty good for pigeons. They each have their own little house. They can fly in there. We'll put some straw down. And they can nest. They can lay eggs. So, we're not sure what kind of, well, we have the fantail pigeons. But some of them in there, not the one that we got, had some eggs. So, I know out of all the pigeons we got, some of them are going to lay eggs at some point, I would assume. So, if you laid it on its back and then went and turned. So, oh, I think it would fit. Yeah. I see what you're saying. The distance between here and here is narrower than the door. Yeah. So, this is what it looks like. That's a good door. The old wind got the best. Pull that hand. The wind got the best of this one. Yep, see? Wow. Okay, there you go. We didn't break the hinge, but good enough. Yeah. This is going to be perfect. A little shelter for them. That way they can sleep up top, they can sleep below. And then, like I said, we can just put straw right here. And then their poop should mainly fall right to the ground. And then, like, you can make these little nesting boxes for them if you want. And then maybe find some long branches. What about, I saw that little cedar tree that we could, like, prop it up so they could land in it. Yeah. So, we're going to try to build, at least work on the enclosure a little bit. Get food, water, shelter, and stuff like that. And then release our pigeons inside of our predator-proof enclosure. The roof. Huh? So, why didn't we cut the roof? Oh. Oh. God, see? Yeah, we got it. Oh, look at us. We're a beast. If it was any bigger, I don't think you were. Woo! Our verticals. Oh, boy. Dude, this thing could not have been any bigger. I knew I'd use this rabbit hutch one of these days. Yeah. Not for rabbits, but. I like the tree. It's our pigeon hut. The old pigeon hut. Look at this. Oh, God, yeah. That's their nesting box. Man. Could not have planned that any better. Look at that. Beautiful. So, that way, if you get strong north wind, they've got all the blockage that they need if they want to sit under there. They can sit on it, too. No, they can sit on it. But that way, if it's raining, it's blowing. An old man snoring, they can go under there. Shoo! We got the old chicken wire figured out. We got a little stepping branch. We'll try. We'll see what they like. If you guys have any pigeon. That's one of the things we haven't really had before. No pigeon before. So, they got a nesting box in there. Three of them. And I think we're going to take the other nesting boxes, or left two of them, and put them with the chickens. Ralph is growling. He don't like Quattro. But see, look how nice he's been. He's watching his girlfriend, Carol. Him and Carol. They're besties now. They're big tree guys, so. I mean, I don't know if we need a bungee, but we can do it. Yeah, that'll give them plenty. Around the base. Yeah, look. Didn't it get to land on this? Yeah. This is good. I like this spot. There you go. Now that machine goes. That's good now. Oh, yeah. So, they got a little chill spot if they want to try to get away from the wind. They can land on these branches. They can roost on that branch. They go chill in their little hut. And this is predator-proof, hopefully. Hey, buddy. How you doing? Welcome to the farm. We're going to start with the expensive, fluffy ones, because once you release the 19, it's going to get crazy in there. So, we're going to start with just two. See what they do. Oh, God. Why does he walk like that? Do you guys fly? Wait, why do they look like that? That's hilarious. Why do they look like that? He's squaring up. Come here. Are we sure they fly? Oh, well. Well, you know. Are we sure they fly? I don't think these ones fly. Bro, they're dead ass on the ground going, why? Fans, I don't think they fly. That's funny. I literally Googled these before we bought them, and there was videos of them flying. Oh, oh, he's getting it. Oh, he's climbing. He can climb. They can climb. Hey, listen, pal. You want to go in here? How do you like that? Go lay an egg or something. Why do you sit like that? What? What happened over there? Here, come join your friend. You guys want to share? Hey. Oh, whoa. I'm not sure if they know how to fly. They're just going to have to teach them or something. How do they know where they're going? They can't see. No way. They're just literally walking like that. I'm really confused right now, to be honest with you. Maybe the other ones fly. Maybe the other pigeons will teach them. All right, well, let's get the other expensive, fluffy guys out. See if they're any better. Otherwise, we'll release the... The normal ones should fly. I'm not sure what the strat is with these. He definitely can't see. Look, it looks like he has no head. All right, come on. Do you guys fly or are you like your friend? He flies pretty good. Don't go back. There's no way this is a natural thing, right? Like... You think someone breeded pigeons and this happened? It's like they're just leaning. Like they're giving a little low ride. I mean, these guys hadn't left yet. Maybe they're laying an egg for you. They ain't doing nothing. You know how to sit in a tree? Hey, where are your feet? No. You never have sat in a tree before? There you go. Get your other one. Hold on tight now. Oh, God. He's a little top heavy. Do you not know how to stand? Oh, he's... Oh, he got it. He got it. Does he know how to get down, though? I'm not quite sure about that. I didn't know they could look behind him. Why did I spend $500 on this? I don't know. They don't even fly. They hang out. What's he eating? I found goosebuckers. Banjo did. Not good. Fly. Come on, you got it. See, those can fly. Oh, yeah. And these were $9. Oh, boy. Oh, God. Easy there, pal. Hey, use the stick. Oh. Oh. That's what I thought I was buying. Why did we get the fluffy tail expensive ones? These are great. Banjo's like releasing doves. Look how elegant they are. Come on, Banjo. You got it. Wee. These are like... These expensive ones were a total rip. Figured out. They got it. Whoa. They like that. What's getting it under here? They like that spot up there. Hey, let me hold you. If we didn't cover that up, they 100% would have got out. Look. They would have just... Oh, yeah. Yeah, so I'm saying... They would have shot straight out. Mm-hmm. Imagine that. We do all those. They just fly away. Oh, I think I found a hole. Oh, right. One got out. Here, I'll scare them. No. No. Oh, God. I don't know. I don't want to scare... They get out. Right here. Get out. Get out. Get out. I know. We're good. Wait, they can get through that? It's through that, I guess. One of these. Wait, but they can get through that? They squeeze through it. Really? Excuse me? How many did we lose? I think just one. Where'd he go? He'll definitely come back. He walked over there. I'm going to shoot him. Wait. Is that messed up? Imagine if we took out the little chicken wire then. Yeah. I didn't know they could get through. I bet he'll come back. We just won, wasn't it? Yeah. Next time I come down here, I'm coming down with my gun. I guarantee he'll be sitting on the top of this, trying to figure out how to get back in. I did not realize they can get out. Shoo! Well, we got the hole fixed. We lost one, but it wasn't an expensive one. We patched that hole. I didn't realize they could get out of that, like the exterior. Hey, are you good, bro? Hey, you good? You get it figured out there, buddy? This actually worked out great. I'm really glad we fit this thing in there because now they've got a place to hang out. They can chill. They shouldn't be able to escape. We've got chicken wire across this entire thing, kind of all laid down. Hey, you settle down, buddy. No. Did you just poop on me? You bastard. They like, oh. You got it. He's not sure about that stick. Come on. Pick a side. I'm sure you're right here. There you got it. He likes that little stick. See, I don't know why we bought the expensive one because these were $9 each, and they're great. They do pigeon things. These guys, they're literally sitting in this corner doing absolutely nothing with their life. Like, they're just sitting there. I don't know why we got them or what they're good for. That one identifies as a fan. Yeah, that guy. There's one of our known ones that can't fly, so he identifies as a fan tail. But these ones, they hang out up there. We'll have to come back. Obviously, they're trying to figure out what's going on right now. They've got their water. They've got their food. Ideally, they fly in there, and they can nest. If they want to sleep up here, they can. They want to sleep under there, they can. If they want to sleep under there, they can. If they want to sleep in a tree, they can. I feel like without us ever having pigeons, they've got a decent setup in here. A nice, big enclosure. It's not overcrowded. Plenty of food. Plenty of water. Plenty of structure and stuff to play on and stuff like that. And they've got some friends over here. The old chickens can hang out with them. And we thought about taking out this middle divider, but I think for now it makes sense just to leave it. It's not like we ran out of space at all. I mean, you could probably triple the amount of pigeons we have, and it'd still be fine. So that is what we got at auction day number two. There is not a day number three, but let us know what we're missing. We think we still want a turkey because we got robbed today, but we can get turkeys at the normal auction. This was like you go to the exotic auction to get exotic animals like Quattro and like Fantail pigeons. And if any of you guys are thinking about getting Fantail pigeons, just know that they're about as entertaining as buying a plant. They don't do anything. An $80 plant. An $80 plant. Per. Per. Okay? Anyways, hope you guys enjoyed today's video. We will catch you on the next episode. Thanks so much for watching. And peace. Bye.
