Hay making on our smallholding homestead in the UK summer

Howto & Style
 Right at last we can actually think about making some hay. It's been a funny old summer. We've had about you know one or two nice days then rain, then three nice days then rain, one nice day rain. It's been a nightmare to be honest. So it's now the beginning of August I think it's about 6th of August today and usually we've made hay by either the end of June or the beginning of July and so this is really late for us but we've got five days of nice sunshine in the forecast so we're going to crack on and make hay these next few days.

Notifications every time I post a video which is about once a week at the moment. And so yeah, little field about an acre. We should get about 100-120 bales off it. We'll see how we get on. Okay, we've done a couple of circuits around the field just to get a border really and also just to see how the mower is cutting. And I don't think it's cutting too badly. It's fairly even on both sides. So yeah, I think we've got it round about right. The experts amongst you will probably tell me differently but and let me know to be honest if I can do things better here. So yeah, that's good. So I'm just going to get the drone up in the air so you can see some aerial photos and video of what we're doing here. But yeah, it shouldn't take too long to get this field done now. Just kidding! This is, you know, convert into two lamps, beautiful buildings going banyak to be everywhere and you have seas herum. How should we get to pencil down the сцен So as to a sea level? Gotcha! Here we go. Your meal today'skiej. This is a place on end of our first becomes a human. 5 days for your class You'll have to climb out the snow was very hard to give you a good study Hmmm, I thought you'd read that Salam quan, attack the bow Del concrete moves meta her, plus it�를 cause that you'll catch up at the core of the Basic wrong Right Left Let's go. Okay that's the first step done. We've cut the grass. It's taken a little bit longer than I wanted to be honest because it took me ages to get the PTO shaft onto the mower. But anyway that aside, we've got the whole field cut now and so this afternoon after lunch we're going to turn it basically to spread all the grass over the field as best we can and just let the sunshine do its job. Okay it's early afternoon now and we've got rid of the mower and now put the tedder on the back of the tractor. We've set it all up in the right positions I think anyway so when we go around the field now it should just fan out all the grass just evenly or roughly evenly over the fields to let the Sun do its job and bake it essentially. We'll do that this afternoon, we'll do that now and we'll do it again tomorrow and possibly one more time before we then put it into rows for the baler to bale so that's what we'll get on with now. WhileGGV, we've got a national cuisine yet before we go back to the Greeting on Testament from the registration training Luna, which takes active on thebench RaCBAU, it's normal to gather up and make it availableセinr as a foreman from the fishing line on the Arch Thank you. Thank you. Okay, it's day two now of our haymaking exercise and it is really hot. It's about 35 degrees or so here today, one of the hottest days of the year. And anyway, but it's good because it means that the hay that we've cut yesterday is drying really nicely. And I turned it this morning just to spread it all over the place, as well as last night, obviously. And then I'm just going to do it for a third time now. It's about half past two in the afternoon. So it is really, really warm. Hence the cap, collars up, suntan lotion on, bottle of water on the tractor there. So anyway, I'm all set. Let's see how it goes. I might wilt before the day's out. Okay, we're now ready to put all this hay into windrows now. It's had about three days of pretty nice sunshine and heat on it. So it's pretty dry. I think we'll be okay. So I hope we are anyway. So we're going to put it into rows. And then the next stage after that is baling. And that's when the fun starts. Okay, we've got all the hay now in these rows, these windrows, which is perfect for the baler to pick up all the hay and make it into bales. So we've got rid of the tedder on the back of the machine, on back of the tractor. And we've now got our baler, which in our case is an old McCormick, I think it's a B64. I think I've got that right. Baler, which to be honest, is not as good as the modern balers for obvious reasons. But it is what it is. To put it politely, it's got its own little foibles. If I wasn't going to put it so kindly, it's a constant source of frustration. But anyway, we'll see how it goes. It's the lotters are all greased up and so they're ready to go. We've got new baler twine inside. Everything's, I think, okay. But we'll just have to see how it goes. See if the hay gods are with us. We'll see you next time. a Right, I'm going to call it quits on our baler. Most of them are absolutely fine and we've got enough in the field so that we can go through winter. But the problem with balers, especially old ones, is that they're very susceptible to blockages. Not blockages, but so the knotters get all filled up with string and all sorts. You see my bird's nest in there, that's one of the knotters. It's going to be a devil of a job to go that out, which I'm going to have to do. And as a consequence it's not tying the knots brilliantly well so we're getting some split bales now. But as I say we've got, I don't know how many we've got, we'll count them up in a second, but we've got enough as I say. So I'm going to put the baler to bed, get the trailer out and then we'll put all the bales in the barn. Right, that's the trailers all loaded up with the bales. But we have got some loose stuff on the ground which we're just going to use our sort of hippo bags, that type of thing, to squish all the loose stuff that's on the ground. So each bag will probably hold about maybe two, possibly three bales worth. So in the end we just had a quick count up. From this field, which is about an acre or so, we've got the equivalent of about 80 bales, which is a bit on the low side. There's a lot of waste on the ground. Sonia's just saying there's a lot of waste on the ground because our baler is not brilliant, to be honest. It doesn't pick up everything, even though we've got it on the lowest setting. So you know, it is what it is. But 80 bales, we should be all right if we need to buy any more and our neighbours have got loads of hay too. So anyway, I think that's probably it for this video.
