 Growing all organic cannabis has always been one of our favorite ways to grow. Today on Canadian Grower, we're going to be showing you a cheap and effective method for growing cannabis right at home in true no-till living soil using the Clapness Coot soil recipe. As always, please do make sure to drop a comment, like, and subscribe. It really does help the channel out. So with that being said, let's just jump right into it. And we wanted to start out by explaining exactly what no-till growing is. In short, tilling is when you break up the compacted soil or disrupt your topsoil. No-till is a growing method of reusing the soil with minimal or no disruption of the topsoil, thus giving it the name no-till. Adapting a no-tillage approach can lead to healthier soil biology by allowing organic matter to increase in and on the soil. In our opinion, no-till growing can help you achieve a productive soil with higher crop yields, all while saving you a lot of time and effort. Keep in mind that while the Coots mix is great for no-till, this doesn't mean you have to go the no-till direction just because you're using this soil recipe. Now, essentially, the idea here is we're going to be mixing a bunch of rock dusts, manures, and quite a few other things into one large 20-gallon pot, which could serve as our growing medium for years to come if we really wanted to do so. For the most part, I would say that that's pretty much the main appeal to growing with the no-till method, as you don't have to constantly reinvest in dry amendments to feed your plants, which obviously just gives you a lower overhead cost in the long run. Okay, so there's plenty of soil recipes to choose from, but as mentioned before, we did decide to go with the Clapness-Coots mix for our no-till living soil blend, and of course, I'm sure some people might be curious as to what that even is, so let's go over it real quick. Made famous by popular YouTubers like Jeremy over at Build-A-Soil, Jim Bennett, also known as Clapness-Coot, is a well-known figure in the living soil industry who's mostly known for creating one of the simplest living soil recipes designed to provide all of the nutrients required to grow cannabis plants in the same soil for over four years. Since this soil recipe is made of entirely organic compounds, one of the most important aspects of this recipe is that you prioritize the quality of the materials being put into your soil, meaning you're going to want to make sure you are sourcing the best inputs when attempting this mix. In order to grow using the Coots mix with the least amount of maintenance and having better chances of success, it is recommended to grow in containers larger than 10 gallons. Now, there is a lot of stuff going into this recipe, so before we go any further, let's do a quick rundown of everything we're going to be needing. Now, for the base, we're going to be needing some Canadian sphagnum peat moss, vermicompost or compost blend, and for aeration, some pumice, rice hulls, and some charged biochar. Now, in regard to everything else, which is going to be sourced from a company called Black Swallow, we'll be needing some crab meal, kelp meal, neem cake, karanja cake, organic milled malted barley, oyster shell flour, gypsum rock dust, basalt rock dust, and some organic straw, which we're going to be using for our cover crop, along with this 20-gallon grassroots pot. All right, now that we have a rough idea of everything that goes into the soil recipe, we can start making our Clapness-Coots living soil mix. Since we will be making around 25 liters, which is a large volume of soil, we are going to be needing somewhere where we can mix everything together where it's not going to get contaminated or make a huge mess. Now, there's multiple ways you could do this. You could simply throw down a tarp just like Build-A-Soil recommends, but for us, we decided to mix everything inside of a 63-liter storage bin to help reduce mess, but we probably should have went with the tarp, to be honest. Okay, so let's begin with our base soil, which primarily consists of three things. Canadian sphagnum peat moss, aeration, and some high-quality compost or vermicompost, which works just as well. Now, when making your base soil, you can mix using the general ratio of one-third of each. Since we have a 20-gallon pot, we're going to need to mix roughly 6.67 gallons of peat moss with 6.67 gallons of aeration and 6.67 gallons of high-quality compost. For aeration, the original Kootz recipe calls for some pumice. Now, basically, pumice is a very porous volcanic glass that is created from superheated, highly pressurized rocks from volcanoes. Being that pumice is heavy, it will not rise to the top of the soil, unlike alternatives such as perlite. Now, if you do want to spice things up a little bit, you can add some rice hulls and charged biochar into the mix. The rice hulls added provide great soil aeration alongside some charged biochar, which can help improve soil quality by increasing its carbon content. For us, we decided to go with a mixture of all three, adding roughly 2.2 gallons of pumice with 2.2 gallons of rice hulls, and finally 2.2 gallons of charged biochar into our soil. Last but not least, we're going to need to be adding the most important component of the soil recipe, which is one-third of some high-quality vermicompost. For us, we decided to go with a mixture of roughly 4.4 gallons of African Nightcrawler earthworm castings by Gaia Green, as well as roughly 2.2 gallons of some high-quality compost blend from Black Swallow, which largely consists of manure, straw, and alpha-alpha. All right, now that we've finished adding everything we need for our base soil mix, we can begin adding some additional amendments and trace minerals into our soil. Now, growers can easily find Kutze-proof kits online offered by companies like KIS Organics, or even build a soil. And while these kits are great options for those of you who are looking to avoid sourcing your own ingredients, people do often report there's really high shipping costs on some of these kits, and for that reason, we would just recommend sourcing locally instead. Since everything used in these soil recipes is organic, the majority of the ingredients can all be sourced no matter where you are in the world. That being said, we were able to get a lot of the necessary requirements from a local company here in Canada called Black Swallow Living Soil, so big shout out to them. All right, to start off, we're going to be adding some crab meal, kelp meal, organic milled malted barley, as well as some neem and karanja cake into our soil mix. Now, crustacean meal, also known as crab meal or shrimp meal, is an excellent organic fertilizer thanks to its high calcium content and the slow release of nitrogen and phosphorus it provides. We're going to be adding about a half cup per cubic foot of soil to our mix. Now next, we're going to be adding kelp meal, which is another highly beneficial powerhouse that acts as a nutrient-dense, slow-release fertilizer. Honestly, the benefits of kelp meal are massive, as it contains an array of plant growth hormones, amino acids, essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, as well as various other trace elements. Again, we're going to be going with the same measurements as before with a half cup per cubic foot of soil. Okay, at this point, we are going to be adding some organic milled malted barley, which provides our soil with an excellent source of enzymes while also acting as a source of carbon for our microbes. Now, unlike with the crab meal and kelp meal, with this one, we're going to be adding one cup per cubic foot of soil into our mix. All right, from here, we're going to be adding a 50-50 mixture of both neem and karanja cake into our soil. In addition to being a great fertilizer for our soil, neem and karanja cake can help protect our plants from pests, acting almost as like a natural insect repellent, while also helping to increase the earthworm populations within the soil. Again, we're going to be adding that 50-50 mix of neem and karanja cake, which comes out to a half cup per cubic foot of soil into our 20-gallon mix. All right, next up, the Clapness Coutts recipe requires about four cups of minerals per cubic foot added into the soil. In terms of minerals, the original Coutts recipe calls for a mixture of basalt rock dust, gypsum, and oyster shell flour. Now, for the basalt rock dust, we're going to be adding two cups per cubic foot of soil into our 20-gallon mix. Next up, we have our gypsum, which is essentially a hydrated calcium sulfate mineral that is pH neutral and does not alter the soil's acidity level, making it an effective way to introduce calcium without affecting the pH balance. For us, we're going to want to be adding about one cup per cubic foot of soil into our 20-gallon mix. All right, finally, we're going to be adding some oyster shell flour, which is going to be about one cup per cubic foot of soil into our 20-gallon mix. Now, once we finally have everything added into our bin, we're going to want to throw on some gloves and give it all a good mix so we can assure that all of the materials have been properly blended together. Now, a quick note, this recipe does not need to be cooked like most traditional living soils. However, we did decide to have it sit for about 24 hours, which let the microbiology really come to life before planting our cannabis. After about a day of sitting, we noticed the microbiology in our soil had significantly ramped up. We can now see a nice layer of mycelium and fungus forming across the topsoil, which shows us that the soil is creating a thriving ecosystem. It also really smells at this point, but yeah, from here, we're going to want to start stirring the fungi that's growing on the top back into the mix. Well, yeah, that pretty much does it. From here, the Clapness-Coutts recipe is officially ready to be used in an indoor or outdoor garden. This soil recipe on its own can last around a year with little to no need for amending, making it ideal for no-till growers. Now, a quick note should be made that when no-till growing, it is important that your soil is covered with mulch to benefit the microbiology within the soil. Mulch plays a crucial role in maintaining the soil's surface moisture while also conserving a significant amount of water and aiding in reducing humidity levels by slowing down evaporation rates of your topsoil. Other than that, we could toss a handful of red wiggler worms into our soil mix to help breaking down the organic material and keep the microbiology thriving, but that is by no means a requirement. And that's pretty much it. With this soil mix, we ended up growing a very nice plant, all under our XS 1500 light by Viper Spectra. Now, this 150-watt light comes in at a fair price, certainly on the affordable side, and it gets the job done. I mean, the light penetration definitely was not an issue, and the overall grow, we harvested a really nice plant. We're excited to show you guys later. But yeah, if you're on the market for a good light, this is it. But yeah, that pretty much does it for today. If you guys have any other soil recipes or just any other video ideas you'd like to see here on the channel, make sure to comment them down below. So again, I appreciate all you guys who've been watching the video, subscribing, all that stuff. It's really crazy to see kind of the growth of the channel. We're just over 30,000 subscribers now. I do apologize for all the delays and content uploads. We've been super busy on our end. I recently broke my arm. I had to get surgery on it, and then just a bunch of other stuff. But yeah. But yeah, I appreciate you guys watching. Until next time, peace. Okay, so
