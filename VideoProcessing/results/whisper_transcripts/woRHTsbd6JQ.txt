Corteva Agriscience WIN Farmers Panel

Science & Technology
 So welcome everyone that's here in the room as well as all the folks that are joining us on Zoom. We have folks from Johnston, Wilmington, and all of our other sites that are joining us here today for the Wynn Female Farmers event. So as we all know, our Corteva purpose, our purpose, is to enrich the lives of those who produce and those who consume, ensuring progress for generations to come. So today Wynn is going to host the perspectives of the producers. But next month, October, the Pioneer Women's Network is going to host the perspectives of the consumer. So please keep an eye out for that event. We're going to send some more communications around that soon. But I know you're very excited to start this event off. So please join me in welcoming Jim Collins, our COO, to say a few opening remarks. So I have a funny story to start with about Isha this morning. So we had dinner last night with our visitors and customers and some of the panel members and a few of you. And those of you who were dinner knew that I flew in literally the two seconds before the start of that dinner. Now I had been in Boston and New York and I had been working with the credit rating agencies that ultimately will rate Corteva as a company to decide whether we're going to be able to borrow money or not. So naturally I wanted to look my best. So I looked like a banker walking in there last night. So Isha says to me, she goes, could you dress it down a little bit tomorrow? Now the second side of that story is I walk in this morning and I'm standing in a crowd around her. She's like, where's Jim? And I was standing right there. She goes, gosh, I didn't even recognize you. So I promise I will wear polo shirts more often. But I have my name tag on just in case you know that. Well, let me start by thanking you, Isha, and your team for the work you've done to set this up today. So if you were part of the design committee for this today and you're here, would you just stand up so we can say thank you? There's some in the back. Great. And the way Wynn has reached out to the Pioneer Women's Network and to the folks in Wilmington and other sites to make them a part of this event today I think is just one more example of what we're trying to create here as Corteva. One team, one focus, one culture. So it's great to have the other folks joining us on the phone. The next group I want to thank are the panelists that will be here and the other farmer customers that have joined us here. Last night was great at dinner. We sat down at tables and started talking, and within 30 seconds you could almost not even hear yourself talk. The buzz and the sound in the room and the energy was just extraordinary. So we've added a few more people here to the room today. So if I could get all of our visitors to stand just for a moment so everybody in the room can see who you are so that during the rest of the day if they've got questions, they're going to come seek you out. So thank you. And Isha is right. You know, we started to build this company based on a very foundational and fundamental statement, and that is our purpose statement, about enriching the lives of those who produce. And all across this business for the last year, different groups and teams have sought out, how do we get that perspective in the room? And so we've done a number of these, but for the different women's network to acknowledge that there's a very special role that women play in agriculture here in the United States, I got a few statistics here that women now account for 30% of farm operations in the United States. I didn't realize it was that high. That's just in the U.S. Globally, we would say it accounts for greater than 50% of women are the lead on the farm in agriculture. And for any of you who have been to Africa or India or China, you'll know that number is probably more like 75%. So women play an extraordinary role in agriculture. And I, Director Durham, who's the head of economic development in the state of Iowa, I texted her last night and I said, hey, I thought I heard a statistic. Am I right? And she answered me back that as of today, more than 50% of the farms, the registered farm legal entities in the state of Iowa are owned by women. So there was another one that I didn't know. And then finally, the last statistic, which I heard about a year ago, and I think the number might even be higher, is that the enrollment in 2018 at land-grant universities for ag-related majors, 54% of the applicants of the enrollees were women. So not only do we have a strong presence in agriculture today, but you can feel the wave that's coming, right? So I congratulate you for thinking about this, of bringing this perspective here in the room. And I think the panel is just going to be extraordinary for getting that perspective. The other thing I find very interesting is we talked about this purpose statement of not only being those who produce, but also getting the perspective in the room of those who consume. And when we go out and look at external research, it shows that consumers most frequently trust two groups. They trust moms, and they trust farmers. And can you imagine what happens when you put together mom farmers? So that's what we have here today are some really great farmers, a few that I got to know really well last night. They're running extraordinary operations in what is a difficult environment, and they'll certainly share some of those perspectives. But many of them are moms, and they're managing the household and running the families and providing for the health and the education of the rest of the farm family that's associated with them. So it's a very special role that you play, and your perspectives are very special. So as we think about inclusion and we think about the diversity of this business that we manage globally, having sessions like this I think is just so appropriate. So my job here really is to introduce the star of today or the administrator of today, and that's Krista. Over the last year or almost two years now, I've had the absolute pleasure to work with her, and I tell you the passion and the energy that she brings to the business, to agriculture, not only in the U.S., but globally, and especially her championship for women in agriculture is second to none. And so we're also very honored to have her here and for her to help moderate our panel this morning. So Krista, turn it over to you. I did expect the women to come. I know what our network here is on campus and around the company, but it's not just women that need to hear this message. It's enlightened men as well, and we're so fortunate that we have a company where we do work together as a team, and it's men and women together to build this new company. But the tone is set at the top, Jim. It starts with you and the folks around you in your leadership team. And I see colleagues, men and women, in this room, and I'm proud to be a part of such a team that recognizes the contribution of all of our customers, big, small, tall, short, men and women. It really helps. Jim inherited me. He did not recruit me to join the company. For those who don't know, I'm only going to be on the company, as Jim said, a couple of years. And when I was leaving my last job, I was already deciding, it's a big move for me. You know, what am I going to do next? I'd never worked at a corporate level. Didn't know if that was for me. I really thought that maybe an association, again, working directly for farmers made more sense. I'd kind of been working for farmers or kind of organizations that represented farmers or government. Just never thought of myself as a corporate person. And Jim Burrell, at the time, was helping convince me that DuPont, at the time, was a great place. And then the merger was announced, and Mr. Burrell was retired, and things were kind of chaotic. And Jim, all of a sudden, was the point person for me to talk to about, do I make this leap? So I kept looking for all these signs to tell me that it was not. It's going to be crazy, which it is. It was going to be chaotic, which it is. It may not even work, which it is going to. Certain of that. So I just kept asking questions and really things, thinking this is going to be the sign that says, nope, you don't need to go there. Nope, this is not the place for you. They're not going to get you. I don't have that corporate mind, and Jed will tell you. I still ask about a thousand questions about acronyms every meeting. And poor Suzanne and her NBR, I'm always like, what does that mean? So I just didn't see myself fitting in. And then one of the final questions I asked Mr. Collins at the time was about my work in women in agriculture. And I just said it's something that is a lifelong passion. I grew up on a farm in Georgia. I know what my mother and grandmothers and friends and family members have done for agriculture and felt like it's never been appreciated or recognized or valued in the way it should be. And I want to continue to be a voice that makes sure that it's heard and that we see the women's contributions just like we see their male counterparts, whether they're granddaughters or daughters or wives or sisters, that it's still valued. And I want to go to a place that would honor that and let me do that and bring others with me and share in telling that story. And Jim did not hesitate. He said, yep, that's the kind of company we want to be. That's when we come together, and we were not Corteva. It was just still kind of Agco. We're going to be the kind of company that sees everybody, that values everybody's contributions, not just one part of the team. And you can continue that work. You can accelerate that work if you come for us. I have to tell you, that was one of the final questions and answers that I got that made me want to be a part of Agco and now Corteva. And Jim has never, ever backed down. Even when it's been uncomfortable, even when budgets are tight and would have to be very focused, we have not forgotten all of our customers. And that certainly does include the women who are involved in agriculture across the globe. Today we're going to hear from four fabulous women. There are others they're just representing. They're just the voices of so many others around this country and around the world. So I thank you, Jim, personally. You made a big difference. You might have regretted saying yes to me, but I'm glad that you didn't. So I'm going to go on stage and then I'm going to have our panelists come up. So let me get up here. Hold the handle. I know that, the rail. I know I've learned that. If nothing else, I am a much safer person since I joined this. I'm sorry that Susan Lewis is not here. I just have seen that and heard me yesterday. I started two steps with a phone in hand and Kelly, who's with me, said, Kristen, you can't do that. And I'm okay. I stopped right there and did midway hall. People bumped into me. I stopped and didn't do my text moving. So I have learned. All right. So let's get started. Stephanie Holcomb, come up, please. She is from Kentucky. We'll learn more about them in just a minute. Karen Muson, please join us on stage. From California. Katie Sawyer, where's Katie? There she is. She's coming up. She's from up here in Kansas. And last but not least, Lori Link from Missouri. First of all, we thank you all and all the women who have come. We know it's a busy time of the year on your farms and in your businesses. Busy time with school just starting and those with families are having to juggle a lot. So we're very pleased and honored that you would spend a couple of days with us. We had a great dinner, as Jim mentioned last night. Just talking, getting to know each other, talking about their businesses, talking about Corteva, what can we do better. So it was a great opportunity to visit with you. And I know that our folks in the room and around, really, the company who are listening in, I really appreciate your time today. I'm just going to start. And Lori, I'm going to start on that end and we'll work this way. Tell us about your operation. Tell us about what you do in your operation. Maybe how long you've been doing it. And a little bit about your passions for your business. Good morning, everyone. Lots of friendly faces, so when you look at me, keep smiling. It really helps. Because this is a big group. I am actually a fourth generation farmer in our farm in north central Missouri. We are, I'd say, a mid-sized farm for our area. We farm anywhere from 1,000 to 1,500 acres, depending. Some of that's, we have more than that, and some of that's in cattle production as well as road crop. We grow corn, soybeans, hay, and then also we rotate in wheat every now and then. Upon graduating college, six days later, I got married. And six days later than that, after that, I was a resident of Texas for a short time. And then me and my husband spent time in western Kansas. So it was definitely a blessing for us to get to come back to the family farm, my family's farm there in Missouri. And what I do is kind of what I don't do. I will not run the planter. I refuse to learn to do that because I know that, ooh, that's that. Yeah, and I don't want to, you know, my dad already now complains if the rows aren't exactly straight. So, yeah, you know, have you seen the little post about, you know, texting and driving? And, yeah, that would be me. So, but I handle the grain cart. I handle the tractor. I handle the combine. Work with the cattle. Chase the kids. Feed the bottle calves if there's one. You know, just pretty much whatever there is to do. It is what you don't do. So we want the one thing you don't do. Okay. That's great. Thank you. Katie. Katie. I'm going to make sure I'm on here. Good morning, everybody. I am Katie Sawyer. I hail from McPherson, Kansas, which is kind of smack dab in the middle of the state. We have an approximately 2,500 to 3,000 acre farm that grows the traditional Kansas crops of corn, soybeans, wheat. We do some grain sorghum, and we are planting alfalfa again for the first time in probably a decade. Some brome hay, some forage sorghum, triticale, and some cover crops. We have a very large Angus-based commercial cow herd that we have kind of a backgrounding lot there on the farm that we feed through the winter months. We calve out here at our farm as well, and then we use a lot of the grass over in the Flint Hills of Kansas to graze during the summer and fall months. I actually work off the farm. I married into farming, so I'm first generation that's helping raise the fifth generation and my two sons. I like to provide the nutritional and logistical support, meaning I deliver meals and can help move men from one field to another. Those are my best traits right now. Off the farm, I have a unique and a great opportunity to work in policy development as I am district director for our U.S. congressman, Dr. Roger Marshall. And so he is on the House Ag Committee and actually a member of the conference committee for the farm bill right now. So I've been able in a lot of ways to marry my personal world and my professional world in that the work we're doing in D.C. is directly impacting myself and my neighbors. And I like being able to travel the state of Kansas and our district specifically to talk directly with farmers, ag associations, commodity groups to really delve deep into what is and is not impacting them and where their priorities lie. And I can speak a lot to that just at our own farm. So it's been a unique opportunity. And it's served us well so far. So I don't help a lot on the farm, but like a lot of other moms up there, I try to take care of all the other things that surround the farm to keep the men working. That's great. Thank you, Katie. Karen. Well, so my background is a little different. I'm a third generation farmer. And I am actually a distributor of Dow DuPont products and Corteva. But so I own and operate a 70-year-old crop retail business called Gartutellian Incorporated. We're located in Reedley, California. Our claim to fame is we are the ERA, North American Ag Retailer of the Year. We were named the 2016 ARA Ag Retailer of the Year. And we are noted as being the single largest independent crop care retailer in the nation. We operate out of one location. We serve about 1,500 growers in the Central Valley. We represent five counties. We serve about a 100-mile radius from our operation. We have presently about 130 employees on staff. We have 40-plus pest control advisors are part of that staff. We are very engaged in our communities that we live and work in. So I was born and raised on the farm when I was growing up. We were grape growers. Today we are citrus growers. And we are 100% female-owned and operated. So my husband is our president and CEO. And my son-in-law has recently joined the operation. And he oversees operations and marketing for us right now. But we are a growing, burgeoning company. You know, we are in California. The dynamics are much different, you'll hear, than much of the rest of the country. And yet we continue to thrive and flourish. So in addition to the crop care retail business and the products and advice we provide, we also provide some ancillary products and services to our growers. And we've responded in part to the need of the population of our commercial growers. So we also provide water management and services. We provide customized, fertilized blends. And we also provide to growers, and you don't have to be a customer of ours, but we do regulatory compliance and training. And we monitor all of our growers that are part of that service. So every week they'll get a check. And, you know, we monitor. We maintain all their employee handbooks for them. We make sure that they're compliant in every aspect of the law, whether it be OSHA or product food safety. We also own and operate our own nonprofit foundation. We founded the foundation in 2003. And I am the CEO of the nonprofit foundation in addition to overseeing marketing efforts of our crop care business. So since 2003, we have gifted and granted over $2.5 million. And those, they are project-specific. As CEO, I get a lot of latitude on what I do. So we, of course, we support FFA and 4-H and all the Farm Bureaus who are members and active in all of our Farm Bureaus. But in addition to that, we are very active in growing ag literacy programs, whether they be at the high school level, the college level, or even at the elementary school level. And as Krista already mentioned, you know, our real focus is that young mother. And so a lot of times we talk to mom through her children. I am also the voice and the marketing director of our company. So you will hear me 24-7 a day, every day, advertising on our local radio stations in our five counties and sending messages to the consumer about all the importance of agriculture. So some things that I might say are, you know, farming is a lot more than planting, plowing, and picking. But I'm trying to educate and let the consumer know that they can trust a farmer, that everything we do is sustainable, that we do care about them and the health of their children. It's about the land and the legacy of our growers. We want them to be successful not only today, but we want them to be here for future generations. You're one busy lady, Karen. I am one busy lady. Wow. I'm tired just listening to you. There's a lot going on in your life. I got accused of being a little overly passionate last night. Never. Never. We appreciate it so much. Thank you, Krista. Stephanie, tell us your story. Good morning. I'm Stephanie Holcomb, and I am similar to Katie in that I'm a first-generation farmer, but I'm working in the sixth generation of my husband's family farm in southern Kentucky. We are just over the state line from Tennessee, so we're only about an hour north of Nashville, Tennessee. We grow corn, wheat, soybeans, barley, and rye. I work with my in-laws. My mother and father-in-law have run the business for the past 40 years. My husband came back to the business in 2010, and I came in 2012. My background is not in farming. I have a manufacturing background, actually. And my husband and I met when we were both working for Caterpillar. He had to go off the farm. His dad encouraged him to go off the farm. And so he spent about 10 years away from the farm working for Caterpillar. So that's where we met. And we had good experiences there, but he always knew that he wanted to come back to the farm and raise his family, raise our family on the farm, which, since being back, I understand why now. Because it's a wonderful experience for our family. But we worked, well, when we got married, we actually lived in Mexico and had a wonderful time working for a big corporation. But the farm was expanding, and his dad wanted some help. And so, like I said, he came back in 2010. And then just because of, you know, transition, I decided to come to the farm in 2012. Well, one of the main things was that with my job at Caterpillar, I was traveling quite a bit. And I wanted to be around my family. I didn't like being away from my son as much. And so luckily, they found a place for me on the farm. And I basically brought in my manufacturing background to the farm. I helped organize operations looking. I essentially handle all of the data that comes off of our farm. I handle all of the input inventory, crop inventory. I manage our granular system, which I know is now part of this company. So I've worked with that for four years on the farm. And it's just my way of trying to organize everything, make sure that we are doing everything that needs to be done. We run about 6,800 acres, so it's enough. It keeps us busy. And plus, we're spread out over Kentucky and Tennessee. We go, it's about 300 miles in between farms. So we've got to make sure we get everything done. So that's where granular comes in. It really, really helps us with that. I'm trying to think. So yeah, so I said I manage all of the data on the farm as well as grain marketing and then working with FSA. I think you can tell the diversity of these four women who, and I know if we talked to the others who were with us and other women around the country, you'd hear that coming from different backgrounds, not everybody grew up on a farm. Not everybody had that kind of family experience, either married into it or just chose it by it. So I think the diversity, whether you're doing back-breaking or mind-bending work, you're still contributing to this great industry. So I thank all of you. It's great to hear your stories and hear the diversity of your stories. I want to shift a little bit, and Karen touched on this, consumers. If you look at our mission, I know every employee here can recite it in your sleep, right, the new mission of Corteva. I won't ask you to do the pledge or anything, but I hope that you do know it. But we talk about customers, and customers are always at the forefront. I mean, that is the heart of a business like ours, and that's why we have these kind of interchanges and discussions and listening and learning from you. But consumers is in there as well, because we know if you who are farming don't have markets, then we don't have a market, and we don't have you. And there continues to be this kind of growing non-connection, whatever the right words, disconnect, with consumers and agriculture. So, Lori, I'll go back to you. I know you're involved in 4-H. I know your kids are doing things that help them interact maybe with not only just farm kids, but others. But do you open up your farm? Do you bring folks in? What are you doing, and what do you think is your responsibility as a farmer these days to help talk about agriculture in a different way? It is. I know I would love to open up our farm more. Our farm is always open to anybody. We have, being that we also have a pioneer dealership, we have others that do come on the farm quite a bit to pick up seed, and we travel to other farms, which is fun. But I think one of the best ways, and having kids helps, is that it's just the little things. I think Katie has, too, you know, the Arab blogs. So a lot of us are moms, so I had a blog for a while. Now I focus mainly doing advocating through Instagram and Facebook. Instagram's my friendly place. I like it. You get hearts and smiles, and it's a good friendly place. But I think the kids helping that, too, is they have wonderful experiences that other kids don't get to have and won't get to have, and so that's really fun. Just being at our county fair, any time that the kids can interact with people, they do it and they love it. One of their favorite things to do is to feed marshmallows, the big marshmallows. It's a treat for the pigs, and people get a kick out of that. So it can be the big things to, you know, talking about what we're doing if we're planting a cover crop or it's time to harvest, or it's having somebody pet your pig, your kids show pig, and feed it a marshmallow. I think the gamut is out there of unique and different ways to get our story out, and I think we should try to embrace all of them. That's right. Stephanie, since you were more of a consumer than a farmer for a long time, has your mind shifted? Do you understand agriculture better? Are the things that, lessons you have learned in that growth, now being a farmer yourself, that you would share with consumers, someone in Atlanta or Indianapolis or Boston or New York, that won't be able to make that change that you've made? What would you say? What have you learned, and how could you share that? When I worked at Caterpillar in Illinois, I asked, why do they let the corn get brown in the field? I mean, I did not understand. I mean, that is how far removed from agriculture I was, and now, obviously, I understand that. I've learned that. That's good. You asked what I've learned. That's a good story. Just being able to be in the position that we are is amazing. You know, the percentage last night, there are so few, less than 1% of the United States' farmers. There's a little bit larger, talking hobby farmers are part-time, but full-time get your income from farming. Right. Or ranching. Yeah. So, you know, we have a difficult job to get our, help consumers understand what we do, and that's one of the things that I am, you know, hoping to see from companies like Corteva is, and I had no idea how much you guys were focusing on, not only on the customer, but on the consumer, and I think that that is wonderful, because that is a focus that I feel like, as a farmer, that I want to focus on the consumer and be able to provide them with a product that they want, right? I don't, you know, I mean, I want to make sure that what I am growing in the field is something that a consumer, is something that a consumer wants. So I think it's wonderful that Corteva is making the effort that they are. And then also, you know, obviously women. We're the ones that go to the grocery store. We're the ones that feed our families and make sure, you know, and we are the ones making the choices of the food that we provide for our children. And I think 70% of women make food decisions, whether it's what restaurant you're going to go to, what you're going to buy in the store, what you're going to feed your kids in the U.S. and around the world, somebody's even higher because men are not as engaged as they are in the U.S. So I think it's at least 70% are making decisions on food choice. And so we have such an opportunity to show what it is that we do to our communities. In our local community, we're involved with the Boys and Girls Club garden, a garden project that they have there. So, you know, just getting out and just helping kids to understand what is agriculture. The food does not come from a grocery store necessarily. I mean, getting these kids involved and harvesting the food from the garden is a really neat experience. What are your girlfriends that didn't think of you being, you know, a farmer or involved in agriculture? Did they give you a hard time? Oh, my gosh. That is a wonderful question. It's really relevant. Actually, you don't know this, but I actually just met with my girlfriends from high school less than a month ago. We got back together. It was our 20-year high school reunion. We didn't get to go to that, but we got together. And they're like, what is it that you do? I don't understand. You know, what is it that stuff grows in the field? And they're from Ohio. You know, I mean, it's growing around them, but they don't understand. You know, so it was really, really cool for me to be able to tell them what I do, where our product goes. You know, we're lucky that we have been able to get into some distillery business in Kentucky. And so, you know, we can actually say, you know, go. They understand that part. Exactly. Look, this is what we do. So, yeah, it's a wonderful question. I'm really glad you asked that, because I'm like, oh, I have a good answer. Thank you, Stephanie. Katie, I want to shift a little bit, because in your job, having been involved and working for members of Congress before myself, I know that your district, although it's an ag district, your members are on the ag committee, you have non-aggies in your district as well. Yep. How do you deal with, and we won't talk about your boss, but how when you, those questions come up and you're trying to convince that, you know, a member should be on the ag committee, support for farmers is important, what's happening in trade matters, what happens with tax bills matters to farmers. I mean, how do you kind of balance that? And then it's a family issue for you as well. Absolutely. We look at it from an economic perspective a lot of times, because majority of these communities, whether they realize it or not, are built on a foundation of agriculture success. And Kansas is a great example that when commodity prices started slipping, and then, of course, oil prices also affected us, but a lot of these communities saw it, and they saw it in their grocery stores, they saw it in their hospitals. And so we talk about the ripple effect of the agriculture dollar, and I think, if I'm correct, it's for every dollar spent downtown, every $1 spent by a farmer in downtown small-town America is about $7 ripple effect across the economy. And so when you put it into dollars and cents terms, those people start understanding real quick that you need to keep the people on your periphery alive and well in order to keep your downtowns alive and well. The majority of our district, which is 63 counties in Kansas, is very rural. It is very sparsely populated. And so whether or not you're working directly on the farm, you're impacted by the success of the ag community, because we all, as farmers, purchase equipment, we purchase supplies, we also purchase groceries. And if it's a good year, we purchase an extra pickup, and if it's a bad year, we don't go on vacation, and we aren't using the movie theater quite as much. And so we talk a lot, and this has been a good opportunity with writing the Farm Bill currently, to talk about the Farm Bill and how judicious we are with our dollars when it comes to helping the farmers through the crop protection program, crop insurance programs, and some of the other commodity programs. But we really do try to preach that the ripple effect of the ag community is greater than anybody realizes. And for those community leaders who have been around for a lot of years, they get that. It's the newer people to town that just kind of say, you know, not a big deal. But 60% of the Kansas economy is agriculture-dependent in one way or another. So it's huge for us. Wow, thank you. Karen, you told us about a lot of things that you do with consumers already, but one thing that interests me is you're talking about your voice on the radio. So you are reaching a broader audience than maybe some of us have the opportunity to. Tell us about how that came about and what is your goal? Obviously, you're talking about your business, but you're using that platform to reach not only customers, but maybe consumers. Right. So a lot of our business messaging, of course, is done through marketing. We have a service. We have a lot of competitors in the field. So we have multi-branch competitors that are run and operated by big corporate businesses and also producers of ag products. So we are not a manufacturer of products. We are a distributor of products. So we're a little unique in that. But, you know, I was born and raised in the same rural community that my father was born and raised in. And I went to the same school that he went to and I had the same first grade teacher. Small towns, yeah. And, you know, that's not something you can easily replicate anywhere else in the country today. But by good fortune, I also attended the first one-room schoolhouse that he did in first grade. But, and my sister was missed out on a lot of those opportunities. But my first grade teacher, she still is a big, big person in my life. And she was a big person in the community. So it's not only just by necessity. It really is a passion for me. I, as, when I became CEO of the nonprofit foundation, I spend probably 100% of my time in the community. I'm in my car. I am talking to people all over, whether they be in Tulare or Madeira or Merced or, or Bakersfield or Fresno or Readley or Selma or Orange Code. These are all little tiny rural towns in our communities. And the more I talked, I became more and more frustrated with the disconnect. And, and then I thought, I would tell people, and I'll say this to you too, I encourage you when you're buying, going to the grocery store, to just stand in the produce section quietly for about five minutes and observe people's buying habits. Because as I did, I made it a regular thing wherever I was. And what I noticed really became quite clear. And that was, is that, well, Jim, people will say that they trust the American farmer, but I don't think that that's very accurate. Consumers buy by price. You know, you go to a Whole Foods market and they very clearly have it marked what country that product came from. I mean, you don't have to get the microscope out to read the little tiny Q&R label on it that says it was made and grown in Mexico. And there's certainly nothing wrong with that. But consumers are driven by price. And the second thing they're driven by is organic. They will pay a higher price for organic goods. And that's what I was noticing. If you went to a Whole Foods market, organic goods moved, right? In my, I go to Safeway. Safeway can't sell. There's still today a very small section about this big that's organic. You go to Costco, half of the produce section today is organic products. And it's a myth, there's a disconnect. Consumers believe that organic products do not use pesticides. So I was born, yeah, I was born and raised in, you know, the most productive agricultural region in the Valley. We grow over 400 specialty crops. They're not grown anywhere else in the world. Okay? We produce 50% of all fruits, nuts, and vegetables for the world. And yet 15% of everything we consume is imported from another country. And that really bothered me. So I began talking to educators, specifically, as you said, FFA and 4-H instructors, about their experiences with their students. And what they said is, you know, they don't know. So when we went into a classroom, and I have a friend, and we did a cotton. We taught cotton, right? And one of the first things she said to them was, is, so do you know what cotton is? Nobody in the room knew what cotton is. Raise your hand. Not one student raised their hand. They didn't know what cotton was. She said, so what is your shirt made of? Shoulder shrug, right? She says, let's look at the label in the back of your shirt. Okay, what does it say? It says cotton. Do you know what cotton looks like? Do you know we grow cotton? That kind of was the spark for kind of my adventure, you might say, into ag literacy. We produce and sponsor a program produced by our Valley PBS station. It's called Valley's Gold. Our Farm Bureau president goes out and does 30-minute segments, and he visits farms across the valley, producing everything from aquaculture to nuts, right? We've been to tomatoes and garlic and cotton and dairy, and we do it all. So we've been producing. This is our fifth year producing this segment. There are 13 episodes in every one. You can stream them live. I would encourage all of you to visit one of the segments, maybe something you're specifically interested in. They're actually quite good, given though they were produced locally. In conjunction with that, we sponsor and underwrite another program called Valley's Gold Education Through Agriculture, and it's a program that is hosted by the National PBS Learning Channel where teachers can go in and they can actually download and create activities if they want to teach ag subject matter, and that all resonates from another. I'm also a great Google searcher, right? There was a study done in 1954 in Kansas about teaching relevant subject matter, and so as I go into schools and I tell them, you know, if you can make the connection because everybody has to eat, right? That's the relevant subject matter that actually they actually were able to prove that children had better enrichment experiences. In addition to that, we also fund video conferencing, live video streaming of teachers out of the Kings County Farm Bureau where we sponsor and underwrite a program by the Plant Foundation. It's called Farm Academy Live. Anybody anywhere in the world can stream live into their classroom. They send ag content and activities so that cotton is sent to the classroom in advance of the lesson. Teacher can see the classroom, you know, and vice versa. So they're really interactive, but we have currently about 200 classrooms across the world. A lot of classrooms use it, interestingly enough, not just to teach kids about ag, but they'll use it to teach children how to speak English. So we've gotten a double whammy on that. But I feel like there is a big disconnect. And one of the reasons is today you can go back to the grocery store, right? My best lessons come from the grocery store. Remember growing up, we could only buy fresh fruits and vegetables that were in season. Today, you know, I can buy a watermelon 365 days a year. Okay, my uncle farms in El Centro, in the Imperial Valley. We only had watermelons when they were in season growing up. Nobody would even dare to buy a watermelon in December because you knew that it had been in the grocery store for 90 days, right? And it probably hadn't been refrigerated either. But today you go to the grocery store and you can buy, you know, fresh tomatoes, you can buy fresh garlic, you can even buy grapes 365 days a year. So the variety and the plentifulness of fresh fruits and products, I think, really is another disconnect that maybe not only families have, but also children have. Thank you very much. You're right so much. The grocery store is a good tip. I think I'm going to see a lot of people in grocery stores stalling around the hovering... Stalking. Stalking is a better word. Thank you. Yeah. Well, I'm a people watcher, right? I think you can... You know, I love watching people and their reaction to things. I can oftentimes learn a lot about those reactions. But I said this at a very large conference and the room kind of chuckled, right? And later on I had a legislator call me and he said, you know, I went and did that. He said, I never even noticed that before. But he made a special trip to the grocery store just to challenge my theory, right? Well, I think it's a good challenge for us of the folks in Indiana. I was going to think you're a little weird, but I think it's great. Thank you, Karen. It's great. I wanted to shift just a little bit because I had a couple of questions and I am going to open it up for all of you. So be thinking about your questions that we have not covered yet. But a couple of things. Jim talked about how many young women are going to college and majoring in agriculture. I looked at Robin who has a freshman at Purdue and ag econ, right? Robin right here on the front row. Her daughter just started this process. What would y'all say to young women who are thinking about a career in agriculture, whether it's in policy or communications or an engineer or actually in agronomy or economics coming back to the farm? Laura, you have kids. So what are you telling your kids about? I know they're young, but what would you tell them as they think about college or some of these young folks who are entering college about careers in ag? I'm actually, because I do have a 14-year-old, he'll be 15 in October. And I'm actually, at this point in the game, I am not pushing college. I'm pushing, we have a very good junior college. That's within 45 minutes. That is actually focusing. They have a university farm. And so they are focusing on some of that stuff. We have a program in Missouri called A Plus. Through doing different things, you could get both years of that college paid for. So actually, I'm not, and I always thought I would. I thought I would push college. It was important to me that I went to college. I went to the university and majored in agriculture. And to me, that was very important. But I think we're seeing a shift. I think my kids need some type of formal training. I don't know if they need formal education at this point in the game. I'm not ruling it out. But I think there's definitely other options besides hardcore four-year university. I think that's a great message. I know that kids are really looking at debt. They're coming out of college with debt and jobs to be able to pay back their debt. They can't even afford a home because they're still paying tuition. So I think that's a great message. So this child would probably come back to the farm? Is that your anticipation at this point? We do. That is my goal. Good. I have... We don't know what the son would say, but that's your goal. Okay. I think so. I try to brainwash my kids into that. You know, go do live your life. Just come back home. You know, if you want to live, you know, a couple miles down the road, don't live right next to me. You know, but if you're within four or five miles, that would be great. That's terrific. Katie, what about you? Your kids are young, but what would you say to someone who said, you know, I don't have a background in agriculture, but I have a passion. Is there a place for folks like you in the future? I think so. And I think we almost need some more of that in our industry because I think I... One of the things that I brought to the farm was a lack of understanding and knowledge. And so I asked a lot of questions. And through that, I think I made my husband maybe think through some of the processes and some of the ways he was doing things previously. And so I encourage anybody who has a passion for agriculture and any piece of the whole industry to get involved. And I take what Lori said, and I double down on that because I do think that the four-year degree is not necessary anymore. We have a lot of technical jobs. I saw a report recently that the Midwest, about 75% of the open jobs out there do not require a four-year degree. And farming is a big piece of that. I know we need a tractor driver, someone who can run our technology and run our equipment, but doesn't have to have sat through a psychology class. But as far as getting women involved, I think the more the merrier. I think we bring a different perspective. We bring a different way of doing things. And I, at least in our part of the world, I do see more women getting involved and I see it becoming a more woman-friendly environment. I think by us as females encouraging other females to get involved. And I think that's both on the farm, that's in the co-ops, that's in, you know, the ancillary services. And then it's in all of the associations and groups that we're involved in. I think building those support systems and building a megaphone for female voices really will encourage other people to step up and take part in it. And we do have unique roles as being both mothers and farmers that we can speak to a different segment of the audience that our male counterparts just can't sometimes. Great answer. I want to shift just a little bit because we don't have a lot of time. I want to leave time for the audience. But Stephanie, knowing of your background as a mechanical engineer? Manufacturing. Manufacturing engineer. Better be careful. Rajon's going to be recruiting. I'm not kidding you. Do not talk to her afterwards. She's going home. But technology and the role that technology has played in your operation, we talked a little bit about, and Lori, we did, and others, about the automation and the data and just needing to know where every cent is being spent, making sure that you have good processes. Do you see the next wave of technology and the difference it might make in agriculture? And what is it made on your farm and how do you see it changing even more in the future? I mean, my job on the farm is working with our technology. So, yeah, I definitely, I've never, unfortunately, I've never known anything without it. I mean, we've always had the yield monitors and everything like that in the equipment. And I see, well, just my perspective, you know, just being able to understand how everything fits together in one system and understand, I mean, farming is not easy. I mean, I think, I don't remember who was talking yesterday, but about how even though it's not easy, we're not looking for something else. I think it was, was it, Teresa said that this morning, that we're, even though, I mean, we're not looking to go to another job. You know, this is what we do. This is, and so we have to, we really have to buckle down and make sure we understand our costs and, you know, make sure that we're doing everything that we can to conserve our most valuable resource in the soil. And so, to me, I think technology is the future of the farm. I think that it's something that, it's expensive. I mean, but in a lot of ways, I think it pays for itself and it has on our farm anyway. I've got one last question and I'll see who wants to answer this and then I will let everybody else. Can I just chime in? You probably can, Karen, of course. Yeah, so you'll discover I have an opinion on everything. Well, a couple of comments about your question. I would say that in visiting universities, I think we're still, in a lot of universities, training people for careers that will not exist when they graduate. And that really concerns me. But there is no broader field anywhere than agriculture. We need engineers. We need researchers. We need marketing people. We need business people, whether it be in finance or in economics. We need an educated workforce. The workforce in 2020 will look very different than it does today in 2018. And we've just seen like the tip of the iceberg with technology. We already have GPS tractors. In my little small town in Kingsburg, the most exciting thing is we have autonomous vehicles now doing all the spraying. We don't send people into the field anymore to do spraying. You know, we're on the cusp of something really great. Another one of my commercials is about if you love hard work and being outdoors, ag has a career for you. Okay? And it's absolutely true. And I don't care what your interest is. We have a job for you and we need you. And you won't find a job anywhere more rewarding than the product that agriculture produces and the impact it has on everyone's daily life. You know, another one of my messages is about veterans. And it's, no two people work harder than the veteran and the farmer. And they both are working for the same cause and it's to protect our freedom. And that's a message that's vitally important to this country today. A nation that can't feed itself is no more secure than a nation can. That's not a saying. That's absolutely true. I was watching the news this morning and they're reciting about, you know, a shooter you had. These are occurrences that are happening more and more. We can't become, you know, we can't just, we have to engage everybody we can on the importance of agriculture. Because if we begin to outsource our food, we're no longer a secure nation. And really, one of my causes is regarding the food bank. A lot of people have talked about Boys and Girls Clubs, which we work with, and whatnot, but the food bank. One in three children in the Central Valley struggles with hunger. And yet, we're the most productive agricultural region in the world. And yet, I have one in three children that goes to bed every night hungry. There is no excuse for that, right? We have, there is such a void and such an opportunity for agriculture. I would encourage everybody to consider, you know, engaging and advising their children and grandchildren that it's a very worthwhile career to pursue. It makes me want to plug our own garden. I see Heidi sitting there. Yeah. One of my first visits to this campus was to go out to the garden and I wanted to see that had okra. It's my favorite vegetable. Maybe not be everybody's, but we had some. I was pleased, but we have a relationship, a garden just right down the road here that we have a relationship with the food bank. And you're right, that is a way, not only to educate people, but connect to the community and address hunger and address hunger even in a country's bondage. One of my gardens is at the zoo. And it's overseen by the Fresno State Jordan Plant Science Club. It's their community project. We did all the work to put it in, but they oversee it. It's their community project. But it happens to be at a zoo. So it's a very friendly, demonstrable area, right? In all of the products, the students decide what they're going to grow. They work with the veterinarians as to what would be healthy for the animals that could be fed to the animals. Everything is picked, harvested, and it's fed to the animals at the zoo. So again, it's very interactive. It introduces the consumer. It introduces kids to just a place they naturally are drawn to, which is a world-class national zoo. That's great. I am going to get this in, and you all have to be patient with me. One of my titles, official titles, the Women in Ag is one that I just gave myself, but it's... Chief Sustainability Officer. Senior Vice President of Women in Ag. I like that. Yeah, right. I love it. It's Chief Sustainability Officer for Corteva. And I can do the whole thing, Agri-Science, Ag Division, or Del DuPont. I say it all the time. Because of recognizing the contributions as a company, we have our own footprint issues and making sure that we are good citizens wherever we are producing plants or have our facilities. But we also... We all believe in our company this ethic to help farmers be better stewards as well. So they can meet this growing demand from consumers, environmentalists, and others that don't understand really that we do take good care of the land and water and natural resources as farmers. So, Lori or Stephanie, one of y'all, answer about the pressures you feel from the environmental community or, again, consumers, citizens who just are not aware of you as a good steward and how we as a company can help you tell your story, help you have the tools you need to be sustainable. I think, as a fourth generation farmer, I put more pressure on myself than I actually feel from consumers because it is not my goal ever to have a piece of land be sold because we're not doing what we need to do to keep the farm going. So, it's a struggle as to how do you, I mean, somebody purchased land years ago for maybe $50 or $60 an acre and here I have a piece of land that's now worth $5,000 an acre, $5,000 an acre. How can I keep it sustainable? How can I keep it productive? How, what can I do to keep it in the family and keep it doing what it's supposed to do? Land has a purpose and we need that purpose just like Karen said to feed the world and so we can't, we can't, we can't risk, I guess, we can't risk it not doing what it needs to do. So, there is pressure from consumers for sure but as a farmer it's as much me, you know, putting that, that pressure on myself. I don't think I've ever heard a better answer. I really don't. That, that is a great answer and I've asked this question many times. Well said. or I am going to hush. It is your turn to challenge these women and hear more of their stories. We have folks with mics, I think, so raise your hand. Here's one right now. Great. Excellent. Thank you all. Dr. Horace Beck, I was wondering, you mentioned the four-year degree. If I wanted to take tuition money for four years and try and get in a farm, how far would that go? I think all of your several generation farmers, so. Where are you going to University of Georgia? How do you break into farming if you don't either grow up in it or marry into it? That's a great question. How can we help with that? Do we have any, do we have any female farmers here that have done that, that have broken into it? Because it's not easy. No. No, it's not. It's almost impossible. And it's not something that you, probably as a female on your own, can go to a banker and say, I need, you know, $50,000 to farm. Anybody in the audience done that? Right. As well, I see a hand. I want to, yeah. Go away. Right to the mic. Here it comes. Sorry. Okay. So, me and my husband last year. Tell us your name, what you do. I'm in customer service. So, I actually grew up on a farm. My grandpa still farms. We didn't get that land. Obviously, he's still using it for his income. So, I work off the farm. Last year, we bought land. Land is expensive in Indiana. Oh, yeah. So, with buying our land, we actually had to partner with the FSA office. We had to partner with the bank. There's a lot of paperwork that goes into it. We had to do a business plan for multiple years. And so, we have 50 acres that we're starting with. That 50 acres will turn over and hopefully help us buy a little bit more and a little bit more. Last year, we put beans on it. The prior owner hadn't been putting nutrients back into the land. So, we did really bad yieldage. 30 acres or less. That doesn't help. So, this year, any income from last year went straight into putting nutrients in for our corn this year. We're lucky that our corn looks amazing this year. So, where did you get your seed? we are a pioneer family. seed. And, we're lucky that we have also great customer service with our rep. So, that keeps us around. It is hard. It's not simple. we have a $60,000 operating loan and that $60,000 does not cover everything. So, I obviously do work off the farm. So, I support our family while my husband tries to make full-time farming a full-time gig. It's not easy. It's a lot of pressure. Thank you so much for sharing that. That's great. Land, oh, sorry. Land prices are very volatile in that in one part of the nation it'll be completely different than another part. Where Katie's from, especially some of the dry land or if it's got center pivots on it, irrigation type systems completely changes the value of it. It's very, you can't take a $40,000 college tuition and expect to go buy 400 acres. And in California you couldn't buy one. Yeah. Wow. And with water, I might add. Here's a question. I'm Rhonda Ham. I'm in our community investment group. So, my question is have any of you run into a situation where parents are actually discouraging their children from going into agriculture because they have a bad association. I'm from the Central Valley so I know the situations you have there. That's kind of I was leading that but I'll open it to anybody that has that experience. But just with the diversity of background in that community and there are some negative associations with what migrant farm workers, et cetera, say, no, you shouldn't go into agriculture. So how do we help with that messaging? So what I hear a lot, so I'm from the Central Valley and of course immigration is a hot topic all the time, right? And so you'll go into high school, I work with a lot of the local high schools and they'll say that when you're trying to do an ag program, you know, they say, well, the parents say, yeah, well, the parents don't because it's hard work. It's backbreaking. It's 365 days a year, 24-7. This is not an easy task, but then when you go and talk to the kids without their parents, it's the only thing that is what they want to do. They relish doing what their grandfather did. They relish their grandmother. They relish those visits and the time they spent on the farm. Again, I have to reiterate, farming today is not farming like it was in 2015. You know, in 1835, 100% of the world population was in agriculture. Okay? In 1925, 50% of that world population was involved in agriculture. Today, in the United States, it's less than one. Okay? So, jobs have changed. Now, when I say 1%, they're talking about the farmer, they're not talking about all the people that are engaged in farming, whether that be an equipment manufacturer, or the grocery store, or even your natural resources, which are counted in that ag number of ag farmers, right? People that are logging and doing industry like that. So, what I would explain to them is farming today is not, go Google the word Gus. He's the autonomous vehicle I was talking about. And show them that photograph. All those kids will want to do, my grandson, who's two and a half, is all into anything that's a big truck, right? Okay, I stood at the World Ag Expo for 40 minutes just watching Gus go up and down a demo, you know. It's mind-boggling that you could do that, right? And I've seen, we see these big harvesters that are GPS harvesting. This is, these are things kids want to do and they can do them very well. And we should encourage them. But again, I don't think our consumers are very informed about what farming is, particularly in California, in the Central Valley, because they're told about an immigrant farm worker who's not being paid a fair wage and is taking the job away from an American citizen. And that's not the real story. Thank you. Other questions? I'm monitoring an online, the Mentimeter here, and so there's some questions on the thing here. So I'm going to just kind of paraphrase a little bit, but one of the questions is, what do you need from Corteva in the future that could revolutionize what you do today? Crystal ball. All right, that's top of the list. Okay. Well, I would encourage Corteva to be an advocate for agriculture. I don't think it matters. The importance of the work that you do. You have some, we all have something very proud of, right? We feed the world. Okay? If the world, the population today is, you know, is seven and we're going to be nine by 2050, 2050, food is going to be the most important thing in everybody's life. To send a child to bed hungry is not acceptable. We have a great challenge ahead of us. Population's growing, there's going to be less land to be more productive, productive, and we need to step up to the forefront and be able to challenge this. We need to be able to form more healthy, vibrant food. We need to enrich, cultivate our local communities. You know, Lori's community is probably the most important community in the United States today. It's that small, rural America. And it's where our food comes from. It's where Stephanie comes from. We cannot forget that, you know, all the messaging comes from, you know, our media centers, Atlanta, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, that's not where food is produced. Food is produced in small-town America and rural communities where the hardest working people you will ever meet, the best people you will ever want to know, everybody is family and friends. That's America and that's where our food is grown. And we need to be able to tell our story better. We all need to be able to tell our story better. Social media gives everybody an opportunity to share just that special story. It might be somebody you just met in the grocery store talking to in the produce section. What did they say to you? You know, share that story. Share that story. But we don't brag enough and we don't share our story enough. None of us do. Whether it's about our grandkids, my grandkids, or they told you, my grandson, he is going to preschool and my husband tells everybody he's teaching the class calculus, right? But we should be bragging. We should be bragging about everything we do. My dad always said farmers are kind of quiet, solitary people and they are kind of quiet and solitary people but they're the best. They're the nicest people. If you need a helping hand, you call a farmer and they will be there. Okay? They will be there. They won't ask why. They won't ask how much it's going to cost. They'll just, they just, they're there. They're there. I think if I could add on, you guys are the experts behind the seed, the crop production services and what we need from you guys is the expertise and the transparency to talk about what you're doing and why you're doing it because we are the ones that are putting it in the ground, spraying it on our crops but if we don't understand the technology that's gone into it, the methodology that's gone into it, the chemicals that are in it, it's hard for us to then tell our consumers, tell our neighbors what's going on and I think we learn the hard way with the GMOs of if we get too far behind this technology, we're too secretive about it, we aren't transparent with what we're doing and why we're doing it, it quickly becomes a narrative that's out of our control and I know you guys are working hard on the CRISPR method and I think that is really cool technology and I've already seen a lot with your guys' names attached to it talking about what it is, why you're doing it, how it's different than what we've done in the past and that's great because I can look at that and say look, the people in the labs, this is what they're saying about it and I can use your expertise and your understanding of the product because that's not my forte at all to then relay that to the consumers and talk about the impacts and the positives of what we're doing and why we're doing it. Great message. Both of you have very good messages and I think good challenges for us as a new company, that's a high bar, you know, it really is so that's good. Anybody, either one of you on the ends want to add to besides the crystal ball, Lori? We got that. I would second the technology and the trying to approach it differently. I do think that the CRISPR-Cas is something that is going to be in the future, obviously, and you all know a lot more about it than I do, but being able to educate us so that we can educate consumers and, I mean, the fact that you are going to be having a consumer panel, that was really neat for me to hear that today, you know, understand what they want because I do agree that the GMO thing is, you know, probably could have been done better. We would all agree. Yeah. Question on here in the middle. Oh? Thank you. Hi. My name is Susan Gentry and I'm in our global supply chain. As we've brought the company together, we've been trying to clarify our customer satisfaction metrics. And so I'm interested in your perspective because I want to ask the customers, really, how do you measure your suppliers and how can we do that better? Wow. Good question. Very good. Anybody? I'm not answering. Y'all have got to answer. Question. It's okay. Be honest. What were you asking? We value service. And that's one thing when you come on our farm or you need seed from us, you're going to get our best service. So to know that because we have, we may have growers that only have 100 acres. We may have growers that have 3,000 acres. And we want to treat them all the same. And some of the ways that we do that is with service because we can't always do that with price. Even though we'd like to do that with price. But we can't afford to do that with price. So service is very important to us. Finding a way to get the best product out at the best price where everybody wins is important to us too. I'm going to add another component to your question because I think consumers measure things differently. So whether my customer, so my customer satisfaction I think is measured in a number of different ways. And one of it is with social responsibility. How much is given back into the community and how we engage community in that, right? And I think not only employees value that but I know our customers value that as well. We're a very aggressive, you might say, person in philanthropy on two sides. So we do have the nonprofit foundation which is operated separately. But in addition to that, the corporation as well is very philanthropic and gives, supports and underwrites numerous programs whether it be FFA scholarships or scholarships and tuition for college and university students whether it's for a 4-H club. People value those things because it impacts their little local communities. We support and underwrite gardens at churches, you know, at private schools. But I think social engagement that you're interested in more than profit. Service, of course, is the highest bar and I would assume everybody is given the best service. Job one, or you wouldn't be in, I wouldn't be in business today for 70 years, right? If I wasn't giving great service. But I think what sets us apart and what we're always acknowledged about and as a matter of fact, the Environmental Respect Award itself goes to that. And it was given to us for our community involvement. We do set the bar very, very high. We have a whole department in-house and they're part of a marketing team but they are very engaged, hands-on people that are in classrooms. If you need a teacher in a classroom, we conduct visits on our site. We provide visits. We do boot camps. We do trainings for students that just might be curious about what a crop retailer looks like, right? or something specific we do. We might bring a tailgate training, an OSHA training to your classroom and show you what's required to be out in a field. But I think being visible and enriching the community, and this isn't just me talking, it's really, truly something everybody believes in. But you've got to remember in small town America, our employees, our team members, are all part of those communities. And reinvesting and creating a legacy for the future for them is as important to us as reinvesting and creating a legacy for our company. And they go hand in hand. One is not going to exist without the other. Good advice. Very good advice from both of you. Thank you. Online, is there a question? I'm getting several and this is great. We appreciate everybody online that's submitting questions. I'm going to combine a couple. One is, what are any specific challenges you all have faced as a woman working on a farm that's pretty much dominated, the industry that's dominated by men? And the second is, what worries keep you up at night when you think about the next five years and how farming is going to change? Who wants the first part of that? I just want to quickly add that if there's some point that the other farmers are saying, you know, audience that you want to add, please feel free to raise your hands and we'd like to get your perspectives as well. Yes, good point. Right now, Missouri is in a drought and we started off already dry. So we can't always worry about what we can't control and we cannot control the weather, but the drought is going to affect us for years. We came into it already behind in the winter. In the fall, we were very dry in the fall. We did not get any moisture in the winter. Our first good snow was on Easter, which is April 1st. And I mean, it was a wet, heavy, heavy snow and it still maybe brought, what, a tenth or two of moisture. I mean, that's the ratio of snow to rain. So that is what's keeping us up a little bit at night and how we are going to continue to do what we do because water is so important as we see California. Water, you can grow more crops in a wet year and floods than you can ever grow in a dry year. Yeah, I think much of the country and around the world if you talk to people around the world, they will say water should be the world's number one concern. And, you know, whether you're talking to somebody in Jordan or somebody in rural California, the reliability of water. So having water is one part of the puzzle. Reliability of water is another. And I think also having policy makers that don't understand these things is worrisome and what keeps me up at night because they're making policy decisions that they really don't understand the repercussions of. And so when we look, when we try to isolate a problem and try to solve the problem, most people are really not looking at the ripple effect of that. And so what I always say is sometimes we concentrate too much on the ants while the elephants are, you know, approaching. And that's kind of the way I feel sometimes about our regulators is they're concentrating so much on the ants because they're biting and nipping and yelling the loudest that they're forgetting the elephants are coming. So... I was just saying I'm on that one down. Well. To go back to the question about the challenges of being a female in farming, I mean, when I came to the role or to the farm and the role that I am now, there really were not any females. But I kind of had an advantage because I was a female in manufacturing. And so that is, there's very few of those also. And so I guess for me, I didn't, you know, I was able to overcome the challenge. And the thing that I think is wonderful is being able to network and have a community of women in farming and what you all are doing here and seeing the number of women here is really amazing. And I think that, you know, there's no reason that we can't do, you know, anything that a man can do. And yeah, I had to, you know, I had to earn respect. I mean, for sure. It was not something that they just looked at me. I mean, obviously I had a lot to learn about agriculture. And I think earning respect and, you know, being willing to learn is a really, you know, important thing to do in trying to continue in this business because it is hard. I mean, we are dry also. I mean, it seems like the corn belt is not, but we are dry. And it definitely makes things difficult. And that's, you know, as far as keeping stuff up, keeping me up at night, that's definitely one of the things. Any of our other guests have there anything that you want to add to either portion of that question? Your seed sales rep in central Missouri. And the area that we're in is a very, very small community. I mean, the county is like around 4,000 population total. It's a lot of small farmers. Probably the average farmer is probably 65 male. A lot of them about to retire. And for some of those, as a seed sales rep, I came right out of college into there. I think if I didn't have a family association with it, it would have been a lot harder to knock on somebody's door because they wouldn't take you serious. like I had decal brought in a girl straight out of college, came out of St. Louis and we were doing a harvesting of corn plot. And she rode with the customer and then later on we all kind of dispersed and he came up to me and he's like, I don't think you have anything to worry about with her. She asked me how I wash my combine and that was the only question she had. Oh, wow. It's got quite the uphill battle to kind of fight and earn respect. And I feel like as a woman you kind of, you got to earn it a little bit more but it really, if you have that family behind you, it helps but there's still a long ways to go. That's great. That's good input. Very good. We're getting close, believe it or not, to the bottom of the hour. A couple more questions if we answer them quickly. Maybe one more good one. Who has a burning question? Pressure is on. I'll tell you. I'll let you know. I'll let you know. I'm an area leader here in Indiana and East Illinois. Manage both Car Protection and the Pioneer brand. My question to you, I know I've read some of your bios, very fascinating and great backgrounds. A lot of you are involved in, some of you are involved in other women organizations or networks. Can you talk to that a little bit if you are and maybe the value of those things for you? That is a good question. That's a great question. I'll start. I'm actually in a women's only peer group. There are eight of us from spread out, I mean, I don't know, still mostly Midwest, but going down to Mississippi all the way up to Indiana. And we get together twice a year and we, I mean, really have formed a bond and have, you know, are there to support each other. And it's something that I'm really glad to be a part of and can ask the, you know, the questions, feel comfortable asking questions to them and, you know, understanding what they're going through. I mean, we know, you know, if you're with the people that you are doing similar things to you is what you are, it really helps. So that's something that I'm involved in. I'm involved in a couple of different things. I'm involved in a group called Common Ground Kansas. Common Ground is a national organization with different chapters throughout the state. That's been a really great group because it takes the mission of mothers speaking to mothers and so it's the women to women connections. And I found it to be a very good opportunity to connect. We've stood in grocery stores before and, you know, we've gone to ball games and we've, you know, we've done a lot of demonstrating that, you know, your pop can is about the amount of actual crop protection products that we put on, you know, an acre of field. So a football field basically. So good networking there. I need to put a plug in for Annie's project. That was one of the first steps into the ag world that I received. I was still engaged to my husband at the time and that was a deep dive into agriculture but a great opportunity to connect with women through all spectrums of the ag community. And then I think my final piece is Kansas Farm Bureau and while it's not a women's only organization, they've really, I believe, done a good job of harnessing the power and the voices of a lot of the women in the state of Kansas and given us great platforms to then move into other agriculture organizations, commodity groups and whatnot. And so they've provided a great platform for us and I think largely because we have stepped up and taken advantage of those opportunities. They're there and so we carve out the time to take advantage of those. And so we have women in Kansas who are serving on national boards and doing great things all because they started with Kansas Farm Bureau. So those are my three passionate areas. I am lacking. And I'm not. And I need to maybe reach out a little bit more but I also know it's hard being a female farmer and finding other females who do as much as I do. Other roles, everybody has their role and we need everybody to do those roles to get the farm to work. But if I sit down and I talk with another female, her role may be completely different or her husband and my husband, we may be in competition for land, for seed. There's a lot of seed dealers where we're at. You know, everybody wants to sell seed because of the advantages of it. You know, your own discount, the revenue income. And so I don't know if I have a lot. Now I do. Now you do. Yay. Now I do. It's kind of a different animal in a very small rural community. I don't, I think some of the other ladies might agree too. And that's sad for us because we should be able to talk. We should be able to talk prices. What are you paying for your seed? How are you doing this? What are you finding works? What doesn't? But sometimes it's a very competitive field in what you actually do. Karen, you have thoughts? Well, I'm involved with an organization. It's an extension of the land-grant colleges and the Ag One Foundation called Common Threads. And for 25 years, we honor women and we've been honoring women in agriculture, whether it be through the Cal Poly campus, the Fresno State Jordan College campus, or UC Davis. And I will tell you the stories of women. We've honored women that are, we have a woman that is still living. She's 106 years old today. We honored her when she was 90. She's a fifth generation farmer, right? And she didn't start out by being a farmer, you know, let's be honest. But of course, her husband died young and she was there to carry on and her grandson is still farming that land today. But there are incredible stories. I guess I spend the majority of my time maybe talking more to men because I think they need to know that there are women out there. And of course, as John, you know, we see more and more female sales reps come into our office. And I will tell you, they are the smartest, brightest people you will meet. They are the cream of the crop. My daughter is a graduate of NYU. She was a performing arts major and she has also a degree in journalism and 50% of her classmates were recruited to be pharmaceutical reps. As with this story, if you talk to UCLA and their journalism and performing arts departments, because they're smart. They're attractive. They're smart. They're hardworking. And they just really are admirable people to work with, right? They have busy lives. You know the saying, busy, if you want something done, find a busy person, right? There's nobody any busier than a young mom today. You know, and they are working, they're working two jobs. They're going home. They're great moms. They're very involved in the community and their church. And they are, they're great representatives of any company. But I think you'll see a growing trend. Like I said, I think I spend more of my time with men. We were talking about Rotary earlier. And my Rotary Club was maybe one of the early clubs to maybe welcome women. And I was not their first member by any means. But I would still say the club is the majority of men. I'd say 30% female. We're trying to grow the club and do the younger. I think that, my Rotary Club might be like farming because our average age of our club is over 60. And we are trying to grow the, you know, the 30 to 40 year old. And we've seen a lot of growth in that. It takes time in cultivating and welcoming those and understanding that their needs are different. They're driven by different things. Women are motivated by different things than men. different. But they certainly are not afraid of hard work. Great question. Great answers. Thank you. Thank you all. We are one minute over. The clock, I'm looking at the clock. First, I want to thank this panel and the other women who came. This is the first time we have done this. We've had farmer panels. We've had customer panels. We've had women involved. We've never had, at least I'm told this. I'm new to the company, but I'm told this. All female farmer panel and women involved in agriculture. So it's the first but not the last. As I said last night, I assure you, I think we all learned from all of you. Thank you all for, again, for taking time away, for sharing your thoughts, for being honest, encouraging us on transparency, encouraging us to have these kind of dialogues. I think we all learned something for you. Thank you for the audiences here and at our other sites. We really appreciate it. And I want to just make a plug for the company again, something we're doing on October 15th. Does anybody know what day that is? It's the International Day, UN's International Day, honoring rural women. So it's women from villages, from towns, from farms, from ranches. We're going to spend just a few minutes on that day recognizing the hard work and the contributions of those women. So we have a series where we're going out and talking to women farmers, women in these villages and towns and farms and ranches on the land. So remember, October 15th, we'll continue to engage with women around the world. But we really appreciate your thoughts and really advice today and comments. We value you as customers for what you do, but also as friends. So you have your network now, Lori, I'm telling you. You have your network. And thank all of you, everybody who came. So thanks very much. Thank you all so much. Thank you.
