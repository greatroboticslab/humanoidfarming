 Hey everybody it's Ryan. Welcome back to Howl Farms Work. We've got the 4640 here and it is hooked on to the Kuhn FC4061 TCD and we're gonna go mow some hay today. So Travis already left with the 7600 and the John Deere mower so we're gonna be heading down there as well and mowing to help them try to mow faster. So we had a mower just like this last year. It's pretty much the exact same mower. The difference is that this one has a impeller on it instead of a roller. So using an impeller is typically better for grass which is a lot of what we do. Typically we do more grass than alfalfa. However I did like the performance of the roller last year. It's just that with all the hay down at the valley the impeller is more suited for grass because it's more aggressive whereas a roller is more gentler on the alfalfa. It's got broad leaves on it so it's more fragile. You're more likely to lose leaves with an impeller than you are with a roller. But the one feature that this does have is the two speed for the conditioner which is actually pretty nice. So this is a brand new mower. It's never been used. Nice new paint underneath. And we're gonna take it down to the valley and start mowing. So let's hop in the 4640 fuel it up and head down. Well this is filled in pretty good. Some of it with weeds but for the most part it's pretty good. I just got a text from Travis and he somehow got reception but he told me to go down and cut the upper bottom which he did the outside lap around so I know how far out I can go. It's kind of dangerous to open it up so that's why he used the John Deere because if something happens to it we'd much rather it be borrowing more. But he did the outside lap and I'm gonna cut everything on the inside now. So we're gonna head down into the bottom. I'm not totally sure where he's at right now. My guess is he's probably on the lower bottom which are a little bit separate because there's a wet spot like kind of like a creek in between them. But we're gonna pull down there and start mowing. There he is. You just barely see his flashing beacon. Which reminds me I gotta shut off the flashes on this. I actually haven't even fired up this mower yet which would have been smarter to do back at the farm. But I thought about it when I left. It's like it'll be fine. I'm sure it's fine. Right? It's not like it's Monday or anything. I'm not gonna adjust the mower yet. I'm going to leave everything set as it is. The wide angle kit on the back is set down. The shrouds are actually set in a little bit. I'm gonna run some through and see how it does. And then just go from there to adjust how I see fit. He's planning on coming through tomorrow and tedding it out. So I'm not too worried about getting it completely flat out. I want to be able to dry in between the windrows a little bit. So we're gonna fire this up and see how she runs. Yeah that's too narrow for me. Well that's fancy. Can you still run it with that? With the tire as all? I don't want you hitting the tire. If it's not hitting the tire it's nowhere close. I wish I could do it as wet as you can. I don't think it'd be that hard to remove. I think putting them in is the worst. You're supposed to drop it all through the hole. Yeah. I'm trying to decide if we want to take those shrouds out or not. Yeah we're gonna take them out. It's not that bad all you got to do is move the ends over to the holes and drop them out. Put it over. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Put it over. Lock to your socket on to loose my socket up and down the drain into two 공als. There. That's kind of good. There. It's not going anywhere. Did you get it? There you go. Wow. Steve. That's actually kind of nice. Oh, we're throwing it real wide now. There's a few things that I'm noticing on this mower that they updated from the one we had last year that I really like. The fact that those shrouds can be hung on the tongue is really nice. And the fact that they're about, I would honestly say that they're about half as heavy as they were last year. I mean, you don't struggle to pull them off like I did last year. So they definitely designed them to be lighter so that you can handle them easier. That's really nice. It's definitely a one-person job now to be able to take those shrouds out compared to last year. You can still do it one person, but you really had to struggle. It's doing a really nice job at cutting this. I think I like this more better than the one we had last year. It's basically laying it out as wide as I'm cutting, which is what we want. There's a little bit of space in between the rows, but just enough to let it start drying underneath. But there's not any moisture underneath the grass because it's been dry. Looks like it's doing really good. It's cutting off the grass at a good height, so I'm not worried about adjusting the height at all. It's taking that heavier material like a jam. Oh, man. That's a thick stop. There's the Kuhn windrow. And there's the John Deere windrow. He must have found something the more he didn't like. Okay. My own personal guess is that he found some barbed wire. And knowing from experience, barbed wire is not very fun to try to fish out of a mower like this. This stuff is so thick that it's wrapping around the PTO on the tractor. It's not because of the mower. But. I started to smell something funny. Look how compacted and shredded that stuff is. It's hot to the touch. We got it all cleaned out now. And I'd say that that was probably the result of that PTO adapter that we've got on there. That we've always had on the 46. It's never been an issue until now. The stuff just might be so tall that even after I'm running over the window windrow, it's sticking up through there and just catching behind that PTO extension, which you're not technically supposed to be using one of those PTO adapters. So even the Kuhn guy said that they make them with the large thousand for a situation like this. So we could have gotten one. Like this.

I mean, I keep playing pass the football with his knife. If I had thought about it, I would have brought mine. We just finished in the bottom. Now, we were just talking, and he's probably going to leave the field behind us until next month to let the new seeding grow in a little bit. But we still have this to do yet. And this is a 30-acre field. That one to the right is a 7-acre field. So, he's going to do a lap around the outside of that. Then I'm going to start doing the straight back and forth passes. It's currently 1 p.m., and using two mores really helps. I mean, we've had our own fair share of issues. For me, it keeps twirling up by the PTO. So, I think it's just because it's so thick compared to what it's been in the past. It's been thick before, but I don't know if I've seen it quite this thick with this tractor. So, all the grass is getting up underneath. And it's sticking through by the PTO, and it keeps getting wrapped. The mower's running really good. We adjusted the conditioner down so that it was forcing a little bit more of the material through those impellers. There's a handle over there on the right-hand side or left side that we're looking at. And we just dropped it down, and it just will force the crop to go through those impellers a little bit more. Two mowers. This field really shouldn't take that long. Again, he's going to be using the John Deere moor to do a little bit more of the hillsides and the stuff that we really don't want the 46 on. Seven acres to go. Travis is already working on it. Let's wrap this up. Let's wrap this up. Everything is now cut. I'm going to head back to the farm. Travis is going to be right behind me. I figured I'd leave a little earlier because the 76 can go faster than the 46 can. We'll probably get back to the farm about the same time. All right. We just got back to the farm, and that's a wrap for today. So overall, I really liked how this moor spread out the hay in the windrow. We took those shrouds out and hung them on the tongue. I really liked that. That's a really welcoming change from the model that we ran last year, as well as the fact that they're pretty much like half as heavy. So I really like that. The big thing that I really like about Kuhn's mowers are the quick change knives, and they don't require any electric impact or anything to take them out, especially if you have a problem in the field or a dental blade or something. All you got to do is just pull that tool off, and you can change out a knife in literally like 20 seconds. So we're going to use this moor, some moor going on. We're leaving that other field down at the valley for probably next month to let that new seeding grow up. But we're going to be spending the next week probably raking that up down there and gathering those bales in. So be sure to watch out for that. And yeah, that's pretty much it for this video.
