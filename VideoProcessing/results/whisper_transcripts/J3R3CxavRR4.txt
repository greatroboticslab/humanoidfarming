 Here's how we make whole grain mustard from wild plants. This week we stumbled upon a bunch of wild mustard seed plants ready for harvest. These seed heads are from wild field mustard which likely originated in Central Asia but now it's basically found everywhere in the world. The cultivated version of this seed is actually what is used to make canola oil but we use it to make whole grain mustard which is really nice to have when we're not buying food from the grocery store. It's pretty easy to separate the tiny seeds from the chaff using a strainer with holes that let the seed through. Then we grind it up to expose some of the yellow inside of the seed and make some mustard powder. We do like it whole grain though so we don't go too crazy. There's an interesting reaction that takes place when you combine crushed mustard seeds with water and it actually transforms it chemically to give it that spicy mustard taste. We usually let it sit for one to two minutes to react and then pour in some apple cider vinegar to stop the reaction. Finally we put it in the fridge for a few days and it's ready to go. It firms up and mellows out as it ages so if you find the flavor to be closer to wasabi let it set for a while longer and try it again.
