 This man is really talented. He brings a big bottle and makes big holes in it. In the next step, he selects a quantity of small onions and cuts off their tops. After preparing the onions, the man begins to pour fine soil into the bottle gently. Then he places the onions inside the hole, making sure that the cut part is facing outwards. After finishing planting the onions, he makes a hole in the middle of the soil, then prepares a plastic pipe that he has perforated on several sides to be used to water the plants. In a few days, the onions are ready to be cooked and reproduce quickly and continuously. I would appreciate it if you could like and subscribe.
