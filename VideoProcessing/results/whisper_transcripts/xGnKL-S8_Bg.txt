 There's a subset of carnivores, subset of health gurus out there that say you're gonna destroy your health unless you only eat grass-fed, grass-finished that's been only grazed on the slopes of the Himalayan mountains from the month of March to May. That's the only kind of beef you can eat. It costs $200 a pound. And also, I sell that. You can get a box from me once a month of that panda massage meat. No, no. Is grass-finished beef a little bit better than feedlot beef? Yes, it is. It's anywhere from three to 6% better with regards to the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio to the omega-3 profile. It's gonna have more vitamins and minerals, but is it a deal breaker for somebody who cannot afford $22 an ounce beef? No, it's not. We've had hundreds of people, Jesse, in our private group lose almost 100 pounds, if not more, eating the big five-pound sticks of the cheapest beef that you can buy at the discount grocery.
