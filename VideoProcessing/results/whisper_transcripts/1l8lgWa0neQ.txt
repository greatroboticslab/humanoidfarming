 Hi guys, my name is Mary Beth. Welcome back to the Cookbook Review. Today we'll be reviewing from Harvest to Home, a great seasonal cookbook with activities and recipes to really make the most out of fall. Use a lot of seasonal ingredients as well and really just some great ideas for just fun fall activities. So you're going to start off with the contents and it really kind of breaks down by fall month. So you can kind of do it themed if you want to. You can do some in all months, you know, move forward or backward, but definitely a lot of fun, a lot of cool ideas to do, and just kind of inspiration for the fall as we're moving, you know, into that season. Definitely a lot of things to plan and really kind of looking forward to those kind of cooler temperatures. So a great planning device if you're wanting to make the most of your fall and the seasonal ingredients and just the activities that are available for you. There are where there are recipes, there are a lot, you know, some really good pictures and some really good ideas of, you know, some things that you can do and really just some artsy activities as well if you want to do so not just a pure cookbook, but really kind of an all around just like activity book and things that you can do. So a lot of different avenues to use this year after year after you get into those three months.
