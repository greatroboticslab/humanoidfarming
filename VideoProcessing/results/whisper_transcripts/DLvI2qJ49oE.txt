 Here's a vertical garden idea to use empty fence and start growing food. This fence is on a semi-shaded area and I'm growing micro dwarf red robin tomatoes and they won't grow bigger than this. And to prevent the pots from drying out too quickly, I set it on a drift system. Any excess water will just flow at the bottom.
