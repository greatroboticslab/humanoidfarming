 What makes the tractor such an iconic part of agriculture? Well, for one reason, they're incredibly versatile and they come in all different shapes, sizes, and brands. Of course, we don't have time to cover everything here, but the tractor's uses break down into four main categories. First, one of the biggest jobs is to pull equipment around the farm and through the field. By connecting to the draw bar, or hitch, the tractor can pull wagons, plows, corn planters, or hundreds of other machines. But that's not all. While a tractor is pulling a machine, it can also power it. Called a PTO, or a power takeoff, this rotating shaft connects to the tractor so that the machine can do all kinds of jobs, from baling hay to spreading manure to hundreds of other things. But be sure to stand back while it's running. For jobs the PTO can't do, there are hydraulics. The tractor pumps high-pressure oil through hoses, which can move parts or lift heavy machines up and down. Some equipment doesn't even use the draw bar at all. It attaches to the tractor's three-point hitch, which includes these two moving arms and a center link. That way, the farmer can raise and lower equipment without any need for wheels at all. Of course, this just scratches the surface of the thousands of jobs tractors can do. But between the draw bar, PTO, hydraulics, and three-point hitch, now you know the basics. And that is the way it works.
