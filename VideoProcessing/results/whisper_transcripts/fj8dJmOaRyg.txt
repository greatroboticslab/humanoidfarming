 Music This session we're talking about the big picture of managing soil health with cover crops and going to go in a little more beyond the basics into some different physical and biological processes. I'm going to start with Ray Weil from Maryland. Ray's been working in the field of soil and cover crops for a couple years. I was asked to talk about physical effects of cover crops on soil physics. I really hate to have things segmented up that way. One thing that I've come to believe more and more over the years is how everything is integrated together and it's really hard to slice it up. So I'm calling it the biology and physics because usually those are considered to be sort of separate things, but we're talking about biological impacts on physics. As I was saying, I hate to separate soil science or any ecology into sort of disciplined slices like physics and biology or chemistry. And these are all very, very much interrelated. And as I've worked on my textbook over the years, I found that I'm always making cross-references between chapters and back and forth. And you really can't do one thing without another. I am going to try to stick to the physics topic and the impact of cover crops, which is biology on physics. And if we look at soils, there's a number of physical properties that cover crops impact. And amongst these are temperature, water, and then the architecture of soils, which is often called structure. Those are all physical sorts of things. But they also all interact. So the architecture affects how water moves in and out and is used in the soil. And the temperature affects that as well in terms of evaporation and the biological activity that affects physical activity. So the main thing here is they're all interactive. Let's talk about temperature just for a moment. Cover crops can have a major impact on temperatures. Of course, temperature impacts are mostly felt near the surface. There's very steep temperature gradient in soil. So as you go deeper, this particular data, Charlie isn't here, but this is some data that Charlie and I collected a few years ago. Went back when he was in Maryland. And this is data collected at seven and a half centimeters. So pretty near the surface, a little bit deeper than you might plant the seed. So this would affect your planting conditions for the next crop. That's one of the reasons why we're interested in temperature. But of course, temperature is a major driver for all the biological activity and mineralization and all that kind of stuff. And what you're looking at, these different colors, bluish color here is a mix of rye and radish. And these were planted in separate rows. So we had good representation of both rye and radish, at least in the fall. And then the radish died. This is data from early March to early June. So this is spring data. And the gap in the middle is when the crop was planted. And then we had to take the sensors out of the field and put them back in. So this is in late April here where there's a gap. And you can see that in both temperature and water there were major cover crop impact. The no cover is the purple. So that's a bare soil. And you can see they were wide. They have the same problem here. The buttons jam between two others. They're pretty wide daily fluctuations. But the impact of cover crop is on temperatures in the neighbor of 5 to 10 degrees on the average. So you can have 5 degrees centigrade is the big difference. It's almost 10 degrees Fahrenheit. So you can have very big differences. Now this is in terms of spring warming. But in terms of mid-summer when we're, you know, in spring we would like to get warmer temperatures so that we can plant earlier and get seeds germinated and get the soils to dry out. And then in mid-summer we're really interested in actually cooling the soil. So we've got two opposite agendas taking place. So you want to plant cover crops that do these things for you. That's one of the nice things about zoned cover cropping, alternate rows and that type of things. The kinds of things that Ron Morris was talking about with vegetables, if you were in his section, session, and some of the other folks were talking about with precision cover crop planting. I really think we want to, when we do these mixes, think about spatially separating the different functions. Because we want different things to happen. We would like the, you know, the zone right over where we're going to seed to warm up and dry down a little bit and get ready to seed earlier. But we would like the bulk of the soil between rows to be covered with the mulch and stay cooler and moister during the summer. Moving on from, so we can talk more about temperature if you have questions. I have a fair amount of data that we've taken over that. But I think that's fairly intuitive except that the impacts can be greater than you might expect. And of course the differences between living cover crops and dead cover crops is how much bare soil you have. Secondly, you start looking at the architecture of soil. There we can have really dramatic effects. And these can happen very quickly. Earlier on we were hoping to find things that we could show farmers and the farmers would notice within one to three years. A lot of these effects you'll see after your first cover crop. And certainly see them after a couple of years of cover cropping. So this is a pretty dramatic impact here. This is actually rows that have been in grass for a couple of years versus soil that's been kept mostly bare. And this particular picture is taken from a tree nursery where the tree rows where the trees were going was kept bare mostly by spraying. And the land in between the tree rows was kept under turf for traffic. And so within a couple of years you developed an enormous difference. In this case my recommendation, which never occurred to these nursery growers, to their way to put the trees in the same rows was you really have to take advantage of that soil you're building up and switch your, put your trees into the good soil and move it back and forth. But you can see a major impact and you can imagine the impact that that has on all of the other physical aspects of soils. This is mostly action of roots. So the old paradigm, which is still probably dominant in a lot of organic farming circles, is that if you think about biomass in almost all of them, all of the data that we've talked about today and yesterday, was all above ground biomass. I think all of the data we've been talking about has been that. And really cover crops do most of their work below ground. And we have very little data, of course, on below ground biomass just because it's so darn hard to get. One exception is with the nice tap rooted crop we can get an estimate at least of the fleshy root, which gives you some idea of partitioning, but it gives you no idea of the real structure of the root system, which is the point I wanted to make here. This is actually a radish root, but look at all the fine roots that we often ignore. If you just pull that radish up, you're going to get this nice clean daikon radish that you know, you could scrub off and put on the grocery shelf. I often take them home and eat them. But if you look at the entire radish root system, it has lots of branch roots and lots of fine roots coming off of that. So it actually has a very fine system that permeates the soil much more than the single root that you can kind of follow down. So mentally we're often thinking of this very limited root system for the tap root crops. That would be also true of other brassicas. This is Dave Brandt, by the way, showing me some of his structure out in Ohio that's improved so much over the years with his use of cover crops. So this relates then to the temperature and the root structure, then relates to what happens to water. So this is one of the main processes that we need to try to manage in soils. And certainly is really limiting to agricultural production and is the driver of environmental impacts, at least to water quality. Is what happens to water and soils. This is sometimes referred to as the genius of soil. Is how it holds and drives the hydrologic cycle. So here's a mixed cover crop. This is on Trey Hill's farm on the eastern shore of Maryland. We've got some triticale and some radish and some clover mixed in there as well. But it's what's going on below ground that really impacts this, both above and below ground. It's hard to overstate the impact that cover crops and soil management can have on this hydrology. We all know that the difference between a good year and a bad year in agriculture is almost always rainfall, how much you get and when it comes. And that's true in most parts of the world. Unless you're under irrigation in the desert, where you're controlling the rainfall. So water is usually what limits productivity and profitability and headaches and everything else. So if we can manage that, this will make an enormous difference. So Sord was telling us about the farmerhood, noticed how the bearing strength of the soil has improved with the use of cover crops and roots. And a lot of that has to do with the management of water. What cover crops do to where that water goes. And whether that's drying the soil out so that the soil gets a little bit drier and water moves on down rather than saturating the surface. That tremendously affects the bearing strength. So the physical strength of the soil, including the resistance to root penetration, is very closely tied to water content. And that's key to understanding how cover crops work as well. Because cover crops growing in summer will have a very different effect on deep architecture of soil than cover crops grown during the fall and spring. In the summer, the soil is almost always, through the profile, at field capacity or drier. It's moist to dry. It's not wet. Whereas in spring and fall, where there's very little evaporation, the soil gets saturated, it gets much wetter. That results in the soil being much softer, including compacted layers. And that's why the cover crops are able to penetrate where the cash crops can't. So your corn roots may be stopped by a compacted layer. But the cover crops can get through it because they're doing it when the soil is soft and wet. That's an important concept. So some of these processes, then, how the water is divided. The rainfall comes in. You get so much rain. So we get around here about 100 centimeters of rain a year. And what does that 100 centimeters do? The part we get in the summer, typically we get three or four inches, about eight to ten centimeters per month. And if we get that every month, that's enough to grow good crops. But if we lose 30, 40, 50 percent of that to runoff, as soon as you get a little bit of slope on the land, and it doesn't take much, two or three percent slope. If you don't have the capacity to absorb rain, if the rain comes in anything but a gentle shower, you get thunderstorms, like we get most of our rain in our growing season comes thunderstorms, we can lose most of that. So that's just the total waste and it causes water quality problems. So the cover crops really mitigate this and can have a dramatic effect on infiltration rates, both due to the protection on the surface. It's really instructive to take a farmer out to the field and compare bare soil or bare spot in a cover crop field, or a field that is tilled in the fall, and peel away a cover crop or crop residue and look at the difference of the structure underneath that. It's immediately obvious that there's going to be an enormous difference in what happens to the raindrop when it reaches the soil, whether it starts to runoff or not. So just, this was a real eye-opener, I thought this was great. I spent a week in Indiana this summer, in August. They invited me out to do a number of workshops for farmers in Indiana. If we're looking for a model of really good coordination, I think they had a really nice organization with an umbrella of Indiana cover crop conservation organization that was bringing the NRCS and conservation districts and Purdue University and Extension and all the different players together, industry. And they had these farm hubs, a little bit like what we heard about in Pennsylvania, and they really are quite effective in Indiana. They are really moving ahead in the area of cover crops and conservation in general. We went up with Dan DeSutter, some of you may, actually he should be pretty well known now. He was in the New York Times and probably some of you saw this cover crop article in the New York Times. And he was a farmer that was featured in that. So this is up in his plane, he's a fossil pilot in July, flying over his farm and neighboring farms in central Indiana, near Indianapolis. This is pretty flat ground, most of it's drained, tile drained. And guess which fields were the fields that were long term no-till with cover crops? Man, you know, they had a really, really wet early summer, spring and early summer. Things were drowning out. We had quite a bit of that here too. But they really suffered from that. And the difference between, this is conventionally tilled, you can see there's drainage in this field. No cover crops and no no-till. And just a tremendous difference in the color. These are just farm and all the neighboring farms. So the percentage is increasing, but that's still a pretty small percent that uses cover crops out there. A lot of that has to do with compaction that occurs both at the soil surface through the traffic. They can be mediated by tillage and frost, but often a lot of that compacted force moves on down. So we have a lot of subsoil compaction. And the result of that physically is to separate topsoil from subsoil. And almost all the data that we've been talking about and those 10,000 samples that the soil health people are planning to get, that's all, I'm not sure how deep they're going. I'm guessing probably 15 or 20 centimeters. Sometimes we go 30 and that's not always easy to do. And that usually gets past the topsoil into the subsoil. So we have to be a little careful about crossing that horizon boundary and mixing things together and taking an average. But we often get compaction down deeper in the soil. And this separates this topsoil from the subsoil. There's a lot going on down there. So compaction is a big issue because it physically impedes root growth, especially as the soil begins to get drier. And that just goes up dramatically. And that means that the roots can't get down into the subsoil. And a vast majority of roots in most soils are going to be in the top foot or less. And it's because of that, it's not because that's their natural rooting. You know, if you grow plants in a tube, you know, Steve's done that on his farm and that kind of thing. And you know, if you don't have a root restrictive layer in there, roots will go down very quickly to 6 feet, 7 feet deep and permeate, you know, it's the physics that's limiting the root growth. So if you think about the resources, the water is all in the subsoil. Water is a matter of, you know, maybe 10% of the volume of the soil is available water. So I think it depends on the texture. But whatever that percentage is, that means that it's the volume of soil that's available that's going to determine how well your crops can get that water. And then there's, we're finding out there's a lot of nutrients down there too. Organic matter and things drop off pretty dramatically, but there's still quite a bit going down. If you go down there. So this confection, of course, means water can't get through as well. And so you end up with ponding. And that's part of what happens when you have this low bearing strength is that you're restricting water movement so it gets saturated above that. And then you have this real wet soil that can't carry any traffic. When you break through that and allow the water to move down and the roots to move down, you've greatly improved. By reducing that extra water in there and moving it down to improve the bearing strength. You've got oxygen problems, aeration problems, which then feed into biology and the kind of fungal diseases and bacterial things and greenhouse gases and all that kind of stuff. Very much related to the physics. And there's a lot of other problems. And so how do you deal with this? We know that when you take a sample of soil and send it to a soil quality lab or something, you'll get very little information about this. Aggregate stability will give you a little bit of information about, about, you know, how well flocculated and aggregated the soil is. But very little about the gross architecture, which is really what's accounting for these dramatic effects of cover crops, like I showed with that drainage. That drainage is the macro pores that are taking that water right on down to the drain tile so you don't get those saturated conditions. So bulk density is the traditional way of looking at compaction almost by definition. And you take cores of the known volume and, you know, cut it off and take it back and dry it and get the weight or volume. That, that has its limitations. First of all, it's a field measurement. You have to take a sample correctly in the field. You can't do this on a sample that's been ground or sent to a lab someplace. And secondly, it can be very misleading. I had one experience in Ohio where they're doing a study and they're using radishes and they said, well, radishes increase the bulk density of the soil. Of course they do. You have big roots. And you're measuring the bulk density between the big roots. The soil got pushed away, right? But the effective bulk density of the soil has to include the holes where the roots were, which of course they didn't include, right? So this is some source data that he gave me some time ago. And if you measure bulk density from a fine rooted crop where you're getting a more comprehensive picture within a bulk density cylinder, you'll see that cover crops will impact bulk density and should lower it, especially under no-till conditions. Penetrometer resistance is another measure that's often used. You can buy these things with little dial. It goes from green to red. They're different types. This is highly dependent on water, but it will, if you do it when, you know, this is a good time of year to do it when the moisture is pretty constant, you're pretty close to fuel capacity. There's been some rain recently. You can use this to see some of what's going on. This is taking measurements every two inches through your profile, and you can see this clear plow pan effect that almost every ag field has. It's probably legacy, even if you haven't been tilling for a long time. Now again, if you come in and look at this, it's not going to be uniform. This is showing the differences over a field. And you can kind of see where the machinery comes in and out. That's where the gate was and where the traffic was. So, you know, one measurement's not going to do it. You want to be aware of those things. And as I mentioned, this is very moisture dependent. So if you want to sell a big tractor, you go out with one of these penetrometers in August, and you can show really high levels of, quote, compaction. But that, you know, you need to take that with a grain of salt. It's very moisture dependent in a way of measuring moisture. These are two bulk density curves as moisture changes, and the penetration resistance as the soil just dries off a little bit from about 30% to about 25%. You know, these curves go out pretty steep. And then different cover crops have very different capacities to push through soil. This is cereal rye. It's a great cover crop, but it is not very good at penetrating through compacted layers. This is a field, actually, in Bark, in Bellsville. We may see this field. I don't know. They used to call it a concrete field because it had been mismanaged for so many years. A lot of vegetables have been grown on it. A lot of tillage. And you can see how deep the roots went. You know, it was very impacted by this. This is sort of a bottom view when I turned it over. So these roots were just not going very deep at all. On the other hand, we planted some brassicas in that field. They could push right through it under the same conditions. So the kind of root system really makes a difference. Some interesting work out of Australia. Very little work, actually, on the physics of roots. But this is work done by a metro chair, who I happened to have had in a soils class in Malawi, Africa in the late 70s. He did his PhD in the 90s in Australia, and I still correspond with him sometimes. And they compacted soils. This was the uncompacted. That's the compacted one. And then they measured the penetration of roots through these compacted layers. And I took this data from a table and put it in a graph to make the trend a little more visible. And you can see that root diameter accounted for a lot of the ability to penetrate dense soils. Generally, the coarser rooted plants have more power. And he actually did some work with glass beef and stuff to measure the pressure that these roots could exert. So you can see things like fava beans and peas and lupins. These were not cover crops. These were crops. But you can see the rye grass, the wheat and barley, the fine root things just didn't have the capacity to push through. So we did some ground-breaking work on that. This was published in 2010 and 2011. We created very compacted conditions by driving over the field with heavy machinery when it was wet. Worst case, we created a compacted zone in through here. We're looking at rye, rake, and forage radish. This is the number of roots. This is the soil depth, 10 centimeters. You can see at the surface there were lots of rye roots, but the compaction really reduced that. And there were very few down in the subsoil, whereas the radish had about four times as many roots. And the canola was sort of in between. You can see this in the field. This was on a fairly sandy soil in fall, in October. And it was a very dry fall, and moisture was stressing the cover crops. So these are side by side. You can see the root, the leaves are all curled here in the rye. And this is in a very sandy soil. Without, you wouldn't think this was sort of a restrictive kind of condition. But the radish was just no moisture stress at all. The rye, even where they were planted together, was having a real hard time getting down to any moisture. So this bio-drilling is really one of the main things that we can do with cover crops. It's something that I've tried to study over the years. It's not easy to study. But we did show definitively that this, the idea that cover crop penetrating during the, when the soil is wet in the winter, will leave a channel that the crop root will then find. And these channels are fairly permanent. So this is a mini-rizotron. That's a fiber optic. Same kind of camera that they picture if you've got in the hospital. If you're over 50, you've probably had that done to you. It's not a very pleasant memory, but anyway. This is a rapeseed or canola root pushing through. If you look at the cracks, you can see we went back to the same spot. And this is, the other one was the soybean root in July. So that soybean root wouldn't be able to do it otherwise. The nice thing is that we find a correlation then between the amount of cover crop roots in the subsoil and the amount of crop roots the next summer. This is corn. We found the same thing for soybeans. You'll find this affects water use. So this green line dropping way down is corn water use at 50 centimeters, almost 2 feet deep, after forage radish as compared to after other cover crops or no cover crop. So the roots are getting down there and using the water. There is Steve, one of my favorite pictures, showing the impact on a dry period in the middle of the season with a cover crop and without a cover crop on water availability. Just want to mention, this is a graph, real quick, showing eight farms in Piedmont, eight farms on the coastal plain and the eastern shore. We've been taking quarters down to 7 feet deep. So why do you want to get to the subsoil? Water is one thing, but there's an amazing amount of nitrogen down there. These are averages. And you can see in the top foot we got on average about 60, 70 pounds of nitrogen per acre. And then we've got another, you know, we're averaging around 300, 350 in the top 7 feet. Most of that's below the top foot or two. And a lot of it is down here in the bottom 4 feet. So there's a lot of nitrogen deep in the profile, which we can get at if we do it up. We have up next Michelle Cavageli. I'm not going to do a long introduction. Hop up. He's a scientist at ARS and he's going to continue us. I'm going to continue. Go ahead. Anyway, my name is Michelle Cavageli. I am, like Ray, a soil scientist. Back in the late 80s at Kansas State University, I was doing cover crop work. And that's when I learned that cover crops are cool, but they also use up a lot of soil moisture. So it's really nice to see this kind of other story of how you can increase soil moisture capacity in a soil profile with cover crops. That's a really pretty underexplored topic because of the challenge of studying roots. I studied roots in greenhouses, greenhouse-grown cover crops, and even that is a challenge. Now I spend most of my time leading a long-term cropping systems trial in Beltsville. And it's comparing organic and conventional systems. All the systems have some kind of cover crops in them. And I work a lot with Steven Mursky, who does a lot of cover crop work. So I still do a fair amount. Almost all my research involves cover crops at some level, but I don't really study cover crops compared to no cover crops. But there's a lot of other people in the area that do these types of things. So my talk is actually going to be highlighting the research of other people in, largely in Maryland. And I'm going to try to fill in, I kind of, I understood what Ray was going to talk about. I know what Stuart's going to talk about. So I tried to fill in some gaps in between. So it's a bit of a hodgepodge of different aspects of soil health and how cover crops impact that. I stole these from Steven Mursky. You all know that cover crops are multifunctional tools that can do a lot of different things. I'm going to focus on these four aspects. Erosion control, nutrient scavenging, retention, organic matter, and habitat for beneficial organisms. And I'm going to highlight results from the Northeast, as I mentioned. I'm going to start off with some erosion control. The critical aspect of soil health is if you can't keep it there, then it's not only not healthy, but it doesn't matter that you're keeping it healthy if it's running off, right? So erosion control, which of course is the primary reason cover crops really were stored, I think, is still very critical. And we've heard a little bit of talk on that. And it's hard to collect data on erosion control. So researchers out at Beltsville a few years back did this study where they compared tomatoes growing on plastic culture, that like is often done, compared with tomatoes growing with a vetch cover crop. This is the plastic, as you can see, traditional way of growing tomatoes. And this is a rolled or mowed hairy vetch cover crop that the tomatoes were planted into. And this is all done in a very controlled situation where they could measure actual runoff. And so then they collected water samples at the end of these little short hills. And you can see the huge difference just visually in the amount of soil lost with the polyethylene. And you can see the, you know, with this plastic you form these furrows. So this is kind of a dramatic example of kind of worst case scenario and how cover crops can help soil erosion. When you look at the numbers that the folks data collected, 93% of runoff events were significantly higher with the plastic than the vetch. So pretty much every single rainfall event you're getting a lot more loss. And then when they looked at just the amount, this is liters per meter squared of runoff volume, you can see you have two to five times as much loss of runoff with the plastic as vetch. So very dramatic effects on soil runoff. Soil loss, a similar type of situation. You're losing a lot, almost every rainfall event you're losing more with the plastic than with the vetch. And now you see that the amount of soil you're losing is more than ten times as high with the plastic than with the vetch. So that's kind of a dramatic situation where you really get a lot of erosion in one case, and you can reduce that quite a bit. I work with field crops as I imagine some of you do. I don't work with vegetable crops. So in looking through the literature and kind of thinking about evidence for cover crops reducing erosion in maybe a less erosive situation. This is an example I like to use a little bit. It's not from this area. It's from the Palouse area of Washington State. And they had a side-by-side organic and conventional forms. You say, well, this isn't talk about organic forms. We're talking about cover crops here. But it turns out that the conventional form had a winter wheat, spring pea rotation, and the organic form right across the fence line had winter wheat, spring pea, and then Austrian pea cover crop. And the folks out there then looked at the depth to the orgillic horizon in the soil, comparing 1948 to 1985 data. And they found that on the conventional form, basically there was a lot less topsoil than there was in the organic form. And the reason for this is not so much that it's organic versus conventional, but just that the organic form had a cover crop. And so that shows just a physical loss of soil over time. The project I'm in charge of is a long-term study, as I mentioned. Soil loss is very difficult to measure. Soil loss is quite involved. So we used a model to estimate soil loss in our systems. So we had kind of a similar comparison where we had a conventional system and an organic system. And again, the only difference is real. The primary differences were that the conventional system was a corn, soybean, winter wheat, and then double-crop soybean, whereas the organic was corn, soybean, winter wheat, and then instead of the double-crop soybean, we had a winter vetch cover crop. And it turns out that we, in this case, this is a soil loss this time, so a bigger bore is worse in this case as compared to the previous one. So the model showed that we'd have less erosion. And the model can point out that the difference was all because of this winter cover crop. So there's some evidence of that. But remember, no-till, this is the same model looking at no-till. There are better ways of reducing soil loss than just cover crops. And of course, you guys all, much of this meeting has been about that as well. In terms of other functions of cover crops, organic matter, of course, is really the centerpiece of soil health. I probably don't even need to go through this list, but you all know that soil organic matter has a lot of benefits. How do you increase soil organic matter? You just put more organic matter in the soil, right? This is a graph that just kind of quantifies some of that, showing that you need a certain amount. If you look at this Iowa line here, at 4,000 pounds per acre of residue, you maintain soil organic matter at the same level. If you don't have that much, you're going to start losing soil organic matter. This is a change in soil organic matter here. So it takes a fair amount of residue per year to increase soil organic matter. So as probably everybody in this room knows, quantity matters. If you add a cover crop, you're going to increase the amount of carbon that goes back into soil. That's really the only point I want to make on here. But also that it depends where you live. If you live in a colder climate, it doesn't take as much residue. But of course, it's harder to grow more residue where it's cold as well. The type of carbon that you put in the soil matters. This is kind of the carbon to nitrogen ratio story. Alfalfa has the lowest carbon to nitrogen ratio here. Straw, more, higher carbon to nitrogen, manure and peat even more. And so quality matters. But the problem is here, no roots were harmed in the collection of these data. Because roots are very difficult to collect. And so when we collect above ground, this was a study where people would put this amount of residue onto soil. And it was a very controlled study just to look, just to quantify the effects of putting the same amount of these four different residues into soil and looking at the long-term effect of carbon buildup. So the roots are very important. So I'm really glad that Ray made that point. And then that impact of carbon quality and quantity is combined when you're putting a whole crop rotation in, right? A corn and soybean rotation might have about the same amount of residue going back into the soil as a corn and small grain. But the corn and small grain builds up more soil organic matter because the small grain carbon nitrogen ratio is higher. And so that residue is more resistant to degradation. And of course, if you go include a perennial, then you're going to increase soil carbon even more. Roots were harmed in the collection of these data. This was the actual crop rotations in the field. So what about cover crops and soil cobwebs? That's just probably background that you maybe are or are not familiar with. What happens in a real case where you do have cover crops in the field? And these are data from Michigan. And it's only from the 0 to 7.5 cm sampling depth over about 10 years. And this is kind of a same type situation here where we have conventional and organic, but corn and soybean went to wheat rotation in the conventional and the organic was the same rotation, but then with a red clover cover crop. So it's really just a cover crop comparison. And they did both a low input and an organic, and these two rotations are the same. Change in soil carbon over this time period in the conventional tillage was zero, so there's actually data there, but you don't, it's actually zero. And for the low input, we get 120 kilograms per hectare per year increase in carbon in the soil. It's actually not that much. So that's part of the point I want to make here is that it does take time to build up carbon because of the, most of your carbon that you put in the soil is decomposing, right? The amount that stays in the soil is not that much. I found a study from Maryland with Frank Cole and others looking at soil carbon. They did, they sampled also the surface soil, and they did this work from 1994 to 2007, and they looked at continuous no-till corn versus continuous no-till corn plus a rye cover crop. So a little more kind of standard plus minus cover crop study. It's no-till and it's continuous corn, so those two things are going to help you build up soil carbon. You have a lot of residue in corn. You're not losing as much because you're not tilling. They did this in two sites in coastal plains, so these are the averages for those, and they had one site in the Piedmont. Well, you see, and that's just quite a bit of time, right? You really don't see too many differences. There's a few differences here between the no-rye and the plus-rye, and sometimes they sampled over two years, and they sampled twice a year, so you're kind of following this over time. So there are a few differences. I'm sorry, this is total carbon over here, and this is labile carbon. Sorry about that. They only have one case where there's a total carbon increase, but what's more interesting perhaps is that labile carbon is actually increasing more than the total carbon. And this is the stuff that is more active, and so that's what's going to be feeding your microorganisms, and I'll talk a little bit, I'll show some data about that in a bit. Piedmont soils, they had a small increase in carbon, but no increase in labile carbon in this case. So in this case, we have a lot of carbon going into the soil because it's continuous corn. The rye cover crop added about 20% more carbon, and so it gets difficult. If you're already adding a lot of carbon with residues, you're not going to have, if you're already adding a lot of carbon with your crop residues, your cover crop, contribution is going to be less as a percentage. So you might get situations like this where you actually don't even see really much of an increase in carbon. But what they did look at also was water stable aggregates, two different sizes from 6 to 2 millimeters and 2 to 0.5 millimeters. And then you see across all these different situations that they are finding an increase in water stable aggregates in the surface soil. And this comes back to what some of Ray was talking about, that having those cover crops in the surface is really critical to increasing the porosity of that soil and movement of water into the soil and taking advantage of the water that you do get, which as Ray said, is really what drives a lot of differences in crop yields in this area. So even though the carbon might not show as much of an effect, looking at some of these other soil health parameters, you do see an effect that cover crops do benefit. Yeah, in this case, that's what you would get from this, right? You'll get more aggregation, and that's the roots and the mycorrhizae doing their work. And you might not increase the total carbon, but you're increasing the carbon in what it's doing for the functioning of the soil. So the function of the soil becomes. They did look at that, that correlation between this and labile carbon. There was a correlation, but it was. But still this effect is measuring water stable aggregates showed the effect more strongly. So for every increase in labile carbon, there was a bigger increase in water stable aggregates for every unit increase. Okay, so soil carbon, of course, is important, but it has a lot of different aspects to soil function. And I have a few examples of nutrient scavenging retention. This is from a long-term study, not from this area, from out west. But I found this pretty interesting that they did from 1988 to 1996, and they had a cover crop of vetch for that amount of time, they had a cover crop of rye grass, and they had a cover crop of rye. And you would think, and then they looked at soil organic nitrogen in 1996 after these crops had been used every year. And what was pretty interesting to me in that we always talk about legumes being the sources of nitrogen, and of course they are. But in this case, the soil organic nitrogen was actually higher following rye and rye grass, even though there's less nitrogen input in those systems. And that's because that shows the really strong value of these grass crops being able to retain the nitrogen that's there. So even though you're fixing nitrogen with the vetch, the system kept more of the nitrogen that was added, which suggests that with the vetch you might be losing more of the nitrogen in the system. So the soil nitrogen content isn't driven just by additions, right? It's really the losses in this case that drove this difference. So this is a really cool example, I think, of the value of cover crops for nitrogen retention. This is from my master's thesis. It's old data that was published recently. What I looked at was the impact of cover crops, the phosphorus content of cover crops. If a high phosphorus cover crop, if a cover crop pulls up a lot of phosphorus, does that increase the phosphorus to the succeeding crop? Kansas is a different place than Maryland. We talked about phosphorus limitation there. We don't talk that much about that here, right? We have opposite situation. But this is kind of interesting to me was I grew these four different cover crops and these are all actually forage crops. And this one was a nitro alfalfa. It had the most uptake of phosphorus as a cover crop, but it also led to the most uptake of sorghum phosphorus afterwards. And so there was some recycling of phosphorus from the cover crop to the cash crop. So even phosphorus might be retained as well in that way. This next section I'm going to talk about habitat for beneficial organisms. And I see I have three minutes and I have way too many slides for three minutes. So I'm going to talk about other people's work. Again, coming back to tomatoes. And Jeff Beyer and John Teasdale put this together where they grew tomatoes in plastic culture. And then also with this hairy vetch and the cereal rye cover crops that were mowed very similar to what I showed at the beginning. And Jeff is a soil microbial ecologist and he looked at total phospholipid fatty acids. This was mentioned, this measurement was mentioned in the soil quality, soil health assessments that Brandon talked about earlier. So this is a measure of total microbial biomass in the soil. So what did they find? That with their cover crops compared to the black poly they're getting in general higher microbial biomass. Not too surprising in some ways. You're adding more food for the microorganisms. They also had more fungi. And they had more gram-negative bacteria, a subset of the total bacterial community. But they had less gram-positive bacteria with the cover crops. So what's going on? So here's Jeff's assessment that vetch and rye cover cropping increased soil microbial biomass. That's pretty straightforward. You're feeding them more, keeping the living roots growing in the wintertime. Decreased the proportion of gram-positive bacteria and actinomycetes. These effects were due to the cover crop and not soil moisture, temperature, texture, and pH, all of which they measured. So it was just something that the cover crops were doing independent of that environmental control. And independent of any of the variables measured in the tomatoes. The project was actually a lot more complicated than what I showed. And they had some microplots where they just put the roots in and somewhere they just put the shoots in. And they found this effect both with just roots and both with just shoots. So that's kind of an interesting study that not many people look at those effects independently. The effects were attributed to cover crop root exudates during the winter and to the nutrients released from the decomposing roots and shoots after mowing. So both the benefits are both to the growing and the dead cover crops. So the cover crops are beneficial both alive and dead. I'm going to skip over the gram-negative bacteria. That's getting a little more complicated. And I'm just going to skip ahead to another study. This is from Kate Everts. She's a plant physiologist at University of Maryland and University of Delaware. She does quite a bit of cover crop work on vegetables and fruits including watermelons and pumpkins. She collects disease data. And so this is another similar type of study with bare ground, black plastic, and a vetch mulch. And this is days after transplanting. And this is percent of an anthracnose severity on a watermelon. And you see with bare ground you get more disease than you do with black plastic and quite a bit more than on vetch mulch. So this is an aspect of soil health that's not discussed that much. In part because it's a little more difficult to measure. And I would refer you to Kate and her website for more information on all this. But she looked at cover crops and watermelon folia diseases, specifically anthracnose. And so this is the same black plastic, hairy vetch without fungicide, hairy vetch with fungicide, and black plastic with fungicide. Black plastic without fungicide you get quite a bit of disease. Hairy vetch without fungicide you've reduced. Just the hairy vetch itself is reducing the anthracnose disease quite a bit. With a fungicide you can reduce it a little bit more. And the black plastic with the fungicide still has more disease than the hairy vetch with fungicide. So this is pretty interesting. Go ahead. Do you find that same trend if you just mulched? You're asking the question? Yeah. That's Kate. Kate's husband's here. Maybe he can help. That could be because of the splash effect on this disease. Yeah. So you could. I don't know. You know, I haven't done that obviously. I don't know if Kate's done any of that. I have the division of labor at home. She's the plant pathologist. I do the weed science work. Okay. So I'm sticking my neck out just a little bit more because I'm clearly not a plant pathologist. And this is probably the last slide I have. Sorry. That's fine. Again, this is now pumpkins and diseases. And this is looking at the, these hand, the disease affects the pumpkin handle. So you have bare ground and two different types of diseases. No-till hairy vetch and vetch plus lye, the same two diseases. And you see that the incidence of disease is reduced by both of those. Uh, the incidence of both these diseases is reduced with the no-till hairy vetch and rye. And, uh, I lied. I got one more here. Similar story. Bare ground versus a cover crop. Um, fewer diseased handles. Yield the same for the, both of the different treatments. I'm going to do, I'm going to do a Ray Weil on you. One last point. Keep in mind, and this is, this is critical for me as a non-plant pathologist. Keep in mind that some cover crops can increase disease. Very complicated story. Every organism is different. So don't take away from this, oh, cover crops are going to solve all, all disease issues. So that's all I want to make. Um, up next, I welcome, uh, Stuart Grandy from University of New Hampshire. I am a soil, uh, microbial ecologist and biogeochemist. I study the interactions, uh, in soils between the mineral surfaces and, uh, the microbes that are living on and around those mineral surfaces and then the nutrient cycles that they regulate. About ten years ago, I was a postdoc at the University of Colorado Boulder. And I had a very fancy new instrument at my disposal. It was called a pyrolysis gas chromatograph mass spectrometer. And it's a way of looking at the, the chemistry of, of soil organic matter in, in great detail. In much greater detail than you get, say, with nuclear magnetic, NMR, which is a very commonly used method or certainly much more accurate and much greater detail than you get with the old chemical oxidation methods. So in fact, when I would pyrolysis soil sample, I'd often get 120 different compounds. So I started to use this tool looking at, at different soil, soils and soil fractions. And I was very interested in the, in the clay fraction in particular. This is the oldest soil organic matter. Um, it's also the most stable. It turns over, uh, on the longest, over the longest time periods. And I analyzed these soils from lots of different sites. Um, and I found repeatedly that I, there was no plant material or recognizable plant material in these stable soil fractions. That it was made up almost entirely of proteins and, uh, lipids, many of which we could directly attribute to microorganisms and amino acids. And so I went and got some other soils and found the same thing. And, and did this again and again. That these fractions of soils that are the most stable, that last the longest in soil, that last the longest, had virtually no recognizable plant material in them. And this got me thinking about how we actually build and form soil organic matter. Because it's always been thought that soil organic matter is the leftover bits of micro, from microbial decomposition. It's the, it's the stuff that microbes don't want to eat. It's the stalks from corn that just stick around. Um, it's the stuff that's very chemically complex. Uh, and that basically the most stable forms of soil organic matter, it was always thought, were, were derived from plants. And, and this was suggesting something quite different. That it was, um, derived from microbes. And this has been the focus of a, a lot of our work. And there are a lot of implications for, for this different model of soil organic matter dynamics. Especially related to management. And I'm going to talk today about a system that's an organic cover crop system. And compare it to a conventional system. And show you how fundamentally different, uh, the microorganisms are behaving in these two systems. And how this appears to be directly contributing to, uh, greater organic matter content with the use of cover crops. So really what I'd like to do is, is present maybe a, a mechanism for why we see greater carbon under cover crops. That maybe some of you haven't thought of before. This is the different pathways of soil organic matter formation. Uh, this is the historical model. Where you have enzymatic litter degradation occurring outside the microbial cell. So there, you can think of the microbes as kind of bombarding organic matter with enzymes. And some of it breaks down. Some of, and that is taken up by the microbe. And much of it's converted to CO2. But there's a lot left over. And those, those are the things like lignin and some of the lipids that stick around and contribute to soil organic matter. But actually we know now that microbes can break down just about anything. They're very, very good decomposers. Uh, things like lignin do not stick around for very long periods in soil. And so basically everything goes through the microbial biomass and becomes non-living soil organic matter. Historically we always thought about management as managing these plant materials for chemical complexity and recalcitrance to build soil organic matter. Basically we are trying to limit microbial activity and slow decomposition as a way to build soil organic matter. And these new approaches to thinking about soil organic matter suggest quite the opposite. That it's, we need to promote a larger and more efficient microbial biomass to build non-living soil organic matter. So it's the continuous input of microbial biomass over time that builds soil carbon. So just to highlight this, we've got former model, um, where plant residues going into soil organic matter. But now we think much of this is going into microbial biomass first and then into the soil organic matter pool. And this raises really interesting questions, right? We've studied for a century the link between plant inputs, particularly plant chemistry and soil organic matter dynamics. When really we probably should have been focusing on traits of the microbial community and how they are influenced by management. Things like the growth efficiency and growth rate. The growth efficiency is how much carbon a microbe takes up that it converts to biomass versus being lost as CO2. A microbial community that converts more substrate, more input into microbial biomass than CO2 is likely to build more soil organic matter. Really what we're thinking about then is managing plants that have a certain effect on the microbial community rather than managing the direct input of plants to soil organic matter. So just highlighting the importance then of microbial physiological traits including growth efficiencies and growth rates. Now we know from microbial theory and many lab experiments that as microbes are given higher quality inputs, uh, you could think about it as inputs with a low C to N ratio. Their growth efficiency goes up. So you get a higher growth efficiency and often also a higher growth rate with more delicious substrates. And so that raises some questions about say a corn based cropping system that includes some really juicy inputs from green manure cover crops. Maybe those green manure cover crops are building carbon because they're supporting a more active, more efficient, higher growth rate microbial community. So just to provide some lab based data for this, um, I'm not going to go in depth into this experiment. Um, this is a paper that we currently have in review at Nature and it shows this link between microbial growth efficiency and soil organic carbon and also relative fungal abundance in soil organic carbon. And this was a, a unique, um, synthetic soil design where we were really able to isolate, uh, the microbial growth properties and watch in real time the formation of soil organic matter to try and address at a very small scale these questions about the links between growth efficiency and soil carbon. And then also community structure and soil carbon. So these data suggest that when you promote fungi with certain kinds of substrate inputs, and that's how we created this divergence was with different substrate inputs. We promoted a more fungal dominated community, higher growth efficiency resulting in more soil organic carbon. Now why can't we be doing these things in the field? One way we might be able to do it is through crop diversification, especially the use of, uh, cover crops. Cause they provide a really nice rich source of organic matter. We've done a lot of work in my lab on crop diversity. Uh, we see frequently changes in mineralizable carbon and nitrogen and lots of benefits of cover crops and crop diversity. So we're really trying to dig into the mechanism. So we conducted an experiment, uh, at the Kellogg Biological Station, uh, in Michigan. And this is a very unusual site. We have a conventional and organic system. The total biomass inputs are shown here. They're higher in the conventional system than they are in the organic. The organic system gets more tillage, not a lot more. It's more of a superficial kind of cultivation for weed control. But otherwise the primary tillage is identical in the two systems. And yet soil carbon is higher in the organic system. So this really defies everything that we think about soil carbon dynamics. High, lower biomass. So fewer total inputs. More tillage. More tillage. And yet more soil carbon. So we hypothesize that maybe there are differences in the functioning of these microbial communities. That because in particular of the cover crops, the frequent use of cover crops in two out of three years, that we're developing a more efficient, uh, larger microbial community. And this just shows, um, the difference in inputs over time. And you can see that the organic system has, uh, more frequent inputs. It's not as hugely pulsed. And also more inputs of lower, of higher quality residues or a low C to N ratio. Thanks to the cover crop. So I think you all have a sense now for what our hypothesis might be. That the changes in microbial physiology and carbon allocation increase microbial inputs to stable soil organic matter fractions. And so we measured growth efficiencies and growth rates in the lab. Um, and we also did a neat field experiment where we took different kinds of microbial substrates and isotopically labeled them, which allowed us to track them through the soil. And so at the same time that we were measuring growth efficiencies and growth rates, we were actually able to follow the fate of new inputs into the soil organic matter and see whether in fact there's a greater efficiency of conversion of substrates to soil organic matter. So we found the higher microbial biomass in the organic system. We found that the microbial growth efficiency was indeed quite a bit higher. So 55% of the carbon taken up by microbes in the organic system is converted to biomass, as opposed to only 45% in the conventional system. You can think about this, uh, in reverse. 45% of the organic matter taken up in the organic system is converted to CO2. 55% is lost from the system as CO2 in the conventional system. And we also found, uh, just greater microbial growth rates and growth and activities in the organic systems. And we also use these substrates, as I said, and track them through, uh, the microbial biomass and into different organic matter pools. And we found more recovery of the isotopically labeled material in the microbial biomass in the organic system. So again, the microbes were more rapidly taking up and incorporating these new substrates into their biomass. And then this is the recovery of isotopically labeled glucose, total recovery in different, uh, clay fractions. And again, the clays are where organic matter is being stabilized. And we found a lot more carbon ending up in the organic system in, uh, pools that exhibit a fair amount of stability. And so we add carbon to these systems. It's more rapidly taken up by the microbial community in the organic system. It is more, um, uh, efficiently converted to organic matter, uh, because that biomass is ending up in these clay fractions. And so just to summarize, we've got these two very different systems with different kinds of inputs. Growth rates, uh, and growth efficiencies are much higher in the organic system. Uh, we think it's most likely due to the input of cover crops. I'm happy to have that discussion, uh, with someone if you think there are other, uh, components of an organic and conventional system that might lead to those differences in physiology. In my mind, that's the big difference between these systems. Um, and then we're getting more microbial residue inputs into the stable soil organic matter pool in the organic system. And so I think as we go forward and think about new ways to build organic matter with the use of cover crops, we have a real opportunity here to be thinking about how our plant inputs, how root activity, how above ground inputs are influencing the microbial communities. And thus influencing soil organic matter. And I'd just like to say thanks that, uh, uh, to Cynthia's the lead on all this work. She's a phenomenal scientist. The, the stuff, the stuff on the field site is published. Uh, it's in soil biology and biochemistry. The other stuff is in review at Nature. And then a bunch of other, uh, prior postdocs in my lab that have gone off and done some good things. And they've made big contributions to my thinking about this too. So, thanks. It's, it's certainly possible and we cannot, uh, exclude that as a possibility. I mean, I, I guess I feel like if, I don't know, if you look at the totality of evidence, I think we know that microbes, physiologically, the chemical function is very sensitive to the quality of what it's eating. And so that seems like a more likely explanation, um, than the occasional use of chemicals in those systems. Um, but, but we can't definitively say. Yeah. So I, I, I have a student doing an analysis of already published data to try and understand how, um, different kinds of cover crops are influencing, uh, the microbial community. I would love to take this experiment and expand it out to other sites and systems and, and answer that question as well. But I don't feel like at this point we have that kind of data available. I mean, we used to have this idea that fungi will typically respond to more, uh, complex kinds of carbon inputs like lignin. I think there's, uh, some question about that now. I mean, the, the fungal, uh, world is so, so diverse. There's a fungi for every, every purpose. So, yeah. But that's where we're headed. So the question was, if the organic system has a cover crop input and the conventional does not, why do we have more total carbon inputs into the conventional system? And it has to do with the overall productivity. Uh, the, the, the, the, the organic sites are not fertilized. And so, uh, they're deriving most of their end from, from legumes. And so the productivity is a bit lower than what you'd expect from most commercial fields. Um, and so you just are getting a lot less corn and wheat stover going in. Well, you manage cover crops for a lot of different reasons. I mean, one is, is nitrogen uptake. Um, one, soil cover and erosion control. So there are a lot of different factors at play. And, and so, you know, I think you should be looking at your overall system and, and what works. I mean, cover crops are gonna, they're going to be good. They're gonna provide food for the microbes. If you let them go a little longer, yeah, the chemistry changes some, but you get so much more biomass going in that I don't think I would recommend tilling it in early just to have a certain effect on the microbial biomass. At least not at this point. Maybe we'll get there. I love the idea of a more prescriptive approach to this, you know, as we learn more about these mechanisms. In the field experiment, we did not see a strong difference in the communities. We looked at fungal and bacterial ratios and we use PLFA. Uh, and, and, and it confirmed what others that do genomic methods have also seen that there just isn't that big of a difference in the, in the who's who in the community. But there sure seems to be a big difference in how they're functioning. In that experiment, it didn't change. Yeah. So that's why, you know, I'm not really that comfortable at this point taking this experiment and making a, a broad conclusion. Even though I was always told that's what you do in extension meetings, but. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
