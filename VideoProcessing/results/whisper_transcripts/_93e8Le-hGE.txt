 Hi, my name is Joseph Platts and I have a question about agriculture. I eat oatmeal for breakfast, I have corn chips with my lunch, and wheat bread on almost all my sandwiches. It seems like a whole lot of grains, so I was just wondering how much grains do we eat in this country and what do we eat more of? Corn, wheat, or what? You're right, grains do make up a big part of the American diet, and there are important crops to farmers all across the heartland. You mentioned oatmeal and corn chips, but don't forget about hamburger buns, breakfast cereals, even many fruit bars contain grains. And we're not alone when it comes to gobbling up grains. Wheat and wheat products? China, India, and Russia are big consumers. Rice? Add Indonesia, Pakistan, and Turkey to those folks in Asia who eat rice. And while Americans consume more corn products than other folks around the globe, Brazil, Mexico, and Japan are high on the list as well. But which grains do we enjoy the most? Well, that's tough to determine, not only because consumption can vary dramatically by geographic region, race, and ethnicity, but because grains like wheat, corn, barley, rice, and oats are also used in ways you may not even think about. Things like food additives or thickeners in sausage and gravies. Grains are even used in the production of liquor and beer. So you can see why grains are important to American farmers and consumers. And they play a big role in food exports to countries overseas. And if you think you're eating more products made from grains these days, you're right. We consume more grains than we did 30 years ago. And there are many more products available today that have grains as their main ingredient. The Department of Agriculture recommends that, like all food choices, you balance your diet and eat whole grains, which have a better nutritional value.
