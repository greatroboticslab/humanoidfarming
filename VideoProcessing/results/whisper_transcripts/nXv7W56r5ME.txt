 This tobacco farmer clears stuck soil from the ditches between the ridges, ensuring water flows freely to nourish the plants. The plastic sheets you see are mulch films, laid weeks ago to retain moisture and suppress weed growth. As the plants mature, harvesting follows a strict order. Leaves ripen from the bottom up. When the lower leaves turn pale, they must be picked immediately to maintain quality. After harvesting, women carefully sort and arrange the leaves, preparing them for flu curing. Inside the curing barn, workers hang the leaves in neat rows where temperature and humidity are carefully controlled with heated air. This process changes their texture and color. Once cured, the leaves undergo fermentation, during which they are stacked in piles. This final step removes harsh flavors and enhances the aroma, ensuring high quality tobacco.
