Howto & Style
 This is how to make my 103 blend with what's available at Home Depot. This is a compost and manure. I'm not sure it's organic. They didn't have anything with organic compost, so if you can't find organic compost, it's much better. This sand, this is what we're going to use to add drainage and porosity to the soil blend. Down here we have a topsoil, so we're going to blend these three things together to make the herb garden mix.
