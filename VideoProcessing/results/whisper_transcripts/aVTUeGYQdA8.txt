 There's something about forest-raised pigs that has bothered me for a while now. Pigs go great in the woods, foraging acorns, hickory nuts, beech nuts, wild grapes, bugs, and insects. And in hot climates like mine, forests offer a lot more cooler shade for pigs than just a couple trees in a pasture do. But pigs eat a lot and poop a lot. In fact, they can deposit up to four tons of manure in each paddock. Forests are not created to need lots of fertilizer. So I wonder if forests are able to absorb all the nutrients before they leach into the watershed. Pastures and cover crop fields certainly can absorb a lot of the nutrients. In fact, the nutrients in the pig manure is much, much less than the recommended amounts of chemical fertilizers for pastures and other crops. And of course, while these cover crops in our fields are growing, they help sequester more carbon, increase soil organic matter, and improve soil health. While I put pigs in our forested lots, I try to make sure that I capture as much of the manure from the pigs as I can in our cover crop fields. if for yawns.
