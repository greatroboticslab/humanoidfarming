 Y'all remember this? I still haven't planted in it, but guess what? I was thinking this morning as I was harvesting this okra, I was like, man, I need a basket with wheels. I need to be able to like just move my basket down like that. And I was like, wait, I have one. This will work fabulous. I just kick it on down the aisle as I collect and throw my produce in there. What? I love redneck ingenuity, y'all.
