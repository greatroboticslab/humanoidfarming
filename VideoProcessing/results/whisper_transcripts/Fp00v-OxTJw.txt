Education
 This is where we grew up in California. And this is our 14 acres in Tennessee. This is the tiny backyard I grew up in. Now our backyard is a forest and the park that our kids used to play at. Now this is my kids' playground. Well, this is how we grew up. Backyards with swimming pools and sun always shining and never any rain. Zero farming experience and suburb living. Made a big decision and changed the way we live. And now we have bees, chickens, get milk from our goats, fiber from our alpacas, and the joy of raising baby animals. We even grow a lot of our own food at home. So follow us as we continue to grow and share in our experience and what we've learned while we've started to do this. And thank you for those who have been supporting us.
