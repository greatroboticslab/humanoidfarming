 What if I told you farmers in the Philippines grow pineapples by boat? Forget everything you know about farming. In the Philippines, pineapple farmers use a genius technique. They flood their fields and plant along the water channels. The constant moisture helps the fruit grow faster and juicier with less effort. And when it's harvest time, they hop in boats, pick the pineapples, and float them straight to market. Smart farming, zero hassle, and record-breaking pineapple production.
