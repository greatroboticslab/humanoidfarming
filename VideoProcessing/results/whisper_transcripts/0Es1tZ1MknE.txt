 I'm Nick Winning and I farm here with my family. I am third generation here in Decatur County, Indiana. So here on our family farm we grow corn, soybeans, wheat, cover crops, hay, a little bit of cattle. My daughter actually started a produce section to the farm. We've been just very proactive into trying to figure out ways to be sustainable and continue to grow our farm. With some of the practices we do here on the farm we started off with no-till. We've been putting some cover crops on for the last 25 years probably. My father started that. He saw issues with drainage areas where erosion was back. Since then we figured out that hey cover crops even on the good ground benefits next year's crop. We figured out that there's a lot of beneficial microbes and microorganisms that live in the soil and need a root growing there all year to help us produce the crop for the following year. So we've also got buffer strips and several other practices on the farm that help filter the water before it hits the creeks and streams. It's another step to keep the erosion down and it also benefits the wildlife and benefits everything around us. We do no tillage to our ground. We come through with the planter and that is the only piece of steel that hits this ground. It helps everything from the worms to the microbes to the structure. We do have less runoff, less nutrients leaving the farm so we're able to keep them here where we put them. I believe the whole soil health approach that we have on the farm is a benefit. One, it's cutting down on those nitrates and the phosphorus levels that are leaving our farm eventually going to the Gulf of Mexico. All over the country we have these issues. We've been able to prove it here that we have less soil erosion and less nutrients leaving. Sustainability is not cheap. However, we get the benefit on the yield end that yes it costs money but you're making money. We have paid for all of the products that we put on these fields. I want them to stay here. We're keeping all the nutrients out of the creeks and streams, keeping them healthy. So this is all been huge for the public and for farmers and we're trying to work together with consumers to make the earth as healthy as we can. So to me sustainability matters to this farm because my father has implemented the practices, my grandfather, I plan to do that for my children. I want to keep this a family farm for generations to come.
