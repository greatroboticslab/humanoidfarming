 What's something people don't know about paddy fields? Rotating your crops, like mixing in legumes, can do wonders for your soil and your harvest. Here's the secret. By growing different crops like legumes between rice seasons, you naturally increase soil nitrogen, making your soil richer without extra fertilizer. This simple switch breaks harmful pest and disease cycles, keeps your soil structure strong, and even helps your fields hold water better. Scientists say this smart rotation can boost your rice yield by up to 20%. Plus, you're cutting down on pollution and helping the planet. Experts around the world, and right here in India, recommend crop rotation for healthier harvests and a greener future.
