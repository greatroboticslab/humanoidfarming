 When you're driving along the Great Northern Peninsula in Newfoundland, look on the side of the road, you're going to see roadside veggie gardens. Just like this, with scarecrows and everything built in. It's right in the peat moss that's here on the side of the road. I've seen hundreds of little veggie gardens just in the ditch. It's really cool.
