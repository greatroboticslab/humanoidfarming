 Hmm. There he is. Good morning. Good morning. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. Come on in, come on in, come on in. You are welcome in this place. Come on in, come on in, come on in. You are welcome in this place. You're welcome. You're welcome in this place. Come on in, come on in, come on in. You are truly welcome in this place. I am getting ready to, should I say garden? I probably shouldn't say garden because that's going too far. But I'm going to start, I'm trying, I'm going to start trying. Let's just do that. Let's just say I'm going to start, I'm going to try to garden. I'm going to attempt to garden. Let me take my quick little, get my nerves together. Let's just do that. Double tap that screen if you come in, double tap it real fast is what I hear. Let's go. Hope I'm not showing my goods. I don't really have any goods to tell you the truth. Hope I'm not showing my bags either. Double tap that screen as you come in. I also want to put up a bird feeder. I don't know if this is the right area for it or if we have the right birds around here, but I'm going to do it anyway. Double tap that screen for me. I have some potting for you. I have some seeds. And because I don't know what the F I'm doing, I just got some, I got something for the shaded area. As you can see my porch is shaded a lot of times, but then it does have some soil. So I have some, oh wait, what did I get? See what I'm saying? Well, I thought I had one for the shade, one for the sun and some other stuff, but I have basil, onion, kale, peas. Again, just trying it. And this is the soil I got. Now, don't cuss me. Now this soil, it says for flowers and herbs and whatever. Wait, it says flowers and herbs. Wait, I'm not saying herbs, I'm saying vegetables. Is that different? It's probably different, but I'm going to use the same soil. I'm so sorry. Don't tap that screen for me. I appreciate you. So let's see. I wanted to use this, maybe this one, to make a bird feeder. But it's kind of big. So what I'm going to do is, I'll probably put water in here for the birds. And then I was going to place maybe one of these, these things in the middle right here and put, oh man, I forgot to see. See what I'm saying? Well, that's what I was going to do. So right now, I'm going to just put the water in here since I got the basket for the birds. So let me put the basket in and see if any birds come up while I'm sitting out here. I'm going to do this first. I don't, I've never met a bird that didn't like sunflower seeds. So I got sunflower seed stuff, berry blast and some peanut butter crunch. But I'm going to do berry blast. I wonder if they're going to come up here while I'm sitting here. That's what I'm trying to figure out. Nobody's double tapped the screen. Y'all didn't like the video yet? Like my live, please. Go ahead and like my live, please. I appreciate you. I'm coming on here. I'm looking for subscribers. I'm only about 25 away from 500 subscribers. Only 25 away from 500 subscribers. I'm so excited. But I need y'all's help. I need you to help me. I need y'all to subscribe for me. Even if you don't enjoy me, that's okay. I didn't ask you to enjoy me. I said subscribe to me. Help us out. I ain't too proud of me. Please, baby, baby, please. I have never done any of this, so I don't know what the F this is. I usually get birds bread and chicken. Birds love chicken. It is the most disturbing thing to watch a bird and chicken. I feel like they eating their cousin and, you know. Let me make sure. You don't bother me. Refrigerate for it. Get a little grab and insert into this. Okay. Some of them said no thawing. I'm like, wait, what do you mean? Oh, that's what, oh, this is milk resistant. So it can get up to 115 degrees and it won't melt. Okay. I thought it meant you had to thaw it out. I'm like, I don't want to thaw out no bird stuff in my house. See how ignorant I am? Y'all didn't know that either. Drop me a comment. Let me know where you're watching from, if you don't mind. I'm like, I'm like, I'm not. I'm like, I'm like, I'm not. But I hope you subscribe. I really do need subscribers. Hey. You doing all right? You online? Oh, you're not on there? I just signed on. Okay. This is messy. I see why they say. I want to smell this so bad, but my smell. I have a really, my nose is not just big just because it's big. It smells like nobody's business. Do you understand me? If I put this in my face, it's probably going to make me sick. I'm too loud. Yeah. I, you know what? I forced, I had to force myself today. I forced, I forced myself today. It took everything I had to get up today and I had to go out twice. I was so mad at me. Let me see. Thank you for double tapping that screen. Yeah. I want to see if they going to eat it. Will they? Okay. Okay. Good. I said, I'm just used to feeding them chicken and bread. I don't know. They love chicken. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay. Good. That's what I wanted to see. I said, I want to see if they're going to try it. I was going to get a bird house because they made, they made a nest in our light, huh? I thought they would just land on the thing. They won't land on the basket. I don't know, girl, but I did buy something. So I may do that. I may, um, I bought this for it and I was going to hang it up there and put water in here and I'm still going to do that for the water, but I was going to hang it on this side, I'm going to hang it on the other side. But I may just hang it up under there and that way they could sit on this. I'm going to hang it up there and put the other one in the water. Huh? Wait, what other one? What's up? Oh, it's just one. I'm planting seeds too. So it's just one for the bird for the water. But what I'll do, I'll do it. I'll put that, um, I'll put this under there so they can sit on this with the, where the water is and they can eat that at the same time. So thank you. I appreciate that. Because I didn't think about that. I thought they would just hang off the basket. I don't know. Okay, let's see. I want to see if any birds are going to show up. And eat while I'm doing this soil. And eat while I'm doing this soil. And eat while I'm doing this soil. I want to see is tough at the others. What do you got that meat? Oh? Hopefully this fish net works to hold it up. up. With my luck it won't, but hopefully I got somebody else's luck today. Okay, so probably not what I was thinking. Okay, maybe not what I was thinking, but it's not. I don't want them to get tangled up in there though, so let me see. I have to find a way to, so I can hang this. Maybe I didn't think this way. Maybe I didn't think this way. Maybe I didn't think this way. Maybe I didn't think this way. Maybe I didn't think this way. Oh, that wind is strong, thank God. Let me go ahead and get out here, girl. I don't have AC in my car. I don't have an AC on in my house, so I'm going to get this one. I'm going to find these in. I don't know if this is going to work, but as you can see I'm going to get there. I'm going to get there. I'm going to get that screen for me. Okay. I'm going to get that screen for you. Okay. Come back to it or I'm going to the house and I do nothing. My attention is staying. My nerves are very short-lived. I'm going to put these in here. I'm not reading instructions. I'm going to see if they make this recilibrill. I'm going to get that screen for you. I'm going to get that screen for you. I'm going to get that screen for you. I'm going to get that screen for you. I'm going to get that screen for you. I'm going to get that screen for you. where when i tell you i could not believe that i saw in the dollar tree a ten dollar item i knew they had three dollars i knew they had five dollars and i know they had ten i'm horrified do you understand me horrified let me put this down so you can see me double tap that screen for me i appreciate you hope i don't have a camel toe hopefully you can see the pots down here i don't know if that's too big or not because i don't have that much soil let's eat Okay. Put that in there. And I'm going to put this in here. There's three. Looks like crap. Set it like so. I don't know if I'm supposed to open it. Please read it. I do not like reading instructions. That's why I don't know what the F I'm doing. Okay. Dig a hole and plant holes have to hold that. Okay. Well, I read that. It says pointed side down. What the F is a pointed side? It's like a piece of crap. What do you mean? There is no pointed side. Are you playing with me? It's like a rock. There is no pointed side. It's like a flat. Almost flat like a rock. Yeah, they're playing with me. Okay. Okay. Okay. It says it's easy to grow. And we will see. Because if anybody is able to not make it work, it's me. It says quite a bit of water. Okay. Okay. Let me see what y'all saying in here. Let me see what y'all saying in here. Hey, Harry. How are you? Everything's going pretty well. Hey, save the free girl. Good morning. 10. Be mad. My breath, it don't smell fresh, right? But that's not why I have my mask on. But thanks for, you know, trying to make me feel bad about it. It don't. You have to understand me to know it don't make me feel bad. Woo! Let me see. Okay. Let me go get some water because it says do it right away. So, we put it. We got it. Let me go get some water. It says put quite a bit of water in there, but I don't know what quite a bit of water for them is. Let's get some more soil. There we go. Let me put some water. Water is what I say. Let me go. Double tap that screen for me. A quick double tap. I guess they say put quite a bit so it can get down to the actual seed. Okay. That's quite a bit. That's quite a bit. And I'll put it in the seed. Right there. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to have these small ones. I'm going to put onions in one. The basil. The basil. The basil. Well, that was smart, so. Oops. Not really, but I didn't get anything to go up under here. I didn't know I needed anything to go up under here. So what I'm going to do. I'm going to put them in here for now. I'm going to put them in here because I'm going to get a container. I'm going to get something. I'm going to transfer it out of there. Yeah. So. I didn't realize these were paper, but that's okay. Go ahead and double tap that screen for me. I'm looking for subscribers, guys. I need your help. I need your help. I need your help. I need your help. I need about 25 more subscribers to get to 500. And I'm on my way to monetization. I am working on getting independent again. And I need your help. I need you guys to share my videos. Share my Do You Remember When videos. Share those. Keep commenting like you've been doing. Let's see. I need it. It says... Oh, wow. This is the right move to actually plant this. Barely, but it is. Okay. I'm not too far off. So I got these onions. They were $1.99. Hopefully it works. Okay. I don't know when the last time I bought these type of onions, but... I would definitely use them if I was able to grow them. I'm going to put this here. I don't know how many... I don't know how many... Should I just put all of them? Just put them... All in there. I was going to spray them out, but... Put them all in there. Get some ammunition. Okay. I guess I should have labeled it huh? I'll put the seed that it belongs to on the side and then when I go inside I'll write on there what it is. Okay, that's onion. I have kale. I don't eat kale. Don't know nobody that eats kale. But I want to see if it's going to work. That's a hole. And then I have... Let's do basil. Do I buy basil? I do not. Would I use basil if I grew some? I probably won't. Oh wow. Oh my bad. Basil is little. I used to put all the basil. I didn't mean to do that. Double tap that screen for me. Okay. Okay. That's what it's looking like. I need to put some water. Otherwise, I'm... ...I'm just getting different. There's so much . But yeah, probably it's not in通аг呢. You mean it's up today to find a little shepherd. If you would buy this t-shirt or open it, but you could buy I mean with a motive. I don't know why I just put water in the bottom of there. I'm going to keep it right there. Let me try a couple of these flower flowers. Let's try the shaded. He's sunny. Let's try the shaded. Let's try the shaded. You said you eat kale seizure-free. Well, look, if it works, you can definitely have it. Thank you so much, seizure-free. I appreciate you for putting it out there. What haven't you seen in months, Harry? You ain't seen me in months? Where you been? Where have you been? I've been here. Check out my, Harry, check out my Do You Remember When videos. I've got them. It's about 31 of them. They're only about 30 seconds to a minute long. Check those out. I've been out here. It's been a struggle, but I've been out here trying my best. You know depression is real, Harry, if you're still on here. Depression is real. Trust and believe. Actually, I wanted to put some rocks down here, but I don't see any, so... I've been out here trying to eat on me. ... You said it's different than regular salad. Now I do like now for my salad. I will eat spinach in my salad. Kale, I think kale to me, it's kind of bitter at least, you know, so I try to stay away from it. Okay, I don't know how many of these I'm supposed to put. I don't like reading instructions, not because I can't read. Why is the office people here on Saturday? The office people here on Saturday? That's making me nervous. Is today Saturday? I guess so. Is today Saturday? What are we doing here on Saturday? I live here now. No, you don't. No. Okay. Hey, I was like, I was like, wait a minute. Today's Saturday. What are we doing here on Saturday? I live here now. No, you don't. No. Oh, I was like, get out. I see you more than I see myself sometimes. Okay, I don't know how many of these seeds I'm supposed to use, but I use a lot. Okay. It says just apply water. Okay. That's just what I'm going to do. But this is shaded, so. This wind ain't a joke. Don't tap that screen for me. Okay. Um, and then, let's see, that's the shade. And then I'm going to do mixed colors. Let's do mixed colors. I'm going to put mixed colors in here. I'm distracted. I'm trying to figure out a place to hang this bird feeder where they would have somewhere to sit. Um, oh, I may put it down here and I'll see if they can, okay. I'll, I'll put it down here by this sconk and see if they can eat. So that's going to, oh no, I said I was going to put, oh, I used my thing to. Oh, I will. Y'all see how fast I can get? Double tap that screen for me. I'm going to use, let's see, mixed colors. Let's see what this do. I'm looking for subscribers, guys. I need your help. I need your help. I need your help. I need your help. I need your help. I ain't too proud to be here. I was, last time I checked, I was like 27 away from 500. I know I can do it. I just know I can't do it without y'all, so. Y'all can share my, do you remember when videos? My shorts. Share my baby cat shorts. Share my, uh, my cooking videos. Not because I knew how to cook or I can tell you how to cook, but just because you want to support me. And if you don't want to support me just to shut me up, that works. Well, not really. I'm going to put some water in there. Did that say, son? I think that was, oh, that was a wildfire mixture. Okay. Now let me figure out what to do with this bird feeder, where to put it. I have to go back to the store to get some more pots. For the rest of it. Please see that person will miss you even more. And as you can get some more. Anyone who might even know what to do with this bird feeder is going to be missing here? Have a look. Remember? I don't want the cats to get to it, so... Hopefully this works. I don't want the cats to get to it. I don't want the cats to get to it. I don't want the cats to get to it. You think that's going to work seizure-free? That's all I got right now. That's all I got. I think the birds can sit on that stump. They sit on it anytime to poop, so they can sit on it right there to eat. They poop on it all the time. Okay. You doing okay? I'm good. Let's see. I believe the birds will do this. Bear the whale with that. Look. I'm just going over here. I'm just going over here. I'm just going over here. I'm just going over here. I'm going over here. I'm just going over here. I'm just going over here. I'm just going over here. I've got to shield it so it don't blow away. This one is shady. There's some shade right there. I can't. I'm hoping they do what they say they supposed to do. They say simple. They can't get no more simple than that. They just plant and water. That's it. That's why I bought it. Because I can barely plant and water. That's too many different things for me. Let me try to straighten this up a little bit. I can't see. Baby, baby cat came up about four or five this morning. I haven't seen baby cat. not silver cramps but more returns we're gonna need to open this first time let's prepare have time to prepare will you come across? Speaking of cats, where'd she go?
