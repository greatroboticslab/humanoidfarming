 Hi everybody, I'm Scott Geyer with John Deere and today we'll review what you need to know about storing large round bales. You've spent a lot of time and money to plant, grow, cut, dry, rake, and bale your hay. So now is the time to follow a few basic tips for bale storage so you can limit storage losses and maximize hay quality at feed time. Today, we'll be storing large round bales using a John Deere 6130M Utility Tractor, a 620R Loader, a Frontier Loader Mount Bale Spear, and a Frontier 3-Point Bale Spear. Tip number one, they say every successful project starts with the first step, and step number one towards successful bale storage is to start with well-shaped, dense bales. A bale with a dense surface will shed rainwater more effectively, helping protect the inside of the bale. Tip number two, for most operations, storing a lot of large round bales indoors just isn't practical. That's why most producers store their large round bales outdoors in an open, well-drained, sunny area with good access to the livestock feeding area. Exposing the bales to sunlight and wind helps with water evaporation, which helps maintain their nutrition quality. That means never storing bales in the shade under trees where access to sunlight and wind is lower and exposure to moisture is higher. Tip number three, store large round bales in long rows stacked tightly, end to end. When you stack bales in this way, it helps them to maintain their shape, which helps limit their overall contact with the ground. This also helps prevent rot in your bales by keeping moisture from penetrating the ends. Also, leave at least three feet of space between rows to allow exposure to sunlight and air to circulate. Many studies have been done on which direction your rows should run, north-south or east-west. Though a north-south orientation tends to get the nod, it's clear the direction of the rows isn't nearly as important as the storage area being out in the open, well-drained, and sunny. Believe it or not, the outermost four inches of a six-foot round bale account for about 25% of the bales' total volume. So, bale them right and store them tight and you'll go a long ways toward keeping their nutrition value up and storage losses down. Don't forget, always read the operator's manual before storing or operating any piece of equipment, and follow all operating and safety instructions. And remember, if you're looking for equipment that's built to get the job done season after season, year after year, you'll find it, and all kinds of advice on how to use it, everyday at your John Deere dealer.
