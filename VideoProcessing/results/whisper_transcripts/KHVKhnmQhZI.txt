 This may be controversial, but farming more acres doesn't equal more profit. You see, a majority of people have this backwards where they think the more acres they farm, the more dollars or profits that's going to put into their bank account. And the exact opposite is true. The reality is, especially for those of you that aren't tracking your numbers the way that you should be, more acres and more revenue for your operation literally only means more risk for you. And the bigger these operations get that aren't tracking their numbers, the faster they are going to decline till one day they ultimately go out of business. Now, at the end of the day, if you are expanding acres and adding onto your farm operation, make sure you're doing it for the right reasons and not for the ego driven reasons, because you want to be the biggest farmer in your county. That recipe right there is ultimately going to end you up in one place, and that is financial disaster.
