Education
 Hi, my name is Ruby Slince and I'm a student here at Purdue in the Agronomy Department. I'm here in our state-of-the-art phenotyping lab and here are three things I wish you knew about Purdue University's Agronomy Department. We are a small department so it's easy to meet Baccholian students with shared interests in feeding the world and forming a community where we can all help each other out. There are many different ways to get involved in the department such as Agronomy Club. As you do, we welcome all majors as well as you can be on the Crop and Soils team who get the opportunity to travel across the nation identifying different crops and soils as well as they're considered collegiate athletes here at Walmart. This department opens a wide range of careers, some of which might be unexpected such as an Extension Specialist, working with drones, or a Genotype Specialist. Thanks for following along with us today.
