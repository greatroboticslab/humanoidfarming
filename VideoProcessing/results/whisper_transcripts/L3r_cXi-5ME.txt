 The three points of the disease triangle are first, you've got to have a pathogen. And in a lot of soils, those pathogens are out there, they're just waiting for the right opportunity. And that opportunity involves having the right host crop there. So, you've got a pathogen, you've got a host crop, and you've got to have the right environment. So, for example, let's talk about sclerotinia white mold. It starts off as a little mushroom on the ground. What conditions, or what environmental situations, would help a mushroom grow? Well, if it has shade, if it's cool, and if it's wet. Well, if you've got those conditions in the environment, and you've got the pathogen there, and you've planted soybeans, or sunflowers, or dry beans that are a host crop, you've got all three points of that disease triangle, and your odds of having a problem in the field are much higher.
