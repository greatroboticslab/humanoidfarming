 Do you want to take your farming to the next level in Stardew Valley by learning how to grow your own giant crops? Well, I'm JunimoBee and I'm here today to teach you the ins and outs of these highly sought after additions to your farm. Here's a quick 1.6 spoiler warning as there are new giant crops in the 1.6 update. So if you didn't know, there are 5 possible giant crops you can grow. The spring cauliflower, the summer melon, the fall pumpkin, and new to the game we have the winter powder melon and the keyfruit. These crops are unique as they don't go away at the change of season and the giant keyfruit will not disappear after the key's crop special order has ended. But if you do want to harvest them, you can do so with an axe, expecting to reap about 15-21 of the harvested crop at normal quality. So the important question, how do you grow them? Planting 9 of the same regular counterparts in a 3x3 area, you'll have a 1% chance to grow a giant crop as long as the top left crop is fully matured and watered. With this being said, keep in mind that the giant crops will not necessarily appear on the first day the crops have finished growing, but instead have a chance to appear any day after the fact as long as all of the previous criteria continue to be met. Good luck!
