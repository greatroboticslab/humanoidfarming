Howto & Style
 G'day I'm Tim Thompson. Today I'm renovating some small paddocks at home and this is a task that many of you will want to undertake. The house block couldn't be a better example of some depleted paddocks with poor nutrition if you tried. After years of being used as a place to ride motorbikes, drive paddock bombs and keep horses, these paddocks have been thoroughly thrashed. They're chemically well out of balance and they're in need of a bit of TLC. So we're going to go through the basic steps coming out of winter now that you can apply at home and get your paddocks thriving. The first step in any paddock restoration is sampling the soil properly. This requires a series of cores, 40 or 50 from across the paddock avoiding gateways, underneath trees and around water troughs. I then quartered this sample and mixed it thoroughly each time I quartered until I ended up with just enough to go in the bag. I signed and sealed that bag, sent it off and two weeks later I had my soil results. Now that I've got my results I know exactly what my paddock needs to get the maximum benefit, maximum growth of plants. Now we've got our soil results we can go back to plant, playing with machines. First job was spreading some prilled lime. Prilled lime is really good because it doesn't have dust and it spreads really easily out of a three-point linkage spreader, saving you on contractor costs. You also need less of it so it's more economical in the long run, even though it has a higher cost at the start. We'll put a couple bags into the spreader and of course the first thing we're going to do is calibrate it to make sure we don't put all of this out in half the area that we wanted. I headed off to a small paddock of a known area for the calibration so that we only had to use a couple of bags of lime and if we got it wrong it wouldn't be a big disaster. So that was on about a quarter of an acre which would be about one-ninth or so of a hectare and as you can see 40 kilos hasn't quite gone out over that area so that's telling us we can open it up just a little bit more. It's a little bit imprecise, we're rushing today to try and get this out and if we have to drive over the same area twice just to get it out that's preferable than running out early. So we're just going to open this up a little bit more, hop into the paddocks and get it spread. Next up the plan is to drag this impressive looking medieval type device over the whole paddock and try and aerate it so that when it does rain the lime gets in. Now I've left this to after spreading the lime because I didn't want to compact all of the aeration work that I did with the big tractor that we used to spread the lime. I'm a bit frustrated having assembled this and put it together last night I quickly chucked some grease in the two grease nipples at each end only to find that they both broke off when I've applied the pressure of the grease gun to them. Now I'm going to tow this backwards where I don't want it digging up too much of the ground but even though I'm towing it backwards it's still making a fair impression on the drive so just be really careful when you unload and set up this device it's pretty effective. So the next thing I have to do is the secret weapon of this device. I take the bung out of the side over here and I'm at my water fill up point. All I have to do now is fit the hose in the hole, fill her up with water and she'll weigh several hundred kilos. These spikes will go all the way in the ground. I decided to try the paddock brand aerator because I was after a simple cheap solution for a hobby farmer. And I was going to drive this thing over rocks and stumps and roots as much as I could and see if I could damage it. Because if I can't you probably can't either. The aerator worked an absolute treat and aeration of your soil is often much overlooked. It's probably the equivalent of putting on a decent fertilizer every year because it increases gas exchange CO2 with oxygen, increases water penetration and it helps the nutrients from the top of your soil get down deep where they encourage those roots to grow and develop. It's really important not just doing a soils test but getting the advice of an agronomist that you can trust. Now I'm after some more organic options so I'm going to go and see Rose at Hoogies and find out what they've got for me. G'day Rose, how are you going? Hello Tim, how are you going? I'm really well thank you. Yep. Now I've got the soils report that I did and you guys provided to me a couple of weeks ago. I've already applied the lime. Very good. And I've looked at aerating the paddock as well. Now we're up to the good fun stuff. Yep. And I'm looking at putting some more biological longer lasting fertilizers on the ground. And I'm also looking at putting some down some nice seed with lots of different varieties. Can you help us out? 100% Tim, we've got lots of options. So you're after something perhaps a bit like guano that we've got here. It's a natural type of product. Yeah. It's not a synthetic type fertilizer. So it's actually BFA certified, so organically certified. So another option I guess to supply phosphorus, to supply sulfur as well. So Rose, when we're looking at our fertilizer options, the product that I'm buying today is a little bit more expensive than super. Yes. A few dollars a kilo more. Yes. But that's not the only thing you look at is it? Totally. When you're purchasing a fertilizer, you've got to look at a few things in the bag. Yep. You've got to look what you're purchasing. You've got to look at the percentages of phosphorus, potassium, sulfur. You've got to look to see if you require any trace elements. Yep. You've also got to look at the ease of spreading of the product. There's not a lot of point purchasing a product that's maybe non-pelletized. Too hard to spread. I've only got a little spreader on the back of a pallet. And it's more than likely you've got a PTO. It's got a spinner. So you're looking for a pelletized fertilizer, which the products we looked at this morning is pelletized. So you'll find it really easy to spread out. And perhaps the other thing to consider is that you've got neighbors quite close to you. Yeah. So you want a product that's not too smelly on the nose. Now I am getting bat guano and people will immediately go, bats. They've been to Tamworth. They know that they smell. Yes. This is fossilized stuff. So it's actually not going to smell. Correct. And it's not a nitrogen based fertilizer. So I can get the stock back on the paddock quicker. If I wanted to, I'm probably going to spell it though. Ideally putting fertilizer out is often a good reminder to go, we'll put the fertilizer out. We'll try and get the stock off for possibly two to three weeks would be ideal. Longer in winter. Yeah. Give the paddocks a nice break. Yeah. All right. Awesome. So don't just look at the price. When an agronomist recommends a fertilizer to you, sometimes they might recommend a fertilizer that's a bit more expensive. Yes. Don't just look at the price. Look at the reason why they're recommending that product and ask the right questions. Correct. Why are they recommending that product? What are the percentages and what advantage is that choice going to give you? Exactly. Because some people will just walk at the price and walk away. Yes. Without thinking more deeply about how you've tailored this to their individual soil test. Exactly. And you're looking at the application rate of the product as well. So it may be more expensive per bag, but you may- With a lower application. Yeah, a lower application. So the products we talked about this morning is a lower application rate compared to an alternative. Let's get spreading. All the very best, Tim. Thanks, Rose. Always good to see you. It's a pleasure. Always good to talk soil. Any day. Thank you. Yeah, it's a Hilux. She'll be right. Now, we're really lucky with the wind today. I hope that the noise is not too bad for you. We're going to do another single bag calibration on this spreader. See how far a single bag goes and that'll give us an idea of where to set the aperture on the emitter. So let's tip this in. And add pelletized bat guano to the paddock. It's embarrassing when the seed bag is bigger than the seeder. But there's a reason why I'm using this. It's actually very difficult to get a good quality seeder with the parts and the features you need for a budget price range. You're either spending 15 grand or 500 bucks. And I know where I'd rather be putting the 14,500. So this little paddock seeder ideally suited to a ride-on mower. So it is really only for small pastures. And that is a limiting factor. But the advantage you get is you don't have yet another implement to store for something you only use occasionally. It's got a beautiful driven agitator in the seed hopper. So that stops jamming. That stops misfeeding and uneven seeding. It's got a little set of aerators. And it does a pretty reasonable job. Look at that beautiful mix. Now I'm aiming for about 20 different varieties growing in my pasture towards the end. This is a good start. We've got some pasture radishes in here to try and open up the soil. We've got some legumes in here to fix nitrogen. And we've got some pioneer grass species that are going to give us great protein for the livestock. Now I know full well that I'm going to cop some flack for using small equipment in this video. But not everyone's got huge paddocks. And there are alternatives for those who don't to manage their land really well. And I hope that this showcases a few products and techniques that can be used to keep your little block looking great.
