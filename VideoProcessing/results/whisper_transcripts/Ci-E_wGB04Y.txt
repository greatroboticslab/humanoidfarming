 If you have dandruff, you probably have an overgrowth of fungus on your scalp. This fungus feeds on your scalp's oils, and as the population grows, it consumes more and more. This causes irritation on your scalp, producing more dead skin cells than normal. These cells get mixed with the scalp's oil, sticking together into clumps which is called dandruff, the white stuff you see falling out of your hair.
