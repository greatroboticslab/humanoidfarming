Howto & Style
 More and more things in our lives are like out of our control. And that is creating pushback, kind of emotionally, intuitively in us, to want to get more control of our lives. And we do that with independent self-reliance and security. So along with this whole, you know, techno-glitzy, sophisticated, you know, life that surrounds us all the time, more and more of us are feeling like, well, you know, can I take more of this control back and be more self-reliant and secure in my food, in my energy, in my housing, in my health, in my finances. These are all things that seem to be spinning out of control in a time of, you know, disturbance and unknowingness about the future. There's a huge push to come back. And I get that. And that's what's driving this whole, you know, homestead farming self-reliant idea.
