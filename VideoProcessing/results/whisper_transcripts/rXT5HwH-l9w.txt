 Modern Irrigation We have different modern techniques of irrigation. Let us learn about this one by one. Furrow Irrigation Water is allowed to enter the field through channels or furrows that are made between two rows of crops. Crops such as tomatoes, leafy vegetables and grapes are grown using this method of irrigation. Basin Irrigation A basin is formed by surrounding a flat piece of land with low walls made of mud. It is then flooded with water so that the roots of the crops are submerged in the water. Paddy, for example, grows best when its roots are completely underwater. Sprinkler Irrigation The water is dispersed through sprinklers which have perpendicular pipes with rotating nozzles on top. The pipes are joined to the main pipeline at regular intervals. When water is pumped through the main pipe, under pressure, it escapes out from the rotating nozzles in the form of rain. Drip Irrigation In this type of irrigation, the water is made to trickle or fall down, drop by drop, near the roots of the plants. This method ensures a minimum wastage of water. It is useful in places where water is not easily available. Video Shes in 여기는 Toil
