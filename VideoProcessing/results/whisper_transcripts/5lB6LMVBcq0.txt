 Now this will go on a trailer and the front here we have a two inch hitch so you have to have a two inch ball like how we hook it up on the tractor here so if I send on this here it's a two inch ball and you need a two inch ball to hook up to this to take it away. And if you don't own a hitch we can rent you one for five dollars extra or a drop hitch for ten dollars extra.
