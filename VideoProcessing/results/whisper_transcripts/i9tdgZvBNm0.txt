Howto & Style
 Uncle Tim's it's all good and that's no bull. Oooo it's frosty out this morning. 25 out this morning. Coming out to feed the gilts. They're up there in the forest. They'll come running here in a second. Here they come. Come on! Here pig pig pig! They're ready for breakfast. Some of you might wonder how pigs keep warm when it's cold outside if they're not in some sort of a shelter. They do that by building themselves nests. You can see, well I'm not sure how well it shows up on the video but there's where one of the pigs spent the night and the ground is literally steaming because it's so warm compared to outside. So they dig themselves in. Used a bunch of old grass and debris from the trees there. And it's just steaming. They stayed warm. Over here I have straw. You can see some here, there. I just have straw spread around the forest here in different areas for them. And they'll get themselves all nice and cozy and that helps keep them warm. It's insulates them from the ground. But yeah, they're able to keep warm. As long as they have proper amount of feed to feed their system, they can keep themselves warm. Of course, many of you feel fresh. When will they see a HoşgeldKarty are as fun. There he is. have fun and updates. There a lot of places like this too.
