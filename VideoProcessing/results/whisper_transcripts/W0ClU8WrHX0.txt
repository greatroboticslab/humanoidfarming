Howto & Style
 What if you could plant just once and then harvest for many years to come and all with minimal effort? Well you can if you grow perennial vegetables. These are fantastic vegetables with superb culinary qualities and often good looks too. They are great for filling the hungry gap, that time of year when the winter vegetables are done but the newly sown vegetables aren't quite there yet. So come on let's get started. First up is the globe artichoke, a big, bold plant whose thrusting eruptions of glaucous foliage make for a really architectural statement. You can start them off from seeds but better to get a head start with young plants like these. I just love this plant because it's so attractive in its own right. I'm planting mine into an area of ground that gets plenty of sunshine and that has well-drained soil. They might not look like much now but these grow into absolute whoppers. So if you're planting more than one plant like I am, leave about three feet or a meter between plants so they've got room to grow. These will require a little bit of aftercare of course, keep the area weed free, water especially in the summer and especially during their first year while they are establishing and then next spring mulch around the area to keep weeds down and to feed all that eager growth. If you're in a really cold region you might also want to cover the crown once it's died back down in the autumn with some sort of straw or compost to protect it from the worst of the winter cold. It's the tight flower buds that are harvested once they reach about golf ball size and definitely before they open. The buds can be steamed or boiled till tender, then to eat the individual scales are picked off and dipped into a sauce before sucking the delicious flesh from each scale. You're then left with the tender heart, the real centerpiece to the whole affair. You'll often get a second cut of flower buds after harvesting the first but do allow some of these to flower because honestly this is probably the most bee attracting flower I think I've ever seen. The bees absolutely love it and it's endlessly fascinating to watch them go about their work. Another perennial vegetable very similar to the globe artichoke is cardoon and it loves exactly the same conditions, plenty of sunshine and a well-drained soil. But in this case it's not the flower buds you're eating but the stems. They look a lot like a bunch of celery and can be used in the same way as celery. Baked, gratinated or turned into soups for example. And if you're looking for a bold statement of a vegetable for colder, damper parts of the garden you really can't beat rhubarb. We did a video on that a few weeks back and if you missed it I'll pop a link to it in the video description below. Now come and have a look at these. These are bulblets of Babington's Leek, a type of perennial leek which I'm told has a garlicky leek flavour. So I'm planting them into pots of an all-purpose potting mix. You can plant them directly outside into prepared ground but I'm starting them off indoors so I can keep an eye on them. It'll protect them from the winter wet in their first season and also stop my dog getting at them who seems to have a thing for leeks for some reason. So they're going in about, what's that, about an inch deep and I'll grow them on to plant out in spring and they'll be planted out about six inches, that's 15 centimeters apart to form a really nice decent sized clump. Plants should be left alone in the first year following planting so they can bulk out and establish. Then from the second spring you can begin harvesting the stems, cutting them off at ground level so that the bulb beneath can continue to grow. In early summer they should send out flower stalks and these flower stalks will contain lots of tiny bulbils. These bulbils either drop down to the ground or weigh the stalk down so they make contact with the ground that way. And when they get buried in the soil these will start growing also, further expanding your clump of Babington's Leeks. Other perennial alliums to give a go include the Welsh onion, a type of perennial bunching onion, and the tree onion or Egyptian walking onion which walks its way across your garden using its top setting bulbils that flop onto the ground, root and then grow. Another perennial vegetable I'm making room for is perennial kale. And I love perennial kale because it can reach epic proportions, almost the height of a person, but it's easily kept in check to a reasonable height through regular harvesting. Perennial kale is exceptionally hardy, it's very resilient too because it easily shakes off any caterpillar damage, and perhaps the best bit of all is that it can be harvested almost year round, anytime you need fresh, tasty greens straight from the garden. The best way to introduce perennial kale to your garden is with cuttings taken from side shoots. Big chunky cuttings like these which are about what 10 inches or 25 centimeters in length. They came by post already trimmed and if I bring you in a bit closer here you can see how they prepared them. The bottom here has been trimmed just below a leaf node and then the lower leaves have been stripped off to reduce stress from evaporation, leaving just the top leaves there. These are ready to plant so let's get on and do that. I'm planting the cuttings into pots of an all-purpose potting mix. I'll keep the potting mix nice and moist to encourage root development and keep these in a nice bright spot and then they will go out in the spring once they've rooted and grown on. This type of kale is Taunton Dean kale. Others to look out for include Dilbenton's kale, Ethiopian kale, which is a great choice for warmer climates, and the Sutherland kale, which has its roots in the crofting communities of the far north of Scotland, making it a very tough plant indeed. Now what if I told you there was a root crop that is easy to grow as potatoes but that suffers from few of the pests and diseases associated with the common spud? Well that'll be ochre, also known as the New Zealand yam. Ochre can be cooked just like potatoes too, boiled, baked, fried, but they can also be shaved raw into salads for a lovely lemony tang. And that lemony zest is also in the leaves too, so you can cut those fresh and use them as a salad ingredient. Ochre isn't frost hardy, so to get it off to a strong start you'll need to start it early by planting them into pots and then planting them outside after your last frost date about three foot, that's 90 centimeters apart. They'll grow on throughout the summer and they won't form their tubers until the autumn, so they form really late in the season. You'll then harvest them usually when the foliage has died back after the last frost. Just dig them up, dry them off, and then store them in exactly the same way as potatoes in a cool dry place. Keep over some of the tubers though to replant for next season. Another really popular tuber is the Jerusalem artichoke, also known as the sunchoke. These ones are from the grocery store and I bought them along just to show you what they look like, the size and the feel of them. It's autumn now and they're not planted until the spring, but in the spring I'll plant these about three inches or seven centimeters deep and space them maybe a foot apart, that's 30 centimeters, and then water them and grow them on. They're members of the sunflower family and grow just as big and tall and have pretty flowers as well. Once they die back in the autumn next autumn you can then dig them up and use them like potatoes for example. Have I saved the best till last? I reckon so. My final must-grow perennial vegetable is that royalty of veg asparagus. Asparagus loves the free draining soil and basking in full sunshine. You'll need a little patience to grow it, but boy is it worth it! The easiest way to establish an asparagus bed is using dormant roots or crowns which are available from early spring. As soon as you see them buy them straight away because they're better they're planted fresh. To plant them dedicate an entire area just for asparagus because you won't want to disturb them once they're planted. Prepare the soil by weeding it and then digging it over and incorporating plenty of well-rotted manure or compost. Then dig a trench about a foot or 30 centimeters wide and 8 inches, that's 20 centimeters deep. You then want to create a little ridge within the trench and then splay the roots out over this, spacing the crowns about 18 inches, that's 45 centimeters apart, and then when you create another trench space that the same distance apart 18 inches or 45 centimeters. Then backfill and water to settle. At this stage you can add a mulch of well-rotted manure or compost to keep wheat in check and to feed that crown as it establishes. You'll then need to resist the temptation to cut spears for at least two years to give plants time to establish. Then from the third spring onwards harvest as they appear for up to six to eight weeks until about midsummer when the stems should be left to develop their ferny foliage which will recharge the crown's resources for next year. You'll need to watch out for asparagus beetle which can chew notches in the spears causing them to grow crooked before setting to work on the foliage. Control them by picking or knocking them off into soapy water and be sure to tidy away old dead foliage at the end of the season. Other than that they're largely pest free. There are lots of other perennial vegetables to give a try and many of them are flower border favorites. For example hostas for their tender young leaves or how about daylily flower buds? All delicious for sure. Don't be afraid to explore but please do your research first to stay safe.
