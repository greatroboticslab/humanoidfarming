 Why did I put pigs on these cover crops instead of cows? We need excellent forages for our grass-finished beef and pastured pork. When I asked viewers what they would graze it with, most suggested grazing it with cows. Some even said follow the cows with pigs or graze them together. But I chose to put the pigs here first because they need better nutrition than the cows. The buckwheat, cowpeas, forage soybeans, forage bruskas, and spring peas offer a diverse range of proteins and amino acid profile that the pigs need and cows don't. After the pigs, the cows can graze the sorghum sudangrass and other forages which the pigs don't consume as readily. Cows don't need as much protein as pigs, and the carbohydrate-rich grasses will help the steers put on more fat as they finish out. This way, we are capitalizing on the nutrient needs of both livestock.
