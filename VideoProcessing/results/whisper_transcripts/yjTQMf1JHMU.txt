 How much food can you actually grow on one acre? Now for reference, an acre is just larger than a football field. The answer's a lot like your grandpa's underwear. It depends. An acre of sweet corn will get you around 20,000 ears, but you can get over 25,000 pounds of potatoes on the same acre or 42,000 pounds of strawberries, 37,000 pounds of tomatoes, and over 50,000 pounds of carrots. Then there's livestock, where a single acre of grass is not enough to support a cow, but you could produce over 2,000 pounds of chicken meat. Or better yet, you can raise rabbits and get upwards of 5,000 pounds of meat per acre. So at the end of the day, it just entirely depends on what you do with your acre.
