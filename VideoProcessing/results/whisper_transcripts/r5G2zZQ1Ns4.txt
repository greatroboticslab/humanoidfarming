 hey guys and welcome back to the channel how's everybody doing today so today is april the 11th and i'm just doing out going out around doing some scouting on some of our fields here this morning i just kind of want to see where we're at so right now i am in an organic wheat field you can see out here we are in an organic wheat field the wheat's looking pretty good if you look at it over the distance you can see we're kind of closing the row so the organic wheat is looking good now if you guys are new to the channel or you've forgotten we do have some peas out here planted in to this wheat here's some peas here here's a good clump of pea so the peas are here not super thick a little sporadic but we do have some peas out here with the wheat you can see them peas peas peas peas peas peas you can see we planted at a pretty sharp angle here the peas but they are here the wheat is looking pretty good i would say it's i don't know eight to ten inches tall probably maybe even a little taller in spots shorter in spots but not looking too bad there are some peas out here the peas are nodulating there's a bunch of nodules on the bottom of those peas so hopefully they're making a little bit of nitrogen these crops can grow together now there's not a ton of peas out here we had some population issues with them when we were planting them and what actually happened we were planting with our bean plate so an 80 hole bean plate from precision and these peas were just about identical size as that hole so we might have had our vacuum just a little bit too high and what happened was this pulled that pea in and actually plugged that plate so not another pea could get on there so we probably only had 50 percent of the holes unplugged trying to plant these peas just because the peas are about that right size to sneak in there with the seed plate from the vacuum so weren't getting the population we wanted out here so we're going to be a little light that's all right there are peas out here not an overabundance of peas but there are some we did have a frost here not too long ago and it looks like it might have set the peas back just a little bit too but this is what our organic wheat looks like here in this field looks pretty good it's been growing a lot here recently with the warm weather we've had so hopefully it continues to grow and we can have some decent organic wheat this year now our outlet for this wheat is the same dairy that we sell all of our corn to so this is where this wheat is going to go it'll be sold as grain and they'll probably run it through a hammer mill then they'll mix it into their their ration that's kind of what we're doing with this wheat but the organic wheat's looking pretty good i like how it looks i like how it looks so i'm going to go look at a couple other wheat fields here then i want to stop and look at a field that's got our corn mix in it to see how it's coming along and then got a couple other stops we'll make too and we'll talk about that when we get there all right guys and get a load of this field so this field was organic corn last year that we planted into alfalfa the corn killed some of the alfalfa and we thought the stand was poor enough that we were going to go to beans so we came out here and we put out 150 pounds of cereal rye but as you can see here or hopefully you can see i think the alfalfa came back three times as thick so we've got all this alfalfa out here plus 150 pounds of cereal rye you can see they're about on even playing fields right now but i mean this alfalfa is just going to swallow up a cereal rye crop so we are going to have to this is going to end up going to alfalfa it'll end up going to the dairy it's going to have to we won't be able to plant beans into all this alfalfa out here if you look right up here over the horizon here i mean that's solid alfalfa so this is i mean spots like this where i'm at we could probably get by with it but it's spots like that up there that are super thick absolutely covered in alfalfa kind of swollen up the rye crop that we're going to have to probably send this to the dairy i mean look at that solid alfalfa right there solid so you learn and you learn this stand out here of alfalfa was very poor last fall when we harvested corn and i said we need to plant cereal right here it's going to beans well that must have pissed off the alfalfa and it grew back twice as fast twice as thick and it is going to become an alfalfa field but this would make some really good forage here for our cattle if we decided to chop it and bag it for our cattle if not it'll make some darn good forage for the dairy cattle but that's what happens when you're in a no-till organic environment and you're dealing with alfalfa it's very very hard to deal with but we're learning we're still learning every day about it now we've only got about 100 acres or so like that so it's not like we've got a thousand acres like that that we plan on going to soybeans that'll just go to alfalfa it's only about 100 these two fields here that sit catty corner from each other on the highway so i think they're going to both end up having to go to alfalfa sold to the dairy and then it'll be alfalfa another year then maybe next year we'll come back and we'll plant organic corn into it again and we'll try that route again and we'll we'll nail it this time we'll nail it so here's the other field that's like that about 52 acres or so sitting here you know from the road heck it looks like there's nothing but shiro rye out there until you get out there and you start walking it and then boy oh boy there's uh there's a chunk of alfalfa out there so alfalfa it is alfalfa it is well it looks like it's pretty much pouring to the south and i think that's where the rain's coming today it's coming straight out of the south but here's another organic wheat field that looks pretty good i'd say this wheat's probably just a hair taller than the stuff we already saw uh it looks like that frost didn't do us any favors here that we had not too long ago you can see some of the tips are frosted off well that's no fun but this wheat's looking good it's coming along now i wish we could get our wheat on either seven and a halves or fives and i'm hoping we got something in the works for that if we get on seven and a half we'd have that row closed just a little bit tighter wouldn't have so much gap here and we'd help with weed pressure a lot better but i mean you can look right out there this organic wheat looks pretty good it's coming right along we've got quite a few acres of wheat out this year like 800 or so organic acres of wheat so pretty excited about it it's nice to have it back in the rotation here so we can get a nice cocktail of cover crops out there plenty early and great timing to be set up for organic corn the next year or if we want to throw a cocktail out there to graze cattle on later that fall into the winter we got that option too so we got plenty of options with the wheat being the rotation which is awesome and i'm just walking across the road catty corner here to another farm that we planted corn into alfalfa last year and uh well it's a sea alfalfa again let me show you here so here's what it looks like we harvested corn here last year and the alfalfa is back it's thick and it's going to go to alfalfa this year first cutting we'll take the fodder and all all the stocks they'll mow it tight they'll take it all it'll be a good forage now this field we did plan on going back to alfalfa because how thick it was last year i kind of assessed when i was in the combine shell and corn which fields were the thinnest and the two that we were just at i could have swore were the thinnest there was hardly any alfalfa there in fact i couldn't have swore i know they were thin and there wasn't a lot of alfalfa there but you saw them there's alfalfa thicker can be out there now so i was hoping they would go to beans but i think going back to alfalfa will be fine this field's going to go to alfalfa there's about 80 acres here it'll go back to alfalfa it's looking good the alfalfa's good and thick and you know if the weather keeps going like it has been we might even be able to get an extra cutting off of these this year just because of how well they've grown here in this early early spring but you know now it's april kind of acting like april it's getting wet and it's getting a little colder i think the about every night now we're getting into the 40s maybe trickling down into the 30s it's going to be a little cooler things aren't going to progress as much but overall things are looking really good and uh now let's go ahead stop at one more field here on this little trip while i've been out feeding cattle let's go check on one of the fields where we've got going into organic corn next year all right guys one last field here quick uh this is a field that is going into organic corn i looked at it just the other day and we've got another species starting to grow we can see that clover coming in now we already knew the rye and the vetch was there but now we can see the clover coming so that is awesome so here we are out in this field 60 pounds cereal rye 10 pounds hairy vetch 5 pounds clover and uh if you go here you can see you can see how tall the rye is there's my arm so it's pretty tall it's probably foot 14 16 inches tall so the rye looks good we got vetch in here you can see the vetch right there we got vetch here now let's look in here so if you look down here in that row you can see all that clover coming right there so we've got the clover coming so this field is looking good this rye is tall this rye is really tall i don't remember when we planted this sometime in october but the rye is looking good it's a sea of green as you look out you can see the rows pretty well closed up not quite but we'll get there soon but this corn crop should be pretty good this year based on how the covers are looking and based on how they're coming along and based on the time frame of when we got them in last fall so that's awesome so these covers out here look good they look good excited to see the vetch and the clover grow along with the rye see what kind of nitrogen we can make now at the time that we start planting there's probably 70 pounds of nitrogen out there give or take is what i'm shooting at my guess we could probably pretty easily make 150 pounds out here with the covers and the mineralization we could get there so we'd be tickled to death with 150 bushel corn but the rye is growing covers are growing clover's looking good the vetch is looking good it's there it's pretty thick really so it's coming along some of these in rows are a little thin so that seems to be the way it always goes once you get out into the field things look really good but as far as the time frame it is like i said in the beginning april the 11th now we probably won't even get in to start planting corn for probably another month so just imagine the growth these covers are going to have in another month now soybeans we're going to probably try some not probably not this week because of the cool weather but if it warms up maybe the next week so it's like the week of i guess that'd be the week of the 19th we might try some maybe on a few hundred acres if the weather's right now the only reason we're hesitant is because you can see the sewer ride needs to get grown a little bit more before we get to that window where we can effectively roll it have good biomass and have good weed suppression so that's kind of the hold up now as to why we haven't really tried anything yet i know a lot of farmers in this area have been going this rain's kind of put them to a halt but we're getting there we're just at idle right now we're ready to go just a matter of waiting on the weather waiting on the soil temps to warm up a little bit waiting on the covers to grow but we're getting there but things are looking up they're looking good so i appreciate you guys coming along on this field tour again hit the thumbs up button and leave a like if you enjoy these field tours uh if not let me know in the comments i enjoy getting out here and scouting and showing you guys what we're looking at but i think that's probably going to do it for this video it is starting to rain here the rain's moving in clouds are getting dark it's coming in from the south it uh it's time to get in the house so i appreciate you guys coming along i appreciate the support from every one of you thanks for subscribing if you haven't already hit that subscribe button guys and we'll see you on the next video
