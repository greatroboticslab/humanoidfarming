 Looking to grow your own food? Let's start by reducing the use of pesticides in your garden. Begin by choosing pest-resistant plant varieties for your garden. This can reduce the need for chemical pesticides. Practice companion planting by placing plants that repel pests near each other. For example, marigolds can deter pests from your vegetables. Attract beneficial insects like ladybugs and lacewings to your garden. They help control pests naturally. Regularly inspect your plants for signs of pest damage and remove affected leaves or fruits to prevent the spread of pests. Consider using organic pesticides sparingly only when necessary, and always follow the instructions carefully.
