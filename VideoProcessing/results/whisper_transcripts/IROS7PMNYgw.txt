 About $13,000. For instance, we probably made $1,100 or $1,200 in that day. Our days are 16, 17 hours long. $1,000 just in one morning. I'm Georgia. And I'm Michael. And we are the owners of Global Elise Coffee, Global Coffee Trailer. We both have worked in restaurants for combined over like 15 years. That's how we met. And we kind of wanted to own our own business. Yeah, we spent five, six years at a restaurant that we worked at and managed, you know, with COVID, we kind of, things kind of got derailed for us like career-wise and wanted to do. So kind of started looking at options of owning our own restaurant. And we thought maybe the best way to actually own a restaurant would be to start out with a food truck and kind of see how we liked it, go from there. Yeah, a little less overhead than other, like buying a building. So you started, you went and worked at a coffee shop to get more experience. Yes. And we kind of just started saving up money and keep an eye out on trailers, trucks. And yeah, we found one on eBay for, I don't know, $13,000. Bought that, drove down there in a day, brought it back and started kind of repurposing it to to be a coffee truck. Yeah. It was in Kentucky. It was a Sangria trailer. So when we got it, there was no plumbing in it or like the three compartment sinks. We built all of this out. And the countertops were all wood plank. So we had to cover those with stainless steel. Luckily, my dad is very good at construction and very handy. So he was able to basically do all of the remodeling that we needed to do. And that took about six months. We got the trailer in October of 2022. And then we had to wait until the spring to paint the outside as well because the outside was black. So we painted it, did the decals, and we were ready to open officially in July of 2023. So that means we've been up right now for a year and a few months. So it's our first full year doing it. Yes. Um, got to open right in April and we've been going at it now all season. So it's been kind of nice to have a full season under our belt. Yeah. So can you tell us about like your events or like hours of operation? Like what was the typical week look like? Typically, like right now, this isn't our full-time job. So we do a lot of Saturdays and Sundays. Every once in a while, we get a few Friday shows or if people request, we'll do a weekday. But it's, we usually have to have a lot of time in advance for that just because we have other jobs. But yeah, we try to do a lot of Saturdays and Sundays. We do this as a, as a mobile unit. So we have a commissary at the restaurant that we first started working at and getting experience in. And we still work there, um, during the weeknights and sometimes weekends. So, you know, they're flexible with us. If we do end up booking, like we've done like, uh, like tournaments this year, we've done, like we did a fair and stuff like that. So it's kind of flexible for us instead of just Saturdays. So it's nice to have flexibility because we've had times where like, we open the trailer at seven, eight o'clock in the morning and then we close at two and go right into work at three and bring our dishes with us and, you know, kind of do it. So sometimes our, our days are 16, 17 hours long. Sometimes though, we're only open for two or three hours doing like a concession fundraiser thing and, you know, we're closed up and out of there by 10, 10 30 in the morning. So it definitely depends. Very dependent on what we're, the event that we're doing. Can you tell us about your menu and the coffee and what you serve? I worked at a coffee shop for about two years to get experience. And so I kind of used their menu as a backbone, usually like menu wise, like coffee shops are typically around the same, like some of our specialty items would be our maple. My family actually makes maple syrup. So I use Michigan maple syrup, um, in our drinks. We dabbled in a few different recipes and we try to do a few seasonal drinks. Like right now we're doing pumpkin, which is also a homemade syrup. Um, but most of our staples, uh, syrup wise, we get from Monin, which is my favorite, uh, syrup. When I go to other coffee shops, if they have Monin, I'm always excited. So that's why we like to use it. Coffee wise, we, uh, started with using Costco coffee just because it was cost effective. Um, and so in the beginning we wanted to make sure we were making as much money as possible. So now we are actually going through a roaster from Caledonia called Roots Coffee. And, um, we love their beans and have loved the experience for that. And now you, we've kind of invested in some different and similar syrups. What's your best seller? We have a caramel lover, shaken espresso, which is very popular. Um, it's iced and we use the Monin syrup. So it's very creamy and we, it's very sweet cause we put a lot of caramel in it. Um, in the shaker. Yeah. And then for lemonades, we usually do a lot of blackberry or I should say any of our light refresher. Non-coffee beverages. We do a lot of chives and then lemonades. Um, blackberry lemonade is very popular. Definitely the Italian sodas have been getting more popular as we've been going. We started that this summer when we did the fair to try to attract some more kids and, you know, kind of widen our variety. And that like over the past, yeah, month or two has been like super popular. Yeah. Yeah. We didn't think it was going to be as popular as it is, but it has really taken off. Yeah. We had people want to do like a custom one for a show that we did. Like a youth group situation. So they wanted, um, like a pink princess one. And so we put sparkles on it. It was very fun. Yeah. How often are you switching up the menu? Like every season. Yeah. If we do, I mean, it depends on the show, but typically it's the same for like all of summer. Yeah. And we switched for fall beverages. Yeah. Thanks. How many do you think you sell in one weekend? So like today it was pretty steady for the first few hours. Um, a pretty average day, you know, total drinks sold. We have 87 drinks right now. And you know, we opened at 10 o'clock and it's 1 30. So we've had open houses where we've done nearly like 200 and two hours. So, so we figured what a hundred an hour is about the max. That was a lot of lemonade and things if we're using the espresso machine, it obviously goes a little bit slower, but for the grad parties, we were at like 200 drinks or yeah, 200 drinks in two hours. Yeah. And are you focusing on events or more of like catering events? How do you go about that? As of right now, we're doing a lot of just like events and setting up this spring. We did a few grad parties and we hope to do a lot more next year, next spring. But this year specifically, we did just a lot of like markets and like setting up at places like this. Yeah. Last year we had to be like salesmen almost with the trailer. We had to, you know, hit the emails really hard, look up events and drive further than what we have to this year. This year we've gotten lucky with more private events and people coming to us asking us to come out instead of us like being the salesperson. So that's been nice. That makes, lets us focus on other stuff and just like, you know, focus on the menu more and focus on the quality. When you do private events, are they, is like the person running the event paying for the truck in like an estimation? Are you still doing per drink totals? Are you offering discounts for that? Is it more lucrative to do a private event? So when we do a private event, we typically know like how much we're going to make because we ask for like the amount of people. Whereas like this, we never know if the farm is going to be busy and markets too. You never know how many people are going to be there. So we kind of like doing private events because we know what we're getting ourselves into when we agree to it. We've done like our grad parties. Usually the host will pay us to come out and then we just do a free for all on the drinks. We typically do about like $5 a person in estimation. Last year we, it was our first year doing grad parties. So we did like a big deal cause we wanted to get a few under our belt. So we did like $500 for three hours and that was as many guests and unlimited drinks. So that was just to get it under our belts though, for experience. That was definitely like a tough thing for us to kind of figure out is like how to get our foot in the door in some of the private events. But it kind of all depends. Like we got lucky with being close to some of those. And now we've talked about like with corporate events and people that reach out to us now, like, you know, doing the setup fee and like kind of making it a little more like flow better. So we talked about doing like the iced coffees in the pitchers. So they're self-serve and then if people want. So like shortening the menu a little bit and like doing a charge per person, but having limited options. Yeah. Yeah. Consolidating. Yeah. Food. Cause we don't usually do food for the private events. Usually they do their own. So that kind of in one way makes it easier, but another way, you know, yeah, we try to take advantage of the space with the bakery case and take that out and put in, yeah, the self-serve lemonade, self-serve iced coffee and stuff like that. So if you could talk about like one of your best events, like maybe how many coffees you sold or. So we started our first event we ever did was a 4th of July event. It was a parade in kind of a small community over by Caledonia, Michigan called in Green Lake. So it was a lake event with a parade and like a pancake breakfast down the road and stuff like that. So that was, that's probably one of our better, like one day events that we've done that for instance, we probably made 11 or $1,200 in that day. And that was from 8 AM to 2 PM. But we did the Grand Rapids open, which was a pickleball tournament this year. And that should have been a five day event, but weather made it into a four day event. But we still ended up having like our strongest sales out of that four days. We hit about a thousand just in one morning. And we did that consistently each of the four days. So, you know, I think if we max it out and we kind of like had a good flow and we really stocked up on our ice, our milk and everything, we could probably get about 1500 is about our potential in a day with this trailer. Is there any other forms of advertising that you do? Just social media. We try to be on social media a lot and stay active there. We just started posting reels and things and we've had people reach out because of that. I think when it comes down to like the business cards even, like just having the business cards out and just, you know, something for them to take and go off of us. Even on our menu, we have QR codes for them to kind of follow us and get a hold of us. So yeah, no advertising expenses. And then we do Canva for, you know, all of our graphics. We don't have to pay anybody to do any of our graphics or any of our social media. That's all us. Yeah, we all do it. So yeah, we probably put a little more into it, but you know, we work other jobs and we're still working at it. How did you come up with the name? So it's technically named after me, our boss at the pizza shop that we work at. Nicknamed me Lola. So it's my nickname and then my middle name and then coffee. Yeah. So it just kind of flows. I didn't want my actual name attached to it. So. Yeah. Can you tell us a little bit about like your expenses outside of like the food or coffee? So the equipment was a lot. We actually bought the machine from an old cafe that was in our area that shut down. So we got a good deal on that, but it was $2500. So that was one of our bigger expenses. And then our grinder as well. We had a different one and then we had to recently upgrade that as well. And those are two of our bigger costs. The generator was one that we had to kind of go in and we had a black Friday deal when we first got the trailer. And then after about a year, we realized we were overloading it, had some electrical problems. And so we upgraded to a Gen Max that is more capable. Yeah, more capable, way quieter. So especially now when we do some full events with other trucks, we feel like we're not being as much of a nuisance to them. We have a food trailer insurance that we do. That's through Flip. I think I pay, I think we pay about $75 a month on that. I upgraded and traded in my car when we got this trailer. So we paid our truck payment. So I drive a Nissan Frontier now that pulls it and highly recommend that. Very compact, get on gas. Yeah, so that's about $300 a month that we pay on that. We have our T-Mobile Wi-Fi hotspot. That's through the business. That's nice to take with us wherever we go. It usually works. Sometimes we go into some rough areas where we don't get serviced, but our Square device does have an option where we can go offline for 24 hours. We just have to connect after 24 hours to process the payments. Yeah. We do a lot of our own tax work right now. So I have a QuickBooks subscription right now that we pay for. And then, of course, gas is a big expense out of here. You know, traveling with the trailer and then the generator. You know, almost every show, I have to fill up the gas can and, you know, make sure the generator is filled up and ready to go. And then our actual food license. Yeah, our food license and everything every year. The commissary is nice because we get one free inspection. And we're seasonal, so we only have to do one inspection a year. Why do you need a commissary and why would you recommend it? We do the commissary because sometimes it's hard when we do the long days here. And if we have to go to work at our other job right after a show, it's nice to just pack our dishes up, go over there and get the dishes done. It's nice to use for storage if we have to, you know, we don't have enough room where we are, where we're going. We can, you know, store something there. It's really nice as far as the cooking aspect goes where we can just bake out of there. We don't have to worry too much about the labeling and everything. For our pastry case, it's like, it just saves us a lot of hassle and a lot of time. So today we are using a different baker. But if we do make our own goods, we do it at our commissary. We've been told it saves us a lot of money when we do it that way. So we are, yeah, we're grateful. They take care of us like family. So the goal is to get our own building and, you know, use that as a commissary and as a home base, and keep kind of traveling with the trailer and being able to just go back and, you know, restock and keep going. Do you have any other future plans? We actually, we've been looking at buildings. Obviously the market for that is hard right now, but we just recently went and looked at one. We keep our eyes out on Facebook Marketplace and like LoopNet all the time. Eventually we want to have our own home base, whether that's coffee related, bakery related, or just our own restaurant. But eventually we'd like this to be more full time. I think I've seen people try to, like we've talked about the use of another trailer. And I just think with the space that we have right now, it just doesn't make a lot of sense to do another trailer. With the building, I think that would be a great step, especially because that seems to be the most common question we get from customers is, you know, do you guys have a shop? Are you guys planning on getting a shop? And I think as the past year has gone, we've gathered enough, I wouldn't say clientele, but, you know, enough supportive customers that would probably follow us where we go if it's somewhere close. So just find anything that makes sense and trying to, you know, find the perfect fit for us. What are some positives and what are some negatives to running a food truck business? I think definitely a positive is just being able to go where the people are going. Yeah. You know, we've had times where like it was a really bad show as far as like whether things went wrong here and we had to go and refigure things out. Whether we had to, you know, whether we just didn't get enough sales and people didn't show up or bad weather, but you know, you can always just pack it up and try somewhere else again. Or like we just went to Arizona last month and that was nice to just not have to worry about anything. We just closed it down, didn't book anything and we just kind of make our own schedule. Yeah. Went on our way. So yeah. Yeah. If we need a break, we can take a break. I would say a con would be like not having regulars or regulars will go like weeks without seeing us if we're not like in the same area. But we have had people like actually travel pretty far to come and see us. We're from Middleville. So we have a lot of people that we know from Middleville that come to us a lot. And we've had them travel out to Holland or even Hudsonville to come and see us, which is always a good feeling. What's the furthest you've traveled for an event? We've gone to Jackson and that was what? Almost two hours. Yeah. So we did. Yeah. We did a Gus Macker tournament, which is a pretty popular basketball tournament in Michigan and now it's in some other states. But I think, yeah, that we did that for two days and yeah, it was round trip. It was like, yeah, over three hours back and forth each day. So that was really tough for us. And that was a lot of miles on the truck. That was like, again, one of our like first events. So we were just like trying to get things under our belt. And so we were willing to do that. Now we're a little more picky and can choose where we're going. And we'll probably be going that far. Yeah. We've gotten lucky this year where we honestly haven't had to pay a lot of rental or set up fees, which has been a blessing because, you know, it just needs more profit, more money we can put into bringing like higher quality baked goods and bringing in, you know, more stuff to the event, which is nice. You know, we've found some great people that have let us set up for just, yeah, almost. Yeah. Almost. Yeah. I would say just like an exchange. So the idea is, is, you know, we kind of like in the spot we're in, like today, you know, we kind of reached out to them and we thought that there was already a coffee trailer here because it's too good of a place. But usually there's places out there that have been looking for a place like us. So usually there's a mutual connection there. You know, it is nice when you do actually still serve a purpose to them too and can really help them and they can help you. So if you guys can both see it like that, you know, a lot of great partnerships for them. So over here we have our ice machine and refrigerator. The refrigerator actually came with the trailer. So that was kind of nice to not have to spin that. It just came with it. We added the ice machine and all the plumbing that goes to it. We have bean storage over there and extra syrups around here. This is our brewer. We just do one pot brewing. We keep our filters up here. Cups are here. Syrups are grinder. We have a knock box tucked back in the corner. This is the espresso machine. And the flow is kind of you grab the cup, get the syrup and then hand it out. Our register, we use square. And then our cash drawer is tucked underneath. Under here we have more storage. And then most of our like drain stuff, our tank is under this cabinet over here. But our plumbing for the espresso machine gets dumped into this bucket, which we empty. And then we have a 55 gallon tank. And then we just keep other like, like our merchant stuff underneath on top of the tank. We have a warmer just so that we can brew a few pots because we only have the one pot brewer. So this just keeps it warm so we can keep stocked up. On this side we have our pitcher rinser. It's kind of our catch all for like our accessories like spoons and our frother. These syrups we didn't have room over on our other syrup bar. So we just leave them over here because most of the time these are used for like lemonades anyway. So they're kind of in this area. And then we have our three compartment sinks. Hand washing sink. Under here this lifts up, comes out. And this is our dump tank. And then we have our water heater and then just trash and stuff. Trash bags I should say. What are three tips of advice for any other entrepreneurs out there? I still feel like I'm not like doing it. You know, sometimes I think about it. I'm like, I can't believe we are. So like you just, you never feel truly ready. You just have to go and do it and start getting your foot in. Don't be afraid to be a salesman either. Like our first year we had to, you know, write a lot of emails, get denied. But keep putting yourself out there and things will catch on. Yeah. A hundred percent. Like it's crazy when you look back and like just how many people we've gone to like know. Like we had, we met a guy that took care of us and helped clean out our espresso machine. Cause the water in the city that this was from was so bad that it gunked up a lot of the lines. And you know, so we've met a lot of great people like the industry. We've met a lot of great people as far as customers go that'll follow us. So, you know, try to be friendly and make the connections. And you know, usually if you're whatever you put into it, you're going to get out of it. So I feel like we also really made it a point to put quality over quantity as well. You know, we really invested in the syrups and getting some of the, you know, some of the best ingredients for our stuff. And I think, I think it pays off with the taste and the, you know, the feedback. So. So. So. So. So. So. So.
