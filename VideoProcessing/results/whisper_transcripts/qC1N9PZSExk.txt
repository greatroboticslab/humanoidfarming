 Thank you. Thank you. Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning for our webinar on inflation interest rates in your farm. As a quick reminder, all attendees are muted and videos shut off. However, we'd love for you to engage with our presenters today, and you can do that by using the chat feature found at the bottom of your screen. You can find the chat feature by clicking on the three dots on the bottom of your screen if you're joining on your mobile device or by selecting chat if you're joining from your computer. Before we begin, I'd like to introduce our experts on the call today, which is David Widmar and Dr. Brent Gloy, co-founders of Agriculture Economic Insights, as well as our very own Sarah Adams, who is our senior financial officer from Glasgow, Kentucky. As a reminder, this webinar is intended for informational purposes only and not for public or media consumption. Any opinions expressed by the presenters are their own and do not necessarily reflect those of Farm Credit Mid-America. With that all out of the way, thank you again for joining us today. This event will be recorded and distributed following the webinar to those who have registered. With that, I am going to go ahead and kick it off to Dr. Brent Gloy. Thanks, Luke. Thanks, Luke. Great to be here this morning with everybody. It's 730 where I'm at. I think our panelists here, I think David said we were spanning three time zones. So it's kind of cool what we can do with technology and looking forward to talking with you today about inflation, interest rates, and your farm. So we're not a lot of time, so let's just jump right into it. And I think last time when we were talking with you about the turbulence in the economy, we talked a little bit about one of the nice things about the farm economy is that particularly for people in the Corn Belt areas have a really nice thing called the natural hedge. And that natural hedge allows us a real built-in advantage, and that's that there's a negative relationship between yields and prices. So for instance, at the farm level, if we have really big yields, you're probably going to have lower prices. But on the other hand, if the yields are low, it tends to result in higher prices. And we've seen that to some extent for the last couple of years. So that natural hedge is a really nice thing in the farm economy, and it really protects kind of revenue and holds it kind of constant as conditions change in the farm sector. But once we get outside the farm sector, there tends to be a little bit of frustration. That frustration is that things that happen, particularly in the financial space, don't really have that feedback loop. So for instance, we get high yields. It tends to bring lower prices. People tend to plant less acreage following that, and it kind of feeds through the system. Whereas the money supply and interest rates and other things don't really provide that same feedback loop to the farm sector. So for instance, farmers could quit, you know, reduce their borrowings, but it's not really going to change what's going on in that financial sector. So there isn't as good a feedback loop. And so it tends to be what we call as economists more exogenous, comes from outside the system and just really impacts us. Now, we've had the benefit for the last, oh, 20 years of having an exogenous shock of lower interest rates. And those lower interest rates have benefited the farm sector in a variety of ways. And one is it's helped increase farmland values. Now, that appears as it could be changing. And as we look forward, I think last quarter we previewed this, there's a tough situation kind of brewing right now. And the Fed chair is a guy named Jay Powell, and he is in a tough spot. But this exchange between Senator Elizabeth Warren, who's a Democrat from Massachusetts, and is pretty good at getting her comments in the paper and on TV. And Chairman Powell, I think, sums it up pretty well. Chair Powell, if you could speak directly to the 2 million hardworking people who have decent jobs today, who you're planning to get fired over the next year, what would you say to them? How would you explain your view that they need to lose their jobs? That's a pretty pointed question, pretty tough stuff. And Powell fired right back, I would explain to people more broadly that inflation is high. And it's hurting the working people of this country, all of them, not just 2 million, but all of them are suffering under higher inflation. We're taking the only measures we have to bring inflation down. Therein lies the challenge, correct? So Powell has to do the only thing he can do to slow inflation, and that is to raise interest rates. And it's not a perfect tool. It's kind of a big hammer to a problem. And it doesn't work precisely. So I don't really have a lot of options. But the only thing he can do is raise interest rates. Now, as we look at what's been going on, has what the Fed has been doing, raising interest rates, impacted farm interest rates, David? Yeah. So this is data that comes out of the Kansas City Federal Reserve. And we monitor this data quite frequently. There's a lot of different interest rates going on in the farm sector. But this is the average rate that farms have paid for fixed interest rates on farm real estate. And this data series goes back all the way to the early 1990s. And this is one of those charts where we always say you could write a lot of different headlines and paint a lot of different stories with this headline. The first one that's going to catch a lot of eyes, especially if you only show the last four or five years, is that really sharp uptick in interest rates. You can see we were the average rate of these farm has jumped from a little above 4%. And now it's getting closer to 7%, 7.5%, almost to 8% on these farm real estate loans. So a big movement there. And in fact, if you look, it's the highest interest rates we've seen really since going about all the way back to 07. So there's sort of this, you know, you could see a doomsday scenario here if you just plotted just a few of these years of data. Now, the other piece here is if you zoom out far enough, you say, oh, wow, you know, yeah, it's up considerably from where we were just a couple years ago. But if we zoom back to the 90s and most of the 2000s, we're still at pretty low levels. I think we did an article review several years ago. We talked about how, you know, today's interest rates would be the low interest rates if we were in the early 2000s. We would be saying we have career low interest rates. This is a really great variable situation. So today's, you know, interest rate environment just kind of depends on what recent history we've lived through. And we've lived through a really low, a period of really low interest rates. And so this shock, this warming up here is what's the shock. I think the other thing that's worth pointing out here is look at the magnitude of that line. Look how much, how vertical it went. And for how big of an increase we saw, we just haven't seen this big of an interest rate shock in the farm economy, you know, in the last three or so decades. This is a really big shift in a very short period of time. So to unpack this, to recap this, one of them is where are overall interest rates? And that's lots of different ways of slicing that data. But the second piece is how fast this interest rate change has came on. And of course, both of these are going to have implications that potentially could linger well into 2023 and moving on into 2024 and beyond. Here's another look at the interest rate story. I think that's really important to consider. These aren't farm level interest rates. Instead, these are the interest rates for U.S. treasuries. In green are the shorter dated. The one-year treasuries in red are five years and the blue are in 10 years. The blue shows the 10 years. So you can see if you start over here on the left, most of the time those blue, the longer data have a higher interest rates than maybe those shorter dated, the green ones. But as we move over here to the right, we can see that these short dated maturities, these one-year T-bills have considerably higher interest rates than these five and 10 years. So this is this yield curve inversion that we're thinking about, but a lot of folks are talking about maybe an indicator of a possible recession. But this just gives us an idea of where this interest rate market is at and the different signals that it's sending to those who are using credit. And so right now we have a pretty high price for these short-term loans that are being made here. Still a high price across the board, but much higher for those short dated notes. Yeah, and David, that doesn't happen very often. Part of the reason that's a good indicator of recession, it just doesn't happen very often. It doesn't make a lot of sense. You know, think about the government borrowing one-year money cheaper than they're borrowing 10-year money or more expensively than they're borrowing 10-year money. It doesn't make a lot of sense in the long run. But what that's saying is that, you know, the markets think that over the long run, those interest rates are going to fall again at some point, probably because of an economic slowdown. So this chart here has several things going on. There's actually two charts sitting on top of each other. The first chart up here shows unemployment levels. And so you can see how this is played out throughout all the way back into the late 50s. The bottom half of this chart shows inflation. This is coming out of the PCE, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. And so if you look at this data over here to the right, this is where we are here in 2023. You can see this situation where inflation was really high. And it actually managed to, let's see if I can annotate this. We were over here, really high inflation. And this is where the Fed got their pressure and their mandate to start raising interest rates. And this is the conversation that they were having with, at the top is the conversation he was having with Elizabeth Warren, Senator Warren. And it's this question about these really low interest rates. And so because, excuse me, low unemployment rates. Because we've had low unemployment rates and high inflation, the Fed has had some cover to really raise interest rates a lot in the last year. And, you know, much faster than probably any of us would have anticipated a year ago. But we think that this unemployment story is kind of a canary in the coal mine. We've got to keep an eye on this because it's going to be one of those signals of if the U.S. economy starts to slow down, unemployment rates are probably going to tick up. If unemployment rates probably tick up, the Fed's going to get a whole lot more pressure from Wall Street, from commentators, from political forces, they're going to be hauled to Congress a whole lot more often. And they're going to have a lot more conversations like the exchange that they had with Senator Warren. So why are you harming the U.S. economy? Why are you putting this economy in a tailspin? And I think there's a little bit of a corollary here. Brent, I want to have you talk a little bit about the 1970s and what we saw during that period. Yeah, David. Well, I think the key point in all of this is say, look, people want to know how long is inflation going to last? Well, there's some evidence that inflation is slowing now already, but probably not back to the level that, you know, any of us want. So we're still, you know, over 4% inflation rate. With that low level of unemployment, the Fed has the ability to probably keep raising rates to get it back down until we start to see a lot more unemployment. Now, what we saw in the 70s, the last time we had this level of inflation, we don't have inflation as bad as we did in the 70s. But you can see there were two big peaks of inflation that took off there. But the real problem, I think, that we had in the 80s was what was called stagflation. And if you look at this chart, if you go over to the very right of that box, what you'll see is an unemployment rate that is rising as inflation is slowing. But all through that time period, we had inflation above 5% and relatively high levels of unemployment, you know, over 5% the whole time. But we had a lot, a lot of unemployment. See, that job right there that David just circled, that's when the Fed really got serious about raising interest rates to kill off that inflation. It took a big increase in the unemployment rate, went from, you know, just over 5% to over 10% unemployment. We haven't seen that kind of unemployment for a long, long time in the country, except during, of course, our pandemic experience. But that was really, really a blip. So that is a so-called stagflationary period. You hear a lot of people talking about whether we will have that again. There's certainly a possibility. Inflation has been fairly stubborn. It's coming down, as I said, but nowhere near what we would probably want to see. So I would say watch for more, you know, it to be stubborn going forward. And Brent, I think that stubborn is a really key operative word there. Inflation's pain comes from two ways, the magnitude and the duration. And so far, the magnitude has been, you know, getting close to 6%, maybe 7% on a very short basis, still above 4%. So not nearly what we saw back in the 70s. And the duration so far has been short. But 2023 is probably going to be one of those years where we step back and say, did we get inflation under control? Or was it just the beginning of a prolonged story here? So we need to keep an eye on this and see how this unfolds. The magnitude is the next question. And so what does that mean for farms? I think it means probably, unfortunately, continuing pressure on inputs and probably continuing pressure on interest rates. So I don't think you'll see interest rates declining much any time in the next short run, anyway. Long run, maybe, but not in the short run. One of the questions we get asked a lot is, you know, where will interest rates go? And so we have a little bit of a watch list that I want to share with you today. As Brent mentioned, as goes inflation, as the inflation story goes, that's going to be a really key indicator where this interest rate story goes. There's been improvement, but is it fast enough? And then does the Fed remain disciplined in getting us to 2%? There is a short term story here in 2023, but also a longer term story over the next five to 10 years. Unemployment rates, again, keep an eye on that. We talked about that for a lot of different reasons. And of course, the unknown unknowns, what are some shocks, maybe a geopolitical shock? Maybe it's a supply chain issue. There's been a series of things kind of happening in addition to the pandemic, in addition to the money supply situation that have created lots of uncertainty and lots of challenges for policymakers as they've set interest rates and they've tried to work through the economy. And Brent, I want to spend just a few minutes, have you spend a few seconds here talking about the Fed's outlook. So the Fed produces some outlooks on what their expectations are. There's some optimism, but there are also some diverging opinions. Yeah. So on the left, you have the Fed's view of consensus view of inflation. And you can see that they think in 2023, we're going to decline a little bit from where we're at in 2022, down in 24, down in 25, and hit the long run target basically in 25. So a year and a half, two years left to get to that long run target. But the other thing I think is important to remember is just how far off they were. I mean, they did not predict inflation to be where it is today. On the right side, they have their target for the Fed funds rate. And you can see that almost all of them are saying, you know, we're going to have interest rates above 5% on the Fed funds rate for all of 2023. By the time you get to 24, you start to see some divergence. There's a couple people. Each one of these dots is a member of the FOMC. You can see that there's somebody here saying, hey, we're still going to be over 5.5%, but we got someone down here, you know, under 3.5%. By 2025, look at how divergent those opinions are. And that's where I think is interesting to think about. I mean, these are really smart people. They're all, you know, some of the best economists in the world. They get all of the data and they have very wildly diverging opinions. So I think it's best to plan for, you know, in a worst case scenario as we go forward. You know, make sure that you're resilient to all kinds of different outcomes. So when we start playing these webinars, usually they, we play over a long period of time. We never really know what's going to creep up between when we schedule these and make the title and what the narrative is going to be. And this week has been a lot of political drama in DC, not unrelated to this macroeconomic situation. And of course, it's talking about the debt ceiling fight. We saw this cartoon and we thought it was really appropriate. Of course, it has the cicada on the tree and it says the debt ceiling fight. It emerges every few years, makes a lot of noise and then disappears into the, into the ground. And the debt ceiling fight made a lot of noise last week. It's going to make a little bit of noise this week. And of course, we'll probably all forget about it. Hopefully we all forget about it. Hopefully it goes back into the ground. We don't have to think about it, but want to make a couple of points here. I heard a lot of conversations, a lot of questions about how is this going to impact the farm bill? My quick overview take of this is going to have, of course, impact, potential impact on how the government spends money over the next two years. But of course, as Brent and I were kind of thinking about earlier, it's kind of hard to get Congress to stop, slow down or stop spending money. That's the thing that they generally like to do the best. So I anticipate a limited impact on the farm bill. Of course, we're negotiating a farm bill. We'll see how this farm bill gets resolved. Do we pass a new multi-year farm bill or do we have to pass an extension? The second piece here is, I think, perhaps more consequential is maybe on the ad hoc program spending that we've seen over the last few years. And purple and orange on the chart, these are ad hoc spendings from the MFP program to the COVID money. Even programs that were approved last year that, you know, the USDA is in process of getting payments out for this spring. These are all ad hoc. They're outside the farm bill. About more than half of all the spending that's taken place since 2018 in direct payments to farms has been ad hoc. I think this is probably where we could see the most impact on this debt strategy, this debt ceiling situation. Of course, if you want to roll the clock back about a decade, we were in a similar situation and we were trying to pass a farm bill and we ended up putting in these things called sequestration. And they impacted our ARC and PLC payments for several, several years. So we'll see how far that pendulum that we're watching shift. We'll see how far it swings and keep an eye on this. I think it's a little too early to figure out how all this is going to resolve itself. There's a bill that the House has passed. The Senate's going to work on it next. And we'll see what the details are as that starts to emerge. To wrap this up before we get to our lender expert here today, just a few strategies that we've been talking about throughout the, to wrap up a few strategies we've mentioned over the last 20 or so minutes is, you know, don't over-focus the Fed's next move. There's a lot of times we hear questions and we're going to ask Sarah about this, how she perceives this is, what's the Fed going to do next week? Well, as you saw in those treasury markets, those interest rates are traded on a daily basis and they've been moving up for a long time. We'll need to see how that continues to play off. Oftentimes, ag is more impacted by those 10-year treasuries than necessarily the Fed's next movement. When we're thinking about our new debt, when you think about, are we using long-term debt versus short-term debt? If you're adding new debt to your operation, if you're thinking about your existing debt, maybe there's been a windfall and you want to take some of those profits you've had and how do you deploy those profits? Well, retire long-term debt that's got a fixed interest rate that's really low. Be cautious with that strategy. If farm interest rates remain high, how that impacts your operation and your farm? These are great conversations to have with your lender. Does it impact our own versus renting of capital assets? Does it change the investment hurdle that we need to clear to make investments in new technologies or new capacities on our operation? And of course, step back and think about these government program payments on your farm, how big they've been and how unpredictable they might be going forward into the future. So at this point, we're going to shift gears. Make sure you send your questions. Brent, myself, and Sarah will answer all your questions in the overtime. But I've got a few questions here for our lender expert this month. Sarah, thanks so much for joining us today. Happy to be here. I want to get kicked off by having you tell us a little about yourself and your role with MidAmerica. Well, as Luke mentioned earlier, my name is Sarah Adams. I am a senior financial officer here in the Glasgow, Kentucky area, which for those of you not familiar with Kentucky, is kind of towards that south-central Kentucky area. I've been on farm credit for about 17 years now. My family, we do farm. We've got row cropping cattle out in the Barron County area. So we've got a lot going on. Well, great. I want to kick off by asking you a question that I think about quite a bit. And let's just say you meet a producer and they come in your office and say, hey, I'm concerned about interest rates and the impact on my operation. We just talked about that in that earlier strategy. As a lender, how do you navigate that conversation with that producer? How do you help them take this big level uncertainty and drive it to something specific and tangible for their operation? I think kind of what you said in the question is really the main point. Let's get away from the actual number of that rate and focus on what impact is actually happening or having on that operation. There's little that we can actually do to control that interest rate. It's going to be what it's going to be. So nailing down and focusing on how it actually impacts that producer is really where I try to focus. So ways that we talk about, okay, well, what impact is it having? What are your numbers looking like this year? We try to adjust, you know, is there any low-hanging fruit out there? Any changes or adjustments that we can make to the operation, to the debts that they have that would help save some money? We've had some, we look at their labor expense. Maybe they're paying for some custom spraying, chopping, things of that nature that we could maybe let an employee go and pay for the custom or having that employee start taking over that side of the operation. So just like I said, those low-hanging fruit, things that we can make easy adjustments to save some money. The next thing I try to look at is really get them to start talking about their break-evens and making sure they fully understand their break-even. More times than not, I have noticed that every customer figures their break-even analysis different than the last. So making sure that when we're looking at this, okay, interest rates are impacting it, but why? So far, most of my operations, an 8% to 9% line of credit operating rate, they're not going to see red at the bottom of that break-even due to the interest rate. If they're seeing red, it's from other areas. So trying to make sure that we are looking at a full picture of what that operation, that family's expenses and income is really helps to make sure that we're making decisions correctly for them in this future. Again, we can't control the rates. So let's look at the things that we can control and make decisions based off of that. Lots of conversations about priorities. That is one thing I'm always asking customers, especially right now and at year end, due to the markets right now and the rates and the cost of things, let's prioritize your goals that you have for this next year, the next three years, the next five years. And throughout this time where we've got these thinner margins, let's make sure that the decisions we're making throughout the year keep us on that track for those goals that they've set before. And that's really, really great advice. That sometimes the fear of unknown can be way more powerful in our decision-making than actually penciling it out and knowing what it looks like on our balance sheets and actually, again, asking questions. How do we still make progress towards our goals? So really appreciate that. Thinking about interest rates, do you have any other ways or advice that producers can help think about these high interest rates that they're facing? One of the things that we've really been pushing here at Farm Credit, we've got farm cash management. A lot of times when you see interest rates go up, you typically have those higher savings rates for those accounts. And our farm cash management today, I think, is over 3.7% on savings. So we've got farmers with a couple of great years on income. You mentioned earlier about the government payments that we've been seeing the last few years. So we do still have some cash that's out there. So having our customers move that cash out of their 0.1% earning checking account into the farm cash management account has allowed them to earn interest, earn a higher interest on their money, and then use those funds to operate out of before they have to start dipping into the 7%, 8% operating money that they've got with us. That's been one of our biggest changes lately as we've had a lot more money invested in that. I mentioned earlier that we've been encouraging producers to keep an eye on 10-year treasuries, really watch that market, and maybe avoid some of that day trading around will they or won't they with regard to the Fed and their next meeting. And it's, you know, how big of a hike or how big of a pause will they take? I'm curious about your perspective as a lender. Do you get that question a lot about will the Fed raise interest rates, and how do you think about insulating your thinking with respect to that media cycle? Yes, yes, to all of that. Every day I get that question about what do you think is going to happen, what should I do. If I knew the answer to that question, David, I would be a retired billionaire right now and not on this phone call. So, again, I do not know what tomorrow is going to bring. None of us really do. There is so much that impacts that that to guess on that would be a disservice to my customer. So what I try to do with my customer is take it back to let's make a decision on what we know. Let's focus on what we have today, the rates we have today, not what we think tomorrow's are going to be. If you've got something that you're looking to do, again, one of those priorities that you're going to have to replace that piece of equipment or switch out farms, whatever it may be, let's focus on what we have today, the numbers we have today, and then plan for that. Farm credit, they did a really great thing. I've been really proud of our cooperative. We offered a lower-than-market adjustable rate for three and five and seven years. It's really helped ease some of that pain on those fully fixed rates, going from 4% to 8%. So I've been working with our customers on kind of looking at those adjustments. You had that slide earlier of what's expected, 24 and 25, on the rates and where we're thinking of those treasuries to be or that Fed funds rate to be, and so taking that into account, offering and having these lower rates on these adjustables, and then taking advantage of our diversion tools in the future kind of helps give a little bit of a safety net to our customers. Yes, you may be paying 7%, 8% today, but that's the most you're going to pay. If you can cash flow that and it's a priority and you've got to have it, well, here you are. You've got this option. But in the future, when rates do come down, we can always convert that to a lower rate and lower your payments. You're not locked into that high rate. So that's a tradeoff. I think that's really an important takeaway here. Producers should have a conversation about the range of possible outcomes that they think are possible and then think about what are the particular products that might fit in there. So I have one more question here I want to ask you here. Warren Buffett has a great quote about interest rates and how they power everything in the economic universe. I'm curious about how you've seen interest rates changing maybe behavior throughout the association or the groups, the lenders that you're working with. Yes. So we have seen some changes in that. Farmers are still going to farm every day. One thing we have noticed is that the land prices are still high and farmers are still willing to pay that. That whole saying of land around here won't come up for sale again in my lifetime is fairly true. And so people are still willing to pay that higher price. So we haven't seen a lot of change in that just quite yet. I have noticed that they're coming to me having adjustments to their operation already made in order to afford that farm. So before I would say, okay, you want to buy this, let's see what we can do to how to make it work. They're now coming to me with a lot of these ideas already on how to make something cash flow. One thing I'm also trying to talk to, especially with our farmers, and I hope there's not too many underwriters on here, but no matter how many times we advise customers not to purchase equipment with operating money and things of that, it tends to happen. They're going to use cash for those types of purchases a lot. What I'm trying to make sure they understand today is that right now, IT debt, short-term debt type loans, are actually 1% to 2% lower than operating money right now. So trying to shift that focus in, you may have the cash right now to buy that tractor or whatever it may be. However, will that cause you to have to dip into your line of credit later this fall when it comes time to harvest? And if so, is it better to lock it in now, that equipment debt now at 6.9% or 7% or have to start dipping into 8%, 9% operating money later on in the fall? So just trying to really strategically think through all of that and slowing people down has been a big thing, making sure that they're really thinking through their decisions. I think that's a really great way to wrap up this part of the conversation. I want to tease in August, we're going to come back as part of this series and talk about the farm outlook. And there's sort of this, you know, two conflicting narratives here that we've seen in the last few months. On the left is tight global stocks and on the right is falling commodity prices because we've seen an early look at the 2023 production outlook with yields and trend yields and early acreage estimates and the possibility of building stocks. So when we come back in August, we're going to unpack where the latest commodity outlook looks like and what are the implications for the 2023-2024 outlooks. But at this point, I'm going to kick it back over to Luke and see what we have for the Q&A side of today's conversation. Thank you, David. And thank you all for joining us, panelists. Great information. I'm looking at the chat box and don't see anything coming in just yet, but I've definitely been trying to tease some of those questions out. I did want to ask Sarah regarding our farm cash management and some of those other tools that we have available for customers. Are there any other things? I know you covered most of them, but any other tools or resources that we have through Farm Credit that you recommend customers using in this time of uncertainty? I'm sorry. You broke up on me, that first part of the question, Luke. Oh, I'm sorry, Sarah. I was just curious. You mentioned farm cash management. Is there any other tool or resource that you've been kind of utilizing through Farm Credit Mid-America that you might recommend to some of your operations outside of farm cash management in this time of uncertainty? As far as to invest money or using our break-evens and really looking and digging into those? Either one. It could be do we have any break-even resources when you're walking through those with your customers and their operations? Is there anything that we provide those customers that might help? How do they begin that conversation? What does that look like at a retail office? Yes, yes. So one of the great things that we offer when we, especially if we already have a customer, that new analysis that we now have with Agrolytic and Agronomics there, it'll have a lot of those fixed costs, variable costs broke down into that. One of the things that we typically do is I will go through that back page, and for anybody that has questions of where that is, holler at me, but go through that, look at those fixed costs, look at those variable costs that we're seeing with our customer, and are they higher than our standards? I do a lot of dairies. One of the things we look at is a cost per cow, for instance. And so when you're working with your underwriters on these customers, whether it's a new loan request or not, you can work with them to kind of break some of this stuff down so when you're having a conversation, you can say, okay, you know, our debt per cow here, again, I'll go back to dairy, is $4,500 a cow, and this customer is at $6,000. Why is that? What is attributing to that number? What can we change and fix? So, yes, we have some really great tools, not only the actual tools, but people within Farm Credit that would be willing to help break some of those things down to help have that discussion with customers. We did have a question come in. The question is, do you recommend borrowing from FCMA for equipment and not using cash in this environment? I guess that could be for you, Sarah, as well. Yes. So I think that's really going to be a customer-based type answer. If I'm having to give an overall one, then I would say yes, highly likely borrowing the money for that equipment right now, potentially could save them money. Again, that is a very case-by-case answer, so I hate to say yes or no to it. That was a tough one, Sarah. Yeah. It's very nuanced. I would say yes or no borrow the money, and there's other, I say, man, you don't need to add anything to your cash flow payment. So that's just going to depend on that customer's financial position. Very good. We don't have any additional questions, but I did want to see, David, do you mind going back to your, the Fed prediction of what the rate will do, that slide? And maybe just tell us, is there any way that we can discover who those individuals are and why they are offering that prediction? You know, if you, you don't have to look very hard to find their names, and you can actually follow them on social media, and you'll see some of them are pretty vocal about their comments, and they're pretty quick to, you know, usually it says, the headline will say, Feds, insert blank, says this about the outlook. And so they're all looking at different geographies, different sectors of the economy. They're all thinking about things very differently. And so I think it is a very worthwhile exercise to read these minutes that the Fed puts out after their meeting. You can scan those, and then you could just, I don't, my Twitter feed is populated with all sorts of things, but some of the more valuable things are when you see these Fed governors or these members of the FOMC make different comments. It helps you triangulate, I guess. None of these folks have a crystal ball. None of these folks have a stellar track record, as we all know from, you know, remember when inflation was going to be short-lived. What was that term we were using, Brent? Transitory. Yeah, transitory, yeah. That would turn out to be a bust. But the idea here is let's see what their base level expectations are. Let's see what they're watching and what they're monitoring. And let's use that as triangulation to help us broaden our own perspectives, but also see how the future might unfold. Because each of these folks have a little different idea of how the future is going to unfold. And if we understand their base assumptions and what their expectations are, we can help update our thinking as, you know, new information becomes available. Ultimately, I think that that is part of what you want to think about is, you know, you have a whole bunch of people here that are all getting, you know, the best data, the best information. And they have widely diverging opinions about what might happen. And I think there's a lesson in that for all of us that, you know, we may feel like we know just exactly what's going to happen tomorrow, but we don't. And so as we build our business, we want to build it resiliently. And so the question, you know, about should we borrow instead of using cash? Well, it really depends on, I think, the situation that your farm is in and where your business is at. And what does your overall capital structure look like? And, you know, we want to be positioned to be resilient over that long term. So talk to your, you know, I think the best advice, you have the best tool that Mid-America has, those people and those conversations you have with your loan officer about your business and getting it positioned to be successful in a wide range of potential outcomes. Because that's what we're looking at here is a potentially, excuse me, a lot of different things could happen here going forward. And we want to be resilient through all of this because, you know, three years ago, how many of you would have thought we'd have the highest inflation we've had since the 1980s? Certainly not me and so it's, it's, it's, it's just important, I think, to remember build for resiliency build for a situation where you can make it through all kinds of different outcomes and be position, be successful in all of them. Very good. We had a comment. We had a viewer today and attendee on the webinar that really enjoys your podcasts. Thank you very much, gentlemen, with AEI and obviously we enjoy having you as well. So thank you, David and Brent for your expertise on the call today and obviously our very own Sarah Adams. We appreciate all that you contributed to the conversation as well. I did want to touch on one more time, David, if you don't mind changing your slides again to the next series that we'll have with you. I think this is a good segue into that just as a reminder and we're coming up against time. So if you have any last questions, go ahead and put those in the box, but maybe another little plug there, David, for, for the next webinar we have with you all. Yeah, heading into the growing season, it feels like we're on this knife's edge where if the crop faces any sort of supply concerns around acreage or below trend yields, probably have to keep rationing usage and, you know, how high will commodity prices go. But if we see the outlook of a big crop or big acreage or not enough usage, you know, how much lower will commodity prices go. And this has been kind of going back and forth and we see this in the commodity markets over the last several weeks and months. You know, that first USDA WASI report had over 2 billion bushels of corn carryout estimated for the ending stock. So we're at the beginning of the growing season, hopefully in August. Maybe we might know a little bit more about that. Maybe we're a little optimistic. But the idea here is how can we summarize what we know all the way through August, help you make plans for, you know, the fall and end of that, the end of the year sort of spending or cash flow management that you need to deploy. And then start thinking about that 2024 outlook because a lot of folks want to start making input decisions here faster than we can remember. It seems like you just get the budgets done for one year and you already got to start thinking about the next year. So looking forward to that next webinar. Very good. Well, I don't see any last questions. Thank you all for joining us today. And please look out for the next webinar series we have. And everybody have a great rest of your day. And week. Thank you all. Thanks, everyone. Thanks. Thank you.
