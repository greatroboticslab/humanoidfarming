 I'm so in love, even though we just met Got no clue what I should do next We'll get it wrong, we'll get it right Whole lot of tears, we both have to cry You'll learn to run, I'll learn to let go Years will go fast, nights will go slow Lord knows the best thing that I'll ever do We'll be growing up praising you
