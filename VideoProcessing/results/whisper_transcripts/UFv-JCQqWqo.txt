Travel & Events
 If you fall into a grain bin, most people might try to climb out. But this is nearly impossible due to the shifting grain, which acts like quicksand and can cut off your ability to breathe. Instead, you should create an air pocket around your face by cupping your hands. If you're trapped and sinking, move slowly to avoid further entrapment. Call for help and stay calm, keeping an air pocket around your face until rescue arrives.
