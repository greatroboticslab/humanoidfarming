 Food production needs to rise to feed a growing population. Yet globally there's only enough in reserve for a month and a half, while ever smaller numbers choose farming as a career. We need food. If we need food, to make the food stocks and to be sure that we will survive in any case, we need to support this agriculture sector. Masabu's report calls for a strong common agricultural policy geared towards food security and moves to tackle price volatility, especially speculation, whilst favouring small, family and organic farms. But with farmers ageing, only 7% are now under 35, income levels may matter more. The Commission's own figures show us that farmers earn 40 to 60% of the average wage of all of the rest of European society. So who would choose farming? Food riots could become more common as shortages affect poor communities. Yet there are fears the existing policies are still aimed at cutting surpluses. To the year 2050, we have to increase food production by 70%. And this is the reason that we have to change our approach for the common agriculture policy. Industry and agriculture compete for land, while 16% of Europeans live below the poverty line. The Commission assured MEPs that feeding Europe and the world remains the top priority. The report was adopted, but it cannot guarantee food security.
