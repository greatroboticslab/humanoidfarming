 The climate in my garden in the Adelaide Hills is pretty severe, with vicious frosts and scorching heat. Yet despite this, I've learned that there are edibles that will cope with these conditions all year round. Top of the list of thriving staples are the leafy greens of chard, kale and lettuce. One chard is enough to feed two people and it grows really quickly, from seed to plant in just two months. Now it will grow anywhere across Australia, but it will slow down over the hot, dry weather. But you won't really notice because it's so prolific anyway. And it's much more reliable than English spinach. Like chard, kale can be planted all year round from either seed or seedling. Now theoretically it's a cool season crop and its flavour is meant to be sweetest in the cooler weather, particularly after a frost. But I grow it all year round to use in my juicing. The only thing I need to do is if I'm growing it in the warmer weather, I need to net it with insect exclusion mesh to keep the cabbage white butterflies off it. Always in demand, lettuce benefits from succession planting to make sure you've always got something to harvest. It can stress a bit in the hot weather and must never be allowed to dry out. So I choose all year round varieties and provide shade over summer. Spring onions and beetroot can also be found in my garden all year round. I love spring onions. They don't have a limited growing window, whereas normal onions do. You can use the whole thing in the kitchen, all the leaves and all the stalk, and they taste delicious. Beetroot take a few months to develop a bulb, but in the meantime you can harvest young leaves to use in salad. Asian greens are often regarded as being a cool season crop where you should start planting them in March, but I haven't found that to be the case. In my garden I plant up a one square metre wicking bed with them every month to keep up a continuity of supply. I use a mixture of big and small varieties and harvest the big varieties first so I leave room for the smaller varieties to develop. As with all edibles, I practice crop rotation. That is, I don't grow the same crops such as lettuces in the same bed year after year. This helps with disease prevention and also helps stop nutrients from being leached out of the soil. I also stagger my planting so that I've always got something ready to harvest. You can grow these staples from seeds, but I tend to plant out seedlings because it saves me time. Why don't you experiment with what all year round crops you can grow in your own garden? You could be pleasantly surprised. I actually used to drill up.
