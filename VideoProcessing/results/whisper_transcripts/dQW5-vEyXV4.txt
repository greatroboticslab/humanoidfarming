And today we're producing another program from here in San Antonio, Texas, where the 2017 Bayer Advocacy Forum is underway here at Commodity Classic. And of course, we're addressing lots and lots of important issues that are impacting farmers and ranchers nationwide, one of which is farm labor and farm labor shortages. And with us is one of the presenters here at the Bayer Advocacy Forum, Brian Antle. And Brian, you're the president of Plant Tape and a fourth-generation farmer out of California. Let's talk about farm labor issues, farm labor concerns. I mean, up in our neck of the woods, we use a lot of farm labor for industries like sugar beets and sheep herding, etc. This is a huge issue across America for farmers and ranchers nowadays. Yeah, it's a huge issue. We're struggling every day to find labor and enough labor to get our crops harvested in a timely manner and not let them go over the hill to a point where we've got to destroy the crops because we can't get enough labor. So definitely the major topic in our industry right now is labor. Talk about your operation in California and elsewhere and the concerns that your operation in particular is facing. Yeah, so we grow 40,000 acres of specialty crops, right? Lettuce, romaine, broccoli, cauliflower, celery, onions, the whole list there. We grow in Salinas, California and down in Yuma, Arizona. And, you know, each area presents its own struggles. But, you know, we're struggling for labor in both areas, specifically down in Arizona, where we're having to rely heavily on H-2A program to get enough labor to get the crops cut each year. Of course, we're hearing a lot about immigration reform from the White House these days. How is the president's immigration reform ideas impacting farmers and ranchers and that important H-2A program you just mentioned? Yeah, you know, it's getting better. We're all a little concerned at first about the new president. I think after last night's speech, there were some things in there that gave us a little hope there might be some bipartisan work to hopefully chisel away, possibly, get something accomplished with immigration and get us on the right track. You know, the sad reality, I think, for a lot of folks in farming and ranching, no matter where you grow or raise livestock or crops, is there's plenty of jobs out there to keep a lot of people employed. The unfortunate part, though, is a lot of folks that live here in the United States don't want to apply for them. Yeah, that's right. I mean, we just spoke inside about it. I mean, on our ranches, we're paying $18 to $25 an hour with full benefit package and free housing, and we can't attract enough domestic labor. I mean, people just don't want the jobs. You know, it's not considered an elegant job. It's not considered a career path, I guess. So, yeah, we struggle every day, but, you know, there's plenty of jobs. Just nobody's coming for them. And the sad reality, last question for you, Brian, is because of this and the advancements in technology, we're being forced into doing less with more, and that's going to mean more technology in the fields doing what humans used to do. Yeah, I mean, that's the path we're going down is, you know, we can't wait for the government to fix the immigration, and we're not going to hold our breath that more people are going to come to work domestically. I mean, we're going to, you know, continue down the path of automation and technology and, you know, how we do more with less. Well, we appreciate you joining us, and the best of luck you did in 2017. Yeah, thank you. It's nice having me joining you.
