 Welcome to the operation safety maintenance troubleshooting and repair guide overview for Lifetrack the open source tractor as of December 2011. Okay so there's a couple of general comments to make about the equipment that you're being presented with. First of all this is life-size real dangerous equipment and all safety and operation procedures should be followed at all times otherwise you lose you risk getting injured hurt or even killed by these machines their operate they operate on 27 to 54 horsepower typically that is not a play thing serious equipment. The thing to keep in mind about the present release is that we are now in a beta release stage meaning about 150 or so hours of field testing that we've put on these machines but that's not not enough to actually see all that can go wrong with these machines maybe there are still failure modes we haven't seen and only after thousands and thousands of hours of testing will the machine really stabilize and get ready for general adoption by the rest of the world so right now this is for the developers and makers people who are aware we do not recommend this to be used by people who do not have awareness of their body of heavy equipment we do not recommend that you use these things alone and you should all always wear safety equipment such as hard hats eye protection ear protection gloves and things when dealing with this equipment there's another important point to keep in mind about these machines that that open source ecology is producing open plans distributed to the whole world so a lot of the machines may be custom so be careful if you're exposed to one or more of the machines because they may each be slightly different basics of tractor operation so this is a power device that runs from hydraulic fluid power so if you've got the power cubes on you connect the hoses to the inlet of the hydraulics this is the inlet of the hydraulic system then you can drive the wheels or the cylinders on this tractor so you step inside the seat and the leftmost valves these two valves to go forward depress both of them to go backwards go up on them to turn you you move only one or move one and the other one in the opposite direction to turn in the according direction which means that you'll be turning this valve system this the left valve controls the left side of the tractor the the right valve controls the right wheels so when they go when they both go together that means you're going straight if they go opposite of each other that means you're turning so it's it's same as a skid steer operation now what are the other valves the the second set of this last one in the first triple valve system is an auxiliary system which has quick connects on it so you can attach any device you want any external device like a sawmill or a rototiller or whatever whatever you you want to power you can attach it through that valve now the right set of valves is for the loader so this is the up and down on the loader arms and this is curl of the bucket so you can be digging soil or whatever lifting things whatever you need to do that's the basic operation not much to it it's just just turn on the power cube turn it on turn it on step into your driver's seat and you're off to go wherever you need to go we've got tracks in this machine so you can go through a lot of heavy terrain we are currently modifying the wheel drive system results forthcoming very soon what are the upon startup or any adjustments that have to be made yes there's a couple each of the valves has a pressure relief on it so if you want to change reduce the pressure to the wheels that's adjustable you do it by the pressure relief setting on the first valve that is useful depending on what kind of motor you have the rating of the motor that you will use on this the hydraulic wheel motors on the tractors they're going to be rated for a particular value so you have to stay within that you can use a pressure gauge to measure that pressure there the quick attach plate on the tractor is able to accommodate a number of implements like right now we have the bucket on and the way you put that on is you go up to the device with your quick attach plate and you pick it up you can pick it up and then you tighten the machine whatever you've got whatever attachment you have you you tighten on with the bolts and the two eyes that it will be later quick attach we're gonna install a quick attach lever in the next model as a regular practice you do want to check the integrity of hoses you want to check that your bolts are tied these are the whole frame is designed for disassembly with bolts and these are lock nuts so they shouldn't come off but make sure that every time you use it just do a good visual inspection to make sure there's no obvious errors like loose bolts or broken things anywhere and check that the hoses are intact yeah the hydraulic motors on the wheels can't can be replaced very easily for maintenance so if anything goes wrong that's the worst thing that can happen and right now we're actually installing the the full dismountable wheel set for this tractor we're experimenting with that seeing if if that actually works but if that is the case then then you've got a frame you've got wheels that can be taken off readily and replaced you've got a power unit that can be replaced so it's pretty much maintenance free all the parts are sealed bearings are sealed maybe a paint job we can definitely finish up a paint job on this to keep it free from rust keep it away from the elements it is a good idea to keep the power cube undercover so you don't get rain and and freezing troubleshooting what happens when the tractor doesn't run the most common thing is that there's a hose not connected that means you try to turn on the power cube and it doesn't turn on that means a huge resistance power cube never turns on what if a power cube does turn on and the tractor doesn't run well it could be that that some hose is also disconnected or that there is no hydraulic fluid in the power cube itself it's spinning but it's not producing any fluid power so once again check the fluid level check the connections those are the main things the only trouble the the failures we had on on this tractor was the couplers broke on the motors so if if you've got apparently you turn on one of the levers and say everything is working but the tractor is not moving forward well it could be that the hydraulic motor broke you need to replace it the coupler could have broken you need to replace that but other than that there's a there's a firm connection between the motor and the wheels so if the motor is spinning the wheel should be spinning if you can see for example here if this bolt this bolt might break then you won't get power to the wheels the motor will spin and be okay but it you won't be getting any traction so you have to these bolts are replaceable here regarding safety just this this is a heavy piece of equipment it's dangerous it's a power device don't stand under the loader do not go nuts on terrain where you can flip over and kill yourself you do want to have a seat belt on which is not installed in this model right here yet we do recommend the seat belt system we do recommend a skid plate on the bottom of the tractor so things coming from the ground you don't get hit by any things from the anything from the ground like twigs or rocks you do want to have a cover plate on the top so if you're lifting heavy things in case they fall fall or things fall on top of you you don't get hurt here so a cover plate on the top some safety shield on the top would be quite desirable and in fact on the sides as well there is a danger of pinch points here so stay away from moving parts like when you're inside the tractor outside of it don't put your hands in pinch points such as this point here where you can chop your fingers off readily don't put your hands in the cylinders or if you're moving them up and down pay attention to where your hands are so you don't chop them off the loader front loader has much more power than than it needs to actually so you can lift I mean the rated load load capacity of this is about 8,000 pounds but before you pick up 8,000 pounds you're gonna tip that's a basic overview of the life track operation maintenance thank you very much
