 Hi, I'm Ann Tartar and this is Kayla Maddox and we're with Tartar Farm and Ranch Equipment. Today we're talking about the Tartar Cattle Flex Feeder. So what do we mean by flex feeder? Most of your traditional feeders out on the market are just a solid round ring Ann. So when we go to talking about the closed top flex feeder for cattle, this feeder has multiple sections and at each section it's hinged together almost like a door. So as the cows consume hay the flex feeder actually flexes around the size of hay that as it shrinks. So what this is going to allow you do, no matter the herd size you've got, no matter the the largest mama cows, the largest bulls, all of that pressure is coming in at that feeder at one time. Sometimes you can see a feeder be destroyed in a matter of hours where they're trying to get to that last bite. That's right but with the Tartar Closedop Flex Feeder this is going to allow cows as they consume the hay it's actually going to give to the pressure that's been applied from each direction. And designed with safety in mind it's okay it's it's perfectly safe for your animals body to touch the flex feeder and compress it down. And it's going to make you happy in the end because that animal is going to be able to maximize the cleanup on the hay that's left behind and save hay. The benefits of the flex feeder is that it compresses around the hay and allows the cattle to get to that last bite of hay. We recommend 8 to 10 head for this feeder. Also always keep hay in your feeder.
