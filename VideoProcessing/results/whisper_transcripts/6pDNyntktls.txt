 Harvest season is an exciting time for cannabis growers, but proper preparation is key to ensuring a smooth process. First, clean and sanitize your harvesting area to avoid contaminating your buds. Next, gather all the tools you'll need – trimming shears, gloves, drying racks or lines, and storage containers. If you've been flushing your plants, make sure to do this for about two weeks prior to harvest to eliminate any remaining nutrients in the plant. It's also a good idea to stop watering a few days before harvest to help speed up the drying process.
