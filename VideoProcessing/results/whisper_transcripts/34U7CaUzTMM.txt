 Hi, I'm Farm to Table Chef, Tekka Thompson, and today we're talking about how to soak seeds before planting. So the benefits of soaking your seeds before planting them is that the seeds can absorb as much water in 24 hours being soaked as they can an entire week being directly in the ground. So this will give the germination process a much speedier time and then your vegetables will ripen sooner. So I'm just going to take my seeds and I've got a little just glass bowl here and I'm going to pour the seeds to the bottom of the bowl pretty much covering it. And then in this pitcher right here all I have is lukewarm water. You don't want it too hot because it can shock the seeds in not a good way. So we're just going to do lukewarm and we're going to pour the water over the seeds about 2 1⁄2-3 inches of water. Just like this. And voila. So the seeds will soak for about 24 hours, sometimes 48 depending on the seeds. And how you can tell they've been soaked is that they'll lighten a few shades in color and they'll become plump and round, larger in size and also softer to the touch. And then after soaking your seeds for 24 to 48 hours you can plant them in the ground and the faster they'll germinate and the faster you can harvest. I'm Farm to Table Chef Tekka Thompson. That is how to soak seeds before planting. Thank you for watching. Thank you for watching.
