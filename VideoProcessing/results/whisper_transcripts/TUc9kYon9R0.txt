Science & Technology
 The feeder leader company introduces the Boss, a three-point linkage single bale feeder. Proven to be the most reliable and efficient feeder on the market. Understanding the demands of the modern farmer and the time spent behind the wheel of a tractor were essential in the design and build of the Boss. Its durability is testament to years of working in the field with the farmers that use it. The Boss is a compact single bale feeder, easy to use and designed to handle both round and square bales. The easy to fit square bale kit slices and feeds the bale evenly from both sides. Once the bale is loaded, the farmer can simply back up ready to mount using different size fork lengths to enable easy and fast attachment. The Boss is designed for maintenance-free operation and features unique, non-corrosive, greasable nylon bushes over bearings. The fully enclosed drive shaft means no unwanted wrapping. The Boss's heavy guided roller chain is the strongest on the market with a 15,000 pound braking strain. Solid pins ensure that the weight of the bale is fully supported and evenly distributed. The direct drive attachment to the hydraulic motor slides in easily for a snug fit, preventing any loose silage interfering with the mechanism. The sliding top link allows for increased flexibility when loading. The hydraulic-controlled dual-action chain is smooth and efficient, allowing loading in any direction. The fully covered front and floor means no mud on the bale and ensures all material is fed out. And that means everyone is happy. Leading the way, the feeder leader boss, the farmer's friend.
