 Good morning everyone! The semi truck has been sitting in the exact same spot since we last hauled corn. So we hauled in enough corn to the co-op that we filled our contract, but the bin wasn't quite empty. There's still a tiny little bit on the bottom, but we need to sweep the bin out. Meaning we have an auger that goes around and we get all the last bits of the corn that's left in there. And we can haul it in. But the semi had been sitting for so long that the batteries went dead. So we got hooked up to a charger, got it started. Now we're ready to get into the bin. We're ready to go get at the end of the bin. Are you ready to go get into the bin? You can tell by the sunshine, it's finally starting to feel like summertime in Nebraska. I believe the high is going to be about 85 degrees for the next 10 days. next 10 days and there's a slight chance of rain every single day. I don't know if we're actually gonna catch any but fingers are crossed. Pivots are off right now because we did get about a half inch of rain last night so hopefully we just keep getting these timely rains. Today's video is sponsored by Goodchop.

Now I think you should know in all this video. It will be a motion to get So, let's go. So, let's go. So, now we get to take it to town. It's been a couple weeks. You think I remember how to drive? It's a little warm in here. Good thing the AC works. Does it? I guess I don't know. Hopefully it does. I'm an old grandma. Feel me good? Feel me good? Be back in the saddle? Are you going to say something? No. Clearly I cannot talk. Well, good news. I remembered how to drive it. That's good. I was getting worried. My skills might have been getting rusty. But don't worry. I remember. I was trying to... I feel like I've driven a lot of manual things lately. And I was remembering. I was like, oh, never mind. I don't need the clutch. And this pattern is a little bit different than what I've been driving. So, it took me a little bit to remember. But then I just glanced at this picture. I was like, oh, yeah. I know what's going on. Feels good to be back. What happened? Um... It's not rated for agricultural purposes. Nice! Explosion. New belt time. New belt time. New belt time. Do you know how excited I am for a shower? It's going to feel so good. I think it's going to be a cold shower even. The bin is completely emptied out. And we have like three quarters of a semi-trailer full of corn. But that took all day. So, the co-op is closed now. So, we'll have to haul this in another time. But, to home we go. To home we go. To home we go. We go. Okay. Look at how big, green, and beautiful the corn is getting. This time of year, the landscape, all the green, it just keeps getting better. Then take a look. Incredible. That's the starter. Made it home. Target for tonight. Because the co-op is closed. But we'll take it in tomorrow morning. But I think... You're about due for a shower. I think it's time for a shower. I'm filthy. I'm ready for a shower. Thanks for coming along as we cleaned out the bin. Jobs like that always seem a little bit easier when we're filming somehow. I thought for sure we'd be done with that by noon. But it's now 5. That took way longer than expected. But honestly, that's like any job on the farm. We usually start the morning off with like a solid four things on our to-do list. And usually by the end of the day, if we can accomplish just one of them, it's a win. So, thanks for watching today's video. Subscribe to see more. And an update on the crops will be coming soon. So, bye! Here we go. See you later.антиkin9. We're 楷 fetiini E decree Adding oil to a running engine is extremely difficult. Good morning everyone and come with Grant and I as we make our morning irrigation rounds. It's a little bit windy today but the sun is shining and it's supposed to be really hot. I think like almost 100 degrees. That's why we do our irrigation runs in the morning time so it's still kind of cool outside. So this pivot you guys should be really familiar with. This is the pivot that we took an old engine out of here and put a new one in, new to this location. We placed this diesel tank here and then we also re-nozzled this pivot. So if you remember we put a new sprinkler package on it with Senninger irrigation and so we replaced all the little sprinkler heads on top. And now I'm going to run you through from start to finish how to start a pit. First thing you're going to do, open this little box. I'm going to put it on start. Okay. And then I'm just going to check this. I want to check that my well has drip oil. Look inside. It does. Okay. And then I also want to make sure that it's dripping. Look in this little sight gauge here. It doesn't look like it is. Good too. It doesn't look like it is. There we go. Good. Well. Here we go. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Okay. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. check the oil. Looks a little low. You'd add some. Yes, I know there's no guard on this power shift. It is on the list to get done. We'll get done soon. Luckily we travel with all our supplies and our handy Ranger over here. Only the essentials. Jump pack, drip oil, engine oil, and what is left of a funnel. But as you saw, the rain kind of melted. Got a little hot. I think we should still be able to use it though. We still have got not gotten a new battery terminal. I like a battery terminal clamp to connect the cable to the battery. This vice grip has been holding on for like a solid month now. And I have a feeling it might be here for a lot longer. So some nice fans have sent us lots of vice grips. So I blame you guys for sending me excess vice grips so I can do things like that. Thanks. Thanks. And now I open this little box right here. I'm going to turn the throttle down. And about like here. And now everything should be good. I'm going to start. You ready? I'm going to start. I'm going to start. The carton is getting so big. It's like chest high almost. Look at that. We're getting somewhere. It's starting to fill up. I just started wearing oil racks to work. We're looking on the extreme there. Pinnin' us all the way up to pressure. Long. We're looking on that extreme there. Pinnin' us all the way up to pressure. Long. Long. Long. Long. Long. Long. Long. Long. Long. Long. Long. Long. Long. Long. Long. Long. And it's blue! And it's water! That's right. Now we're done starting it. We're good. We're good. Now we're done starting it. We're good. We're good. We're good. Let's go together. That's why you're not a national city. 아빠 włas shatter love with me. There's aentee in the city. Then I'm ready for it. I don't want to radio so sorry for you. I'm ready for it. I love tea. I sing and well. I love a night home. I'll stand down for you. They're good. Hi, everyone. I was buglling her a magnet. It's pasar 1 a week eating much more Orange Tree. Thank you. We have found a sprinkler nozzle missing. It's just dumping too much water out. This is what fell off and we're going to have to replace it. We're going to have to replace it. Let me show you why irrigation is so important. This corn is not under a pivot. This corn is under a pivot. And this is even bad looking corn because it's on the end rows. But I'm just saying like look at how sparse and look at how full. It's crazy. These things are a pain but they are so important. I'm just saying like I don't want. I don't want. I don't want. I don't want. Well, this is a less than ideal start to the day. Well, this is a less than ideal start to the day. Check out this thing. What in the world is that? International 770. It's a sprayer. Oh, it's a sprayer. How cool. It's like a first generation sprayer. This afternoon we are at a very special event. It's special for a lot of people. I'm coming here strictly for educational purposes. I like old tractors, don't get me wrong. But through and through I'm a John Deere gal. I don't know about all this red business. We're at Red Power Roundup. It's right in Grand Night's backyard in Grand Island, Nebraska. From what I've gathered, this event moves around from year to year. And while I am, like I said, a John Deere gal, there is in truth a lot of really cool old farm equipment here. And so I thought it would be cool if we took you guys along with us to see some of that stuff. I don't think these people like John Deere tractors. Look. Look at this big thing. I'm getting, it kind of reminds me of like the Big Bud type tractors. Yeah. You know? But it's red. Got that old square cab looking shape there. I like this sprayer here. Look at that. Those wheels look familiar? Those wheels look familiar? Kind of looks like something I could see on a pivot. That's kind of what I'm thinking. Right? Is that what you're thinking? Oh yeah, it looks like a pivot tire. I've changed a few of these before. This is an old style cultivator. This is what Grant and I were doing just last week. But our setup looks much, much different than this here. I think that's one row at a time. Can you believe these things still run? I mean, not only because they're really old, but they're case. This truck was used on a farm. This truck was used on a farm in 1928. And it still is in this good of condition. Imagine my Dodge pickup that I bought last year. Imagine that like a hundred plus years from now. Isn't that going to be weird? That will be weird. I wonder if the AC will still work. Sure. I would hope so. Golf carts everywhere around here. We definitely missed the bevel on that. Yeah. Look at them all. Oh, that's a truck. Look at that guy go. Haha. It is Grant's dream to own a cab over. Here's a little fun fact. I was going to buy him a cab over for his birthday a couple years ago. But the longer I looked at it, it was kind of junky. Cause that was all I could really afford. So, uh, maybe someday we'll get Grant his dream cab over. But I have a feeling, I have a feeling he's going to have to wait a while for that. I like that one. You like that one? Yeah. You too. Whoa. Whoa. You like that one? Yeah. You too. Whoa.これ, what did you call Cleve down here? Even at Creek's, it was one. It's a living Sche�� city. Yeah. Uhmm. My sister iswed and çalış I'm going to go. Compare the planter that Grant and I used this spring to this thing. It's all chains and gears. I think men were tougher back then. I think so too. What do you think about all this red equipment? I don't know. I feel a little bit out of my comfort zone, probably to say the least. Everyone here has a KCAH hat or shirt on or drive a red pickup or own a red golf cart or something. It's kind of a lot for me, but I will say everyone that we've met has been really, really nice. So it's kind of hard for me to say anything back. There's probably five or six buildings full like this. And that doesn't even count all of the stuff that's sitting outside. Or just under like awnings on buildings. There's so much stuff here. Look at how long the hood of this tractor is. Never seen one of these before? No! It's like an anteater tractor. It's what I used to call them when I was a little kid. Look at this. What in the world? It swivels. So over here, there's a swapping going on. So you can go buy, sell, and trade parts for all these factors. Someone just found a friend. Not every day you get to see stuff like this. So it's really fun that Grant and I are able to come to these things. And then take you guys along with us. Grant, do you have any parting thoughts from this show? I think I'll stick with my green stuff. I think I will too. Thanks for coming along on another one of Grant and I's adventures. Thank you for watching. And we'll see you in the next one. Bye! It is that time of year again when the tractors aren't in the yard to be filled up every morning. They're out in the field and we're going to be on the go using a lot of fuel with the tractor and the planter. So luckily, we don't have to do the whole drive back and forth, back and forth, back and forth thing. We can keep the tractor rolling all day and all night long because of this handy dandy fuel trailer. So it needs to be filled up with diesel exhaust fluid. This is like an emissions thing that all of our tractors need to have. So we'll put 100 gallons in here and then we will have 990 gallons of off-road diesel for the tractors right in here. And you guys have seen this thing before because we use it literally all the time. But we also have on the backside, we have an air compressor and then these are the reels and the pumps for the diesel and the diesel exhaust fluid. So we're going to get this filled up and then we have a treat. So the people that make this trailer, the FuelMate trailer, is Stellar Industries and they're actually local to Grant and I. And so we're going to get the opportunity to meet some of the faces behind this fuel trailer and then also see where these things are built. From like a flat piece of metal to this right here. So stay tuned for that. It's got some kind of kid security lock on it. Nah, just a Laura security lock. Oh no. Is that all we got? Oh! Oh, perfect. That should work. They need a reel like this thing has. You can go 100 feet. Need a rock? I don't like that. Let's go. Can't wait. Yes, they did what they're going to call us. That should be projet. I feel like you're up to me can actually use the next detail. Yes, wow. Yes. So they F cameras don't need to cry now many times by riding in the sewer mode. And very quick as but. There's plenty of space left on it. One more time as needed, head map matching, the seam. If you go to sign on top of the floor mode, the seam is for much to go to get the 이� ㅋㅋㅋ Yep, you can ask, you know? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. walls of blowout. And so after all the bomb threat in Vietnam, all these buildings are empty and they've sold them off. They're the one to buy them. So these people bought them. And all sorts of businesses run out of these. Those shit. Pretty cool. So all of those boxes had gunpowder residue and it ate away at the concrete. And so there's just little outlines where all the boxes were stored. Isn't that crazy? Okay, so the next building is their newest building. This one was not built in 1950. It was built last year. And this is where after everything has been pitted, everything is put on a pallet. All the separate parts that have been cut out from the laser machine and bent to the right degree. It's put on a pallet, wrapped up, have the code. And then it comes over here to their weld stop. And then everything slowly moves down the line. This building is for trailers specifically. So this is where the trailers are put together. We'll walk along and see some of that. They'll be looking at the Louds file. They will walk along and see some of those points. Next, we're going to pick this up. Tand View. Let's go. Ngay, ngay, ngay, ngay. Looks good. Go, go, go, go. Go, go, do. Tá- شي, ya, ngay.aaaa Let's get home, shoot! Yeah. Ta- carbohydrates. Ta- salaat- Ta-s Walking. I just think it is so cool to get the opportunity to show you guys the size of places like this. I believe I've said it before, but it's like floral farms how it's made. It's exactly like it looks like on TV. And it's fun after being in so many factories to start to recognize a lot of different processes and machines that overlap across all different industries that are part of the agriculture industry. So this building, a little bit older than the one we were just in, this is the building that the company that is now Snellar started in. So all of their employees for every different station used to operate out of this building, all the offices right there. They stored everything in here. They painted everything in here. But now they've been able to expand just in the last 16 years to like seven different buildings. It's pretty incredible. Check this out. A completed fuel tank. Looks kind of familiar, right? It's starting to look more like the fuel trailer we have at home. We've got all sorts of cool tools in here. Wouldn't that be handy? Excellent. Forget about this. And it might be ANSIC analytics. And right now we've been cleaning up! Here we have the washing, hanging, baking, primer powder coating, and colour powder coating. So while Grant and I know Stellar Industries best for their fuel trailer, they actually do many other things such as mechanic and service trucks, service cranes, service truck and van accessories, tire trucks and manipulators, hook, lift, roll off, dumpster trucks, lube trailers for hydraulic oil and car oil and stuff like that and combine head trailers. They are a very diverse company. It's been very cool to see what they do. Here's an example of what one of those old bomb storage facilities looks like from the outside. Oh no way! Look, a dirt bike dragon. How do you find those things wherever you go? So if anyone knows who this guy is, have them call me. Anyways, the government sold the buildings and so now all sorts of different people own them for all sorts of different things. You see a treatment facility. All different things. And look at that. They just keep going on and on and on. Some of the older ones are fully covered in grass, so they're camouflaged, but those are much older than those. I bet you guys didn't think this kind of stuff was in boring old plain Nebraska. If you go a little bit south, they actually, there's a factory where they made the bombs and ammunition and my grandpa stored corn in there back in the 80s. I am incredibly thankful to Stellar for the opportunity to tour their facilities, see where this bad boy is made, and also just for the chance to use this fuel trailer. It has seriously improved Grant and I's efficiencies and I don't know, it just really helps to have a mobile fuel station out in the field and I look forward to using it a lot this planting season. So stay tuned for that. Thanks for watching today's video. Thank you Stellar and we'll see you in the next one. Bye! Good morning everybody. And by good morning I mean, I think it's a little past new. Wild morning. Running around garden parks because there was some broken stuff on the planter, but we got it and we got everything set up and I think we're rolling. We should be good for now. This morning was one of those mornings where I kind of had to make the executive decision like the work in the moment is more important than me trying to film it and also like problem solve and diagnose and fix. I'll spray all the details. So I'll spray all the details. The point is we got things up and running and we're good now. We are planting seed corn and this is not a same time plant. And that is why the pattern behind me looks kind of weird. See, there's a blank spot here and a blank spot here. And then there's also a blank spot on the very outside there and the very outside there. So we are only planting, we're at 12 rows right now of female corn and we will come back later and fill in those rows and then come back even later and fill in those rows again because it's a double delay male plant. Anyways, so come along with me as we plant as much of this field as we can. I think the goal is to do at least 160 acres and we've done 20 so far. So we have a long day ahead of us. Join me. Per usual, we are in the John Deere 8345R with two Demco saddle tanks on the side. That one just has water in it for counterbalance. This one is filled up with 1034-0 and we have quite a monitor set up here. If you are new to the channel, hi, my name is Laura. I am a fifth generation, third year farmer in the middle of Nebraska. And we farm irrigated soybeans, seed corn and commercial corn, hence the pivot right there. For our monitors, we are running a slave John Deere monitor, a regular John Deere monitor, an Ag leaner monitor, an iPad, and a 2020 Seed Sense precision planting monitor. And then my two Ram mount phone holders. I want to show you everything that I carry with me in a tractor cup every single day. Okay. Start off with a big water cup and then another big water cup to refill the one with the straw. And then this morning I had a protein shake and then that had coffee in it as well as a coffee protein shake. Then this is the master bag. On top of the master bag, I usually have my radio, my notebook, and my gloves. Now we get into the master bag. So in the front pocket of the bag, I carry a packet of Kleenexes and a Ziploc bag with a wet washcloth in it to try and clean my handsome face before I eat. But I don't know. That can only do so much. A bottle of ibuprofen, a plastic spoon, and a plastic fork. I'm not going to show you these, but I do carry a credit card with me in case I want to do any online shopping. I carry nail clippers, earplugs, a Milwaukee marker. And this is a tub of Vaseline to be used as trap stick. The problem is that I always put it on, it seems like, right before I have to get out and check something. So I put it on my lips and then I walk outside and dust and dirt just like magnet to it. So I don't use this very often. The pockets, like on the sides, I just put trash in. For a cooler, like freezer pack, I use an ice cream tub. Like something to make homemade ice cream in. I like my cold food really cold. So this is a yogurt and it is completely frozen. It's been against the ice cream maker all day. It's perfect. It's frozen yogurt then. I usually try to have some fruit. So I already had a banana that I ate. And then I've got strawberries and oranges. I've got cheese sticks, yogurts, applesauces, carrots. I ate most of the meat sticks already. Um, almonds, dried apples, gum, granola bars. This is a Celsius that I really like. This is my favorite flavor. It's a peach mango green tea. These are so good. Um, what else do I have in here? I've got some cookies, a clip bar. I ate a lot. I feel like I ate a lot of stuff already. But this comes with me absolutely everywhere. And I love it. I don't know what I would do without it. I'd maybe like to upgrade to a more, uh, insulated cooler. Because it doesn't keep stuff cold for super long. So that's why I have to keep the, uh, ice cream tub as my cooler system. Um, so if you have any recommendations for a cooler this size, I don't want to carry around something much bigger, but definitely not any smaller. Um, and it needs to be durable and, uh, have some pockets in it. But if you have any recommendations, please let me know. That that is what I carry around with me all the time. And then of course, I also have my, uh, pliers and knife on my hip here. And, uh, yeah. And that was me just turning around. And we're rolling now. We're good. Um, is there anything else that I'm missing that I should be carrying around with me? So far, I feel like I'm pretty set up. But if there's anything that you guys carry around with you all the time, like at your job or tractor cap season or in your car, let me know. So I'm happy to add on to this. I know it doesn't look like much, but I find this so satisfying. Okay. Ready? Oh yeah. Look at that. Oh. Oh. There we go. Okay. And my back window is staying really clean. So, everything is planting really nicely. I'm super impressed. So, we were worried initially that because we've had such terrible wind in Nebraska, super dry, super windy. And the ground has been like concrete, just packed super hard. And about a week ago, we had a half inch rain and that really softened everything up. And so, we do have a good moisture profile, like two inches down. And that half inch rain just softened everything up enough that we are able to get the seed into the ground deep enough and it's sitting in a moisture bed. So, very pleased with that. Stopped for a fuel fill up here, thanks to Stellar Industries, for a farm special. I really, really like this trailer. I think the only person who likes it more than I do is Dad. So, I was on one bar, empty, blinking, start filling up. I bet we will be completely filled up in under five minutes. How many gallons do you fit? Uh, I'm going to say at least 40. Alright, we'll see how much this thirsty girl drinks. 118 gallons of Ruby Red Diesel later. She is full. And then I also use the air compressor that I have on the fuel trailer to blow out the cap. So now, I am clean, fueled up, and ready to go. What is keeping stepping on the headroom Party? geez.Ba sev lady that's strong. Haha. Should this help be国men? Keep doing well... Look at cause.uję equals a glass plate.ollsθηak Garcia cooked beaten beste presente Grant came out to make a food delivery and unfortunately Rizey came out and had a bearing I don't know how to do this. It won't spin anymore so I look behind me and there's like a whole bunch of trash built up there so something's wrong. Luckily we do have to treasure the farm but also since we're not planting with any of the mail rows I can just trade them off from here. It's pretty uh greasy. Kind of gross. It's gonna take a while. Need an impact. Nah. This little ratcheting thing. Before I bought this I didn't have a ratcheting one. I literally had to like you know pick it up. Oh yeah. I can't order it. No bueno. Nah. Nah. Thanks for doing it though. Appreciate it. Yeah you need to get a ratchet. Or impact. That's right. I didn't know I needed it until you were out here. I just Mario goes right there and I can't go.

So no such luck. We're so close to being done with the field. We have 10 acres left in the field. Hopefully I can finish because we don't have any other extras. So we'll see how this goes. All right. So my map switched over, but I did finish planting this entire field. So now I moved on to this one, but I just got the notification that my row number three is not planting. So I'm going to go back there and check it out. Look at that. Out of seed. All right. And pretty soon I would have been getting notifications on all the other rows as well. So that means it is officially time to pack this show up and drive back to the farm. It has been such an excellent planting day. Thank you so much for following along you guys. Hello. Hello. Hello.
