Education
 I've got different times on my schedule here. So I'll pass now. It's my great pleasure to introduce the two illustrious speakers we have with us. Both have made and continue to make substantial contributions to the sustainability of the world's agriculture and food systems. Our first speaker will be Dr. Ruben Echeverria. Ruben is a Senior Research Fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, IFPRI, in Washington, D.C. I first met Ruben many years ago. I don't know exactly. I'm going to introduce you to Dr. Ruben Echeverria for National Agricultural Research and then as Executive Director of the Science Council, the CGIAR. Dr. Echeverria studied agronomy in Uruguay and Agriculture and Applied Economics at the University of Minnesota. I'll also introduce our second speaker, Dr. Mauricio Lopez, who is a Senior Researcher at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, Embrapa Agro-Energeria in Brasilia, Brazil, where he's joining us today. He is a member of the advisory group to the Director General of the Food and Agriculture Organization, Rome. He has held a variety of positions with Embrapa, including Director of Genetic Resources and Biotechnology, Director of Research and Development, and from 2012 to 2018 as President. Throughout his time with Embrapa, Dr. Lopez has served in a number of national and international committees, missions, panels, and working groups related to agricultural R&D. He has received numerous awards for his contributions, including the Medal of the Rio Branco Order by the Ministry of Foreign Relations of Brazil, and an honorary doctorate from Purdue University. Dr. Lopez is a plant geneticist by training and received his BSc degree in agronomy from the Federal University of Bicosa, Brazil, and his MS degree in plant genetics from Purdue University, and his PhD in genetics from the University of Arizona in the U.S. Dr. Lopez, so with that, over to you, Ruben. You can share your screen with us. Ruben Duran- Welcome. Ruben Duran- I hope you can see my screen with the two pictures. Yes, we can. Thank you. Thank you for the introduction. It's a pleasure to be here. And this is a dialogue. For us, we are not professors, but we love to engage with professors and with students. We think sustainable agriculture intensification is the way forward. We are totally convinced. And we will try to talk about that in the next few minutes. And so I will try to make the case for sustainable intensification in general. And then we have one of the best cases on sustainable intensification coming with Mauricio from Brazil. So I really thank you, Professor Swallow and Dean Blade for the invite. And we hope that after COVID, perhaps we can pay a visit and check out the University of Alberta. It's been a pleasure to be invited here. So on the global context for sustainable agricultural intensification, you have seen everybody. I think we are all sharing this global consensus on the huge challenges that we have ahead. And you have seen this slide, perhaps, with many more bullets. You know, this is the major thing. Humanity never faced this altogether. We never had to think about increasing demand for food by about half of it, half of what we are producing today, including animal-based food. And we haven't had before thinking on nutrition and diets, not only food. We are thinking a lot on landscapes. And this is at the core of our commission on sustainable intensification. It's not just to intensify, but it's really to look at the landscapes and how to mitigate and adapt to climate change. We have to do all of that within planetary boundaries. And then we have, on top of all of that, we have to realize that we don't take decisions. We in the commission or in universities or in sometimes even governments about farming systems, about agriculture in general. We are talking about more than 500 million farmers. So this is a real, real big challenge for agri-food, for sustainable agri-food systems in general. So that's the context where we started working in this commission. And one way of summarizing all the gaps that we have is just to say three gaps. We have the food gap that I just mentioned. How we are going to produce that without destroying our planet. Meaning that we have a huge land gap. We are talking about 600 million hectares needed if we are going to produce what the demand looks like by 2050. So 600 million hectares is 10 times the arable land of Canada. And so that's a lot of land. How to do that? How not to do that? How to intensify in order to protect and conserve the landscape? That's a huge land gap that we need to work on. And the third mention here is the mitigation gap. We are talking about the agriculture in general. Landscape use produces 15 gigatons of CO2. And the target for the big agreement is 4 gigatons. So we have 11 gigatons gap on the emissions. A lot to do. And as you will hear in the Brazilian case, there is a lot going on in research and innovation to reduce not only emissions, but try to come back and sink some of that. So anyway, big, big solutions, big challenges and big solutions. Now, for all of that, I am biased from the agricultural research perspective that we are not investing enough. So I just want to, this is another challenge. How we are going to cope? We are talking about the global south, of course. We are not talking about highly developed countries. But if you look at the, at the quickly at the numbers, Brazil is orange. China is yellow, at least in my, in my slide. But the big, the big blue there on top is high income countries. Those countries explain most of the spending or the investment in agricultural research. Low income countries are almost invisible. It's the dark green at the bottom. So with these trends, what I want to say is that how we are going to meet those challenges without investing in new knowledge. This is big. So this is one of the key messages is that where is all of this funding going to come from to fill those gaps? Another way of looking at this is intensity. Intensity is very simple. It's for every hundred Canadian dollars produced in your farm. If you invest more than one Canadian dollar, that's a 1% intensity. And high income countries are investing about 3%. So $3 for every hundred dollars produced. But look at, look at the rest of us in the global south. Very low. With the exception of Brazil and a few others, China is growing. Anyway, so low income countries are investing less than one. It will be impossible to meet those huge challenges if we don't do something different. Now, so too little is spent on public agrarianity and on innovation despite all of these documented returns. And I hope that some of you, the students and the professors, I'm confident that you all know the literature. Huge rate of return to investing in agricultural research. However, we are not yet there on the investments. So there is a lot of potential to catalyze these innovations to transform agri-food systems under climate change. That will involve a lot of rethinking of how research and innovation are part of a systemic change. Something has to be different. We don't think that after COVID there will be plenty of new money for agricultural research. So we need to rethink how we do things. And we need much more analysis of the feasibility of technological innovations and their impacts. The little scarce money that we're investing in research. Are we sure that we are investing it in the right priorities or not? That's a big discussion to have. So don't worry about this slide. All I want to say is that there is a lot of new innovations, well-documented, coming from cellular to digital to food process. There is a lot going on. But it's mainly in the highly, in the more developed countries for good reasons. And if you look at the intensification there, it's visible, but it's not that visible. It's just one of them. And the colorful top of the screen are just the sustainable development goals that we all want to achieve. So there is a lot going on. And we in the commission are trying to see what's ahead. What will be the priority? Where to invest if we want to advocate for new investments? So the summary of what we see coming from the literature on intensification is that it is possible to feed by 2050 10 billion people without increasing emissions, without continuing deforestation, etc. If we raise productivity, which is obvious, in the same land we can produce much more, as you can see there in the slide. If we link agricultural intensification with natural ecosystems, there is a lot going on in agroecology these days. And we think that the sustainable intensification is part of that consensus on how to produce more without destroying, and how to conserve natural ecosystems, and also promoting innovation. One thing is research, and a different thing is innovation. So anyway, there are good things coming. So don't panic. But we need to do things a little different than we have done in the past. And I just want to mention a couple of things. I didn't talk with Brent on this one. I just, we found this in the website. You just have examples in Canada. We see that, of course, Canada is always ahead in agriculture, but we see that Canada is really ahead on sustainable intensification. For example, with the no-till system started 20 or more years ago. So there is a lot going on in Canada in this. So this is not a remote thing coming from the Global South. In fact, one of the challenges is how to adapt and adopt some of the practices that you have invented in Canada. We also see, this is a good example, the changes in farming methods in Canada have increased carbon sequestration 400 times, 400 percent since the 90s. Now, this is the missions, the prairie grain farmers. And I used to live in Minnesota looking at Canada when I was a student north of Minnesota. The prairie grain farmers, which are really productive, they are storing more carbon than they emit, according to some of the figures that we got in some websites. And you can see there, I'm sure you're familiar with this, and we can cover it if there is time in the questions and answer how to expand and scale this up. So let me chat a little about the commission before I close and I give the floor to Mauricio. After all of these challenges, what are we doing? Well, as Dean Blay mentioned, we are funded by one of the CGR programs. The CGR is an international consortium of centers, public, working on applied research for development. We are 21 commissioners from the Global South, and the secretariat is based in one of the CGR centers. What we really want to do is to advocate. We want to influence global investments. We are not lobbyists. It's a big difference between lobby and advocate. We want to advocate to say, look, there is evidence here that there are a lot of innovation in agricultural systems that could be scaled up if we do A, B, and C, and not X, Y, or Z. And we want to foster some consensus on metrics because there are many summits and there are many reports, and we tend to agree on the big frameworks. But then who is going to measure that we are making progress? So we are thinking on those two things. If we can advocate based on evidence, and if we have some metrics, basic metrics, to follow the progress, we may have something to offer. The commission is only a two-year commission, so we are going to evaporate at the end of this year. So we have a short time ahead. Now, we want to increase availability and access to affordable, safe, and nutritious food. We want to improve productivity. This is the key points that we want to advocate for. We want to improve the natural environment, improve social equity, and reduce poverty. So we are looking at all of these studies, and don't worry again about this slide. It's just to show some colors. There are a lot of studies. So we look at just 30, for example, of the 90 reports that we reviewed. We painted here how many of those are covering what related to cosine. And the conclusion is that not many look at the global south. And that was one of the reasons why the commission, we are looking at something to add value. So if you look on the right, most of the yellow there is not focusing on the global south. If you look on the left, most of the scope is global. But it's not really particularly looking at the global south. So we thought that we may have some space, not to duplicate, but to add some value. So we are looking at six questions. One is to watch out what, from all of these scenarios and futurology and foresight and reports, what's really the, what's the three or four takeaways on the future of food and innovation to start this advocacy based on evidence? So we want to scan what's ahead from all of these reports. Second, we want to measure how much is being invested in innovation. We know we have some good numbers of investments in research, but not too much on innovation in the global south. So if we can prove that there is X invested, that will be the benchmark. So then we can advocate to say, well, perhaps a little more is needed. Third, we want to have examples. Perhaps the Brazilian example that you will see soon is a great example on the pathways for innovation. How to get there, not only to talk about big academic good papers and books, but say, okay, what's the pathway to be there? We want to work a lot on the innovation and the environment. We will see that we believe that the commission has a lot to offer on the environmental aspect and the agroecology aspects and the ecosystem services aspects of innovation, and also social objectives, particularly on poverty, equity, and so on. And finally, as I mentioned, metrics. We would like to have a few metrics to say, well, if this is the benchmark what's been invested, and we think there is a funding gap of X, how will be the metrics to make progress? So with that, we are looking at not only technology, but we are looking at the policy framework, we are looking at the institutional framework, and we are looking about how much finance is really coming into sustainable agricultural intensification in the global south. So we have a few things going on. The evidence on the left, those four things that I mentioned already, the investment. We are coming very soon with a major report on how much is being invested in innovation. We are estimating the investment gap. We are trying to get some good approaches and instruments, and finally put some pathways and priorities on the table. We have our own networks, of course, to advocate. And we are doing this quite different from other efforts. We are doing this in a public inquiry mode. So we say, well, we don't have all the answers, but we have lots of questions. How about coming and dialogue? So we are organizing several dialogues of all of these six points. So this is who we are, a colorful picture from the global south. And there is a website that you can check, and we keep posting there good news that we are getting from the commission. So with that, I hope I use no more than 20 minutes, and I let my best friend in Brazil, Mauricio, continue with the good case of Brazil. Thank you. So thank you very much, Ruben. And yes, you took less than your 20 minutes, so good job. So Mauricio, you have plenty of time to tell us the case from Brazil. Do you want to share your screen with us? Yes, just a few words before I share my screen. My compliments to you all. It's really great to join Ruben and you all in this lecture to present and discuss with you innovations on sustainable agriculture intensification in the global south. Before I start, I would like to congratulate our Canadian farmers and all of you dedicated to agricultural innovation in this very special day in Canada. In the next 30 minutes, I will try to complement Ruben's excellent talk, telling you how sustainable agriculture is evolving in the tropics. I will use the case of my country, Brazil, which has most of its territory in the tropical belt of the world. Brazil is really an immense country, but most of our land is in the tropical belt. Many of you may be hearing a lot of things about Brazil over the years, some not so good related to deforestation in the Amazon, wildfires in the Pantanal, questions related to sustainability of our agriculture, among other things. Well, this is obviously unfortunate, but obviously these things don't tell all about my country, Brazil. And I hope to convince you today that the trajectory of the Brazilian agriculture in the past 30, 40 years is really amazing. It's impressive. And I will try to show you why, illustrating how research and innovation and a lot of investment in intensification practices are helping us to overcome problems and more than that, helping us drive our agriculture in the direction of sustainability. I will share my screen now with you, hoping that you can see my slides. OK. We're good. I hope it's visible to all of you. So what I intend to do today is to show you what, how agriculture is evolving in the tropical belt with emphasis in Brazil. I will divide this talk in three parts. The first part on modernization and expansion of agricultural production in Brazil. The second part, our investment in policies. Brazil has done quite well in passing public policies to support sustainability in agriculture. And coming to the present and also thinking about the future, the challenges for intensification and also the challenge of increasing multifunctionality in rural areas, bringing more synergy between agriculture and the SDGs and the emerging bioeconomics. Essentially, this is what I would like to discuss with you today. Starting obviously to tell you the obvious, how challenging it is to farm in the tropics. It is in the tropical areas that we have the more intense conditions, intense biotic and abiotic stresses, higher frequency of extreme events like flooding, water logging, heat waves. All this being increased or intensified with the process of climate change. Climate change may even favor countries in the temperate areas, but it can be catastrophic to countries like Brazil and countries in Sub Saharan Africa that will have this stress tremendously intensified. Contrary to what many people think that we have lots of fertile land. It's not true. Most of our soils are quite acidic and poor as this slide shows the concentration of oxy salts in South America and Sub Saharan Africa. Soils are quite acidic and nutrient poor and that poses quite a bit of challenges to agricultural development. The other challenge in the tropical belt is this responsibility to avoid or to minimize environmental degradation since most of the mega diverse countries are located in this region. This is the case of Brazil. This is the case of Brazil. Brazil is has six biomes. It's it's quite diverse with a very rich biological diversity. It's it's a very complex and fragmented environmental resources. So very, very challenging to manage agriculture in such complex and important environments. Well, because of all this Brazil was not the food secure country until the 70s. We had the limited understanding of this complex reality of our huge complex territory. We had low agricultural production and low yields in it for most of our cropping systems, constant food supply crisis, widespread horror poverty. Brazil was known essentially as a coffee and sugar sugar producer until the 70s. And we didn't have many ways to import technologies from advanced countries, which were mostly in the temperate areas because technologies were not fit or adapted to this reality. Well, despite of all this in 40 years, Brazil has been able to develop a science based advanced tropical agriculture. And basically the reason is the investment that the country was able to make in infrastructure, in education, in public policies, in support programs. Brazil invested quite a bit in institutional innovation, in partnerships and in funding research and innovation. We develop our federal research system, which is the largest agricultural research organization in Latin America. And also in Latin America. Lots of regional state research institutes. Brazil has an excellent coverage of agricultural universities, which are well distributed throughout the country. And more recently, a lot of participation, a lot of investment from the private sector, including investment in R&D, not only in innovation. As I said, Brazil consolidated the largest agricultural research organization in Latin America. And Brapa is a large network of research centers. We have 42 research units, almost 10,000 employees, 2,400 scientists, a budget of around $1 billion, which has been maintained over the past 10 years. Obviously, we have a different situation now with the pandemics, but we hope it will be regular after that. And also quite a bit of cooperation, including scientific cooperation in the US, in Europe. We have technical labs. We have labs and technical cooperation in different parts of the world. Also in Sub-Saharan Africa and in Latin America. So fortunately, we have been able to build a state of the art infrastructure for research and innovation in agriculture. I give you just one example of our leading center in sustainable intensification research, which is located in the state of Mato Grosso, the interior, the western part of Brazil. Mato Grosso is the largest agricultural producer in Brazil today. This is a very interesting center entirely dedicated to site research. The other important and distinctive feature of Brazil is the investment, the spending in research and innovation in a certain period of time. This image shows you the Brazilian was 11th in terms of public agricultural research and development spending in the 60s. And by 2007, we had jumped to the fifth position. So it was a huge impact that the increasing spending over this period produced in our innovation system. It helped us to really put in place this very interesting pathway of agricultural innovation in the country that I tried to summarize in a nutshell in this image. First, a huge effort in expansion of agricultural production from the southern tip of Brazil, which is more temperate to the central part of Brazil, which is essentially tropical. After this, a lot of investment in competitivity and production of surplus that helped Brazil also to position itself as an important provider of food to the world and important export. Brazil is, as a country, the second exporter of food and agricultural products today. Brazil is, as a country, the second exporter of food and agricultural products today. And then we moved in the past 15 to 20 years to this sustainability challenge to increase sustainability, to remove the difficulties, the footprints of this first two phases. And we are now entering this new phase of exploring the multifunctionality of our agricultural systems to align our country with the SDG. And also with the emerging bioeconomy. The expansion was very, of agriculture to the tropical area was very important to bring development to an area that was essentially a wasteland in the seventies. This slide shows you the city of Sinop in the state of Mato Grosso when this city was created about 40, more than 40 years ago. It was just a clearing in this huge savannah. There were nothing there. I took this picture in 2015. So this environment is completely changed. So this, the expansion of agriculture in this area was very important to bring development to the interior of Brazil. So I tried to put in one slide what were the big transformation that took place in our agricultural innovation system. Brazil, by investing in institutions, investing in human resources formation, in partnerships, was able to do this three things that were very important in these two first phases. Transform our acidic poor soils into fertile land. Invest in the tropicalization of crops and animal production systems. Invest in the tropicalization of crops and animal production systems. That at that time in the seventies and the eighties, most of our, most of the important agricultural species in Brazil were not tropicalized. And then lots of emphasis in conservation practices and in managing risks. These three developments were very key to help us advance and terrorize our agriculture and to gain competitivity. And obviously to gain, to become a food secure country. Like building soil fertility. This was a huge challenge to us. How to, to farm these soils. This is a natural soil with the soybeans and soil with fertility that has been built with soybeans. A huge difference. So, managing a crop nutrition. Tremendously important. As you certainly know, oxysols are very complicated in terms of crop nutrition, like phosphorus. So managing nutrients like phosphorus and many others in an efficient way was also a big challenge to us. of Ba profess have been made and the That's what we saw in Brazil. So having theazi<|sl|> and plants taken to us around the edge, but the forestians varied the size of offer. But now looking to be a landfill and fruit tree and be aibrillisation conditions after distillation for minnowing on freezing potatoes, Trapping systems were smells a PE. soybeans to the tropical area of Brazil quite efficiently. Today we have soybeans grown all over tropical Brazil. Nitrogen fixation was a tremendous advance. So our 38 million hectares of soybeans today use nitrogen fixation with the bacteria rhizobia that is inoculated in the plants and fix all the nitrogen from the air. This means 15 billion dollars savings for our farmers every year because we don't have to buy and apply chemical forms of nitrogen to our crop. No till and minimum till was a tremendous advance. Our soils are very sensitive and lots of concentrated rains. Erosion is a big problem and today most cropping systems in a tropical Brazil use minimum or no till increasing carbon in the soil saving water and preserving our soils. So it gave us the opportunity this this developments that gave us the opportunity to rapidly bring agriculture to the center and development to the central part of Brazil helped build our competitivity and our capacity to produce surplus and serve the world. Brazil is today an important provider and exporter to more than 150 countries around the world. In a summary the real impact of all this. This graph shows you the increase in average yield of the main crops developing in the tropical part of Brazil from the mid 70s until the 2016-17 season we had 266 percent increase in yield. Production total production 386 percent increase in total production and still the amount of area needed for all this increase was only 33 percent. So technology driven efficiency helped us save land and increase. production in an efficient way. I call your attention to this last line the red line down here which is the area of double or multiple cropping in Brazil from mid 70s to today. It's a tremendous increase in the increase. It's 340 percent. This is a direct result of sustainable intensification. This is a direct result of sustainable intensification. Using the land which is already allocated to agriculture in a more efficient and more intensive manner to save obviously land and to avoid a further pressure especially to tropical forests or pristine areas. But the biggest impact was food security. This graph shows you the cost of food in Brazil from the mid 70s to the 70s to 2018. This is the cost of the average package of food for an average family in Brazil. So the cost was cut by half. So a food security. This was the big contribution of all this investment of this progress to our society. And you see the ups and downs here in this graph. The the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the regularity of prices and the provision of food to the Brazilian society also was a huge, a big gain. So I think this is one of the most important slides in this, in this presentation. And obviously Obviously, for reasons that you know, in the past 10, 15 years, sustainability became the first item in the agenda of society. Brazil is placing a lot of attention to this, trying with its best capacity to overcome the footprints of the first two phases in the environment. Brazil has passed in 2012 a forestry code, which is a public law to limit expansion of agricultural land and to concentrate development in areas which are allocated to agriculture. And also, this law places a responsibility to all private owners of land that are now constricted to conserve water and biodiversity in their land. Also, Brazil has been developing for the past 10 years a low carbon agricultural plan. It's a quite bold plan to stimulate uptake of conservation practices and to lower greenhouse gas emissions in its agriculture, especially incorporating technologies developed by Embrapa and the Brazilian universities and also the private sector. Like incorporating degraded land into more sophisticated agricultural production. Brazil has still 50 million hectares of degraded pastures. So the country really doesn't have to cut one tree in the Amazon or anywhere else. It's suffice to use this 50 million hectares of degraded pastures. And we have plenty of technologies to do that, to incorporate this land with technologies with high efficiency, high productivity. Also, intensifying the use of the land, which is already available to agriculture. And Embrapa has developed technology that allows us to plant and to use the land 365 days a year, like in this graph, this image is showing. We can plant short cycle soybeans in November, December, harvest it in January. Plant immediately corn with the grass, which is Bacchiaia, a very common grass in Brazil. When we harvest corn in June, we already have a pasture ready to be grazed. So with this kind of system, we have a first crop of corn, a first crop of soybeans, a second crop of corn, and a third crop of beef, so to speak. So this is really the most advanced sustainable intensification in land use to avoid pressure over pristine and forested areas in Brazil. And now we are bringing trees into this process, combining crop, livestock, and forestry. Forestry is a potent way to incorporate carbon and to offset emissions from crops or from livestock. So we have a problem with our livestock production because we have a huge herd. We have as many cattle as we have people in Brazil. So emission of methane is really a problem. But bringing cattle into this combination of crop, livestock, and forestry is a way to offset the emissions of methane use with forest. This system is helping us to develop carbon neutral production systems like carbon neutral beef. Embrapa has developed a certified low carbon production system and a carbon neutral Brazilian beef brand, which has been released commercially last year. And it's very promising. So not only for beef, but also for other types of protein production. So this is a very important development to us. And as we incorporate this concept of crop, livestock, forest, we have also a huge opportunity to improve animal welfare, improve the environment. You know, the tropics, lots of sunlight, lots of heat. This is terrible for the cattle. So by bringing trees into the system, we improve a lot animal welfare. Embrapa is developing metrics to show how enhanced the environment and animal comfort can be achieved in this kind of system. Like reducing wind speed, reducing temperature, reducing radiation, reaching the ground, reducing the heat load. and obviously bringing an environment which is more safe and secure for the animals. This kind of concept is attracting quite a lot of interest from the private sector. This is not done only by Embrapa. Embrapa today is teamed together with many private companies that understanding the challenges that we have in the tropics and understanding that only through sustainable intensification practices we will be able to overcome this. They joined us in this large network which we call HGLPF, which is the crop livestock forest network. So we have now new funding and new resources coming through private partners to increase or to disseminate these production systems and to keep obviously improving them. So then I come to the last part of this presentation, which is this challenge that I think we have all over the world, which is to better explore the multifunctional nature of agriculture. Agriculture is of those human activities which are more, that have more functionalities. We can, with agriculture, produce besides food, fiber and bioenergy, we can work on food, nutrition and health, which is a topic very important now that we have such a huge health crisis. Also, agriculture may become a huge provider of environmental and ecosystemic services, giving back to nature what was taken when agriculture was disseminated. Biomass, biomaterial, the connections of agriculture with the green chemistry and this emerging bioeconomy, biological, organic, agroecology, agroforestry systems. So lots of opportunities here to develop systems which are better fit to natural environments or to better connect to the needs of nature. And the last one that I like very much, this connection of food, culture, tradition, gastronomy, tourism. This is a huge opportunity, not only for Brazil, but our countries in the tropical belt. Like new kinds of fiber. Embrapa is developing naturally colored cotton, which is an opportunity for the industry to save in the use of chemicals that are very nasty. This biomass technologies and the connection with the green chemistry, biomaterials, and also a way to provide environmental and ecosystemic services by fixing, taking carbon from the air and bringing it to the soil, like sugarcane. Sugarcane occupies only 1% of the Brazilian area, but it provides a huge impact in our energy matrix. Brazil has the most renewable energy matrix in the world, 45.3. This is three times the world average. Of that, 17.4% comes from biomass, from sugarcane biomass. And not only sugarcane, but also planted forests that are becoming major sources of feedstocks for different industries. Thinking about this new green deal and the way to bring more sustainability to different industries, especially chemical industries. Biologicals. This is a huge thing in Brazil now. In Brazil now, finding microorganisms and biological systems that help us to fertilize crops in a more creative ways, like with rhizobia, not only in soybeans, but in other crops. As I said, this technology allows Brazil to save $14 billion every year. So, one technology that was developed by Imbrapa pays several times all the costs of agricultural innovation in Brazil. Biofactories that are supporting biological control and integrated pest management. Today, you can produce bugs and send them by the mail all over the country. So, this kind of things are growing quite a lot with entrepreneurs, young people that are embracing agriculture and seeing in this area of biologicals a huge opportunity for the future. And as I said, Brazil is a mega diverse country with a huge diversity, six fantastic different biomes. A lot of opportunity to work on this nexus of food, culture, tradition, gastronomy, also as a way to stimulate the tourism. Not now. We hope very, very soon again we are able to enjoy tourism. But, you know, there is a growing demand for culturally diverse food and food as an experience. New flavors, new tastes, textures, sensations and so on. There is a huge opportunity here to, you know, to explore this huge functionality that the natural environments and also agriculture provide to us. And we think that this is very important for Brazil to be more, say, effective in responding to the sustainable development goals. And also to synergize with this new economy, the circular economy, which is emerging and which is gaining force. And also to finish, I just want to say that the very good news is all the fantastic development that we have in the world of science. Up to now, we've been relying on what I call our traditional toolbox. Genetics, statistics, chemistry, engineering. With this, we've been able to do a lot. We've been able to come to the present. But now there is a new toolbox emerging. And it's a very powerful toolbox with new and fantastic ways of dealing with challenges in agriculture. Gene addition, synthetic biology, big data, cloud computing, Internet of Things, robotics and so on and so on and so forth. So this this things are really amazing and impressive. And they show us that the future and including the future of sustainable intensification will be very intensive in knowledge, but not only knowledge, because it's going to be very difficult to embrace. So this is going to embrace or to take out these new tools, all these new possibilities if we don't build new relations. So I think we have to think about the future, which is already, but it will be even more intensive in knowledge and relations. So we have to excel in, you know, acquiring and using new knowledge and building new relations. I think this is very important for us in this world of research and innovation that we understand well the challenges for research and development, for the way we develop our projects. The need to have interfaces with the private sector so that we transform knowledge and innovation. But we have now to think about this new dimension here. The entrepreneurs, the young people that are, you know, embracing this new fantastic tools and the new fantastic knowledge that is emerging and gaining interest, including in agriculture. And it's amazing how agriculture in Brazil is attracting young people, young entrepreneurs. I'm sure in the audience right now, there are many young people that are already doing this or thinking about it. So, but I think we have to be more prepared to it. We that you consolidated our contributions in the research and development and innovation, the real understand that there are new possibilities. There is a new world for innovation and the challenges to find creative ways to embrace it and to use it to help us bring agriculture closer and closer to sustainability, which I think is what society expects from us. And I think this is all about a co side. Trying to, you know, to target knowledge important for sustainable intensification and to target new opportunities to create and to enhance and to empower relations so that we can use sustainable intensification to help the world move in the direction of, you know, food security. You know, food security for all in peace for all. If there is no food security, probably we cannot dream with peace in the future. So it's it's a huge challenge and that it's a big responsibility to all of us. Again, thank you so much for the opportunity. It's been really great to be here with you today. Thank you. So, Mauricio, thank you very much. That's such a tour de force as well as such a positive presentation. I don't think I've seen a presentation about global agriculture as positive as yours. So coming on the heels of Ruben's kind of bad news story to hear this fantastic story from Brazil and the graph that really caught my attention, I guess, was seeing only 30% increase in the area of crop production at the same time as you know, 100 for two to 300 increases in yield is really news to me. I think it's really, really something so perhaps you could stop sharing your screen. We can see more hands and have more of a dialogue as we go forward. Just to let everyone know there. I'm not sure what what screen you see, but there are about 150 people joining us today's which is a nice turnout. So thanks everyone for spending your afternoon with us. And let's see, we can take questions in through the chat or if people would I can see some hands as there is a rise. So people would like to, to, to make a verbal question, please hit the kind of hand button under the more, the more button you can see click more I think you can get. Oh, I don't know. Somehow I think you can, you can show a hand to flag that you would like to ask a question if you do if I don't see you please just unmute yourself and speak up. Perhaps with starting with introducing yourself. Brendan, if you open the participants list, then at the bottom there's a little thing to raise your hand. So. Okay, thank you. Can type them into the chat box. I'll keep an eye on the chat box. Yeah. So Helen McDonald is the chair of renewable resources and she's helping us to moderate the questions. I have a, we have a question from Robert Grant. So the first C is does rock phosphate continue to be a key amendment for building soil fertility and acidic soils. If so, are future supplies adequate. I think that's a question from Rissio. Yes, yes. Thank you very much. It was quite important. A few years back in the seventies and the eighties, not much today, but today there is a new tendency in Brazil, which is bioavailability looking for microorganisms that can be that can help us mobilize phosphorus from sources of rock sources found in Brazil. Most of the phosphorus used in Brazil is imported. Our natural sources have low availability of phosphorus. In the past, we used the rocks that are ground as a way to help fertilization, but that is not common today anymore. We see it as an opportunity since phosphorus is a very expensive component of the fertilization of our crops to find new ways to solubilize phosphorus from our sources. This is the, there is quite a lot going on in Brazil in terms of research in this area of bioavailability of nutrients and with a lot of emphasis in phosphorus. This, this is what we are doing today in this, in this area. Thank you. I have another, we have another question for you, Mauricio on Brazil is, and I think this is, you know, the backdrop, I think is that we keep seeing news stories about deforestation. In Brazil, you know, perhaps a higher rates of deforestation just in the last few years and there had been. So the question is what's the reason for so much deforestation if there's plenty of unused or degraded pasture land. Well, there is no need for deforestation in Brazil. So, and, and most of this, the deforestation that we have in the country right now, they are not really related to agriculture or agricultural expansion. There is unfortunately quite a bit of it going on related to logging and also to illegal mining in, in, in some parts of, of, of the Amazon. So there is absolutely no need for deforestation for Brazil to expand its agricultural production. I showed you, we have, we have plenty of land to, to use in a more efficient way and to double or triple of, of, of our, our agricultural production. Brazil has 50 million hectares of degraded pastures. Land that was cleared, opened in the seventies and in the eighties. So it's unfortunate. Obviously the government is looking for ways to counteract it. It's, it's a case of police. It's, this is not related really to agriculture and agriculture, agriculture expansion. It's mostly illegal logging and illegal mining going on, especially in some parts of the Amazon. Thank you. So we have a question. Is I think that what Brazil is doing is incredible. One question, Mauricio is I've read some projects from Sao Paulo on the introduction of urban vertical farming and urban centers. Unfortunately, the cost is a huge barrier to this innovation. Do you see urban or slash vertical farming and urban centers as a growing industry in Brazil? Is Embrapa interested in this? Yes, very much. And Brapa is interested in, in this it's gradually being developed. We have our vegetable centers, center here in Brazil doing quite a bit, uh, in, in this, in this area. Brazil has, uh, very interesting experiences with peri-urban agriculture around the big centers like Sao Paulo, Belen. And so we're saying it's still not much on urban farming, but with the new technologies now for a very sophisticated greenhouses, lightning and things like this. So the possibility, especially to produce vegetables in, uh, within the cities. So this is something. Yes, we are, we are taking it seriously. And then Brapa is, uh, yes, developing research in this, in this area. Uh, I see that Ruben has his hand up. Uh, Ruben, please chip in. Yeah, no, just, I, I, I understand that. Thank you, Mauricio, for such a fantastic presentation. No, I understand that, uh, that was the end of, uh, winter Canadians are really, really interested in Brazil. Uh, and, uh, for many reasons, but, uh, I just wanted to say the, the point is, is a fantastic example. There is only one Brazil. I, I'm not negative. I am, I, on a, I want to challenge. We have 150 mines here and you know how many Brazils are out there. So if you take Brazil, China, India, South Africa, and five more countries, the other 80 low, lower income and low middle income countries, and really far away where Brazil was 40 years ago. So it's not negative, but just to put that the, the gap of investment and innovation is really in the global south as a total, uh, is growing. So we can learn a lot from Brazil and perhaps I'm not so patient. So my comment is that, uh, perhaps, uh, by intensifying, by investing, by rethinking institutional change also, we don't have to wait for the years for other countries in the tropics to, to, to do it. So that's, that's a, the big challenge that the commission is trying to, to address, but the, the example of Brazil is fantastic. We, we, we, we, we, we need to find ways for scaling that up in other places. Thank you. I see Stan has his hand up. Brent. Go ahead, Stan. Uh, you have to unmute yourself, Stan. Oh, I think, um, I think, um, I think Ruhanna has to give him permission to unroot. So maybe do one from the chat box. So maybe, so just, uh, I have a question. I have a question and I asked to, um, I, Ruben and Mauricio. Uh, I was surprised at the relatively low percentages of agricultural GDP spent on research in China and India. So in India, you showed numbers that there's been a large increase in absolute terms, but it still makes it quite low in percentage terms. And I wonder what, because that's, you know, as Ruben hinted, that's where we might want to hope the next Brazil to be might be China or India or other countries. And I wonder if you have reflections on what might be holding back those two countries from, you know, really embracing innovation in agriculture, the way that Brazil has. Well, well, the numbers I presented is about public agricultural research and the study that we are conducting at the moment is trying to put some numbers on the rest of it. So the total number may be much bigger than the one I show, which is only public research. China alone today is investing much more than the USA in public agricultural research. So we know that we still don't know. We are trying to estimate how much is going on with the private sector in other countries and also in total investment in innovation. But still in general, public research is still low, still low. And I, I'm not thinking is linear. I don't think we need to do public research first and then wait for innovate. Everything is part of a system, but it's very low. It's very low. So we're trying to get that answer as soon as we have it bred. We can share the report that we have contracted to estimate what, how much is really going on in those other countries like India and Brazil. We know it's a lot. Probably it's not too much in India. It is a lot in China. Thank you. Okay. So I'm just trying to make sure that people who've asked their first question, we read their questions first. So we have one. How have you been able to convince the youth in Brazil to get along with the vision of your projects in agriculture? Well, this is, this is a very, very interesting, interesting question. Brazil is a very special case in terms of attraction to, especially to young people. You know, young people are inheriting the farms and they are keeping on and they went to good universities, came, came back. Well, it's not really us in a research organization, finding creative ways to attract young people to agriculture. It's, it's the reality of Brazil. It's the way that agriculture is growing and expanding. It's the number of private businesses disseminated throughout the country and assuming the responsibility of the being big players. So it, it, it kind of shows to, to young people that there is opportunity there. And this wave of entrepreneurship is being uptaken in, in Brazil in a, in a very impressive manner. All the big players in, uh, agricultural innovation in, in the world, they are in Brazil and they are investing in, uh, uh, entrepreneurs. And they are putting money in small, uh, ventures, you know, to solve specific, uh, problems. So there is, uh, uh, an environment, an, uh, uh, innovation environment in, in Brazil, which is today very attractive to, to young people. Young people are seeing opportunity there. Young people are seeing opportunity there. Uh, they are, uh, uh, expectant that, uh, agriculture will continue to be, uh, important, uh, and it con- will continue to evolve, uh, in, in Brazil and that we will provide good, good opportunities. And so I, I think it's, it's more the, the environment, uh, in, in the country, uh, around agribusiness and agricultural innovation, uh, taking only, not only the advances in the economy, but the economy, in the public, but also in, in, in, in the private sector, which are making, uh, the, the, the, the agricultural, uh, arena quite attractive to young people in the country. If you allow me in the previous comment of, uh, uh, Ruben, I'd like just to flag one thing that was very important, uh, in Brazil, which was, uh, you know, uh, we've been able to build capacity. In the public domain. And to create a concept of, uh, you know, uh, public, uh, research as a, uh, uh, like a, a clean, a cleaning track train. In, in, in, in Brazil, a public investment is done to, uh, make available, uh, you know, uh, institutions that operate like a cleaning track train that go up front, uh, embracing the most difficult, uh, uh, uh, time consuming challenges that are, are not usually embraced by the private sector because they are too risky. Too risky. So what happened in Brazil, the government was able to take the risk and to pay for it. And, uh, uh, in Braco is like a cleaning track train. So we develop, uh, knowledge that stimulates the private sector to come to uptake it and to transform it in, in, in innovation. And then we, in Braco, we move to something else. Uh, so this concept of public investment, uh, to build institutions that operate like a cleaning track train. I think it's very key for other countries that want to say to mimic what happened, uh, in Brazil. Well, so we have, uh, the Stan, uh, entered his question into the chat. So I'll just read his B and then go back to Maya. Um, so Stan asks for both Ruben and Murcio. How does COSAI and Brazil balance export agriculture with domestic food security and affordability? Well, so far we, we are looking at global food security. So if Brazil exports a lot, uh, Latin America in general exports much more than Canada, US and Australia altogether and Europe, uh, is, is good for global food security. Uh, we are not looking at the national level and the trade-off between how much you export and what's going on inside on food security, uh, yet. So, so that, that, that will be my answer. Thank you. Mauricio and Brazil. Well, uh, Brazil is a, is a big agricultural nation and it will, you will continue to be. Brazil is an important provider of, uh, food and agricultural products to the world. And it will continue to be as a country. Brazil today is the second exporter of, uh, agricultural, uh, products. Obviously, uh, food security in Brazil is essential to us. It's our high priority. And obviously we don't want to, uh, to increase, uh, uh, agricultural output in Brazil at the cost of our environment. Even though you see in the media all the time that, uh, we, we, we, we, we are not careful with, uh, uh, our environment. Brazilian farmers are very aware that, uh, uh, to be an important, uh, uh, global player in, uh, this area of, uh, uh, uh, food security. And, uh, uh, uh, to provide food to the world. And, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, to provide food to the world, you have to be careful with what you do in your country. So yes. I think our main priority obviously is the Brazilian people, as food security in Brazil, but we feel that we can go on contributing with the food security throughout the world. And I think Brazil will try to excel in its capacity to produce a surplus in a sustainable and responsible way and being an important player for food security at the global level. Thank you. Ellen, do you want to help pose a few of the questions? Sure, I'll go to Maya's question. So this is from Maya Eviden. Are many agriculturalists in the global south, in Brazil and elsewhere, considering insect production as an animal protein source that can be produced on smaller footprints than of land and cattle? Perhaps Mauricio has examples from Brazil. We've been looking at on a different, not as part of the commission, what's going on with alternative protein or additional sources of protein, not alternative. and as far as I know, there is not, I mean, there is a lot of interest and curiosity, but not yet a major initiative looking at insects as a new way of alternative or additional protein yet. We know there is research going on, but not at the scale of the rest of the research. And that's why the projections are that the traditional natural beef, carbon neutral, hopefully, will continue to grow. That demand will continue to grow. Perhaps Mauricio has examples from Embrapa. Thank you. Yes, we are doing research on that, not looking at insects as food, more as insect as eventually as a source of feed. For instance, insects may be a fantastic way to feed the fish. So since there is quite a bit of emphasis in aquaculture in Brazil, insects may be an interesting way to reduce the cost of feed for fish and eventually other animals. I'm a bit concerned with this alternative right now because of the pandemics, you know, when you think about bringing other animals into the process, there is always the risk of zoonotic diseases or, you know, viruses transitioning from insects to cultivated animals like fish. So I think we will have to be extra careful as we consider this alternative, especially when tagging wild populations of insects and trying to adapt them to such kind of use. But yes, we see it as an opportunity. For Brazil is not exactly to use it as a food, but we see an interesting opportunity to use it as a source of protein in feed, especially for aquaculture. Thank you. The question is over here, this is an interesting discussion. Okay. Okay. Do you want me to do the next one, Brand? Sure. So the question is from Solby C.O. The question is, how well received is cyclic farming by the private sector? So this is incorporating plants, trees, livestock throughout the year. Is it well received by the private sector? How many participating companies since the launch of the program? And were there additional incentives for companies to conduct cyclic farming besides getting a certificate? It's tremendously well received. We have today many, not only private companies, but co-ops. Brazil has large co-ops. Co-ops are a fantastic way to solve problems, especially for small farms in Brazil, because it's a way to remove market imperfections and so on. So co-ops are helping us to disseminate this kind of technologies. We are teaming together with banks that have interest in financing farmers, large agribusiness companies like John Deere, Syngenta, and others that are working together with us, supporting the development of these technologies and the dissemination of these technologies. Obviously there is a challenge here. A person that was used or consolidated its, say, farm with cattle production only. Now you have to also produce crops and also have trees or forestry in your system. It's a challenge for the farmers to incorporate these new responsibilities, these new challenges. And the private sector is helping us with that. For some systems we will need new machinery, new kinds of automation, which fits better, mixed and more complex systems. So, but the answer is total engagement. The private sector in Brazil has comprehended that we have to move really fast with sustainable intensification and with increase in sustainability in our systems. Incorporating more carbon in our soils, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This is very key for the competitivity of agriculture in Brazil in the future and private enterprises. They understand that quite well. So, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, one more. This is from Melinda. And the question is, what is the farmer's perspective towards the beneficial microorganisms-based commercial products other than rhizobia inoculants? So, I don't know if that's for Ruben or Mauricio. I don't have an answer for that one. So, I don't know. Yes. Well, I do have a perception on that. Now, there is today a wave of development in this area of biological. So, it's called generally the biologicals. How to find biological solutions to problems that are solved with chemical solutions. It's basically to substitute chemicals, pesticides, and even fertilizers, chemical fertilizers by, say, safer and biologically based systems. There is a huge acceptance to it in Brazil. Brazil has today even a public policy to stimulate it. Our Ministry of Agriculture has a public program to support developers of these new solutions. It's a quite big program with quite a lot of resources, which are directed to those that are trying to develop and trying to make these options available in the market. And BRAP already has some products developed and released. We have the first one, the most important and the most successful is rhizobia, which is very effective in nitrogen fixation in the tropics. We have rhizobia. We have also azospirilum, which is another microorganism that is involved in this. We have microorganisms that help release phosphorus from tropical soils. This is a huge problem in Brazil because our soils, they uptake most of the phosphorus that is applied in our crops is heavily bound to the oxysols. So we are now using microorganisms to remove this attraction or to release like weak acids that reduce the attraction of phosphorus to the soil and make it more available to plants. So yes, there is a lot of things going on right now in this area of biologicals. Microorganisms and insects that are used for biological control. Companies that are being developed, these multinationals that are developing this in Brazil. So the area of biologicals is really huge and it's growing day by day. And a lot of entrepreneurs in this area. Okay. There is this firm that was developed in Sao Paulo. Students from the University of Sao Paulo that developed a company to provide biological control insects to country, to farmers all over the country. So they pack them in a very specific way. They send them by mail so that they can be released in the crops and it's been very effective. So yeah, quite a lot of that here and not much resistance or people are really not afraid of this way of doing things. Obviously, you have to do it carefully because dealing with microorganisms, viruses and bacteria, you have to do it obviously following all the protocols of biosafety, which we are obviously doing. So that's been a really impressive set of answers to these questions. Thank you very much to all the audience members for chipping in. We're just, I'm just going to, I'm going to pose one question myself to, to both of you as a wrap up and then I'll pass back to Alan who will guide us for the rest of the, this session of the lecture. So, Ruben, thinking about COSI. So, there's one Brazil, as you said, we are hoping that there are lessons to be learned from Brazil for elsewhere. So, if you were choosing a country from Africa that would be, if Mauricio wasn't available and no one from Brazil was available and you were choosing from Africa, where, where might you choose a country in Africa where you see things trending in the right direction with public investment and an innovation system which is kind of mutually beneficial as, as we've learned about for Brazil. Okay. Okay. That's a tough question that we, we have not prepared before for the audience. So that is good. Good question. Well, Africa has 50 countries and it's very hard to pick one, but I will say for, for what I've seen working there on and off. There are more than 10, 12 countries that are really coming up very, very strong in innovation. You know, we, we, for example, in the commission, we are doing a very deep case study on Kenya because there is more data there and more universities and more availability of colleagues. But also in West Africa is huge. I, I've seen initiatives on sustainable intensification from the private sector from a producer associations as Mauricio says from universities. From IAIDA where Stan blade used to work and I many other centers really, really promote it. So I would say, you know, the challenges is huge brand because there are 50 countries and I, I think that at 10 or 12, they're really ahead of the rest. And, and we will see how, how that there is a lot of South, South potential cooperation. Brazil has been a leader on that one too, on how, how, you know, Latin America, Africa, and even Asia can work together a bit more since before you go, I know that we have to close, but I just want to, to first to thank you again, everybody for the invite for your patients to be with us for more than an hour. You know, the challenge that we have in the commission and the challenge of for sustainable intensification are huge, but they are doable. That, I mean, you, you can just saw one example, but there are many more examples that investing in the proper priorities, you can get ahead. But the, the point I want to make is that this, this issue on sustainable intensification is, is not, I mean, we're calling it the global South, but it's also Canada is there because it's a global South. Because it's a global issue. It's a global issue. It's a global issue. I'm sure you have a lot of international students at the university, a lot of Canadian students, professors who are very international. So this is not a better time. When I was a student, it was not such a good time because agriculture was kind of out of the map. Now, if you look at the slide from our regional agriculture is connected to everything. This is a great time to be a student or to be a professor in this topic. And I hope we can collaborate the university that you represent with the commission, with investors and with other things after the commission ends, because I think Canadian universities are very well collected in addition to government programs from Canada that are helping a lot on, on sustainable intensification. So I hope this is only the appetizer. I am much more positive that perhaps some of my slides and I think there is a bright future there if we collectively work a bit more together. So thank you again for the invite. Thank you so much. I think we'll, it's time to move to the next portion of our program and that's a really good segue because we are going to move to the student posters. But before we do that, I just want to give a really sincere thanks to our two speakers, Dr. Echeverria and Dr. Lopez, for a really fascinating presentation, both on the challenges that we face and also some good news stories about what can actually be a Dr. Echeverria and Dr. Echeverria and Dr. Echeverria and Dr. Lopez, for a really good discussion. And I have to say, I really enjoyed what Mauricio said about the value of adding trees into sustainable agricultural systems. That was my bias. So thank you so much. And also to everyone that posed the questions. It was a very interesting discussion. I really appreciate the fact that people contributed there. So thanks to our audience. poster session.
