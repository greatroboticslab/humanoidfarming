Education
 You've heard about helicopter parents and tiger parents where parents fix everything and make life really easy and perfect for their kid. I'm offering up a term called greenhouse parenting. Greenhouse keepers create an environment that is the most nurturing, soft, warm, wonderful place for little saplings to grow. Then they take them outside and expose them to freezing cold temperatures. Feel bad, feel pain, feel discomfort, and then bring the plants back into the greenhouse again. If they didn't do that and they took those baby plants and they just let them grow to maturity in the greenhouse where everything's perfect, and then they deposited them at college, let's say, those little plants would not survive. They would not know what to do when things got uncomfortable for them. You do not have to make life hard for your kids. Life is already going to do that for you. You can continue to create a really soft, sweet, wonderful, nurturing environment at home, but you have to let them go out into the cold, terrible, painful, hard world and feel it and really mess up and make bad choices and fail and do things that are embarrassing and do things that will make them feel guilty. When they do that and they figure out what to do afterwards, they are hardening themselves up so that when it's time for them to go off on their own, it's not the first time and they know what to do. I was trying to figure out why they chiming in the greenhouse, but they time for the goodness and co teaming in it. I had two T08s clocked out to put out the peace of mind and the problem with this difference in the觉. Amhert, we had to start putting a hole that I couldn't change off at home every time.
