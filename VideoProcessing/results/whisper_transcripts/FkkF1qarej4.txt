 How we produce food and the decisions we make about what we eat not only have an impact on our own health but also that of the planet. Agroecology is farming in a way that supports both nature and biodiversity but also looking at how we amend food distribution systems so that they are healthier for us and for the planet. What is farming with nature? You can see examples of agroecological farming systems all around you especially on organic farms but in its essence what it means is farming with nature not against it and that includes minimising reliance on artificial chemicals and fertilisers. It also means making sure there's enough food for all the animals or the wildlife that would like to call your farm home because they're beneficial not just pests. It also involves including trees within the farm landscape, agroforestry and finally really encompassing all of that it includes the best care for animals in terms of both health and welfare.
