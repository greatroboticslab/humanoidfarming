shop tour while we're in here this is a mess this is my shop and it's a total absolute disaster of a mess it won't be that way for long and if you guys follow the channel this might be interesting to you this is where i do some of my videos right here and we've got lighting lighting lighting uh and this mount right here which holds a microphone and a camera and then we've got a table right here

gloves gloves and we're gonna go out to the outdoor kitchen this is the outdoor kitchen from carolina barn builders awesome awesome outdoor kitchen that's called a gather grill i'll post a link this is the coolest grill i've ever seen underneath here we got a griddle and a grate and you build a fire and this thing rotates around so it's like a lazy susan it's patio furniture and it's a grill it's expensive and it's worth it i did a chainsaw video out here gosh months ago and the chainsaw has been sitting here ever since so let's put the chainsaw back together real quick this is that tool that i just brought in it's called a ratchet scrinch it's a ratcheting scrinch chainsaw tool really cool i was out here working on chainsaws trying to get everything ready for winter and like i said it's been several months uh since i was out here got a big gooey ooey gooey mess every chainsaw leaks bar oil if you guys know a secret to make them not leak let me know it's just every chainsaw i have

jesse's pretty cool 1967 ford dump truck gonna be working on this guy very soon it runs like a top but it's got flats flat tires everywhere one of the most handy tools i've ever had on this farm and any piece of property needs this this is a milwaukee tire pump i put this extra accessory on here i'll post a link for you guys in the video description we'll get this guy up and rolling you simply put it on there and you can set it and forget it so i'm gonna turn it on i have a memory i've set set it at 40 psi set it forget it walk away when we get back my tire will be up unless it's off the rim this is george george has got a battery issue let me show you real quick george's battery is dead as a doornail that's how we call it here in the southern regions of the united states reason he's dead is because i left the switch on thanks josh good job make more work for yourself i already got the hood up and i tried to jump this off with a jump box the other day the battery was too dead to jump with a jump box so this is the solution and it's really cool this is a power station portable battery bank i will post a link to it it's the elite 200 and all i do is take my battery charger set it right up here so i plug it in and then i hook it up and it'll charge this car battery all the way back up to full charge with fingers crossed i didn't destroy the battery plug it in negative positive power on 99 ac power on you're hooked up to our battery we have 1.6 volts shoo put that thing on the slow charge all right bring our hood down put this food over here looks like buddy's having a little bit of a fun time lounging what are you doing friend hey boy what you doing friend come on let's go come on go to your bed go to your bed little boy he's getting up the stairs pretty

windy over here looks like i've got a mineral block already out in this little pasture we'll scoop it up and take it to the cows they are probably bawling because they want their minerals there we go cows are all right there now there's buzzards in the air above the cows this means there could be a situation with a pregnant cow huh let's see hey bud hey big bud uh-oh four-wheeler there we go hey big bud you okay this morning huh you okay good boy good boy all right you want to try this you want to try some salt block or you want to butt it you want to butt it with your head or you want to try it we'll chuck that out there this is the one that's balling that's cindy i don't know why she's crying but she's just gonna have to cry every day i roll out hay to the cows today they get an afternoon bale tomorrow they get a bale in the morning and in the evening so we're stretching out three bales over two days they get a bale and a half every day that's how it works and they're ready you guys hungry dude that cow is peeing and the wind's blowing so hard to pee blew and hit me in the face the yuck le pew le pew the farm runs on atvs low pressure we'll talk about that in a second this is a greg judy balen roller greenpasturesfarm.net you guys are greg judy fans tell them you saw me talking about them on stony ridge all right we're gonna back up we'll hook up to this hay bale oh oh gosh that cindy is really fussy over there she's normally not like that oh it's a tight squeeze i'm too fat here we go here we go sometimes the hay bale sticks to the ground pretty good raises the four-wheeler up off the ground a little bit Timber! Timber! Timber! Come on, little girls! Come on, kids! Come on, kiddos! This is called net wrap. These are all net wrapped bales. They keep better outdoors than a twine wrapped bale. Take the net wrap off. Cows can get that in their stomach. We've got to be careful not letting them get any in their stomach. Make them sick. Could kill them. Shake it up. Stuff it on the four-wheeler. Unhook the great-duty bale unroller. Take my arm. Yuck! Tip it up and we unroll. You kids ready for some snacks? Hey, butthead. How are you this morning? Oh, good girl. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo-anf! Woo! Woo! Woo-anf! Woo! Guys, 모습! Wise-o Jenkins! fool Yoda cut off at village… Now typically I'll hook up to another bale but today we're running and gunning, we got work to do so we're gonna leave it alone and get it in the morning first thing, 7am. Oh that's good, that's a good workout. 10 wraps. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, seven, we're ready for the next bale. Now, you want real farm chores, you want real world, I pick up 10 rocks a day, every day, no matter what, every day, at least 10 rocks on the farm. So we're on a quick rock hunting journey. You see I've got some rocks here, we're gonna toss those in a gully in a second. Alright, here we go. One. Oh, come on. Come on here. Two, three. Four, five. Six, seven, eight. Nine, ten, eleven. Overachiever award. Right here. I get my gold star today. Let's take them and chuck them over in the ditch. Good cows. Good girls and boys. Quick head count. We got ten babies. I counted them. There's Tammy. Wait a minute. Another bonus rock. Hot dog. Oh, man. That was a miss. This is my video game for the day. Right? Some people are gamers. I'm just a rock picker-upper. You see all the hay that's scattered out on the land right here along with a lot of manure on the land. What this does is allows us to farm regeneratively. Okay? There's hay all down through here in gullies and ditches and on the top of the hill. Think about it. Okay? We're putting the hay up on the top of the hill. The cows eat on the top of the hill. They poop eat on the top of the hill. And it rains and the nutrients wash down the hill. Isn't that cool? There's a lot of knowing and doing and smartings going on. These are remnants over in here. You see a bunch of rocks. That's remnants from an old tobacco barn that used to be right here. And... Simply gonna pull right up here. Shut her down, Buford. We're gonna chuck these rocks over in that there ditch. We keep chucking rocks in the ditch. The rain comes in. We get a little erosion. The dirt catches. Next thing you know, that ditch is a flat spot. We got more pasture. Hey, Stony Ridge Farmer, don't you have a rock picker? How come you ain't using a machine to pick those rocks up? I came right around here all day picking up little bitty rocks with a machine. There's not a machine for everything on the farm. That's a common misconception. These mega farms make folks think that everything's done from the seat of a tractor. And it's just not the case on a small farm. Guys, share your stories with me. It's not the case. Look at my electric fence back. That's my fence charger. This is pretty cool. Check it out. Gonna have links to this soon. This is an electric fence monitor from SensorTech. Guys, awesome. I can tell every day, every morning when my fence is working and when it's not working. And actually, that setup right there shuts itself down at about midnight and starts back up at sunrise every morning. I had no idea until last night. This is the first day trying that new sensor. Way cool. Let's get back on the blue bicon. We're gonna go back and we'll move the tire pump to another tire. Those two blue balls that you see floating right there, those two little blue things, that tells me my water system is working properly. We're also checking the water system over on the other side where the cows were too. As long as those two blue balls are sticking up like they should be, then we know the water system is working. All the water on the farm is pumped via solar. So we have a solar well. It only works during the daytime. So cows have enough water storage in those tanks to keep them watered overnight. They don't really drink a lot at night. Just riding by the chicken coop there, I can tell they need a little bit of water. We're gonna get feeding water here in just a little bit. I'm gonna check the honeybees real quick too. We lost one beehive this year, but there was still honey in there and I'm letting the bees gobble that honey down. Check it out. There's a lot of bees man, I ain't hanging out for that. Let's check on this truck, see if that battery got any more voltage. We may have to give it a boost because I really killed that battery. It's not a new battery and it's a Walmart Never Start battery too. Let's see what we got. Oh, it says 12 volts already. 80% charge? No. No way. No way. We're gonna boost it. Hit it with a booster. No way. It's 80% charge. That quick? I'm not that hard to believe. Let's just see. No way. Here we go. Ha, yeah right. My sneaking suspicion is this battery is so fried. This truck has been sitting here and I haven't used it very much. I've just been working on it and fixing it. It's actually gonna be sold here soon. Great truck. 5.0 liter. But, uh, it's not an AGM battery. There we go. Uh, 5.0 liter. I just don't drive it. I don't use it. I've got too many vehicles as it is. And, uh, I don't use it. I've got too many vehicles as it is. And, uh, I don't use it. I've got too many vehicles as it is. And, uh, I think it'll make some young man or some young woman a good truck or somebody, a great farm truck too. Yeah. Let's check on the tires on Uncle Jesse. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. So firstly, I had to mill. Oh, man. Oh, man, what's theум? What are you my mercy? Like a哈 PT LA? Why not? Yeah, what's the same going on? Boy, I got a lot of pounds so, dude, I got rough. Get on me and multiple pounds as he was crammed inside all day! Oh, boy, no. Because though I had it, he definitely ran around. I didn't know how much, but I had already gone over that. And finally, the car was Eiscopi. With that, it was cool. And as far as, the other car wasya made, I love high. I just haven't had time to work on it. I need to make time to work on it, really. All right, this one is a pain in the, you know what, to find the... Oh, there it is. Okay, we got to go up, around, and backwards. Let's see how this works. There you go. There you go, little friend. Memory, 40 PS. Just for giggles. Let's see if Uncle Jesse will fire up, man. I think Uncle Jesse might just fire up. Okay, got a pull choke here, and Uncle Jesse's keys aren't in here, so we can't have fun. Oh, the fun police. Man. I know where his keys are. Let's go get the keys and see if Uncle Jesse will start. Oh, keys, please. Yeah. This thing sucks. Shifting. Another chore I needed to do. We got a lot of high wind last night. This is all old lumber that I reclaimed. These are all oak boards and such. They came out of a barn that was here on the farm, and I've got oak hand-hewn logs up under here. All up under there, right? So all that stuff is going to be future construction materials for the barn dominium that we're going to be building out here. I hope you're subscribed to the channel. Let's get this covered up so it doesn't rot and go to waste. Stinky. Stinky. Just like that trash bag. I can't throw stuff away. I just can't do it. I just see potential in everything. I don't know why. That'll catch up with me one day, or when I have grandkids that have to clean this place out. Ha, ha. Oh. The dual tires are a pain in the butt to get air in. Ah, come on. There we go. So I'm going to climb down here and get the other tire if I can. I know it's around here somewhere. Shimmers. Shimmers. There it is. Right in there. Yeah. Memory 40. Look at them tires. Ah, it's a bad set of tires. No. All right. What do y'all think? Uncle Jesse going to start? Or is Uncle Jesse's battery super dead too? Holy but goody. Call this truck Uncle Jesse because it looks like Uncle Jesse's truck from Dukes of Hazzard. I don't know. Kind of fun. What's life without a little fun? She's a four on the floor, buddy. Come on back. Here we go. That ain't the right key. Here we go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Might be out of gas. Fuel pump? Fuel pump. Yeah. Man. Come on there, buddy. Gosh, we should not give up on this. Let's go get a gas can. Just in case. Glug, glug, glug. I spy it. Uncle Jesse has an issue. A drip, drip, drip from the tube there. Got to replace that. I say we put a splash in the carbonators. Come on now. Oh, let's see. This truck has a dull heavy. This is the dirtiest engine bay of any vehicle you've ever seen. Guaranteed. Look at that. Oh, man. Let's try it without putting gas because it's so nasty. I got to super clean this entire thing. Look at that. That is so gross. Come on now, Jesse. Don't let me down. Number two. Attempt number two. Choke. Pump that gas. Battery's a little weak. This dude's got very little gas in it. It ain't got no gas in it. Oh, come on now, Jesse. All right. This ought to make that starter sing, baby. Put that jump box on there. Here we go. Yeah. Ripping it now. Rip it and rip it, baby. To the floor. Oh, man. Come on, Jesse. This Gulu box has a boost feature. Hit that boost button. That makes that thing sling. It started to sling that motor around. Come on, Jesse. Come on. I know what I need to do. I wonder if I have enough fuel in that gas can. Let's open up this air breather thingy. Make sure there ain't no squirrels in it. Air filters. Seen better days. Get a little out of water in that carburetor. A little bit of that spark of juice. In there. Just a little. There you go, bud. Just a little. Come on. Go. Okay. Here we go, senor. Yeah, daddy. That's a fuel issue. For sure. Fired right up as soon as it got fuel. I wonder if the choke is an issue. Ripping it. Give her some gas. It's got to get fuel all the way from the empty gas tank all the way into here. We know it runs. I can't give up. What do you guys think? Should we give up? Should we go get another can of gas? We're eating up some battery on this Gulu. Oh. Yep. We got a leak here. Oh! This thing's spraying gas all over me. You ain't living right unless you get a little 93 octane on you. Get her done. All right. I'm not sure how much gas went in the gas tank and how much gas went in the floorboard. I've got to get that filler neck handled. Got to pour it all in. There we go. Get a little bit in there. Gosh. Pour it all in the truck. Nobody ever accused me of being that bright. Here we go. Come on, baby. I didn't have the choke on before. Come on, baby. Just keep running. Just keep on. That's six gallons in there. It should pick it up. Fuel pump. Pick it up. Bro. Bro. Do I have to go down and get another thing of gas? I don't want to do that. It's flooded. I can smell it. All right. Well, we know Uncle Jesse runs. And we've overheated the jump box. Stay tuned for a future video. This truck has a dump bed. And I need to just clean it up. Get it squared away. And use it on the farm. It's a dump truck, man. Great dump truck. I bought it from my neighbor. I actually did a little horse trading for it. Oh, well. Let's see what she says. 1%. We'll put her on engine starter. She said ready. Oh, no, no, no. She's not ready. All right. We're going to let that charge while we go. We've got to grab a tractor across the farm here. Bring it up here. Get it filled with fuel. That way it's good to go. We're going to be running the sawmill tomorrow. This door is about to make me mad, man. What happened was the wind caught it. It sprung it. It broke this hook right here that holds it in place. I just need to go buy a new one, I think. But what happened, it sprung the hinges all the way back. And now it's not shutting like it should. Well, now it shuts like it should. Oh, man. It's getting a grab. When it's real cold outside, these steel buildings tend to swell and shrink. And sometimes I'll find that door just blown open. And it just basically tries to rip it off. I was saying we're going to go over the other side of the farm and grab a tractor and bring it over here. But I think we're going to take the fuel to the tractor, not the tractor to the fuel. This is the Unicorn Dodge truck. This is my fuel set up right here. And it's a little bit janky. Janky schmanky. That's okay. Okay. Now, the reason I call this the Unicorn Dodge, it could be more of a unicorn if it was a six-speed and a one-ton dually. But it's not. Contact. But it is a Cummins, baby. She sounds good. So why am I filling up this tractor? It seems unnecessary, right? Well, I'm going up to Virginia. That's what the Virginia folks call it. Virginia. The-genia. And we are going to fill up the fuel tank in the back of the truck here because fuel is about 20 cents cheaper per gallon in Virginia than it is in North Carolina. We're going to use off-road diesel, but it's still cheaper up there. It may be under three bucks a gallon. Yeah! I'll fill this diesel tank up probably three times a year, and that's all the fuel that I'll need for the year here on the Stony Ridge. Cows do most of the work, but I've got to come in and clip behind the cows. Cows do most of the work, but I've got to come in and clip behind the cows. so a saw mill's way over here this is my land that's my neighbor's land we're pretty cool i take care of their property for them most of the time um they just reimburse me for fuel i've talked to them about leasing uh their pasture for the cows and at some point we may do that or may mow hay but right now i'm just mowing it keeping it up keep it pretty the cast loader is right over here i'll show you guys what a cast loader is this is why i didn't drive my nice truck down through here it's muddy right here and that truck just got a wash job try to keep my trucks clean at least the ones that i use anyway if y'all remember we'll get you a little footage right here of building this bridge built this bridge last year while we're walking this is the log yard there's some trees down here i've got to get cut up you'll see that in a future video these are logs that are going to go on the sawmill all this is going to be milled into two by fours so we can finish out the tool crib in the mega shop that you guys were just in just a minute ago this is the cast loader and this is the wood miser lt40 and i've already been over here making a little bit of lumber you can tell but this is a job for tomorrow cast loaders from tne distributing we've got a tri-l grapple on the cast loader that we're moving our logs and all of our brush with we're gonna have a big old bonfire pretty soon pretty awesome this is a mini articulating loader meaning it bends in the middle so it's just a mini loader cast mini loader um again from top notch equipment out of minnesota contact yeah and it's way low on fuel i ran out of gas in this thing one time not fun not cool and don't don't don't leave the door open i busted the glass out of it one time too so check it out when you steer see how the tire gets closer okay you got a loader and then we got a button on here that extends the loader so the boom extends our uh forward and reverse is right there and that's just how easy a cast loader works very fun my fuel light is on on this thing which means not good we've got to get over there get this thing filled up the reason i didn't uh drive it across the the farm was because i was afraid i was going to run out of fuel with it this thing will turn on a dime check it out there's the sawmill i mean look at that that's so cool hit it this thing's a little sensitive on fueling up it does not like full trigger pressure when i fill it up it'll kick back a little bit so i gotta be careful you know what i just noticed a little something here the tire is low on this so i just so happened to bring over the tire pump we're gonna go ahead and fill this tire up see a little bit low right there a lot of bit low that's pretty soft again if you don't have one of these pumps on your farm you just need one even around the house we're gonna go to 24 psi ask me how i know i've had to i've had to fill that tire up at least 20 times just got a slow leak okay it's cool be careful don't mess up a pretty truck let's give her the gears baby let's give her the gears let me show you something this looks like a 2000 dodge commercial man this truck is so nice ain't she pretty gosh i told them when they bury me dig a hole big enough for this truck and put me in it right here clear prop we're off to rural king and here's what we're picking up at the rural king oil is cheaper there i'm picking up hydraulic fluid for the gale rt210 and it says hydraulic fluid capacity 21.5 gallons and i got all the specs right here so i get the right stuff things are cheaper at rural king it's worth the drive we just passed martinsville speedway right back there got some pretty cool rk tractors sitting out here i wonder if anybody will recognize their friend stony ridge farmer in the store here today fingers crossed this used to be k-mart my brother used to work here at k-mart back in the day and uh had a lot of fun in this parking lot doing donuts in the snow after hours back in my high school days got my wallet this one's gonna be expensive i know it is uh i have to question the sanity of starbucks you know
