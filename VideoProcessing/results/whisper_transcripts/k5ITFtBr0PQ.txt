 Then the good part we see these varieties, they are drought tolerant. So even if there are no rains, you still survive two weeks, three weeks without rains. As you can see, even the soils are dry here, but they are still looking down. The soil is dry here, but they are still looking down. Thank you so much for receiving us to your stand pretty much and your demo plot. It's sorghum, a traditional crop. So I think pretty much if a Zambian farmer would indeed know what this crop is all about. But just talk to us about this particular variety. My name is Alit Anjo Nirenda, I'm the Assistant Account Manager for Saka region. Wonderful. Sure. So on sorghum, as you can see, we have two varieties here. Although we have quite a number of varieties which we have for Azamseed. So for now we just planted two. I'll even explain only the same what we have here. So as you can see, we have ZFSV 17. This one is a white one and it's a hybrid. It will mature. Yeah, because it can mature in 110, 115 days. Yes. Then in terms of turnage, when you plant a hectare, it can give you about 4.5. 4.5 is about 80 to 90 bags per hectare. Okay. Yes. Wonderful. Sure. So you said it's white, so there are other colors as well? Yes, there are other colors. Yes, we can see there are two different in color. The other one is red in color and the other one is white in color. Oh, wonderful. Sure, sure. What's the difference in there? Okay. So the difference in terms of color, even the numbers itself, then the use itself as well. Oh, okay. But although both you can use Nishima. Oh, yes. Yeah, they're not bitter. Yes. But with this one, like the white one, most of the farmers, they also like using it as Nishima, like our step food, you know? Yes. Yes. So in terms of yield, this one, it's a little bit high compared to the other one. Oh, so the tonnage is higher. The tonnage is higher because with this one, as I mentioned, you can get about 4.5 meters per ton. Yeah, which is 80 to 90 bucks. Okay. Yes. Then the good part we see, these varieties, they are drought tolerant, I can say. So even if there are no rains, it used to survive two weeks, three weeks without rains. As you can see, even the soils are dry here, but they are still looking healthy. Yes. Yeah. What is the best time to plant sorghum here in Zambia? Okay. Thank you so much. The best time you can plant like mid-December or late December. That's a good time where you can plant. Because you are also aiming at it. By the time you are harvesting, like this time around, maybe it's in April or May, it will be late by that time. Yes, because there are a little maturity variety. But late maturity variety you can plant in December. Okay. Yeah. Sure. Sure, sure. So even you can see the other one, the late one, this late one, you can see some of the farmers, they like, I can say they can even sell to, these are the like, thread things. You can see sorghum, I mean, so go, that drink so go, they are making it from this one. Oh, I see. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. They are using the same variety. How accessible are these seeds? Does a farmer have to come directly to Zambseed or they can find them in outlets dotted around the country? Okay. Thank you so much. That's a good question. I can say in terms of seeds, we have the seeds at Zambseed HQ. Okay. Yeah, because in most cases, most of the abroad dealers, they don't order like the same crops, like sorghum. So what we usually do is, we have the Zambseed farm, but if they can make, they can give us some calls, we can deliver for them. Okay. Yeah. Like maybe if they are coming from, let's say Southern province, they can take it from Mazabuka, we can send to Mazabuka. They can buy it from there. Quite right about the outlets. So I can assure you to say this time around our outlets do have sorghum seeds. Yeah. Like in Petra is there. Yeah. Mazabuka. Yeah. And I can say Kapili. Yeah. Yes. Kasama. Yeah. Petauke. And Shepata. It will be available. Yeah. The other thing I forgot is, a maize grower definitely understands that they will have to apply fertilizer, a vessel dressing and a dog dressing. Okay. Is it the same case with sorghum? How is the fertilization structure like? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thank you so much. Sorghum we are also applying fertilizer. Okay. You can apply fertilizer. It also depends on the type of the soil which you have from your fields. Okay. Yeah. The whole sense of applying fertilizer, we just want to improve like in terms of yield. Yes. That is probably a high yield. So the thing is, we are applying fertilizer as you are planting. You are planting together with fertilizer. Yes. You apply fertilizer then you put the seeds. If it diminates you can wait for about five, six weeks or so. Then you can apply another, I mean top dressing. But the thing is, when you are applying top dressing, you should not apply, let's say, I'll give an example, say made for maize. We are talking about four bags per hectare. I mean, four bags of basil, then four bags of top dressing which is urea. But with this one, you can use 150 bags, I mean 150 cages, which is three bags of basil. Then urea, you can use 100 cages which is two bags. Okay. Yeah. So it's almost half of what we are using from it. Okay. Yeah. And these are tiny seeds. And so when planting, how do you determine the planting spaces in row and inter row? Okay. So for sorghum, inter space, like I can say between the lines, yes, you can use 75 centimeters. Okay. Then between the plants, you can do 70 to 10 centimeters. Okay. Yeah. I see that. Sure. Wonderful. Thank you so much for that. You're welcome. Yes. Okay. Shests up being neither
