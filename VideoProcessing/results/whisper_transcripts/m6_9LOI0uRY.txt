 It's also important to note that the use of farrowing crates is regulated in many countries to ensure the welfare of the animals, for example, in the United States. The Animal Welfare Act set standards for the housing and care of foreign animals, including sows in farrowing crates when the piglets are weaned. The sow is released from the farrowing crate and moved to a different area. She'll have time to rest and recover before the next breeding cycle. Some farmers may choose to allow the sow and her piglets to graze in a pasture after they are weaned. This allows them to explore and forage for food, which is beneficial for their health and well-being. However, some farmers may choose to raise their piglets indoors, in a controlled environment, to protect them from predators and harsh weather conditions.
