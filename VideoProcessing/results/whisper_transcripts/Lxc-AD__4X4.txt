 Agriculture on the Moon Agriculture on the Moon well hello there and welcome to the program agriculture on the move I am a Philip Sydney your host today we are discussing pesticide use and when we say pesticide it's the broad umbrella that comes with insecticides fungicides we decide molucicides rodenticides all of them falls under the broad name pesticides and of course it's important we come to you every year maybe twice a year to remind you of the use of pesticides they are dangerous so we need to update you and keep you informed as far as the use of pesticides are concerned with me today is mr. Christmas Alexander is a crop protection officer in the Ministry of Agriculture welcome to the program brother good afternoon and thanks for having me this afternoon thank you for being here I know you're busy but my my comrade I know you have so much to do but I'm happy you know you come here time and time again to really give some information to the public because we they need to know you know because when you deal dealing with pesticides we know the the hazards and we need we need to know how to deal with them but what are the major concerns with pesticide use in St. Lucia pesticide use is a major concern in St. Lucia you have a number of farmers who cannot read the pesticide read and understand the pesticide label you have a number of farmers using pesticides on the wrong crop you have a number of the retails agribusiness places selling the wrong pesticide to the farmer you have some other agribusiness places selling pesticides selling pesticides whereby it is not sold in the recommended way it is not properly or I'd say if you go by the market for example you'll see a number of persons selling pesticides with no label no active ingredient when you buy the pesticide on the on whatever package there's no active ingredient and so on your pesticide even after you have used the pesticide disposal of the pesticide container when you go out in the field you see pesticide containers probably that we use decades ago after you plow the soil you still see those empty containers on the pesticide so it's a whole issue of from registration to disposal of the pesticide the whole life cycle of the pesticide needs to be um they reconsidered in solution but but it is okay what is your unit doing uh on a regular basis to update solutions especially the farmers like you mentioned some of them cannot read the labels what are you all doing to ensure that they are safe to use those pesticides um we do a number of pesticide training training on pesticide use and safety but the issue is this as i said you have person selling pesticides and the pesticides are not properly packaged we have some of the retail shops repackaging the pesticide you have pesticides if you go by them um in town you'll see some pesticides whereby the the the the label is in a foreign language which is illegal well as the pesticide board the pesticide board is the regulator of pesticides in sandosha the pesticide board supposed to have its register um and an inspector who will monitor um what is happening out there and work together with the customs so that those can be um rectified in terms of the the the the inspector confiscating products and so on this is what is happening present okay but for example you mentioned okay if you go by the market uh somebody ad lib selling pesticides right to to the farmers to the public it is not labeled or or the wrong label is on it what do you all do with that person doing such a thing well based on the law you're supposed to get a warrant from a magistrate and you know sometimes when you all go through all the bureaucracy and so on the the pesticides already sold and um what you can do is sub programs of that nature where we educate farmers and the public out there in terms of the the the weight or they should purchase pesticide pesticide should not be purchased without the label pesticide should not be repackaged and so on that is the what you can do for now but even even i know you have farmers putting pesticides in in soft drink bottles you know what what what they all do well in a situation like this it is very difficult to police a farmer decide to um put pesticide in in in in a soft drink bottle we've warned persons we have had lots of programs in that regard and persons still continue doing the doing the same it's as i said it will be very difficult to sort of control this unless you educate farmers properly as i said give them the right education if you give them the right education probably in the coming weeks or whatever they're going to change those habits but as i said it's very difficult to change this okay but let's go back a bit i mean i'm sure what you're we are discussing here many moons ago that you have been discussing that right yes have you seen any uh obvious change with the farmers and also the people who are selling those pesticides out there have there been some change definitely not because as i said we've when the pesticide is registered it is registered based on the label that the the person submit to the pesticide board but what is happening when you go out there you're monitoring you see pesticides that are sold under the wrong label the wrong color code every pesticide supposed to have a color code take for example some of the observation i've made is that you have to example a product like a paraquat product that is a product that's supposed to have a yellow label and you've seen person selling pesticides that particular pesticide with a green label which says well it is not toxic at all and these are some of the issues that we in the coming weeks we're going to address this on on the year with the president what what are the hazardous highly hazardous chemicals we have in solution that is cause for concern um yes we have a number of highly hazardous pesticides still registered on the pesticide list and when i speak to highly hazardous pesticides highly hazardous pesticides are those pesticides that are capable of causing irreversible harm to human health those are the pesticides that are if you go under the rotterdam convention they are listed on the annex 3 of the rotterdam convention these are the pesticides where by on the stockholm convention the class the label you have one a and one b whenever you see a pesticide one a or one b it is a highly hazardous pesticide and on the pesticide list presently as i said we have several highly hazardous pesticides like paracot we call the gramaxone we have glyphosate the touchdown glucosinate ammonium the buster you have mephomil a product called lanit we have clopirifus we have to for the amine those are somebody they do those highly hazardous pesticides that are used presently out in the field and to use highly hazardous pesticides it is very difficult to phase out all the highly hazardous pesticides what we recommend to the farmers is that in the absence of the alternative you can use all the necessary protective equipment so that the risk is minimized but again farmers they they tend to tell you that um they've been using pesticides for so long and nothing is happening to them but you have to understand that for pesticide use the the effect can be chronic and it can be acute as well probably some of those pesticides that we use they've been using it's accumulating in the body because of the level of exposure they have no protective equipment and as you know the body is very susceptible you're not a turtle you're a turtle you have a hard shell where the pesticide will not be able to enter but you all the biggest organ in your body is your skin and others in your pores and so you have your your your your ears you have your nose where pesticides can enter as well so it is a it is an issue pesticide highly hazardous pesticide is an issue for us take for example gramaxone the paracord a lot of countries now are banning paracord why because you have a high rate of suicide because it is a weapon of choice you have the the glyphosate which is the bastard you've read a lot about glyphosate people swing months and two for millions and so on claiming well they got cancer because after they use the product over a long period of time but for us in st lucia we have not banned the product whereby the only country in the world that banned the product for agriculture use was sri lanka and it was reinstated but as i said you in terms of a product like this you don't expect to go by um take for example derrick walcott square and see persons using um the glyphosate there but it is a product that is regular most countries are regulating this particular product because of um public safety you should not use that product where you have other persons congregating and and so on this is the issue in terms of the others like in the mefomil and so on but we are there is a dire need for research in alternatives to um those highly hazardous pesticides on a global scale it is happening but the the alternatives as well they are problematic as well because there are there are still lots of unknowns a lot of persons now talking about biopesticides biopesticides by botanicals and so on yes but there are lots of unknowns to example example we had a product called by rat it is salmon they put salmonella to control the rodents in this particular product but what can happen to the salmonella is that it can mutate so whereby with the pesticide over time the concentration will be diluted but if for example you introduce a product like this a biopesticide it means it is a live organism so you cannot withdraw the life organism when they introduce it into the market so these are some of the issues as a pesticide border we we face out there but there are chemicals that uh a band overseas that you mentioned and right here i know there is our sister island's invention also banned that particular difference yeah right but we have it here in st lucio well as i said burning of a pesticide there is no globally harmonized system for pesticide registration it is country specific as i mentioned a while ago to examine the grammar zone countries are phasing out the grammar zone because of the suicide rate in st vincent the decision was taken years ago for to to ban the glyphosate but i'm not sure whether it was reinstated but as a cgpc grouping which is the grouping of pesticide boards of the caribbean where we meet and we discuss pesticide issues and the cgpc is the caricom working group on pesticide management so it probably st vincent is the only country that that banned this particular pesticide but again as i said there is a dire need for alternatives in that regard and if you all the free herbicides that we use presently the the group of synetamodium the basta the touchdown and the on the grammar zone all those pesticides are listed as highly hazardous pesticides but as a board you cannot ban those pesticides because if you do will not tell a farmer to go and weed five acres of bananas in the absence of an alternative but what you can do is take the precautionary approach presently we haven't the there are no alternatives but make sure when you apply in the pesticides you adhere to the pesticide label and you put all the protective equipment that you have on the farm wow uh but what do you do on a regular basis to actually get the farmers to understand the the the dangers of using those chemicals and that's why i think we we we we we need we we falter you know i know you said okay you you you go out there the farmers should know to read the labels but in terms of the protective way um i are you all doing a surveillance at those shops that are selling the chemicals to see that they sell protective gear um presently uh we did some monitoring but most of the retailers are saying that since covid there is a shortage of protective equipment on the market probably because of covid a number of the the ppe that was used for pesticide a number of persons use it for covid as well so we we been impressing upon those those retailers that if you sell them pesticides you should sell the protective equipment as well and it is the duty of the farmer or whoever is using pesticide in the households as well because that is where pesticide registration is so complex some of the pesticides that we're using out in the field the agrochemicals the active ingredient is the same as some of the pesticides that we use in the household whereby with pesticide with the agrochemicals we tend to tell the farmers use the protective equipment but in a household setting you will not tell persons use the regular slug bait you you're using around the homes you should have protective equipment to apply the slug the slug bait the normal aerosol spray that you use for the the big the the the roaches and the mosquitoes and so on you will not tell the householder to use protective equipment yet it is the same active ingredient in the in the in the agrochemical you have persons now using take for example the scented aerosols with the same active ingredient as some of the pesticide and you you at home watching television you close all your door and you you you you're still there watching the television because it is centered when i was young i used to do that because it is centered whereby before it was not centered when you were applying those aerosols you would open all your windows and you sit out now it is scented you figure it's safe to say well that is what that is what that is the trick it is centered and persons now believe well it is different it is more friendly and so on so they they will sit at home and apply those aerosols and and watch television so imagine you're doing that for decades what what is going to happen to you yes it may not happen to you suddenly but over time it's going to affect the body you spoke about alternative uh hazardous harsh chemicals that can be used um the organically you know um produced chemicals how prevalent are those chemicals how can you access those chemicals um in st luci well again it's not st luci alone yes we've been talking about alternatives like botanicals these are the extracts from plants and so on the the pheromones the which is called the semi-chemicals and the microbiome which is the live microorganisms we've been talking about those pesticides for a very long time on a global scale but in terms of commercialization in the pesticide market the pesticide the market for toxic chemicals is approaching 60 billion dollars a year but in terms of the the the organic products it is still less than 100 million in terms of of value so you can see there is a dire need to source those those pesticides do more research bring them in evaluate those pesticides because without evaluation you cannot tell the farmer use microbials this is the toxic chemicals because with the toxic chemicals they're going to see the effect immediately but the botanicals the semi-chemicals they work differently you have to apply those some of those pesticides even before you you observe any problem so those those microorganisms they have to be fixed in the soil and so on and then they will be able to do the work for you but in the toxic chemical just you just use it for one spray and then you see the effect that is um some of the issues we face out there so in solution to dates i mean i know we have had some organic pesticides right um do we do our own research in saint lucia in terms of adaptation of those chemicals and the use by the farmers in from say from your uni standpoint yes we do a lot of work in terms of outreach programs with the farmers in terms of of the biopesticide as a pesticide board we've been registering a lot of biopesticides lately the microbiome the botanicals the things like timorex ghoul and and so on sting biopower biocure and so on all these are microbiomes we've been registering those products but as i said the the issue is that um in terms of the effect that is where the farmers we need to do more training the farmers as i said the farmers want one immediate effect but the microbiome and the botanicals they are a bit slower than those toxic chemicals all right we'll do for our first break you're watching agriculture in the mood we'll do for our first week stay tuned back soon if you have the black cigarette toka treatment always follow the recommended safety procedures always wear protective gear when handling or being exposed to the fungicide or other pesticides use only the fungicides recommended by the black cigarette toka management unit when the treatment is due the required quantity of the particular fungicide recommended must be mixed with spray oil and applied at a rate of 1.5 to 2 gallons per acre fungicides which are not recommended or applied at the wrong time or even when the spray treatment is not done effectively can cause the fungus to become resistant to the chemical and therefore may no longer control the disease oil fungicide mix which has been stored for too long should not be used to treat black cigarette toka disease if carried out such treatments may not be effective and can lead to poor control of the disease remember before each chemical treatment for black cigarette toka disease on your farm first the oil fungicide mix must be re-agitated immediately before application for more information on how to treat and control black cigarette toka on your farm or in your backyard garden contact the black cigarette toka management unit at 451-5491-451-5894 or email bpmu at candw.lc this message is brought to you by the ministry of agriculture in collaboration with the international cooperation and development fund of the republic of china on taiwan welcome back to the program agriculture on the move with me is mr traders alexander plant protection officer and also we're discussing pesticide use peters there is a pesticide board what's the role again of the pesticide board uh the pesticide board is basically the regulator for pesticides in saint lucia they do pesticide registration issuing of the the import permits the pesticide board is supposed to license the all the retail shops pest control operators they're supposed to be licensed by the pesticide board as well these are the major functions of the pesticide and toxic chemical control board okay so so somebody who um is doing see um pesticide pest control at homes and other business places you are you have to be registered yes this is a threat again to in terms of human health you have to certify those operators because you have to make sure that they use the the the right pesticides they have the right equipment to apply to apply to apply the the pesticides and so on so they need to be licensed so okay the pesticide board also uh they cannot take a decision to to actually curtail the use of a hazardous pesticide yes based on the pesticide act the pesticide board can deregister a pesticide but it is the minister that can ban a pesticide in saint lucia and in terms of dealing with the highly hazardous pesticides that we talk about at the regional level there is a plan for dealing with highly hazardous pesticides which we have adopted as well which is one reduce the dependence on highly hazardous pesticides because what is happening out there is that whenever there is a problem to me it may not be a problem but whether the farmers see a few insect damage on the farm the first line of defense is to use pesticide and as a result there is over reliance on pesticide the farmer will have a problem the farmer will go to the agri shop the person in the agri shop does not know whichever insect is affecting the crop but that person is going to recommend a pesticide to the farmer and that pesticide may be a class one a pesticide which is a highly hazardous pesticide the crop at what stage the crop is in the farmer will not tell the person in the agri business shop what stage whether that flowering stage whether that vegetative stage or close to harvesting but that person is going to issue a pesticide to the farmer and what is going to happen the farmer is going to use the pesticide now there are pesticides that once once the plant is fruiting you're not supposed to use this particular pesticide right what did the the agribusiness person will not ask the farmer what group of pesticide are you is this at what stage of the crop you're supposed to use a particular group take for example if you have an organophosphate if it's a pyrephroid how the pyrephroid is working when to use the pyrephroid these are some of the issues that we have to educate those persons of the in terms of pesticide use but you you you you touch a very important point there you know uh it's like okay i cannot go to a pharmacy and see i i okay i will tell the pharmacist what what what are my symptoms the pharmacy cannot diagnose a medication for me unless i go to a doctor yeah yeah yes okay so why is it that the farmer can go to that shop and like you said he's not he has not been able to give the the overall um evaluation of the crop on the field and then this gentleman will will issue to him a hazardous chemical to go back and spray and what would happen two weeks later he would go out a week later he would have harvest that crop and sell to the consumers well the problem the two systems work almost the same with the the medical system yes you might need a prescription but remember they are over the counter drugs as well i understand that well with pesticides at registration the business supposed to provide what is called msd sheet the pesticide label you have an application you you have your dossie now you review the those information and then you register the pesticide you register the pesticide for a particular use so why are you now a farmer wanting the pesticide because you are ready registered take for example as a herbicide so if the farmer has a problem with foods the farmer must have a prescription saying well i need to use the herbicide to control which as well but your point is very important in terms of of food security exactly based on the pesticide board there are certain pesticides that are restricted use pesticides only certain persons should use the pesticide for example you must have the right equipment to use the pesticide for example vided you see farmers using vided on vegetables and when you vided based on vided registration of vided the equipment to apply the vided was a vided the was a vided gun where it's already calibrated at 7.5 ml and vided is probably the most toxic pesticide on the pesticide list true so in terms of them the the the the money that is the way the board that is the way we should go with this yeah those pesticides are classified as highly as the pesticide class 1a pesticide it should be restricted if you go to a shop and you ask somebody for a class 1a pesticide that person should give you a form and you should take that form probably to the person to the to the extension officer or somebody at research and they can approve of that for you in the absence of this what is happening you have even the persons as i said the retail shops because of the of the the poor labeling standards the codes that is supposed to use they're not using the proper code based on my observation during this week we need to do there's dire need to go back and educate those persons in those shops on the on the pesticide label on the code because every pesticide is supposed to have a color code a highly as a species are supposed to have a red green red one which is moderately hazardous yellow then you have a slightly as a blue and then you have a green but what is happening i saw persons now with pesticides paracord pesticide that suppose have a yellow color code i suppose it's a green color code so if you put a green color code on on on paracord it says well it is not very toxic it is environmentally friendly which is wrong yes so definitely as i said there is a dire need to rethink to go back and educate those persons yeah so so what are you all doing well what is the board doing because you mean you're a member of the board well as the we waiting we had a consultancy over the weekend not over the weekend last week sorry we had a consultant hired by the fao reviewing the the legislation and regulations so definitely based on his advice definitely we're going to um make it our duty because it's very important that we we protect the public from the youth because it is the board's duty to protect environmental health human health and animal health as well so that is the way forward based on his report now what he's recommending we'll look at the recommendation and implement those recommendations well house again is there a time frame a timeline or when you know because that that is crucial yes it is very crucial but again it's a matter of enforcement pesticide labeling i spoke to a while ago it is in the pesticide act it is not in saint lucia we have all those pieces of legislation but we don't enforce the rules that is that that is the issue with us who is supposed to enforce it that's the question yeah as i said the pesticide board was supposed to be yeah the all the the stakeholders on the board as well as opposed to in the ministry of agriculture minister environmental health sustainable development customs and so on because of nothing is our issue until which is crisis only when there's a crisis that people act in solution that that's well it shouldn't it shouldn't because it's already a crisis it's a crisis it's a crisis because as i said farmers are using the wrong pesticides persons in the households they're using the wrong pesticides okay imagine i went to the um the same visit with a consultant and what happened is that we met somebody's selling um pesticide when the question well what is the pesticide it controls everything how do you apply it either you use a sprayer or use a brush for bed bugs you know the person is saying you use a sprayer a high laser pesticide use a sprayer or you put the the make the solution and use a painting brush to put on the camera we have to end it here because there is the end of the program and i do thank you for ending on that note because it's very critical we need to come have a part two on that program very very shortly thank you for being with us and i wish you success in ensuring that your board takes immediate action to to at least put us for the pesticide hazardness yes in terms of what we use yeah thanks for having this afternoon as you said i'm willing to come back anytime you have been watching agriculture on the move i will thank you for viewing the program but remember pesticides are dangerous all pesticides even what you use aerosols at your home be careful read the label i'm philip sydney goodbye that they have caught me yes Thank you.
