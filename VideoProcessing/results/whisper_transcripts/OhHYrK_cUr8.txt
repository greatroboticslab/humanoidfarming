 Did you know that UCLA researchers discovered self-affirmation actually lights up the reward centers in your brain, the same areas activated when you receive money? When you say I am abundant, you're literally training your brain to associate abundance with pleasure and motivation. Here's what happens. Your brain has a network called the reticular activating system that filters millions of bits of information every second. Studies show that people who practice positive self-talk consistently notice more opportunities and solutions than those who don't. Do this right now. Notice your breathing. Is it shallow? That's scarcity breathing. Try this. Take one deep breath and on the exhale, drop your shoulders completely. Place your hand over your heart and say, I am abundant three times. Your brain is forming new neural pathways right now. This isn't wishful thinking. It's neuroplasticity. Every time you declare abundance, you're strengthening neural networks associated with confidence and opportunity recognition. Start today with I am abundant and let neuroscience work in your favor.
