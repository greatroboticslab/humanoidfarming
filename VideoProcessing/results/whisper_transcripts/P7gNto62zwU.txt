 Ever wonder what's the difference between grass-fed and pasture-raised milk? Lots of people have that very same question. Dear Organic Valley, how is grass-fed milk different from pasture-raised milk? The concept of grass-fed milk is new to many and confusing to most. Here's one of our farmers to explain the difference between grass-fed milk and pasture-raised milk. My name is Becky, and my husband and I are organic valley grass-milk farmers. Pasture-raised describes our holistic philosophy on organic dairy farming, raising cows outdoors on pasture where they can exhibit normal animal behavior, like walking around and eating grass. Pasture-raised also includes high standards for providing our animals with good living conditions, ideal nutrition, and general well-being. All organic valley animals are raised with this pasture-raised philosophy. In comparison, the term grass-fed is a description of what the cows eat. What does grass-fed mean? When you see the term grass-fed on a package at the store, it simply could mean that some of the cow's diet comes from grass. It could be most of their diet, or it could just be a fraction of what they eat. You don't know for sure. So how can you find 100% grass-fed organic dairy products? That's easy. Our grass milk products come from cows whose diet is 100% grass all year round. Look for the certified grass-fed organic dairy seal in your grocery store. It's the only third-party verification, ensuring that your milk comes from cows that are certified organic and 100% grass-fed. We hope that the introduction of the certified grass-fed seal clears up any remaining confusion between pasture-raised and grass-fed dairy. Thanks for reaching out with an excellent question.
