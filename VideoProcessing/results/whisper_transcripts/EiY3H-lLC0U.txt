When you enter the app, you start by logging in or signing up. Then you, after signing up, it will take you to the home page. Then after that, you have to search for what you want. Then you go to the search bar. After that, it will give you the results of what you search for. Okay, after the results, it will give you... After you search, it will give you the pro, for your results, which will show you the results of what you search for. After reading it, you have got what you wanted. Then you go back to the home page or you exit the app. And this is how our app will be looking. Like, here there's supposed to be our logo, but we didn't make one. So after that, this is showing that the app is loading. Then you have to sign up or log in. So you have to enter your name and your surname, your password, and you confirm the password. Then you enter your email. So that they can be updating you if there's any updates. They're sending you through your email. So after looking, this is our homepage. And that's our menu. Search bar, profile, download, and our home icon. So basically we have four categories, which is soil, animals, plants, and factors. So when you go to soil, it will tell you you will learn about your type and their stability. And animals, you'll manage, how you can manage lifestyle care. For example, monitoring dairy cow, feeding schedule, and mailwork protection to improve yield. And plants, it will help you discover what grows best in different conditions. For example, lye. You know that lye grow best in soil and a higher level retention. And lastly, we have some tools, which will tell you how you're going to manage or use machines. And I am maybe shabby kwana. I think I forgot about that. Okay. For example, if someone wants to know something about animals, he will click stage. After stage, he will select what he wants. For example, a persona wanted to see something about pigs. So she selected, this is a robot view, what pigs are. So this is the last page. I will explain some records that are there. We have this button, back button. When you click there, you will be able to go back to the page to search for something else if you want to search for another thing. And then, there is a... This icon, which it will be providing these settings in language, whether you want to use it in teacher or since we have no farmers or English. This is a market place whereby there will be different categories of crops or animals that farmers are selling. So the farmer will be able to go there and search for the thing that he wants to sell or buy. And these are friends. Farmers will be able to interact with each other, whether to ask questions or to know what they're doing. or to know more about something else. And this is a let up setting whereby farmers will be letting up whether he is doing well or if he is giving the information to the farmers that they want. And, uh, frequent asking questions. This, it will be bringing up the questions that are being asked frequently. And, after they are setting the icon down there, uh, rock out, you, you, it will be taking you back to the, uh, first page. So this is it. Any questions, comments? How will you make money for the company? Making money for the company? Yeah. Okay. Okay. After testing it, if the farmers are, if everyone is, is, is able to find everything he wants or something else, because on the, uh, I have a page there, that's, that's, that's about money and the price. If you want to look there, you'll be asked to pay something else. Or if you want to, uh, post something, you are saying this, you'll be asked to pay something else. So the information is for free. Yeah, information is for free, but for the, uh, uh, saying your things, you'll be asked to pay something. Yeah, they're going to take the information for you. Information from, like, when you search the, uh, for example, the, for example, the, for information, you will email it, okay, for free. Okay. Uh, like, something else. Okay. The app is for free because we, it includes local farmers who can't even afford to pay. But the, for the information, will be used in the money that will be collected from the marketplace. This is super properties if they live, that will be very, very, kind of amazing. Going to never bring up to the people, first parking, aren't they? It only seems to beyan on the day, and when you're fostering their笑 own show, you're taking care to be матери, of aquchил, you've looked up to that subject. Yep.

What will make your act, the emotions, the information, as opposed to, for example, the text? The text you see, or this people, or flowers, or Gemini. We've got the power to actually do it right now. How do I take care and activate it in this planet in giving the information? Okay, this will be, this represents extension records. So it will be based on information that extensions provide.
