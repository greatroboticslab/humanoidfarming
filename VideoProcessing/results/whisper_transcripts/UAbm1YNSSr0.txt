 Yeah, I'm grateful for the opportunity just to be a part of this project. The last year and a half or two years has just been a great experience. And just like Dr. Morgan mentioned, I'll be talking about soil and the interaction between soil and water and specifically the effects that soil health practices have on soil water characteristics. And before I start advancing into my slides, I think it's important to recognize that 70, you know, arguably 70% of the fresh water that's consumed globally every year is consumed through agriculture. And so any way that we can become more efficient in agriculture with our water is an important topic to explore or important way to research. So one of the things that really regulates the interaction between soil and water in the soil is soil structure. There we go. Sorry. You actually saw these pictures a little bit before, at least the one on the left in Dr. Groove. In her presentation, she did a fantastic job with aggregate stability. And this is related to her talk as well. But you can see in these two pictures, this soil has decent soil structure. You can see aggregates. You can see channels or highways for water not only to infiltrate, but roots to grow through. Not only is the water allowed to infiltrate, but it's allowed to store and be made available to the crop. And so this is really kind of what we're shooting for in an agricultural system is something with this kind of structure. And in agricultural production, there's really two main things that affect soil structure. There may be a few others, but in general, there's two main categories. The first one is soil forming factors. So how did the soil form and gain its structure naturally? And some of the things we look at is the climate, the organisms or the biota, the topography or landscape position and slope and relief. The parent material, or in other words, clay percent, sand, silt and clay or the texture of the soil. And then time. How long has that soil been in place without being interrupted? And then the other main category are the management practices. And so arguably this is another soil forming factor, an anthropic or a human soil forming factor. So specifically when we talk about management practices, I'm going to focus on tillage, cover crops, nutrient type for my presentation, but there are additional ones like crop rotation and diversity and things like that. And one example of a negative impact of management is through intense tillage. And these two pictures here are examples of systems that were tilled. The one on the right is a moldboard plow. And I think the one on the left is the same. And you can see that that aggregate stability, that structure of the soil has been destroyed. And I was taught in my soil genesis class that if you think about a city that's been really well organized, has lots of structures, roadways, highways, driveways, all these different, I guess, routes for water to go. When you till it, you destroy that infrastructure. You destroy that city, so to speak. And it just becomes these big clods and it makes it harder or more tortuous for the water to get through. And so what happens is, and again, Dr. Groob gave a good picture of this. You get these surface crusts or even sometimes you get erosion. And these are two fields, both corn and soybean fields that are tilled. And not even, not even in my opinion, intensely tilled, but, you know, disked, maybe, maybe once in the spring or once in the fall. But yet it disturbs and wrecks that soil structure and makes it susceptible to erosion, both wind and water erosion. And so you can see the real or goalie erosion on the left in that picture. And in the picture on the right, you can see the water moving off the field. And this is after planting even. So the field was tilled and planted. And then we had this rain event and the water is moving off the field and carrying the soil with it. You can also see if I use my pointer here, these little plants emerging from the soil, that's the corn that was planted. And so you're losing not only your soil, but your yield, your plant. So it's an environmental loss and a financial loss as well. And so it's important to really consider how management is affecting the soil structure and ultimately the interaction between soil and water. And there's several different ways that we can measure that interaction between soil and water. One of those measurements is available water holding capacity or how much water is the soil holding that's also available for plant uptake. This is important when it's also a lot of times related to drought resiliency. Another one is bulk density. It's an indirect measure of soil structure. And also related to other things like soil compaction and whatnot. For my purposes today, I'll be referring to bulk density as an indirect measure of soil structure. And generally with bulk density, the lower bulk density you have, the better your soil structure is most likely to be. And I can explain a little bit more of that in the slides to come. And then there's saturated hydraulic conductivity or the speed of the water as it's moving through the soil profile. And this is a saturated measurement. So it's if you picture an agricultural field in the spring when it's at field capacity, how fast when the soil is at that capacity is that water draining through the soil profile. And then that's really where this project, the NAEP Shimmer North American project to evaluate soil measurements comes in. Growing up, I used to read these truck magazines and they would do all these comparisons with these truck manufacturers to determine which truck was best. And in this case, this project allowed us to do a comparison of these measurements to determine which one was most sensitive, or perhaps we could say best, and being sensitive to management decisions and management practices. And because of this project, we had the same measurements, same method on paired treatments and on these long-term sites that were generally greater than eight years, established for at least eight years. And so it's just a unique opportunity to really do a side-by-side comparison of these measurements and methods. So you can see a picture there. Dr. Morgan showed this picture earlier of all the partnering scientists. Well, at least some of them. You know, this was during the government shutdown, so a lot of our government partners aren't in the photo. But I just – I'll give a thanks to them again at the end, but just without these folks, the project wouldn't have been possible. So, and this really leads to kind of my slice of the pie for the project. My first objective was to determine which Tier 1 soil water measurement is most sensitive to changes in management. And again, when we say Tier 1, which Tier 1 measurements are those that are accepted and kind of known to be reliable or sensitive. And so I want to know which one was most sensitive. So the first one is available water and link capacity. And there is two methods in which this was measured. So the first one was intact, where you keep the structure of the soil intact, like the name implies, and then put it on an apparatus and it measures the available water and link capacity. The next one was repacked soil, where the soil gets processed or sieved, and that soil structure is really kind of eliminated from the process. Then it gets put on an apparatus and tested for available water and link capacity. So I'll be looking at a comparison of those methods as well. And then the other one was the bulk density using the core method, which is a traditional method. You pound a core of a known volume into the soil. You dig that core out. You level off the top and the bottom to get a known or to make sure that nothing's going out of that volume, that known volume. And then you dry it, you weigh it, dry it, and then you can get a mass over volume measurement. And then the last one is K-SAT, or that saturated hydraulic conductivity. And you can see the picture of the method we use. It's an in-field or an in-situ method where it's actually saturating the soil profile. You can see the water jug there. And then it's applying different pressures onto that soil and measuring the flow as the water goes through the soil profile. That was the first objective. The second one was, can soil health management practices improve soil water cycling? And like I mentioned before, I'll focus on reduced or just tillage intensity in general, cover crops, and nutrient type, or inorganic versus organic. So the results, diving into it, we'll talk about bulk density first. So this is the distribution of bulk density across the sites that we sampled. You can see, if I use my pointer here, that bulk density is on the X. And then you have the frequency or the number of plots that we sampled that had that same bulk density. So the average bulk density that we saw was about 1.23 grams per cubic centimeter. And so how well did this measurement respond to tillage? So this is, again, a response plot. Where on the X, you can see the change in bulk density. And then over on the Y, you have the different tillage comparisons. So overall, which is an average of these different pairs or comparisons. And then you have the different intensity levels here with moderate and intense, minimum versus moderate, and the minimum versus intense. And you can see, because none of these whiskers, so to speak, or these ranges are touching this zero line, we did get a significant response with bulk density when comparing it to tillage. So not only that, but we got a negative response. And our bulk density value is decreasing with decreasing tillage, which is good. That's saying that perhaps our structure is getting better as we decrease the amount that we're tilling in the soil. So this means that we take our average bulk density of 1.23, and if we were to apply soil health management practices to those fields, our bulk density would go down from 1.23 to 1.19. So, and then if we compare it to the other management practices I'm focusing on for cover crops, we really didn't see any significant change or sensitivity with bulk density or organic amendments. So tillage, bulk density was really sensitive to tillage practice. So then diving into hydraulic conductivity, very log, normally distributed. You can see that our range, I'll put the range up here, was anywhere from 0.1 centimeters per hour to 108 centimeters per hour. And this picture, I think, really helps describe maybe why we saw that range. And so you can see our plots were fairly big. This is actually a plot in North Carolina on one of Dr. Groove's sites. And with saturated hydraulic conductivity, you can move over a foot and take a measurement here, and you may get a different value. And so it's just by the nature of the measurement, extremely variable. But nonetheless, how well did it, how sensitive was it to management? So again, this is tillage. You can see that for overall, we really didn't see a significant response using this measurement, except for the comparison between minimum and intense tillage. So basically what we're saying is if you were to switch, say, from a moldboard plow to a no-till management system, you would see a significant change in your saturated hydraulic conductivity, or the speed at which that soil is flowing through the soil, the speed at which the water is flowing through the soil profile. So if we were to compare it to the other management practices, it really wasn't sensitive to cover crops or adding organic amendments. So we really want to focus on this, the significant response we saw to the comparison between minimum and intense tillage. So we saw about an increase of 7% in the speed of the water as it moves through the saturated soil profile. And then if we were to change that into our average, if we were to apply soil health management practices on our average KSAT, we would jump up to 18.2 centimeters per hour, which is an additional half an inch per hour. So if you have in the spring, you have a saturated soil profile and you have a rainfall event, as long as it doesn't exceed that rate of half an inch per hour, you wouldn't, theoretically, you wouldn't get any ponding on the soil surface. So I'll just go ahead and end with the available water holding capacity test. So again, there's two methods in which this was measured, and you can see the distribution was was fairly normal for each. But with the intact core, so when you preserve the structure of the soil, you're getting an average AWC of about 0.18. So if you're to, and that's cubic meters of water per cubic meter of soil. So if you're to multiply this value by 100, you would get the percent of this cubic meter of soil that could have available water to the plant. And so using this method, that's about 18% available water holding capacity. Using this method, it's more like 0.23 or 0.25%. So with this repack method where you're destroying the soil structure, it's telling us that we're having more available water holding capacity. So how well do these methods respond to management? Well, very, very differently, actually. So with the intact core, you can see that we got a response in every category except minimum versus moderate. And with the repack, there really wasn't any significant response except for this one method. So this is telling us that the intact core method really is the method to go with when measuring available water holding capacity. It's more sensitive to management change. So just kind of to give you a visual of this, this is a site in Kentucky, and on the left we have a no-till management practice. On the right we have a tilled practice. You can see this visual stair step down between these two practices. And this was a study was established in the 1970s, so it's been in these practices for a long time. So if we were to say that this water bottle represents the tilled capacity of that treatment to hold plant available water, we're saying if you switch to no-till, your available water holding capacity grows or increases, and which could be, which could make or break you in a dry year. If you convert this to gallons, this is an additional 200 or 2,200 gallons per acre in the top six inches of soil. And now if you were to look at this in inches of rain that it could, that it could take in an addition, it's about 0.15 inches in the top six inches of the soil that it could take in additional precipitation. So, and I will point out that interestingly, if we consider the other management practices, cover crops, we had a similar response to, with cover crops as we did with reducing our tillage. So in conclusion, you know, if I had to rank these third, second, first place of which measurement I would use as a producer, as a research scientist. In third place would be bulk density. It's cheap, it is sensitive to tillage, you do need it to calculate soil carbon stock, but it's not a direct measure of soil function. In second place, KSAT, it's a great measurement. I think it has a lot of potential, especially if you have time to do multiple measurements per plot. It does have high variability, but it is a direct measure of soil function. And then of course, finally the king or the winner, queen, I guess, king or queen of these measurements is the available water boiling capacity into the intact core method. And not only is it a direct measure of soil function, but tomorrow Dr. Diana Bagnell is going to talk about how we can estimate available water boiling capacity through modeling. And so perhaps we can get that cost down. With that, I'd just like to thank our partnering scientists, and then of course, the financial support that we received from the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, General Mills, and the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research.
