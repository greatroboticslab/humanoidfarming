Science & Technology
 The Sir David Reed Controlled Environment Facility at the University of Sheffield, England was open in 2004 and is a world-leading climate-controlled plant growth facility. With the aid of Conviren's plant growth chambers and rooms, the facility supports diverse research into tropical plants, sub-arctic plants, past global atmospheric environments and future growing conditions. These growth environments also provide the basis for Sheffield's groundbreaking contributions to some of the biggest challenges facing us today, including feeding the world. My name is Darren Rose. I'm Faculty Estates Coordinator for the University of Sheffield. There is a total of 32 Conviren units within this facility, at an estimated cost of about £2 million for the units. We've got about 50% walking and about 50% reaching. In total, about four different units, from the BDR-16, the MTPS-120 and two models of the BDWs, a 40 and a 160. The 160 has a floor area of about 15 square metres to allow us large experimental designs. One of the units we have is the BDW-40. This is a low-temperature unit which allows us to do plant research into sub-arctic plant species. Because the facility here is so large, it's essential we have a central management system. This allows us to collect data, parameter data for the research scientists, allows us to monitor alarms and we can also log in remotely from anywhere in the world and monitor these chambers. So with the four units we have, we can pretty much replicate all climatic conditions on the earth, which is, from a research point of view, is extremely useful. So we can go from minus 20 right up to plus 40 with anything in between. This facility can test hypotheses with live plants and virtually any plant species. Several of the Conviron units here are configured with specially designed trays and irrigation for rice research. And eight of the small growth rooms are ideal for growing Arabidopsis. One of the major challenges of the world is food sustainability, crop reduction. This is an element of the Faculty of Science major project, which is Project Sunshine. These cabinets will help us research into that problem for us and for the world. In the ten years we have been on with these cabinets, we have managed to undertake a vast number of experiments and projects. This developing on that work has allowed us to gain more research work, more funding to undertake more research and increase the reputation of the University of Sheffield. We chose Conviron because of their international reputation for reliability and repeatability of the controlled parameters. The company is very well known within the scientific community within the UK. After deliberations, it was thought that the partnership between the University of Sheffield and Conviron would enhance both our reputations within the scientific world.

For more information throughout Gene Day at you have mentioned the research which has enabled us about this project. Remember why? Someone might find out something professional you can ask for your work or advice. The family is a step właśnie in exchange, removesMs and patients. We talked about this use of thealeAsia program, which has been developed in華ara of unvaccine, where you've been playing with the engineers, especially when We지가ins, but not just the 來-back, because our staff has been very promising. These guys have been very Relaxed cooperated with a brutal類, to be brauchable and Matsuda who can many of people ensure this new style. We would say that when People was with us and say they would still best dance and can't support us. That's how you can affect us.
