Why Was This Chicken Egg Like This? #chickenegg

 When I went to go feed the chickens today, they surprised me with something I've never seen before. And in the end, I made a discovery that will even surprise you. Here's some food. Oh, look at that. I see you guys have a little egg inside your dust bathing area. Oh, it has a little hole in there. Why is there nothing coming out? That's so weird. Let's see if we can pop off the rest of the hard shell and get the soft egg in our hands. The hole is right there. So what I'm going to be doing is just trying to take some of the egg shell off and try and get into the egg without anything breaking. After cracking back the egg shell and making a small hole, I accidentally punctured it but found something really cool. Check this out. Seeing the egg yolk right there, that little white dot? I had no idea what that was, so I took it out to discover it more. I started taking the egg white out and started throwing it around. It makes a great bouncy ball until I accidentally dropped it.
