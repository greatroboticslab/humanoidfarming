 Hello and welcome to edupediaworld.com. In today's video we will learn about animal husbandry. So what is animal husbandry? It's a branch of agriculture that deals with feeding, caring and breeding of domestic animals. And these animals can range from you know a horse to a cow. It also includes the birds which come under the poultry like the hen, the ducks, the geese. Also there are other birds which are included in this category which also comes under animal husbandry. We have the cow, we have the buffalo. So all these animals you know the animal husbandry talks about breeding, caring and feeding of all these animals. You know the range is quite wide. Now what do we mean by husbandry? When we talk about husbandry, husbandry means it is the management and conservation of resources. These resources are related to animals, their care, their protection, their wellbeing. So all these resources are related to animals only. If we manage and conserve these resources properly then this comes under animal husbandry. The branch of science that deals with the management and conservation of these resources is what is known as animal husbandry. Right? So animal husbandry not only talks about breeding, caring and feeding of these animals but it also includes proper planning. And what is this planning? The planning is for domestic animal shelter. That is how should they be sheltered? Where should they stay? What is should be the condition of the place of stay of each of these animals? Because every animal will require a different kind of place to stay. Their requirements are different. The animal husbandry talks about the domestic animal shelter. It also talks about the breeding of animals. Also takes care of their health, the care and protection that they require. And why is this protection we talking about? Why are we talking about health? Is because there are a lot of diseases, viral, bacterial, fungal and lot of other infections that may infect these animals. So we need to take care of them. These diseases need to be in control. And that's why animal husbandry also takes care of the health of these animals in order to avoid any kind of disease. Right? Lastly, their economic utilization. Like how can these animals be utilized? You know, properly utilized. So over utilization should not be done. Proper utilization of these animals and their products will ensure availability of their products for a long time. So now let's move ahead. So what are the animals we're talking about here? The animals which are included under animal husbandry are like cattles which include the cow, the bull or the ox, the buffalo, the yarks, horses, ass, goats, sheep and camel management and conservation of these resources. So these are the range of the animals that are included. So animal husbandry also includes as I said the cattle farming. Kettle means it comes up. It includes the cow, the buffalo, the horses, the yaks, old tree farming, egg and broiler production, the fish production. Then comes the marine production like here we will talk about the fishes. Then we have the inland fisheries and beekeeping that means epiculture. Beekeeping is called epiculture wherein the bees are they will be given a shelter and then the honey will be extracted. So that is what is called as beekeeping or epiculture. Right? Now as the population increased, what happened the industrialization also came in the globalization came in with this growing population, the requirement of the food also increased. People wanted more food, more milk, more meat and other products. So now because the requirement was more than there came a need for people to really look at their cattle, other poultry animals with which they were getting these food products. So what was the requirement? The requirement was to treat these livestock properly. The requirement was to protect them from diseases. The requirement was to give them a healthy environment and healthy food so that they could produce more and more food so that people can eat. And the requirement of this more food because of increase in the population can be balanced. So in this video, we will talk about all those processes and practices with which we can take care of these animals with which we obtained food and we obtained other products which makes us which gives us a balanced diet. Right? So first we will talk about cattle husbandry. Cattle husbandry as the name clearly suggests that it talks about how the cattle should be treated, how the cattle should be fed and how we have to protect them so that they can give us more milk and we can use them effectively. Cattle husbandry is done for two purposes. One is for the purpose of obtaining milk. And secondly for drought. What do we mean by drought? It means there are some animals, some category of cattles which are used for irrigation, for carting. They are only used for doing some kind of work like heavy work. Whereas there are other categories of cattles which are used in order to obtain milk like the cow, the buffalo. And the drought animals will be like the ox or the bull. What are these animals? Milk producing females are called milk animals or they are also called as dairy animals. Whereas drought are the ones which are used for farm laborers and are called as drought animals. So basically there are two categories. So this is how it looks like. You can see here this is a cow, a milk producing animal and the drought animals. This is how the farmers utilize these animals in order to do their work. Now Indian cattle belongs to basically two categories. So this boss indicus is what we known as commonly known as the cow. And the boss bubalis is commonly known as the buffalo. So there are two categories and we all know it. Right? So right hand side this is a cow and this is a buffalo. So we have two different species of the same category of the cattle category. Right? So buffalo is the most productive economic animal that we know. What is so important about buffalo's milk? Buffalo's milk is richer in fat, in proteins, in calcium, in phosphorus. So it is really rich in all these nutrients. It also contains low sodium potassium cholesterol. Buffalo's milk is also ideal for making milk products such as Koya, Dahi, ghee and etc. And that is the reason exactly why the buffalo's milk is in great demand. Right? And there are certain vitamins such as vitamin A and D that are also present in the milk. So buffalo's milk is most important. So now that we know that the buffalo milk is so important, what is required is the requirement is of its proper cleaning and a proper shelter for a buffalo. Right? Now, why is it required? Basically for two reasons. First is because it gives us milk. We need to have good quality of milk from buffalo. Secondly, it is very very important for the health of the buffalo. And that is why we need to really take care of where are we keeping these cattle animals. So the place of stay and their shelter, the condition of that area should be neat and clean. It should have lot of sunlight coming in there. It should also be a shady place. Right? So that they can take rest. So now because we know a buffalo milk is so important. First thing, these are the few steps that are required as far as their stay is concerned. First is both the cow and buffalo require regular brushing so as to remove dirt and other loose hairs from their body. And on the right you can see this is how the entire process is done in big industries and big places where they have this cattle shed. And this is how the brushing is being done over these cows and buffettos. So this is how they are cleaned every day. Next is they should be sheltered under well ventilated roof shed that protect them from rain, heat and cold. Right? So they should have some kind of sunlight coming in but at the same time they should be allowed to shelter inside a shed. So that they are protected from rain and extreme cold and heat. The shelter should be such. Thirdly, the floor of these wherever the kettles are staying should be such a way that it has to be a little slopey. So that when it is washed all the water comes out of that area and the area is dry. Right? So this will give them a clean place to stay. So these are some small little things which should be taken care as far as their shelter is concerned. Right? Requirement for food for kettles. What kind of food do kettles eat? Now there are two types of food that the kettles are generally given. One is during the normal course of the day. That is during day to day life. Secondly, is a special food that is generally given during the lactation period. That is when the cow or the buffalo is lactating. So the farmer should properly know as to what kind of food is to be given to the two types of categories of cattle. It is very important because this special food when given in the lactation period can produce more and more milk and a better quality of milk. And during that time. Right? Now as far as the food is concerned, there are basically a roughage and a concentrate. Now this is what I was talking about the components of cattle feed you can see. There is a green grass. These are some kind of seeds. These are those corn seeds and other grains which are given to the kettle so that you know it increases the production of the milk in them and also keeps them healthy. Right? This is a green grass against it acts as some kind of roughage. So let's now talk about the component of cattle feed. So basically two types. One is a concentrate which is low in fiber and contains high level of protein and other nutrients. So basically on the right is what you see is a concentrate. This is generally mixed with water and then you know the cattle are allowed to drink it. So this is the concentrate and roughage mainly contains fiber. So what they are eating here is a kind of roughage a green grass. So both are important. Grass is also green grass is important as far as the concentrate is also important. So this is the component of cattle feed which should be given to the cattle on a daily basis. Now there are other tips which are important. For example, first is that the concentrate must be fed individually according to the production. Right? Like if a particular kettle is producing more milk then it requires more food. More feed should be given to the particular kettle. However, if there is another cow or a buffalo which is not producing any milk or which is producing less quantity of the milk. So this is the one that is producing less food may be given slightly lesser feed than as compared to a cow or a buffalo who is lactating. Right? Secondly, good quality roughage also saves concentrate. So if you provide more roughage then it will save on the amount of concentrate that you are giving it to the kettle. Thirdly, regularity in feeding should be followed. There has to be proper time at which these kettles are fed. Feed concentrate mixture before milking half in the morning and other half in the evening. So basically feed concentrate should be mixed once in the evening and once in the morning. So that they have a balanced diet. And feed the roughage after milking and watering also. So after you milk the kettle after and before both they have to be given this feed. High yielding animals may be fed three times a day. So those kettles who are probably lactating or who are yielding high may be given more feed that is more than twice. And lastly, maintain normal rumen mortality and optimum milk fat level. So these are few tips that should be you know really followed religiously. So as to maintain good health and a very healthy environment where the kettles are staying. So thank you for watching edupedia world videos. Thank you.
