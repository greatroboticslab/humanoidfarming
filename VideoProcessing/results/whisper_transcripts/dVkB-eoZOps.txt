Education
 I'm Sreenath. I study Agricultural Science at the University of Queensland. I would say opting for Agricultural Science at UQ is definitely a good option because UQ has these partnerships with many of the public and private firms which all have an international reputation. So it not just gives you hands-on experience while you are studying but would create a potential career option for you to go through after you graduate.
