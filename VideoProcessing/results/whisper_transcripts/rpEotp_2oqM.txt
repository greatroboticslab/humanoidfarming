 What are the top 10 implements you should have in your machine shed? To answer that question, the first thing you should do is make a list of all the jobs you need to get done around your place. Mowing pasture or turf type grass, lifting, moving, and dumping material, scraping and moving dirt, grading or leveling land, digging holes, or working a large garden. Which implements are right for you depending on what you need to get done. But having said that, here's a list of what we believe owners of large properties should have in their machine sheds to take care of the most common jobs they'll face. Number one, a loader for your tractor. Without a loader you're only getting half the productivity available from your tractor. With a loader you can add a material bucket and turn your tractor into a scooping, moving, dumping machine. Add a pallet fork and you've got a forklift. Add a root grapple and you can put all that woodland refuse in one big pile. And the list goes on. Number two, rotary cutter or grooming mower. Two completely different machines designed for two completely different tasks. Which is right for you? Here's a handy rule of thumb. If you're maintaining turf grass or any other grassy area you'd like your friends and neighbors to admire, you should probably be using a grooming mower. On the other hand, if you're keeping rough areas like a road edge, back lot, or pasture under control, you should probably be using a rotary cutter. Be advised, these mowing implements are not interchangeable. It's important to use the one that's right for your application. You'll need at least one of them, maybe both, because as we all know, the grass just keeps on growing. Number three, a box plate. A hard-working box plate with scare fires is one of the most versatile implements you'll ever have. Grading and leveling drives, building paths, leveling land for a new building, spreading dirt from where you don't want it to where you do want it, terracing land, providing some rear ballast when using your loader attachments, and generally speaking, it's one of the must-have tools you'll probably use a lot. Number four, a rear blade. Digging ditches, returning gravel that's been pushed off your gravel driveway back where it belongs, grading and smoothing your drive, snow removal, you'll find plenty of work for a rear blade. Number five, a land plane. A land plane is a great tool to have in your machine shed for maintaining a gravel road or driveway, smoothing a horse arena, leveling a garden, and plenty of other uses you'll think of. Number six, a snowblower. If you have a long driveway up to your place or any other large area you need to keep clear snow, there's nothing faster or more efficient than a tractor mounted snowblower. Number seven, a post hole digger. Build a fence, build a deck, build a pole barn or machine shed, plant trees. A shovel or post hole digging tool that's powered with your back is no match for a post hole digger and auger powered by the PTO on your tractor. Number eight, a rotary tiller. If a large vegetable garden is on your list of wants, you'll want a tractor mounted rotary tiller to prepare the soil for planting every spring, or before planting a cover crop in the fall. Number nine, a pallet fork. Along with a bucket, a pallet fork is one of the most versatile tools that can make all kinds of jobs easier around your place. Stack a load on a pallet, strap it down, move it anywhere you want. Number 10, a broadcast spreader. Need to spread salt over a large area to keep the ice at bay? A polyethylene tractor mounted broadcast spreader is perfect for the job. Not only will it stand up to the salt, but it's also perfect for spreading seed in the fall and fertilizer in the spring and summer. That's a four season machine, which always means more for your money. Those are the top 10 implements we think you should consider first. Actually, that's 11 if you count both the grooming mower and rotary cutter. Frontier has more than 400 implements and attachments that are available only from your John Deere dealer.
