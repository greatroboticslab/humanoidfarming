 Instead of waking up in the morning and heading off to work or school, let's say you wake up in the morning and you have to milk your cow. Or maybe you wake up and have chickens you need to take care of. But what if I told you that is what we wake up to every single morning. But not just chickens and cows. In today's video we are going to be sharing with you guys our life as two teenage farmers living on a farm. Living up in the morning, milking cows, taking care of animals. We get the whole experience and we are so blessed to live here. So come along with us for a morning in our life. Good morning everyone. Right now the farm is waking up. Everyone's getting up. Also, I wanted to point out that we are filming this video on Mother's Day. So that adds a little touch into our day. We just went downstairs, we made our mama coffee, we got her breakfast ready. But yeah, something special for her. We are going to get our day started. So, let's go. Okay, Maddie is awake. Right now she is in the middle of doing our mom's beautiful hair for Mother's Day. So, tell us what you think our mom's favorite thing to do on Mother's Day is. Farm work. Is that true? Yes, it's very true. Oh my goodness. Stop biting. Stop biting. He says good morning. He's got to get his morning water. Oh, hello. Yes, say daddy's awake. Yes. This is it. That's true. Okay, anybody heard that could avoidْ Thank You. Thanks. Hmm. and my container about午餐 significantly and cook lives and everything does and all the Repa has and theQUA-F Okay, so my mom is still getting her hair done. I'm about to go get the feed buckets for her and then we're going to do feed for the cows. I'm going to set these up and spread them out on the floor. Good morning. Good morning. There's Shorty. Hi, buddy. Good morning. Alright. I'm going to make sure my sister does come and check for eggs though because I do have eggs. But chickens are out. We're going to head to the barn and we're going to get the cows done. Key carts. Daddy Warbucks, what are you doing? I got to give them feed and you can't have it. No. Come on, you two. Alright. We do have to lock them in here because Shorty likes to come over and try to eat their feed. He's a bad boy. These two are ready. Here we are. Good morning, Shorty. Good morning, Shorty. We do keep him in the stall because, well, he's a bit special and spoiled. And he knows it. Right about now, Madison is going to go. She's going to feed the calves. I'm going to go grab the cows. And then Maddie's going to do Shorty, I guess. Sunscreen and fly spray, right? Yep. Okay. Come on, girls. Thank you. Okay. Alright, cows are all in. We are going to go ahead and start milking. They are cold for so they don't have to. They are cold for so they may make sure they don't have to. Okay. Alright, cows are all in. We are going to go ahead and start milking. They are cold for so they may make the cabs. Okay. Shutting. Okie dokie. The girls are all milked. We have one more cow to come in. Madison is going to take Elias out while I bring the other cow in. Thank you, Maddie. Yes. Here's a cow. So when the cows come in, the first thing we do is fly spray them, and then we put iodine on their teats. We always fly spray them in the summer because the flies are really bad. Okie, so while Devin is milking the cows, I'm going to go do the baby huts and clean up the stalls. And that's where we're at so far. Maple is done being milked. Maple is done being milked. I'm going to go see if my mom is going to take her out. And then I'm going to take milk up to the house and filter. What? Oh my goodness. Ben! Oh my gosh. Benji! Look at him up there. He's been just sitting there watching me. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh my gosh. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Benji! And then he's just sitting there watching me. Ha ha ha ha ha. Bye bye. Bye bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Good to go. You bowl us for yesterday. Uh-huh. We just got done filtering all the milk. Madison got done with all the cow huts and stuff. We are coming out now because we do have to bowl us and give replenish to Majestic because she has runny diarrhea. My mom's getting all the chickens in right now. Majestic's over there. And then we got Miss Formosa sleeping. They're all taking a nap. I've got a little monster on my hand. What are you doing, you cutie? Hmm? Hmm? That's not for you. Yuck. Not for you. Here. It's for this pig. Helps your tummy. There we go. No. Oh! Okay. Okay. We are complete. I'm going to head to the garage. We're going to start getting pig food and horse food ready. Okay. Welcome to the feeding station. This is where I get all the pig food and the horse food ready. Pippin, Matrix, Snickers, and then that one is Scarlet's. My sister, she feeds Shorty and she feeds TikTok because those are mainly her horses. Anyway, I'm going to show you guys what I feed these guys. Coming over here, we have loads of senior feed because Scarlet is one of our senior horses and so is Pippin. But we are trying to get them to gain weight as well. So this really helps. So Scarlet gets the bigger bucket because she gets more food. She gets three scoops. Three. Three. Three. Pippin gets two scoops. Okay. So we got our alfalfa. Just do a layer at the bottom. Just a layer. And then Pippin gets alfalfa pellets and Scarlet does as well. Now we're going to focus on minerals. They get their minerals every day. Pippin. So we're going to go get our GutX and our Osteomax. Matrix gets the Osteomax just because she has stifle issues and this really helps her. Pippin gets GutX because it helps her gut really well. And, well, she has diarrhea problems too. And then Scarlet gets GutX as well for the same reason. What is going on here? What is going on here? Our Osteomax right here. And then we've got our big thing of GutX right here. Pig food. Pig food. Hello girls, how are we doing? Okay, my bun is not bunning. It's flopping. I wish I had a pretty horse when I grow up. Patience my Nicky boy. You ready girls? Alright, let's let them out. On out ladies. All the horses are done eating. We're just waiting on Pippin to finish eating. So we're going to head over to the pigs. Hello! Oh. Let's go. Let's be patient in the gates. I'll give him a little bit just to feel the fitting. It's my tongue. Dwayne! My poor bun. Look at Maddie's. Mine. Hello. Hi guys. Are you excited for baby bunnies? Yes, I am. Really excited. Let's get me cute. Yeah. These have been the best water containers yet. Right? Here you go. All good. Have a good day. Alright. We are going to go over. We're going to check on Pippin. See if she's done. And then we're going to gather all the buckets. And go from there.
