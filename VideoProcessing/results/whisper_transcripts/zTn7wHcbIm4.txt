 Here's five of my favourite plants for adding colour to your garden and because they're all perennial, they're going to come back every year. Great for the front of a border, this is Nepeta Persian Blue, flowering May to September, lovely aromatic foliage and loved by bees. Looking fantastic in any garden is Scabious, they make an excellent filler when situated amongst other plants, they're attractive to pollinators and the seeds are loved by birds. Great for the middle of a border is Achillea cerise queen, beautiful pink flowers for months on end and they can be divided every three years. Next is Aquilegia spring magic, growing to around 40 centimetres in height with these beautiful nodding flowers in late spring to early summer and they make great cut flowers too. Finally, the cottage garden classic Lupins, offering height and colour to your border with these beautiful pea-like flowers which are adored by bumble bee.
