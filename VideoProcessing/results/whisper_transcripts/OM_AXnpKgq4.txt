In zone 7B, there's always something fun to grow. And today, I'm walking you through the perfect planting calendar for your best garden yet. Trust me, by the end of this, you'll be ready to get your hands in the dirt. But before we dive in, let me share a little story. A few years ago, I planted tomatoes way too early. I was so eager that I didn't check the frost dates beginner mistake. Long story short, they froze and I learned my lesson. Timing is key in gardening and that's exactly what we're focusing on today. Whether you're new or experienced, these tips will keep you on track. So grab a cup of coffee, sit back and let's get started. And hey, if you've ever had a gardening mishap like mine, share it in the comments. I'd love to know. I'm not alone. January planning and preparation. January is a quiet month. No outdoor gardening just yet. Instead, it's all about planning and getting ready for the year ahead. Indoors, start your cold tolerant veggies like broccoli, cabbage and Kyle. These early starts will give you an advantage when the growing season begins. Now is a good time to check your seed stash. Do you have everything you need? If not, make a list and order early because popular seeds can sell out fast. I learned this the hard way one year. I waited too long to order seeds thinking I had plenty of time only to find myself paying extra for late season shipping. Trust me, it's a mistake you'll only make once. February, start indoors. February is the perfect time to start onions, leeks and lettuce indoors. These crops benefit from an early start under grow lights. Make sure your seedlings get enough light to grow strong. And don't forget to keep the soil damp but not soaked. Nobody wants soggy seedlings. I remember one time I thought, the more water, the better, and ended up drowning an entire tray of seedlings. It was a tough lesson, but a helpful one. Sometimes less is more when it comes to watering. March early cool crops. March is when things start happening outdoors. It's time to plant cool weather crops like peas, radishes, and spinach directly in the ground. These plants thrive in the early spring chill. But before you plant, get your soil ready by adding compost. Your plants will thank you for it later. I personally enjoy using an old garden fork to loosen the soil. There's something so rewarding about breaking up those clumps of dirt. It's almost like breaking apart a rich chocolate cake, only this cake feeds your plants instead of your sweet tooth. April, the big planting month. April is the month when everything gets going. Start tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants indoors. Outdoors, it's time to plant carrots, beets, and Swiss chard. If the last frost date has passed, you can also start hearty herbs like parsley and cilantro. I've learned to be careful with April planting. One year, I got too eager and planted all my tomatoes outside early. A surprise frost hit and wiped them out overnight. Lesson learned, always wait for that frost date. May summer veggies galore. May is when your garden starts coming to life. Now's the time to plant summer staples like tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and squash. You can also sow beans and corn directly into the soil. Don't forget to mulch around your plants. Mulch helps keep the soil moist and blocks weeds. It's like a cozy blanket for your plants. One year, I skipped mulching, thinking it wasn't necessary. By June, my garden was overrun with weeds. I spent hours pulling them out of a mistake I won't make again. June maintenance and second plantings. In June, it's all about keeping up with maintenance and succession planting. Keep the harvest going by planting more lettuce, radishes, and bush beans. Watering is critical during this time. In the summer heat, even one day without water can stress your plants. I have a bad habit of forgetting to water during heat waves, so now I set an alarm on my phone. My neighbors probably think I'm odd as I dash out with a hose every afternoon, but it's worth it to keep my garden thriving. July heat-loving crops. July is the month for crops that love the heat. Okra and melons flourish in the summer sun. But be sure to shield your more delicate plants during extreme heat. An old bed sheet works great for providing shade. Once, I used my favorite beach towel to protect my plants from the sun. Let's just say it wasn't a good idea when I needed that towel for the beach later. Lesson learned. August fall garden prep. August is all about getting ready for your fall garden. Start cold-tolerant veggies like broccoli, cabbage, and kyalin doors. Meanwhile, clear out any spent summer crops to make room for the next round of planting. Compost those old plants and turn them into rich, fertile soil for your garden. Composting feels like magic to me. It's amazing how kitchen scraps and garden waste can turn into something so helpful for your plants. September fall planting. September is the time to plant fall crops like spinach, turnips, and arugula directly in the garden. It's also the perfect time to transplant your fall seedlings. Protect your young plants with row covers to keep pests away. But make sure those row covers are secured well. One windy day, I watched my row covers fly halfway across the yard. It was a hassle to retrieve them and set them up again. But at least my plant stayed safe. October cool weather crops. October is garlic and shallot season. Plant them now for a delicious summer harvest. Once planted, add a layer of mulch to shield them from the winter cold. Planting garlic in October feels like burying little treasures. You won't see the results for months. But when you do, it's absolutely worth the wait. November cleanup and prep. November is all about tidying up and preparing for winter. Plant cover crops like clover or rye to enrich your soil. And don't forget to clean your garden tools and store them properly to avoid rust. December reflect and dream. December is a time to pause and plan. There's no gardening to do, but you can prepare for next year. Flip through seed catalogs, sketch out your garden plans, and set goals for the upcoming season. December feels like the gardener's halftime. It's a moment to rest, reflect, and plan for an even better garden next year. Here's a little secret that changed the game for me. Always keep a gardening journal. Write down what worked, what didn't, and what you want to try next year. It sounds simple, but it's like having a cheat sheet for your future self. And here's another pro tip. Don't stress about perfection. Gardens are messy, unpredictable, and full of surprises. That's the beauty of it. Even when things go wrong, you learn something valuable. So there you have it, the Zone 7B planting calendar to guide you through every season.
