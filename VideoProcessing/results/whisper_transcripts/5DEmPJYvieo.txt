 Straw bale buildings have been around since about the late 1800s. As soon as John Deere and others invented the baling machine out on the plains they were building sod homes. It was easy for them to look at these big bricks and think about like oh man that's that looks bigger and better than stacking sod. One of the key concepts of minimizing carbon footprint is to minimize your concrete use. So the students and I excavated a big two foot wide trench. There's 44 inches of washed stone and then on top of that we poured a real minimal beam out of concrete so it's only eight inches thick. And then there's two rows of block and then basically just a sill plate that the straw rests on top of and the straw is just like big building blocks. We're getting ready to put these box beams on the top and they'll connect down to these rods that go down into the foundation and that will compress these walls and make them really firm and stout. The roof won't actually rest on the straw walls. We'll have a post and beam inside and the roof will set on that post and beam. I have a sawmill out at my farm and we were able to salvage quite a few logs off of campus and students actually milled up some cherry and some oak and elm timber that will be used in this project. So some of central campus is represented up here and north campus as well with the timber that's going to be used in this project. So after the walls are compressed they'll literally take a weed whacker and level out these walls and get them looking nice and straight and then we'll do three coats of earthen plaster on it. The first one is basically just a mud coat. It's just literally clay soil and water. This has like real long chunks of straw so we'll have like lots of tensile strength to fill in large gaps. But when we do the final adobe we want something that's much smoother so we have a shredder over there to take down these long chunks to like itty bitty pieces of like paper shredded straw that we'll then mix with clay and sand to make a much finer mix. And then our final coat will be basically the same with a little bit less straw and some lime putty in it. The lime will make it more waterproof so it should make it more weather durable and also harder to the touch. The students actually were real proactive thinking about a little solar system for this so they wrote a Planet Blue grant and Programming the Environment is supporting that as well. And this will be to the best of my knowledge the first official University of Michigan building that's a hundred percent solar powered and a hundred percent off the grid.
