 Music My name is Chris Wharton and I'm an associate professor in the nutrition program at Arizona State University And I'm extremely excited to have Jean-Martin Fortier here to offer this incredible workshop on profitable small-scale farming This is a collaboration that's been months in the making With a lot of organizations and I want to just call some of them out now so Kelly Young for example at U of A Cooperative Extension Helped put this on along with steadfast farms and Eric Schultz And a number of other folks are contributing to this event So I just want to make mention of one of the other organizations involved in this workshop It's called the food systems transformation initiative, and so this is a new organization at ASU It's one that I direct and it's really focused on Broadly equitable participation in the food system and that means we really care about food security and people's ability to have access to healthy Oftentimes locally produced culturally appropriate affordable food, but it's also about ensuring that people can have livelihoods in the food system And so this event is really an important piece of that we really care about Having an integrated and diverse food system and allowing people to have the opportunity to be producers and participate in the food system from that perspective as well Next part of this was about extending the season and I don't I'm not going to go in details here because You guys have the reverse This is typical of farming practices Northeast Farmers can't wait to get into their fields Come springtime And I always wonder what's you know why have you prepared your soil ten years ago? What's the deal with this? So again coming back to permanent beds Okay, well I'll go fast then So we use a lot of row covers these are UV treated sandbags The explanation for why we don't have the aisles the pathway covered with with clover is because we want to be able to use the dirt to anchor row covers insect nets throughout the season and because that's how we bury the cover crop These are different hoops these are made of pecs, plumbing, tube, half inch and they can be higher than your usually metal hoops Then you're usually metal hoops See them here This is a picture of the walk behind tractor on a permanent bed set up really early in the spring Contrasting with my friends that can't wait to get into their fields with their tractor I think it's silly That was a picture of that Metal bender You have hoops that are made out of metal This is especially important if you have snow loads This is the trick when you're making mini tunnels Making sure that the first hoop and the last hoop are really straight If one goes the whole thing kind of like So you want to have braces that anchor them or you put another one like this So to have like a cross or a shape Okay Caterpillar tunnels They're wonderful They can be moved really easily They're a bigger version of these hoop houses, these mini tunnels So they're two inch pipes and metal rods are cut into two feet pieces buried one feet And then you just slide the hoop into the rod And then you take a rope with a slip knot and you tie all the ridges together It creates the rigidity Then you bring it down there Tie it lock and then it won't move anymore And then you'll have a brace like that And then you have a structure You'll put the plastic over it And then the final stage is to bring all these ropes In the middle of all these Between the arches To really bring everything down So even if there's a lot of wind It should stay Call it a caterpillar tunnel Because it looks like a caterpillar Okay So the big advantage of this Is that it can be moved really easily It takes us two, three hours to put it down It's a six, it's a four times four It's a twelve by a hundred foot caterpillar It takes us half a day to dismantle it and put it somewhere else So I'll have it for certain crops at one point Then I'll move it And then I'll move it again And you guys could put shade plot over these We grow heirloom tomatoes in the summer Really popular back home This is a little hook That's how we keep it open And when you want to close it You just flip the hook inside And then the plastic will go all the way down Okay This is a three season shelter It's really not permanent This is a picture of Tim He was, that was his first year on his land Four days after putting this up He has a tornado So permanent hoop houses Sometimes better, especially in the winter So these are intercroppings So we'll have Because this is prime estate Really valuable space We want to do really early carrots We'll have the cucumbers intercropped with beets That are transplanted Lettuce mix Twelve rows It can grow year round Because it's really frost hardy And we use the combination of one shelter One other shelter So that's four degrees That's another four degrees And the crop can take minus four degrees So I'd add this up You have a system where you can grow pretty much year round Even if in Norton climates So no reason why you wouldn't be able to do this Except for the heat Okay Insects I'll go fast here too No, no Well, they're different insects So it's not the same But one thing stays that we have a solution Pre-planned for all of them Okay? So in most cases we're using insect nets So we also use biopesticides And we're not shy about that These biopesticides they're photo or biodegradable And they need to touch the insect on contact So you really need to know what you're doing You need to be scouting for certain specific insects And we always dress up for the occasion Because even if it's biological or natural It's still toxic We have something back home which is a scouting service Which sends us alerts every week of different insects That have arrived in different areas And it's a free And what this does is that it allows us to go look for certain problems With the idea that they might be there Because if you're just walking and kind of like observing things It's not the same thing as you're specifically going to a crop Looking for a bug or an insect Ticky tapes Great way to see if certain crops are there Again, when you buy these tapes there's procedures You just follow them, very interesting Insect nets You can't grow organic without them It's a mechanical, physical barrier And that's the best solution against problem See the difference here? Flea beetles No flea beetles It doesn't These insect nets have no thermal capacity So that's the big advantage of having them Especially in you guys' climate So different nets Different hole size These are like mosquito nets And you want to have the right net for the right insect Because they're not all the same price And you don't want to have only smaller nets Because they're 10 times the price So what you do Once you know what insect is a problem You call the manufacturer And you ask for the net to protect against that insect Everything that needs to be covered, yep Everything that needs to be covered, yep Everything that needs to be covered, yep No, because it's one crop per bed Same crop Okay Okay Okay Yeah, you're right Okay I'm protecting my summer squash against cucumber beetles Okay I'll have the net for that If it's also predated by another insect I'll have the net for the smaller of the two Yep We put bumblebees inside the hoop houses Okay So this is how we get rid of that insect We've sealed the tunnel with an insect net We also have this It's a sass So it's a little vestibule You open the door You close the door You close the door You have an inspection Good Then you open the other door We want to make sure that no insects can come in That's a great strategy to go about it Remember this picture? It ties down to your question We didn't learn all of this overnight It took us many years to figure it out And we started like that So If I would have had a book like the Market Gardener when I started It would have jumpstarted my farming career five fold That's kind of like my question I think so You're pretty diligent I think it would save you a lot of the learning step You know because there's a lot of ways to go really bad To start off bad If you have at least a good procedure A good guideline A good set up A good design You know all of the fine tuning Will take many years But at least you're off to the With a good system So this is a picture of our booth now So people are very much attracted to it Because there's a lot of abundance Everything is washed Everything is neatly placed And there's a lot of colors This is a picture of my farming friends That were in New Mexico when I was there Channing bros Channing bros They would do Turnips, rutabagas Radishes But they would pile it so high And then they would tell me JM, pile it high and watch it fly So that's my advice to you If you're doing farmer's market Pile it high and watch it fly People are very much attracted To abundance Abundance Okay Here you go Pile it high and watch it fly Usually it's to my eyeballs So I'm hidden behind the This is a picture of the first set up When we started doing CSA That was a long, long time ago And we used to do this in boxes So we would do the harvest We would bring everything into the cold room Then we would bring everything out Make the boxes Fold the boxes And deliver them And at one point We realized that we were There was a lot of steps involved into that So we kind of changed this around Where we just figured that Instead of having one person doing a hundred box How about we get a hundred person to do one box? So now how we do things So now how we do things Is that we bring the harvest directly To the part where our CSA is We put everything on two tables And then all of the members The CSA members They do their own boxes And this way we saved half of these work Which is significant And then people They have the impression That they're choosing And they're happier Oh great We get to choose this year Yeah So it's a little bit more prep on certain things You know we'll prepare the units together But Okay So we do this in a park It's outside And we've learned a lot of things through the years It used to be four hours So we would be there for four hours It's like And then we figured That can't work for us So we said to everyone It's two hours We'll be here from 4.30 to 6.30 And at 6.30 we're gone Haven't come and pick up your box You've lost it And everybody got in line And now everybody's here from 4 to 6.30 4.30 to 6.30 We saved two hours there We saved some time with changing the way we're doing the boxes This, that Okay So it's really simple And when we say community supported agriculture That's really what it is People get together They come down They meet their community members They pick up They make a conscious investment of their time To come and pick up these weekly shares And it means a lot to them Yes Yeah, bring their own bags Yeah Okay This is a picture of events we would have at the farm We don't hold them anymore Because this was the goal Was to get everybody on the farm And we would invite everyone all the time every year But nobody would come And so one year We got a little bit tired of this And we said, why don't we do a party? Why don't we cook up a really nice meal And have the meal outside in the garden? We were thinking about this And we were like, oh, that's a lot of work And we're already tired Okay, well what if somebody would cook for us? Okay, that's great There's a lot of money involved into renting these And you know, doing the dishes And say, okay, well why don't we rent dishes? Well that's a lot of money Okay, well, how about we get the CSA member to pay for that And pay for the tents and pay for the meal And so that's what we did So we hired everybody to do this And then when you have a CSA There's a contract at the start of the year And we put in fine prints That there would be a $20 fee this year For the farm to table event So people didn't really know They hadn't made it But why this was important was that That was the hook to get them on the farm We're having a party, you paid for it Why don't you come? And then they came And it was a huge success And that's how we met everyone really They saw the farm They saw the rabbit coop They saw, you know, our lifestyle What we were doing We were dedicated And that really That was a game changer When people really came to the farm There was a connection that was built This, by the way Is the husband of the French woman That will all complain About the leaves Are you serving the leaves? So random things now Because we'll have time for questions This is a greens harvester That was developed some years ago By an 18 year old young man And I collaborated in the design of this product And it's been saving us hundreds of hours Every year since So I've been harvesting salad mix on my knees With a harvest knife for a long time And when this tool came in What used to take us Four people, you know Two hours Now takes me Forty minutes Forty minutes So it's a really big time saver So these are the kind of tools That are coming out now That are really making Small scale farming Relevant again Because we're efficient These are all simple things You know, it's powered by a drill Everybody has a drill So along with this idea of having the multiplication of small farms Of replacing, you know, mass production with production by the masses Will come a tipping point where there'll be a market for some of these tools And when there's a market then there's people that are getting involved And then we get better products, harvesting things, better techniques There are also better tools And that just makes the farming scene more vibrant and more alive And we're really in the heart of that now And these are really exciting times What else do I have? This is for washing greens This, I don't know Eric if you have that problem But there's a lot of pressure now to have our washing stations be more What's the word? Yeah, commercialized, sanitary And so we've used, we've washed greens in washing machines for many, many years And then one inspector came to our farm and said you can't do that Because you can't clean it So that was the response It's just dismounting everything And it's just one barrel And then you can clean it Nope, that's another one This is another project I'm working on now This is called Ramiel woodchip Okay? And it's to bring some of the microbial life at a new level in the garden So we're using hardwoods And it's the top branches of hardwood in the spring Where all the energy of the tree goes there And we're chipping them And we're bringing this into the garden So it's bringing a lot of carbon into the soil But also a lot of microbial and fungi life And the way we go with this Is we put this in the aisle The pathway for one season And then it really decomposes And then when we raise our beds We bring this material back onto the soil And it really starts to bring a lot of humus back into the soil These are techniques that I want to develop more There's a lot of science behind some of that But as more and more as I develop this model I'd like to see the aisles become composting machines Because, you know, the aisles There's no point to them now Except to circulate So if we could put a lot of organic matter in the aisles And do the composting process there That could be an interesting process Well, if needs be I can always shovel in there Because it's not too thick Not too thick Well, this is because The thing that happens is that If you put wood chips onto your soil And you plant in it Since it's material that's not broken down All of the microbial life Will be busy trying to break that down And you'll get a nitrogen loss for your crop Okay? And so you don't want to do that So that's why we put it in the aisles But you could use straw the same But wood is more You know, that'll last for 5-10 years Before it's really broken down So that's why you want to add that element into your garden No, it's just It's just you're using small branches So it's not the tree It's branches that are not more than 2-inch When I say broken down, I mean turned back into soil But it's great to have something that is not to leave broken into your soil That's organic matter So now what we're doing is that we're doing one field block every year Thinking that in 10 years we'll start the cycle again So again, adding more diversity to the procedure To the system is what we want to achieve No? No? Yeah, one, you know, one season is enough Depends Depends the state of affairs I'm gonna end with these I'm not sure I want to go there But these are tools that I've seen in Europe They're built by the farmers themselves They're for permanent bed systems And very interesting So even the bigger mechanized growers are turning to permanent beds now And So That's it for my presentation Thank you Thank you
