 Soil erosion, planting trees to save the soil. Plants have roots that grow in the soil. The roots hold the soil together and stop it from being washed away. So, if there are plants in the area, then less soil will get washed away. What about land that has no trees on it? There, the soil has no such protection. So the soil on it just flows away with the water. This is how our forests act as big soil savers. We must plant more trees if we want to save our soil. Roots of trees hold the soil together and stop it from being washed away. Forests have trees. Trees have leaves. Leaves of trees fall to the ground. These leaves cover the soil. When water falls on the ground, it falls on the leaves. It does not fall directly on the soil. So, in the forest, even the leaves that fall from trees protect the soil from getting washed away. That is how important trees and forests are. The simplest way of stopping soil from being washed away is planting trees and growing grass. So, here we are. And that is easy enough for all of us to do. It's here is one and again. Vitt oso's
