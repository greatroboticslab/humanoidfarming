 Welcome my dear students to this lesson. My name is Belio Joshua, your agricultural science teacher. The topic for this lesson is cropping systems. What are cropping systems? Cropping systems refers to the order in which the crops are cultivated on a piece of land over a face time. That is the styles the farmers adopt in cultivating their crops. There are several types of cropping system but the popular ones especially that are common to our country in Nigeria are these monocropping, mist cropping, continuous cropping and crop rotation. What is monocropping? Monocropping is the act or the system of growing only one type of crop such as maize, cowpe, on a piece of land. That is only one crop is cultivated on a piece of land at a time. This system involves planting any type of crop at all but just one crop at a time. It can be maize but the maize will be planted solely. Another word for this type of cropping system is sole cropping. The principle is only one type of crop is planted at a time in a farmland. What are the advantages of this cropping system? The principle is also the use of the farmland. It makes the use of the farmland. It makes the use of machines in the farm possible. When only one type of crop is planted at a time, the use of the farmland. Mechanization such as the use of the farmland. It makes the use of the farmland. It is easily carried out. When there are several crops planted on a feed, it makes the use of the farmland. In the farmland. That is the use of farmland. It makes the use of farmland. It makes the use of farmland. Difficult. But if it's only one type of crop that is planted in the farm, it enables the use of farm mechanization. It leads to specialization among farmers. Another advantage of monocropy. When farmers participate in growing one type of crop over and over again, one season to another, they tend to become perfect. They tend to improve on the practice of growing that type of crop. They become specialized in that type of crop production. For instance, growing of cassava or growing of maize. When farmers do it over and over again, they become good at it. The control of weeds in the farm is easy with this method or this type of farming system. When you plant only one type of crop in a farm, for instance, it makes spraying it with herbicides easy. When you spray with herbicides, you can make use of a selective herbicide. Take for instance, in a maize farm, when you pick a selective herbicides, it can kill every other weed in the farm, but will not affect the maize plant. If there are more than the use of selective herbicides. If there are more than the use of selective herbicides, it will be useless because it will affect the other type of crop. Also, controlling of weeds with the use of machines is also make it is also made easy. When only one type of crop is planted, the use of machines, a kind out wading operation is made easy. What are the disadvantages of this cropping system? The first one is, it does not afford the farmer a variety of crops. That is, the farmer does not have this choice of many crop products. What he plants is what he harvests. If a farmer grows pepper in the farm, for instance, he only gets pepper. He does not afford him a variety of other kind of crops. If he grows pepper, he only gets pepper fruits. On the other hand, if he grows tomatoes, for instance, he only averts tomatoes, unlike mist farming. That are for the farmer variety of crops. Label may not be efficiently utilized. The use of label in mist farming will enable label to be efficiently used. But when it comes to mono-cropping, labor may not be efficiently utilized. Take for instance, when you hire laborers to weed the farm, they weed a particular farm where only one type of crop is sown. But if it were to be mist farming, several crops are sown there. Now, crop failure due to pests and diseases can result to a total loss. The failure of a particular type of crop can result to a total loss for the farmer. This can be due to disease or pest attack such as worms, locusts. All these are destructive pests. All these are destructive pests to plant. When they enter farmland, they can destroy the crops that are found in a situation where a farmer only grow one type of crop. The loss of that crop results to total loss for the farmer. Monkeys are destructive pests to maize plants. A situation where a farmer plants only maize in a region where there are several of these kind of pests available in that area, it can result to a total loss for the farmer. But if it were to be mist farming, like monkeys for instance, do not attack young. So this could have served as a composition for the farmer. Mist cropping is the act of planting more than one type of crop on the same farmland at a time. Mist cropping is the opposite to soil cropping or mono cropping. And there are two forms of mist cropping. There is interplanting and there is intercropping. And we explain them one after the other. When it comes to interplanting, a particular crop that is sown first or planted first before another one is also avested before the last crop. Take for instance in this farm. Yam is planted first and maize is planted last. Maze is avested before yam. So that means maize is intercropped with yam. Maze being the last crop that is planted is still avested first. In this instance, maize is planted before melon. But maize is equally avested before melon. So maize is said to be interplanted with melon. If it is planted first and still avested first, then it is interplanted with the other crop. If it is planted last and yet avested first, it is said to be intercropped with the other crop. What are the advantages of this system? It affords the farmer a variety of crops. Maze farming, sorry, mist cropping Maze farming, affords the farmer a variety of crops. When farmer plants several types of crops in the farm, he has this variety of options available to him. He can plant tomatoes, pepper, melon, maize and so on. It provides insurance against the failure of one type of crop. When one particular type of crop fails, maybe due to disease attack or pest attack, farmer will get composition for his effort, for his labor with the rest of the crops that are planted on the farm. Take for instance, if tomatoes are planted with other crops and tomatoes are bad for this season, the farmer will be compensated from the product he will get from the other crops. If it is maize, he will get composition from the other crop. It ensures efficient utilization of labor. This system of farming ensures efficient utilization of labor. If a farmer hired laborers to work in his farm, there are several crops present in that farm. The money he would have used to clear a large area of land, to weed a large area of farmland, can be used to weed a farmland that has several types of crops planted in it. It's efficiently used labor. What are the disadvantages? It does not encourage the use of machines in the farm. This system of farming, or of cropping rather, does not encourage the use of machines in the farm. This is an avestor. It avests everything off the farm. Avesting of grains. Now this particular machine cannot be used where there are up to two or three crops on the same farmland. Because it will avest everything together. And some might not be mature yet. So this system of farming discourages the use of machines in the farm. It is labor intensive. This is demanding in terms of labor. There is need for enough manpower to be able to practice this system of cropping. It requires a lot of labor. There is need to employ more ends in carrying out the activities in a mist farm. It is equally tiring to the farmer himself. Mist cropping is a labor intensive cropping system. It leads to rapid exhaustion of soil nutrients. Mist cropping, since there are several types of crops planted together on the same farmland, it depletes the soil nutrients readily. The soil tends to lose its fertility with time. After continuous cropping, planting more than one type of crop in the same farmland, it tends to deplete the nutrients of the soil as time goes on. The nutrients that are present in the soil is limited and concurrent use of planting of mist crop depletes the soil.critical水 feedings is a greatlerin secondaryцы можно use longermetical forms my soil not in that nature.
