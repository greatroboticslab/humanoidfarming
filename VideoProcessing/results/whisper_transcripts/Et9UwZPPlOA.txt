 Well, happy February. I'm headed to our first local farm equipment auction of 2023. I've got nothing in mind to buy, but you never know what you'll find. So come along. The thing about auctions is the unknown, that you might get a great deal on something, or you might wait around all day and either overpay or not even get it. The other thing is if you're selling things, you don't know what you're going to get. So, like for instance, years ago, I came across a water cooler. It had hot water and cold water. It was brand new. I don't even know where I got it, but I took it to the auction because I thought, man, this thing's probably very valuable. I got a dollar for it. One dollar. Never fails. There are always interesting things at an equipment auction. Now, 60. 60 down and 50 down and 60 down and 80 down and 50 down and 50 down... How about you? 60 down and 50 down and a little bit... You want to be 60, 70, 70, 70, 60, 70, 70, 70, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60, 60. 60 dollars. What's your number? Nice club car carryall. I love these things. 869, 869. I'm on a mare. Got a long track back here. 35, 31 mare down by a mare. The 10, the 30, the 30, the 30, the 30, the 30, the 40. Alpha Theta, Alpha Theta, Alpha Theta, Alpha Theta, Alpha Theta, 60, 60, 60, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 80, 80, 100. I was going to hold my camera up over my head for a creative shot, but then I was afraid they would think I was bidding. Some neat old machines. I had one of these. I feel like everybody's had one of these at one time, right? I don't know if that's an 8N or a 9N. I had a 9N. I think that's what that is. Lots of antiques here. Nice. I would like a combine. I don't have a use for one, but it's just such a fun, enormous machine. Thank goodness it is sunny because out here in this open field it is windy and chilly. I have a question for all of you out there in the comments section. I have a question for you. Look at this white tractor. Did it come with a hood ornament? I mean that's pretty fancy. There are a lot of older machines here, but there are some pretty nice modern ones too. I think this used to be a Kubota. I bet it still runs great. A whole little section of John Deere here. Very nice. Old Kubota. Holy smokes. Look at the size of that cylinder. It seems disproportionate. There's hardly any cylinder wall there. Giant. What a legend. No seriously. What a legend. Now that is a tractor. Six cylinder gas engine. Never flat tires. Never have to worry about a dead battery. Three point hitch and power take off. Nope. But you have this which would run almost any piece of equipment with a big belt. You could keep some very fancy chickens in here. I have to remind myself that things I would normally throw away must have some value to somebody. Right now they're selling some rough sawing lumber. Makes me wonder if I had a saw mill. What's going to get for lumber? I don't know. That was $105 for seven pieces of oak. Rough sawed. Probably two by eight, two by ten. That doesn't seem like very much money for that nice wood. $16928. Oh my, looky there boys. Double loop rim. Good look. That's almost two tires, almost two rims of a thousand for the pair. 500. Five hundred. Five hundred. for that nice wood. 16, 928, oh my, looky there boys. Double loop rim, good look, I'd say almost two tires, almost two rims, and a thousand for the pair. 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 500, 300, 300, 300, 100, 100 100 and 1 half, 100, 100, 1 half, 150, 100 with the heat 1 half, 100 with the heat 1 half, 00": 00": for those two tractor tires and rims that seemed really fair maybe prices are down this year fire sale wow the speedometer's melted funnily enough i was just talking to my friend about that our speedometer's melted and as a result it's very hard to say with any degree of accuracy exactly how fast we were going i totally missed the vehicle section a lot of trucks here for sale look at this guy coming up i love that i love it boy for an old truck in the northeast this thing is in really good shape i betcha that would run seems kind of out of place here to farm sale i actually found something that i'd kind of like to have i don't know if i want to lay around for it though i'm gonna say the old easy go is easy gone hey if you're one of the people who came up to me today and that i gave one of my stickers to i want to thank you for watching today why thank you and well thanks everybody for watching today i'm out of there 50 there nice planks there about 50 there 25 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 40 now 50 50 50 down 60 60 50 down a bit down 60 to 60 50 down a bit now here to 60 50 down a bit now here to 60 so 50 789 yeah last year if you remember lumber was still off the charts expensive i know it's come down i don't even know where it is today but it's not where it was and it's kind of sad to see this rough sawn lumber selling what i think is pretty darn cheap they've got two trucks running so if you want something in two different rows you better make your choice hey there's something for our friend joseph over at the garden tractor boy channel if we could just ship that to the uk i'm so cold and tired it's funny there were a couple things that i wanted to just see what they would go for and you think you have time so you walk around you come back and you missed it 200 one twelve S свидam I got it. So I bought this carriage. Oh man, there's the line to pay. That's a big old line. Thanks very much. Take care. Oh boy. Well, I didn't expect to buy anything today, but that's the fun of an auction. So I saw what I really wanted was that Amish buggy. I thought that was kind of neat. I thought it would make a neat decoration. And I was going to bid up to $400 on that, but it went higher and I didn't really need it. And then there was that little carriage next to it, which has some pretty significant rot in the wood. So it's really just decorative. It would take a lot probably to make it functional. Plus I don't have a horse. But so that one started up and it started in at like $100. So I jumped in on that one. And then I thought there were three people bidding on it, but it may have just been me and somebody else. So I got confused and I dropped out for a little while after it went over $250 or something. And then I jumped back in and apparently I bid $375. So I didn't really, I didn't really even pay much attention. So when the guy said sold, he looked at, he pointed at me. So I was kind of surprised that I won it. But anyway, that, that was pretty neat. And then a woman walked up to me afterwards and told me I got a really good deal and that I should be happy. So I am, and it's going to be happy because it's really cool looking. It's not good for anything other than decoration, but I have a plan for it, which I hope will come into play in our near future. So that was fun. Let's go pick it up. Well I went home and I picked up the trailer and I picked up Ann. She doesn't know what I bought. So it's a surprise really with her in mind. Oh, and I picked up Hachi too. Right Hachi? Okay, so let's play a game. Okay. I don't want you to know what the item is. So I'm not, yes, I'm not going to, I'm not going to respond to anything you say, but you can name some things that you think it might be or things you'd want it to be. But you're not, no clues. But I'm not giving any clues and I'm not going to respond even if you get it right. Okay. A chainsaw that would be right for me, but you would not have brought the trailer. Correct. Oh, I'm not supposed to respond. Go ahead. Just a, just a, hmm. Um, a digger, a front end loader. Okay. What else? We have a front end loader, so keep that in mind. A bigger one? That's good. A bigger front end? A bigger front end loader. A bigger front end. A bigger front end. A bigger front loader. Um, what else could it be? Um, something that moves through, like a better bush hog. I'm not responding. Is there something wrong with the red one? I'm not responding. Isn't this where we got it? This is where I got the one last year. Okay. Yeah. And what's wrong with it? Nothing's wrong. It's great. Okay. I like, I like where you're going with all these answers because that just means you're going to be really surprised. That it's little. That I'm going so big. That it's different than what you're going, that's all. Oh, so it's none of those things. Oh, I wasn't going to say anything. Oh my God. Is that the stagecoach? Is that what you got? That's it. Oh my God. That's so much fun. It's my present. Eddie, that is so wonderful. Oh look, I'll be fancy. I'll come through the spoke. I'm so creative. Hey, I gotta turn sideways. I think that might be not good. That is a piece. That's a good one, right? Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. That's fun. Well, there's our unexpected auction find for today. What do you think? Very cool. I would have never picked this as a guest. See? But it's the best. Truly, just so much fun. It's fun. It's a fun decoration. Yeah. Mm-hmm. All right. So, yeah. Thanks for watching. See ya next time. Bye guys! Que seuride ofUPS4 acts like this one. And we'll note that I'll show you something ah, not appgast, that'll play, and until the
