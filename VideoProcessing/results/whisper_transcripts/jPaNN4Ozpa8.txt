 I don't know if you know, but grains could be contributing to your weight gain. Here's how. First, grains have been genetically hybridized to increase yield. The problem with this is that this has increased specific lectins in the plant, like gluten. Gluten is pro-inflammatory, can cause damage to the intestinal lining, and if you have any inflammation in your gut, it's going to be really hard to lose weight. The fiber in grains can also feed gram-negative bacteria in your gut, which produce endotoxin that can be absorbed in your bloodstream and lead to inflammation. And too much endotoxin is associated with weight gain, too. Pesticides often sprayed on grains are known endocrine disruptors that impair hormone function, particularly estrogen, which can lead to fat accumulation as well. Grains are often also fortified with literal iron shavings, which is obviously not a good thing since excess unbound iron can increase oxidative stress and damage your mitochondria. So I personally avoid grains at all costs, and if you want more simple and effective fat loss tips like this, give me a follow and join my newsletter at metabolicupgrade.com.
