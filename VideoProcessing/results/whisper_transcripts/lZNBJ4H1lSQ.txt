 The way we farm affects the planet, the animals and all of us. Four Paws is advocating for farming practices that are not only respectful to the environment, but that can help us better adapt to the current planetary crises. Intensive agriculture not only compromises animal welfare, but it's one of the main causes of biodiversity loss. 77% of all agricultural land is used for feeding or grazing animals. Yet, in reality, they're all kept indoors, suffering from cramped conditions and not able to enjoy their natural feeding or social behaviours. Four Paws is influencing global agricultural policies in many UN spaces, like the upcoming Biodiversity COP16. We're pushing for a transition to farming systems that have excellent standards of animal welfare and that work with nature, not against it. Ending harmful farming practices isn't just better for animals, it's better for our world. Help us advocate for a future where farming works for the animals, for the planet and for people. Ending harmful… Ending dop, lifelong OFF Thank you.
