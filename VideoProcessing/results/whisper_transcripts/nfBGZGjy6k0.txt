We're doing now, we got a few cows, calves, we're trying to match up. We're having a hard time getting cows tags. That's what we're going to do, like you've seen in the last video. We did it across the way, trying to tag calves, and we're just going to leave them. We're going to match themselves up, and then we'll load them up that way later. We got about two loads left over here, and then we head across the road. So that's the plan. We're going to do six cows on the front, one on the back. We're going to do six cows. We're going to do six cows. Up! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Volendo. Yo! Filip почвano Gar verk. g nuestras rentas qualcheAreng Estelido? Queda Pero me tourné la luna, Queda... What we're going to do here, we haven't fed these cattle yet this morning and now it's the afternoon after lunch. So we're going to get them fed here and then we'll get these paired and then all the cows will come in and we keep them in here and get them all paired up and get them shipped out. We're going to try rounding up calves, we're going to get some gates in here so we can get the cows going. Most of the Herefords are over here so we'll get all of them down past here behind the North farm. Yeah so we'll have everything pretty much whittled down today. We've got maybe 20 left over at the other farm and then at the North farm, cows haven't calved yet. They aren't going to calf, they didn't get bred back. We've got some cull cows, stuff like that. We've got left over there. So we're going to get everything dispersed to all the pastures. Today we have been doing everything that's left over, late calvers, I'll get a little hodgepodge of cattle and cows and calves over at my house. Kind of what we'll end up doing because we still have the bulls there. So once we get, we'll pull the bulls out of there and then we'll get everything moved out of there. All the brand new calves. You get too far away. Look, look. Look in and we go. I don't want to squeeze through that. Look out there watching the knees there. What's up? I want it. I want it. I want it. I want it. I want it.
