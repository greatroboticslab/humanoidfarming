 Hydroponics is a method of growing plants, usually crops, without soil. In this method, the crops or plants are grown on water rich in essential nutrients. According to studies, plants grown hydroponically grow faster and healthier than plants in the soil since they are being provided with required nutrients directly to their roots through water. Nutrients are dissolved in this water that surrounds the roots so plants have easier access to the nutrition they need. Many different civilizations have utilized hydroponic growing techniques throughout history. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Floating Gardens of the Aztecs of Mexico are examples of hydroponic culture. As the many benefits are realized, now scientists and horticulturalists are experimenting with different methods of hydroponics. It was even integrated into the space program by NASA as they are considering the practicalities of growing food in long-term space missions. Hydroponics allows plants to grow up to 50% faster than they would in soil and fresh organic produce can be harvested throughout the year. It also helps to produce higher yields than traditional soil-based agriculture and allows crops to grow in areas of the world that cannot support crops in the soil. Hydroponics is good for both environment and the ground product since it eliminates the need for massive pesticide use compared to traditional soil. soil-based agriculture. Hydroponic systems require only around 10% of the water that soil-based agriculture requires. The water used in a hydroponic system can be reused thereby reducing the need for more fresh water supply. It is also a great option when there is a lack of land or yard space for gardening as it doesn't require a lot of space and can even be done indoors.
