 This is all the food I'm making for Alfa's Mud Kitchen, which is covered in paint now. It's very rough at the moment, the bits I've done. It's my tomato, strawberry, looks a bit like this at the moment. I still need to glaze them, do my oranges. Currently I've just done the base coat of orange. I've done like this for example is really rough, nowhere near down on my peas. Pizza's done, that just needs glazing. I could shoot like a paint on it, love that. Um yeah really happy with those. I am also making some for work as well, um for the children to enjoy there. So I'm really happy with some of them, some of them I'm like a little bit rough. Um but yeah I just thought I'd show you my journey of my journey, who do I think I am? I just thought I'd show you like... what I'm doing. This is what I mean by it, I've only done one layer and you sort of have to layer it and then layer it and layer it. Which is really annoying, I should have got thicker paint. But in my background I have got an arthur. It has mud kitchen in my background, in my view. I actually need my sunglasses to be able to show you what plants I have. Weirdly enough it's actually really sunny. Sunflowers. So far I could do with a little bit, they could do with a little bit of help at the moment. And a bit, I need to actually put those ones in pots. The mud kit, oh okay we've gone on the floor now to do it, love it. This is what it's for you see and I love it. Here is my precious vegetable patch. So rhubarb, runner beans, pumpkin, that is lettuce leaf and spinach, broccoli. Is that everything? Well everything on the actual vegetable patch. Hey boo. I want that one. I want that one. You can get that one out. Then we've got strawberries, tomatoes and black currant. I actually had this one last year and it's still going strong somehow. Strawberries. You can just about see, so I've just got paint all over my hand still. Those are all of my main plants. And then the bug hotel is over there. And yeah, I've basically done nothing so far. This is what I mean, I sort of just gave up. I mean I've got an ant, does that count so far? My idea was to have like an actual lavender section. And yeah, because that's good for bees. Then I wanted pine cones and all that. There's just so much to do. There's literally so much to do for it. I wanted it to have bright colours somewhere and parts of it. Because you know, bees like, they're attracted to colourful plants and all that. I will see. I literally have no idea where I'm going with it right now. And I've got my old teacup bird feeder as well. But I wanted to like sort of put somewhere with it. Because it's originally on the big apple tree. If you have any ideas on what to do with the bug hotel as well, please give me some advice. I would love to know. So far the only advice I've had is on Pinterest. So my mum actually got these. Free with the honey she buys. So I thought, you know what, let's plant them. They are plant bee. Like wild flowers to help bees come to your garden. And I'm going to put them right here where the roses are growing next to the bug hotel. Tear open. Tear open. Get me. Get you. No. My turn. On that one. On that one. Yeah. This one. Yeah, do you need a hand? Yeah. Wow. Again. Again. Again. I need to fill it up. Can I fill it up? Yeah. Thank you. What else have we got to tidy up? Are you taking the bowl? Where are you going to put that then? Where does that go? This way. This way. In there? Yeah. Oh, is it even putting the mud back? One. This way. In there as well. We're all finished now. We are. That was the cutest tidy up I've ever seen. Thank you. How did I forget about my lovely herb garden? I'm slowly growing it. I'm slowly growing it. The newest member is the mint. Look at the shower. Are you smelling? Does it smell nice? Yes. How are you smelling this? TV is dry for example. Can I eat it? I drank like a latte in the oven?
