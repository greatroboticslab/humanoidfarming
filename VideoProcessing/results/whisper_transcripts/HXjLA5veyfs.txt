 One of the most important factors governing the success of our crops is spacing. Just like this sweet corn behind me here, the space between your plants and rows has a huge effect on your plants health and productivity. However, corn is a bit of a unique one in that spacing governs not only growth and health, but also pollination and crop viability. It's the fine line between having enough space for these large vigorous plants to grow, but also being close enough to get adequate pollination for the ears to develop. Welcome to another episode of the Garden Quickie, where in two minutes or less we tackle the most pressing garden questions of the day. And today, we're talking corn spacing. A little less than three weeks ago, we seeded this eight foot bed with Golden Bantam sweet corn. I sowed the seeds at a spacing of four to six inches. It worked out great and nearly all the seeds sprouted. But much like carrots or beets, we've sown far more than we need. About double, in fact. Corn should be spaced about 10 to 12 inches apart from each other. Closer than that, and the plants begin to compete with each other for water and nutrients. And for a big vigorous plant like corn, that's not going to end well. But any further apart, and the corn won't receive adequate pollination. You see, corn is entirely anemophilous, or wind pollinated. So it requires other corn plants in a specific density of spacing to get max pollination. And thus, max harvest. It's best to thin when the plants are about four inches tall and have three to four blades. Don't pull them out. Simply cut them off right at the root collar. These plants here are a little bit large, and I definitely want to thin them at a much younger age. At least a week or so ago. Either way, if you seed it at a six inch spacing, simply cut down every second plant. Right at the root collar like we mentioned. Now, the root collar is where the stem meets the soil. Easy stuff. That's it. Shouldn't take you long, and your corn will be well on its way to an epic harvest later this summer. Know what else doesn't take that long? Garden quickies.
