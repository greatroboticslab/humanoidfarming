 Y'all just can't let nobody damn sleep in. Out here hooping and damn hollering on my off day. Come on. Hello, go to your store. Thank you very much. Don't step on my damn chicken. Come on, Roo-Roo. Let's go. Where is your fucking boot? I'm telling you right now, you mess up them high dollar shoes I just put on you. We're gonna fight. Go on to your store. Wook is too hot for this now. Come on. Get in your stall, Robo-Girl. Missing boot ass. Fluffy, get your ass out of my damn horse feed now. Absolutely not. That's the cat food. No, ma'am. No, ma'am. No, ma'am. Get out. Hell no, you're not coming back in here. It's too damn hot-falled shit now. It's supposed to be fall. Fucking fingernails are sweating.
