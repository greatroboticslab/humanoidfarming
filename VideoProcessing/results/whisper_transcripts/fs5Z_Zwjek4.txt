 How will astronauts going to Mars be able to grow their own food? Researchers working on the International Space Station are experimenting with growing plants in the microgravity environments of space to figure out the best way to provide fresh food for future astronauts traveling to Mars. Microgravity isn't the only environmental difference that exists in space. In a weightless environment, up and down has no meaning, so roots grow in odd, chaotic directions. Shoots that emerge from the soil in search of the sun find, instead, a cold metallic lamp that never rises or sets. There are also volatile organic compounds that can affect seed production if they aren't properly handled, along with higher radiation levels which might cause mutations or change how the plants grow. According to Dr. Annalisa Paul from the University of Florida who worked on the study, in these experiments we found that light had a very profound impact on not only the direction of root growth but also the morphology or patterns of root growth. Experiments onboard the International Space Station will help astronauts on the NASA spacecraft called Orion that has plans to make the one-year trip to our neighboring planet.
