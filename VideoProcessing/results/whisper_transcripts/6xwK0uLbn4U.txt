 This is a little presentation Atticus and I gave at Bayou Land Young Farmers meeting Monday night on fertilization and this is kind of the tail end of it but you know technology's come a long way this the picture on the left is actually my dad's 1940s model bee tractor you can see the triple 13 and the old Kentwood jug and down into the fertilizer pick right in the middle and then come over on the right and this is a big stubble splitter rig that Jim Domain uses and they started out with a really big coulter and then went to these smaller yetter coulters but I'll get into more of that later I've got some videos hopefully I'll be able to play them but the the this all started with I guess the first person who started playing with it on our end was Taylor Blanchett he's got a lot a lot of heavy land in that Laurelville area and his idea was to be able to get in there early with some balloon tires and you know the top of the rule always dries out faster than the in the fur so the idea was to excuse me to get in there earlier and get his his fertilizer down and get the cane crop up and going we had four basic treatments in this test we split the stubble which is you know you'll see the coulter running right down the middle of the stubble and then coulters 18 inches apart which in my experience is a good bit narrower than where you would normally run a two coulter rig normally they're out about 24 inches and then conventional where we off-board put the fertilizer in the in the off-bar cut and then wrapped it back up and then the fourth one was kind of a wild card it it kind of gave me a panic attack when I saw it but we actually surface applied the uh the fertilizer and uh I was really surprised that there weren't any uh yield losses from that but we had ideal conditions last year so that that uh that that probably contributed to the lack of differences so like I said this this big stubble splitter rig that the domains use that you can see the the knife cut right in the middle of the stubble um it's uh works really well I really like this setup when when they started this they were pulling a bubble rig uh with the fertilizer in it behind the applicator and they went from that to tanks on the tractor just trying to have one less uh wheeled piece of equipment in the field some of the concerns we had um I had initially was was cutting stubble and you can see in the picture on the left where they they definitely disrupted some of these young plants and on the right you can see the leaves were just trimmed and it's something the grower asked me after the meeting Monday night he said how late can you do this and I said yeah that's a really good point the later you get the more damage you're gonna have once this cane starts making a stalk uh so that's something that definitely needs to be considered in this point in the game uh but these this test last year was put out early and uh the the cane fully recovered from any damage uh that was incurred due to the cultures in the middle uh like the guy who run that ran the applicator last year told me he said just don't look at it for a week or two so this is a video you can see this this colter rig in the middle and I have a couple videos I'll play and this is so the second video I showed was um that was the original the luvier coulter's is a 24 inch coulter uh the the first video was the yatter coulter's it's a little bit smaller to 20 inch coulter so there's a difference of opinion on you know if you're putting fertilizer deep enough or you know or too deep maybe um but there's a couple more pictures here just the the fertilizer cuts and on the right uh it's kind of hard to tell but there's a big chunk of soil at the drain that that was knocked out of place by the coulter so there may be some concerns as that and I was really really surprised behind especially behind the yatter coulter it's like they call it a fluted coulter it's kind of wavy and that soil tends to crumble and and it really does fall right back in the in the groove behind the fertilizer so why would we even consider not cultivating obviously this is something Atticus and I noticed last summer walking cane in these irrigated fields in some of the new areas the cane production I didn't realize how far the roots extended out into the middle but we could actually hear the roots crunching under our boots as we were walking the fields so especially conditions being late it's certainly something to be considered to not prune what roots are there as a second treatment we went with two coulters 18 inches apart um and like I said that's a it's a good bit narrower than what I would consider conventional but you know I really like this treatment as well because he's putting the fertilizer right where he needs it uh one disadvantage with this and within a conventional approach that you avoid with splitting the stubble is you put your fertilizer in the middle of the row like that and you're able if you have weed problems or if you come in and put your fertilizer when the ground conditions are a little damp you can come back and off bar whether you're fixing some ruts or whether you made a little uh a little rut when you put the fertilizer down you can come back and fix that if your fertilizer is in the top of the row as opposed to if it's in the hip of the row and conventional like I said we off board put the fertilizer in the trench and then wrapped it back up and then the fourth uh fourth treatment like I said it I was really surprised I wasn't real happy with this application because like I said it's on top of the row there was an addition last year of a product they call slow in it's a slow release component to the fertilizer blend that may have had something to do with the the fact that we didn't see any any differences but I really think it had more to do with ideal conditions we didn't have any great big heavy heavy rainfalls following this this application but we had adequate rain and so they incorporated the fertilizer you know with rainfall and it was able to stay in position so like I said there were no significant differences in uh in tonnage tons per acre and uh tons pounds of sugar per ton or in pounds of sugar per acre um these were large plots these were five row plots for replications across the field and we had uh we treated the truck weights as a replication within within those five rows and uh and we just used core data um for the for the sugar data so but uh with that I can entertain any questions or or hear any comments
