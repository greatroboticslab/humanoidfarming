 Hey guys, what's going on? Welcome back to another Hay Day video. In this video we're going to be playing the latest Balloon Maker event in the game that started today, but by the time you guys watch this video, I think it's already been two or three days. So here's the Birthday Balloon Maker. A new machine is delivered as a gift by the postman. You can make the balloons. You get the groovy notes that you can trade for the rewards. And here are the Groovy Balloons boat events. It's the Groovy Birthday season. Boats all want some time-limited gifts. Fill the crates, use the catalog, completing an entire boat will reward you with some extra groovy notes. Right, so here's the currency you're going to be using. It's called Ask the Groovy Notes. Right, so how to play this event? It's very simple. The first thing you're going to do is you're going to open the package, which you guys would be seeing right here. Um, sorry, can't sell you that. And sorry, once again. Yeah, so this is a package. This will be delivered to you by Alfred the Postman. So let's open this and see what it says. Okay, Birthday Balloon Maker. Best regards, Hay Day team. We're just going to claim this and it's going to go directly into the storage. You guys can see in the bottom left corner. I'm just going to open this and here we go, the Birthday Balloon Maker. You just have to put it out on your farm. Now, some people get really confused. First of all, they see that they don't see the package. It could be because you already had a package. That's why the machine didn't come. Or you probably didn't refresh the game. But I'm sure at this point, everyone has this machine. And secondly, it gets stored in your storage right here where you purchase the other machines from. So here's a look at the Balloon Maker. I think it looks so pretty. Of course, the theme of this machine is also 1970s, the groovy. So I'm just going to tap on it and here we go. Eight balloons. This is just insane. Look at the mastery. You guys can see. Right. So first of all, let's listen to the sound of this machine. How does this sound? Okay, so this sounds like another old machine in the game. So the sound is not new. These are all the balloons and their ingredients, which I've already shared. Now, the most important thing, how many slots you should open in the Balloon Maker? Well, I definitely don't recommend people to open all the slots because I think that's not worth it. I think four to five would be enough. And that's what I'm going to do. I think that's still really, really expensive. But I think it's going to be worth it because we have the catalog and there's going to be a lot of, a lot of new decorations. Like you guys can see over here, they're here in the game for the next five days. We also have some tools, puzzles, permits. These are going to come later. Even the tent. Wow. Why are we having some fall decorations in the birthday? Getting any check vouchers, which is kind of a shame, but that's okay. I'm still happy for the permits. It's called as the gifties catalog. Even the art has been changed, which is so cool. Okay, now your boats are going to ask for the balloons. Like you guys can see over here, I'm being asked for the record balloons. So, you know what? Let's just open the slots. I think I'm going to work with four slots at the moment. That will be enough. The best part is that the balloons now just take 10 minutes. It's not going to be a problem. And I'm just going to make some record balloons. Wow. They even cost three diamonds to speed up, you guys, and not 10 diamonds. As was the case in the last Easter egg machine. The eggs were costing 10 diamonds. I mean, they were taking 10 minutes, but you had to spend 10 diamonds. But this is so cool. It's just three diamonds. I'm impressed. This means you can even spend diamonds. And I'm just going to fill this. You guys saw that I just got 20 groovy notes, which is cool. So, you know, let me just fill the other crates. Okay, I'm not going to ask for help because I need all the groovy notes for myself. Let me just spend a bunch of diamonds over here. Yeah, I think that's it. And we're just going to fill the crates. Here we go. I just collected 80 notes. And when I'm going to complete this boat, I'm going to get 50 more. And I'm not going to make any more balloons because I'm going to wait for my next fodder. And that's the balloon which I'm going to make. So let me just put an advertisement in the shop so that somebody can, you know, help my boat and I can make more balloons. Now, I really enjoy these events. I think they're so much fun. They're a little hard, especially if you don't have the ingredients. And that's another important thing. Make sure that you stock up all the ingredients like the indigos, the soybeans, because you will not be finding this stuff in the paper once this even starts. Everybody would be purchasing this. So your only option would be to plant your own crops. And that's what I'm going to do. So let me just harvest my crops over here. Right. Come on. Okay. Here we go. And I do have soybeans on my baby farm. So that's not going to be a problem. I'm going to plant some soybeans right here. Yeah. And I could probably go with some. Chickpeas. Perfect. Okay. Did somebody help my boat? Right. Two more crates to go. Okay. So finally my boat's been done. Let's send it away. And what do we need for my next fodder? Okay. Wow. Record balloon once again. And some fresh diffuser and a fancy cake. right so I'm just gonna put four now usually the boats ask for at least four or six balloons sometimes they can ask for like two balloons in one uh crate so make sure that you keep making the balloons even when you don't need them for example this is just gonna take like 40 minutes and my boat's gonna come in like next uh four hours after 40 minutes I would make more balloons next 40 minutes I would do the same and so on I usually set an alarm because I get distracted very easily so I have to be in the game uh to make the balloons but yeah I'll see you guys soon when my next order comes and then we shall see what happens all right guys I'm back and here comes my second boat uh once again with the record balloon I'm just gonna start filling the crates it's asking for four of them once again each record balloon gives you 20 notes which is uh good so we're just gonna ask for help on some of the crates yep here we go and I'm just gonna put in advertisements so that somebody can help me fast all right let's uh go with the hand drill and you can see that I did make some other balloons I made two of the checkered balloon and I'm just gonna wait till my boat gets filled and then I'll put the next balloons into my machine because because it's almost my bedtime right now so I don't want to make the balloons not knowing what's my next order I'm gonna make sure that I'm putting the balloons that I need for my next boat so that next morning I can um fill those crates and I don't think that I can purchase anything at the moment all right perfect somebody just uh filled my boat which is awesome I've got 15 uh more notes and let's see what do we need for the next otter all right so okay let's make some guitar balloons so yeah that's what I'm gonna do before I might put some more you know because I'm still gonna do my farm management finally my boat is here and I think I'm just gonna start filling the crates once again it's asking for just one of the piece balloons I'm getting 10 of the groovy notes here we go that's a 380 I'm getting 50 more once I fill all these crates you know and I'm just gonna ask for help on the rest of the crates and let's put another advertisement right maybe with the hand drills I think yep here we go let's see what balloons I made so I made two guitar balloons I'm not gonna make any more I'm just gonna wait till uh my next otter but it's gonna be a little hard because I think I'm getting low on all these ingredients so I really need to stock up on them which are yeah the soothing pad right here I need to make more cotton fabric so that's what I'm gonna do and I think it asks you to make a lot of tomato soup yeah so all right so let's wait till my boat gets built okay finally my boat's been done I'm just gonna send it away let's get my extra musical notes what's my next otter okay we need to make some musical uh balloons so let's go over here and start making them I'm just gonna need some uh popcorns bread and corn okay so far all the boats have been asking for like one balloon in each crate which means four of the balloons and they only take 10 minutes to get ready so that's not even a problem I've got 430 musical notes and I think I'm gonna purchase uh one of the decorations over here let's actually get this one um the groovy guitar player I love this and I'm just gonna put it out so here we go it's kind of smaller than I expected but it's so cool it's obviously party themed which is like the whole thing in my favorite birthday so that's basically all about the birthday balloon maker or the groovy balloons uh boat event here in the game for another 19 or maybe 15 to 16 days by the time you guys are watching this video you have a lot of time um just get this um just get this machine and start producing the balloons you have the opportunity to get all these cool rewards let me know your thoughts and comments what do you guys think of this event how this event has been going on for you and if you're not already subscribed to the channel you might want to do because i'm going to post more haiti content thank you so much for watching i'll see you guys soon have a good day bye
