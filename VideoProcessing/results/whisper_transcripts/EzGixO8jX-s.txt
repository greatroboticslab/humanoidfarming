 I'll make do. It's a real pleasure to be here and represent class 6. Thinking about how to start this talk, I got to thinking about how it was that I came about to be doing the science that I'm going to be talking about today. Looking back, it seems like a pretty straightforward path. As far back as I can remember, I like to grow plants, and I like to watch them grow. By the time I was in high school, I knew I wanted to become a plant biologist and really figure out how they did it. How did plants stand in one place and do all the amazing things that they do? In graduate school, I got fascinated by photosynthesis. In part because it's centrality to all of biology, but also because technologically it was at the nexus of biochemistry and biophysics, and that's where I wanted to be. At that time, there were lots of things that we didn't understand about the photosynthetic process. The early part of my career, I was doing very basic mechanistic research using a reductionist approach. I think probably because I was so interested in knowing how plants grow, to me, the goal of reductionist research was to learn enough to start putting it back together. For photosynthesis, how does the chloroplast work? How does it work in the leaf? How does the leaf work in the plant? And then how does the plant work as a community of plants? And so it's that process over the last couple of decades that I have been really interested in doing, putting it back together. And so what I'm going to talk about today is a component of that. Over the last five to six years, I've been part of a group looking at opportunities to re-engineer photosynthesis as a strategy to improve crop yield. What I'd like to do in starting out this talk is to take a step back and look at what the global challenge is to agriculture over just the next couple of decades. And the place I want to start is here. And so this is just a cartoon of the global carbon cycle, the terrestrial part of it. And what it shows is that terrestrial photosynthesis removes amount of carbon from the atmosphere annually that's equivalent to about 15% of all the CO2 in the atmosphere. It's a massive biological flux. About half of that is used in autotropic respiration. That's the respiration that's used to maintain this photosynthetic biome and to grow it. And then the other half, about another 60 gigatons, often called net primary productivity, that's what's left to support everything else on the planet. Everything from the microbes up to us. So I think it's interesting to look at where does this net primary productivity come from in the terrestrial biosphere. And so you're probably not going to be surprised to learn that the biggest contributor is the tropical rainforest. We hear a lot about the massive savannas that are deployed around the world are the second biggest one. But what may surprise you is that the cultivation of crops represents right now about 15% of the net primary productivity of the terrestrial biosphere. So right now, we have a carbon footprint of about 15% just to feed ourselves. And so the UN Food and Agriculture Organization predicts that somewhere between 2050 and 2070, in order to meet agricultural demand, agricultural demand driven by increasing world population and driven by the greater affluence of that world population, in order to meet that demand, we're going to have to double productivity three to five decades from now. And so that seems like a huge challenge. And it is a huge challenge. But it's already been done once. It was done in the Green Revolution. And so between 1960 and 2005, when population grew 110%, went from about 3 billion to 6.5 billion, crop production across the world grew an incredible 165%, went from 1.8 billion tons to 4.8 billion tons. It's important to recognize, however, that 135% of that 165% increase was due to intensification. That is, the amount that's produced on a given land area basis. And only 25% of it was due to the recruitment of new lands and new croplands into cultivation. And what this figure shows... And what... Excuse me. And so what this figure shows is that, in fact, the land under cultivation spike was greatest in about 19... in the mid-1980s. It's pretty much plateaued or has been decreasing ever since. And so if we're going to double productivity, what it really means is we're going to have to double productivity on about the 1,200 million hectares that are currently under cultivation. And so what that means is that... is that crop cultivation is going to go from representing 15% of all terrestrial productivity, net primary productivity, to about 25%. And it also means that total terrestrial net primary productivity has to increase by about 12%. Unfortunately, yields aren't going that direction. And so the way to read this figure is that in the decade ending 1977, the per-decade increase in the productivity of these three crops was increasing about 30%, about 3% per year. That was sustained through the 80s. You can see in the 90s it starts dropping. And by 2007, for some of these small grains, it was really small. It's interesting, you know, China is the biggest producer and consumer of rice. They're investing 1,000 times more now than they did back in the 1980s. And so this suggests that the low-hanging fruit have been harvested and the next gains in productivity are going to be harder to come by. And so what's causing this stagnation? So I think to understand that, we need to look at what the components of yield are. And so this is called the yield potential equation. And so yield potential is the genetic potential of a crop. And so if you grow a crop in the absence of abiotic and biotic stresses, and so it has enough water, it has enough nutrients, it's not beset by disease or pests, that's the yield that you're going to get. And so yield potential is constrained by the total amount of solar energy that's available to the crop during the growing season. That's all the energy that's available. And then that is acted on by three genetically determined things in the crop. One is the efficiency of the crop to intercept that radiation. The next is the efficiency of the crop or the efficiency of photosynthesis to convert that radiation into biomass. And then finally, the decision that the plant makes and how it's going to partition that biomass between the vegetative part and the part that we care about. So potatoes in the case of the, potato tuber in the case of potatoes or the grain in the case of rice. And so what drove the green revolution, that 165% that I mentioned, is two of these components. One is the efficiency of interception. And so breeders were very good at selecting for plants that put out leaf area very quickly and covered the ground. And that's a main component of increasing light capture is how quickly you cover the ground. And so now our best crops capture about 85% of the total solar radiation that's available during the growing season. We think the theoretical limit's about 90%. And so maybe room for a little bit increase, but certainly not a doubling. What really drove the green revolution was this harvest index or partitioning efficiency. For small grains, it went from about 0.3 to 0.6, which means 60% of the above ground dry matter in wheat and rice and soybean and corn is now in the grain. We think the upper limit's about 65 to 67%. Again, room for small improvement, but not doubling. In the case of photosynthetic conversion efficiency, no improvement at all during the green revolution. And so is there room for improvement? And so you can do a calculation to try to figure out what the upper limit of photosynthesis is that has currently evolved. And so if we start out with, say, 1,000 millijoules of energy, about 50% of it is outside of the spectrum that drives photosynthesis. And so photosynthesis is driven by visible light. The light that we see, 50% of the solar energy is in the infrared. Plants are green, and so they don't absorb light very well, and so about 5% is reflected, largely in the green. Photochemical inefficiencies. Chlorophyll absorbs blue light, red light. A blue photon has about 75% more energy than the red photon. But all the photosynthesis is driven by the energy of a red photon. And so the rest of that is just lost to the system as heat, lost in femtoseconds. Carbohydrate synthesis, biosynthesis requires energy. And there's this process of photorespiration that's a very wasteful process in C3 photosynthesis. And I'm going to come back to that in a few minutes and explain more about it. And then there's maintenance respiration. If you do all these deductions, the theoretical upper limit for C3 photosynthesis as it's evolved on the planet is about 5%. The best that's ever been seen across an entire growing season, and these are for specialty yield trials, is about 2.5%. Farmers in the Corn Belt or wheat farmers in the UK average about 1%. And so it suggests that photosynthesis under agricultural condition is operating only about 20% of its potential efficiency. And so there is the possibility to double yield potential based on improving photosynthesis. And so I've asserted to you that if we improve photosynthetic efficiency, it will translate into improved crop yield. Is there any empirical evidence for that? I think the best empirical evidence is growing plants at elevated CO2, the CO2 that we're going to expect in the future. So at the University of Illinois, we have what's called a FACE facility, which is an acronym for free air carbon enrichment. And so within this ring, we can raise the CO2 concentration for the entire growing season to 600 parts per million, pretty much what we expect in 2050. Out here, it's 400. And so this is an experiment we did last summer with cassava. And this elevated CO2 stimulates photosynthesis both because the primary carboxylase isn't saturated by the substrate and also because it represses this process of photorespiration. And I'll tell you a bit why later. And so with cassava in this experiment last summer, and so this is just a one-off, we saw a 25% increase in yield. Soybean, we've done for 12 years. We see an average of about 16% increase. Rice and wheat have done other parts of the world in other face experiments. In all cases, there's an increase in yield that's proportional to the increase in photosynthesis. And so we know enough about photosynthesis now that we can model it in silico and we can ask the question, if we change this, if we change that, what's going to show through at the leaf level, at the plant level, and all the way through to the canopy level and affect yield? And so we've done a lot of this modeling. It was led largely by my colleague Steve Long at the University of Illinois. And we came up with these various targets, and these are the amount of improvement that we expect. And so as I said, this is part of a big consortium, international consortium, and we're working on many of these different strategies. The one I'd like to talk about just a little bit today is this photorespiratory bypass, which is lowering the energetic cost of this photorespiratory process. And so what is photorespiration? So this is the chloroplast and this is the primary carboxylase of higher plant photosynthesis, which is rubisco. What it normally does is take a CO2 molecule out of the atmosphere, hook it onto a five-carbon sugar, and make these two, three-carbon sugars. Rubisco evolved at a time when there was no oxygen in the atmosphere and it involved a mechanism that's oxygen sensitive. And so it actually, oxygen actually competes with CO2 at the catalytic site of the enzyme. And so what happens under current conditions about every fourth catalytic turnover of this enzyme, it fixes an oxygen rather than a rubisco. This is anti-photosynthesis. And so what it's doing is making one of these three carbons and then it makes this two-carbon molecule glycolate. Not only is glycolate not able to reinsert back into the photosynthetic process, it's also toxic. And so plants had to evolve this very intricate mechanism, involves three organelles, to detoxify it and try to recycle a little bit of that carbon. The energetic costs are enormous. And so here's an example. And so what we've done is we've modeled what the energetic cost is in terms of ATP and NADPH for a soybean canopy. And this is parametrized with data right out of a soybean field that we took for three years. What it shows is that midday, 40% of all the ATP in the plant and 30% of all the NADPH in the plant is to run this essentially fuel cycle. And so people have tried for maybe 30 years to try to redesign rubisco so that it doesn't react with oxygen. It's not been successful. It doesn't mean that it won't be successful in the future, but it hasn't so far. And so inspired by earlier work, we took a different approach. And so our approach was to try to install in the chloroplast a more efficient pathway to metabolize glycolate. So E. coli do it. And E. coli do it in a pretty simple way. They just have these three enzymes, five gene products. And so we thought, let's put that into the chloroplast of the tobacco plant. And we did that. And then we also took two synthetic pathways and put those into chloroplast. And so one of them is shown here. It's based on the glycolate dehydrogenase from climatomonas and this one from glycolate oxidase based on plants. And so we put all of these three different pathways into tobacco. And the other thing we wanted to do was we wanted to force as much of the total glycolate flux through this more efficient pathway and away from the energy-wasting native pathway. And so we wanted to genetically knock out the exporter of glycolate out of the chloroplast so it didn't get into the native pathway. And this just and so because of time I'm just going to talk about one of these pathways and the most successful one which was this pathway here that goes from glycolate to glyoxalate to make malate and pyrolate. And so this is a synthetic pathway. And what this slide shows is that when we put this big construct into tobacco plants in fact these genes that we put in are expressed and so this is the transcript level that they're expressed at and so the climate ammonis glycolate dehydrogenase malate synthase and then we used RNAi to knock down the exporter and you can see in the presence of the RNA module we've knocked down the expression of this exporter about 80 percent. And here are the protein levels by immunoblot and so the proteins are there and the exporter is knocked down. And so when you do this kind of thing in crop plants where these constructs go in the genome is completely random so you have to do it a lot of times. And so typically we do 20 different independent transformations and then we look at these first under glasshouse conditions and so here are five different independent transformation events with what we call alternative photorespiratory path three and you can see visually they're bigger than the wild type or bigger than the null plant. And then also in the greenhouse we do physiological characterizations and so we were able to show that all of these constructs have a higher light use efficiency and all of these constructs have a higher CO2 concentration in the chloroplast which you expect because these alternative pathways evolve the CO2 right in the chloroplast rather than in the mitochondria. But for us the real proof of concept was what happens in the field. And so we've done replicated field studies in 2016 and 2017. In 2016 we did all three constructs in 2017 we focused just down on this AP3. And I just want to direct your attention over here and so this is a picture of this replicated study and if we and in this replicated study we had three independent transformation events if we sum all those three independent transformation events we're seeing about a 45% increase in the vegetative biomass that's generated. and so you know what I hope I've shown you is that there is this big challenge that agriculture has to approach in the next 30 to 50 years. Improving crop yield potential has to play a big part of that and it seems that only improving photosynthesis has the capacity to make big differences in photosynthetic yield potential. I put up a slide that showed there's a range of opportunities I gave you one example of one that we've tried where we have proof of concept. You know at the end of the day we're really not after bigger tobacco plants go figure. What we really want to do is we want to put it into plants that people care about and so we've already put this into potato plants and so we have those plants now in plant lit stage and now in plant lit stage and we're putting it into cowpea and soybean right now and Kinsava is still aspirational but we intend to put it there. And so this is just a picture of this international consortium we're funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation the Food Foundation Agricultural Research and UK Aid and I just wanted to end by pointing out three postdocs in my lab that were involved in the work I presented Berkeley Walker who did the modeling Paul South who did the synthetic biology and then Amanda Kavanaugh with Paul South did the physiological characterization and the field studies so thank you very much. We have time for one question. One? Anybody? Can't tell if people are leaving oh we have one question okay we can okay we'll do two if they're quick go ahead. So when you model you also take into account increased water stress and other environmental stresses that are going to occur in the next decades and how that will factor into crop productivity? And so that's a very good question obviously there are going to be other things increased temperature which certainly affects water availability. And so we're certainly doing those models in terms of the improvement that I put up there in that one slide. No that does not take those into account. Of the other options on your list what's next? Well and so work in my own lab is to change the chlorophyll concentration because one of the reasons that photosynthesis operates at such low efficiency in the field is that a single green leaf absorbs about 90% of the radiation. Photosynthesis saturates at about 20% of full sunlight and so it's wasting 80% of the energy. The paradox is the leaf just below it is light limited and so if we can create better penetration into the canopy and access those leaves that are light limited we'll be able to increase the photosynthetic efficiency of the canopy at the whole and that's what's coupled to yield. Thank you Don. Great talk.
