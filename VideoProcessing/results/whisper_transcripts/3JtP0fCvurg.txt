 In England back in the day, I think it was pre-industrial revolution, they developed this thing called the four crop rotation. So what they would do is in a field, they would plant, or a couple of fields, and each crop grew at a different depth and used a different, different minerals, different part of the soil. And so if you rotated those crops, the soil was always fertile. It maintained fertility, whereas with these mono crops that were pushing worldwide, they haven't used more and more fertilizer because the land can't sustain the crops without it.
