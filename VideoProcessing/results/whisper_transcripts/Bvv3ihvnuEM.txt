Howto & Style
 Hello folks this is Anthony with Honda Snowblower Enthusiasts. I finished this 624 today. Those of you on the Facebook group Honda Snowblower Enthusiasts have been following my progress on refurbishing this machine. Six horsepower, 24 inch wide bucket. It's like a 724 it just has one less horsepower. It's a great double duty machine. It can do small driveways and clean up duty if you have a plow service. And this is basically done now. It's a beautiful condition. Runs like a champ and it's going to be going to some lucky owner soon. So watch for it on Craigslist and Facebook. Thank you very much.
