 What's up y'all? Welcome back to another episode. Today we're talking all about tillage and specifically we're talking about till versus no-till gardening and farming. This is a massive topic and we're going to do a deep dive into it. So let's do this. Okay, so first I want to talk about tillage and I think the biggest pro to tillage and a lot of the reasons people do till is it breaks up the ground. You know, if you've got really hard ground and you're preparing a garden or you're preparing seed to plant, then breaking it up, you know, it really loosens it, makes it easy to plant in, it makes it easy for a new seedling that sprouts to send its roots down and it really oxygenates it. But what happens when you're oxygenating that soil is it really almost triples the microbial life. And what's taking place is those microbes are consuming all the organic matter that's in the soil, the carbon and nitrogen. And without doing a very scientific deep dive into it, essentially there's a very strong correlation between organic matter and the microbial life. And these things are just organic matter and the microbes are just really key to healthy soil and in turn healthy plants. So when you till, you get this massive influx of nutrients for the plantings that you're getting ready to transplant out or direct seed. And so initially it seems like a really, really good idea. The downfall to tillage, however, though, is that you're going to get a ton of weed pressure. And what you're doing is when you're tilling that soil and you're turning it, you are bringing a lot of weed seed that is laying dormant in the soil below the surface, it's laying dormant. So you're bringing it to the surface and then it's getting rained on and then it's going to germinate and sprout and you're going to have a disaster dealing with weeds, especially if you're doing this in your garden. I do think there's a place for an initial till if you're trying to work some organic matter into the ground when you're starting new garden beds or a farm. However, you just be prepared that you're going to have a lot of weed pressure. So that's one of the big cons. And over time, essentially what's going to happen when you do till is you are going to deplete your organic matter immensely. If you continue to till and you continue to really destroy the soil over time as well, if you continue to till the soil, you're going to lose your topsoil to erosion from the wind and the rain and runoff. So I really think in the end that tillage is a very, very poor practice, especially in the long run. You're also, if you're doing this on a large scale and you're using and having to bring in fertilizer, tillage is going to greatly increase your dependence upon synthetic fertilizer. And if you look across the Great Plains, some of the most fertile cropland in the entire world, we have absolutely raped the land. These used to be native prairies that bison roamed. There was immense diversity. The topsoil and the soil health was absolutely incredible. And now it's monoculture crops of corn, soybeans, and wheat, and they're doused with fertilizers, fungicides, herbicides, etc. every single day. So in the end, tillage is very, very terrible. I want to be careful though, because the farmers that farm conventionally and till the ground every year, they're not bad people. They're actually very similar to myself. They love growing food and they want to grow food for people. But in the end, they've never been taught differently and they're stuck in a system that has been in process for years and years and years. But on the other end of the spectrum is no-till. And no-till has grown in popularity over time. And essentially with no-till, what you are doing is you're minimally disturbing the soil. And a lot of people within the no-till system, or a lot of no-till gardeners and farmers use cover cropping. And I've done videos in the past on this. And cover crops, crops are really, really beneficial to increase organic matter to break up the soil, to loosen it. It's also a way of erosion control, also helps increase water infiltration into the soil. So, so many reasons to implement cover crops into your system. But the great thing about no-till is that over time, you're greatly increasing your fertility. And what happens is when you think about the soil, and you look and you think about the soil beneath the surface, essentially you've got a whole new world. And when you do till, think about taking a bulldozer to a home. That's essentially what you're doing to the soil life and the fungal life in the soil, in the ground, is you literally are destroying it in the long run. So with no-till, you're really building that, you're allowing them to really make their home, so to speak. And in the end, they return the favor. So really you're partnering with nature, you're trying to mimic nature. And in nature, you don't see tillage, you don't see the ground constantly being broken down, machinery run over it. And so that's something to always think about, because essentially what you're trying to do is you're trying to not work against nature, you're trying to work with it, you're trying to mimic nature in ways. And obviously we are partnering with nature to produce us food. So with that being said, if you found this content helpful, make sure to hit that subscribe button.
