Science & Technology
 In our goat farms, goat and sheep dung is collected by workers and thrown out. However, in Russia's goat farms, machines have been installed. As soon as the goats defecate, it falls onto a conveyor belt. This belt carries the dung to a collection point, where it is loaded into a trolley and taken to the fields. This dung acts as a natural fertilizer, which is good for the environment.
