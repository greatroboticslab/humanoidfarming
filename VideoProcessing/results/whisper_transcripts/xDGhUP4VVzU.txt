 So we have a good amount of chickens here, lots of hens, and one rooster named Fred. Come back here Fred. Fred, can you say hi? We had two roosters, but one hurt his leg and he was hurting our hens. And this is their chicken hotel. You don't have to have a pretty coop to have a good coop. Picked us up at Costco, it's been working great. Kind of poopy in here, needs to be cleaned out, but we've got an old orchard ladder, some buckets over here, a bunch of hay, we've hung their food, and it works really well. And here's today's harvest. Not one per chicken, but doing pretty good, especially since it's still freezing at night.
