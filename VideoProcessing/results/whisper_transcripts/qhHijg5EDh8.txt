We are thrilled that you are here. We are thrilled that you have joined us for this powerful journey of faith, hope, and transformation. Our mission is clear. Hallelujah. Some of y'all know me as Apostle Alicia Campbell. For others, I'm going to just introduce myself as servant. Amen. Our mission is to preach, teach, and declare the word of God in truth and in clarity. We believe in the transformative power of the gospel. Our vision is clear. We are here to transform generations for Jesus. Reclaiming that which was lost. Where? One soul at a time. Until the earth is filled with his glory. Amen. Heavenly Father, we come to you right now in the mighty name of Jesus. We come to you with grateful hearts ready to dive into your word and explore the depths of what you mean with this fertile ground that we're going to talk about today. Oh, Father, we ask for the Holy Spirit to open our minds and our hearts, helping us to receive the seed of truth you have for us today. May this time together cultivate a deeper understanding of your love and purpose in our lives. So as we gather today, united in the spirit, mighty God, and strengthen our bond as a community, Father, help us to support and uplift one another as we seek to grow in faith and produce good fruit for the kingdom. We surrender our worries and our distractions to you, Lord Jesus, trusting that you will guide us through. And Father God, we thank you for the decisions that you have already made in our lives, God. You are our Father, which art in heaven. Hollywood be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive our debts as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory. We say amen, amen, and amen. Oh, hallelujah. We're going to be talking today. This is backed by popular demand. Amen. We're going to be talking today about what type of soil are you? Amen. What type of soil are you? Many would like, what kind of question is that? It's a good question for us to sit and ponder. Amen. What type of soil are we? Amen. Amen. To God be the glory. God be the glory. Hallelujah. What type of soil are we? We are still in our Love Walk series. We are in part 18 because God loves us so much. Amen. And so we are talking about what type of soil are you? Now, there are four types of soil. There is the footpath soil. There is the rocky ground soil. There is the thorny ground soil. And then there is the good soil. Amen. So those are our four soils. We're not going to talk about all four of them today. I am going to go ahead and set some guidelines for this message today. Amen. I have some things that I need to cover before we actually go into the message. And that's going to be the methods and the misconceptions of what we're talking about. Amen. The methods and the misconceptions. Amen. I just love God. I love what he's doing and how he just bring things about. And so I'm going to go ahead and jump into that. I'm just going to put up this picture here real quick. And if you look at that, you look at that picture. The picture at the top is saying, what type of soil are you? Right. And if you look at the hands, you see the green hand and you see the brown hand. Amen. I just wanted to give you a little description of what we're going to be talking about. Because in this world today, listen closely. We have to pay attention and listen well when engaging in conversation. Whether it's you speaking, I speaking, or someone else is sharing their thoughts. This attentive listening reveals a profound truth. A person can communicate a great deal about their inner landscape. That's what I wanted to show you at the bottom of that picture. It's the inner landscape. Why are we talking about the landscape? Because we're talking about what type of soil are we. And simply through people's words. And their demeanor. Let me take this down. I just wanted y'all to gravitate to this picture. And I might throw it up every now and again. Through their words. Through their demeanor. Each conversation is an opportunity to discern the type of soil a person has cultivated. In their heart. Now. It is crucial to remember. That no matter what. No matter what. We have to be aware. But being aware does not give us the right to judge anyone. Instead. It invites us to listen deeply. To learn about their struggles. They roll my sleeves up. Because we getting ready to go somewhere. Their joy. Their spiritual condition. So we gather information. It opens up the door for us. To extend support. And encouragement. Amen. This gives us the opportunity to listen. To learn. To learn. And offer help. Like this. If they are willing. To receive it. I'm gonna stop right there. Because many times we. As leaders. Or whatever. We. Would try to force somebody into doing something. When. That's not our job. We're not in it. In that type of business. Amen. We're only gonna do what we're called to do. As my apostle always say. And the prophet. Machanda always remind me. We are only here to help. Huh. And somebody type that in the chat. You are only here to help. Amen. We are only here to help. So. If they are willing. And want to receive help. We are here to help. Now. I'm gonna say this. We can assume. I'm gonna sit down. Cause I have a lot to cover today. And I pray. Y'all can see. Amen. Let me bring this forward. Just a little bit. All right. So. We can assume. We all know what assumptions mean. But we can assume. That we. We all know what assumptions mean. But we can assume. That we. That we. We. We. We. We. We. I hear you. Father. Let me say it this way. We can assume. That people are saved. Right. Because they show up in church. Right. We can only assume. That. Everyone goes to church. We can only assume this. And we can assume. That because. They listen to like praise and worship. That they are saved. We can only assume. This. This. We don't have. A guarantee. Right. But we. Really. Have to. Listen. And hear. Then we can. Tackle. The assumptions. Of why. Some people believe. What they believe. Do we understand that. We can only assume. We all know. What assumptions mean. Amen. So. We can only assume. Something. But we can't know. For sure. But we're only here. To help. Right. Okay. So. We have to tackle the ground. First. Before we can plant a seed. Do everybody understand that. Before a farmer plants a seed. He learns about the ground. He. Of where he's going to plant that seed. What he's putting into. The ground. Not only does he learn. About the ground. But he begins to cultivate the ground. He begins to dig up. The ground. And then he begins to plow. The ground. Amen. I just gave you some framework here. And what this actually looks like. Before we plant a seed. We have to know. What type of soil. Are we sowing. That seed into. Now. I already said. We can assume. And then we can't judge. Right. So let's remember that. Only one plants. One waters. But God. Gets the increase. So with that being said. We cannot tell. How many people in the world. Are saved today. That's our assumption. It's up to God. To judge the number. And not us. Oh. I'm gonna say that one more time. I'm gonna say that one more time. We cannot. Say. How many people are saved. In this world today. It's only up to God. To judge the number. And not us. The enemy sits in church as well. And so does his people. So we can still assume. That many are saved. And they probably are. But I want you to think about this. Sometimes the enemy can make something seem like it's right. But that doesn't mean that it is. Amen. I'm just laying some footwork here. Before we go into this. There's a lot of people who do not believe in the Bible. There are a lot of people that don't believe in God's word. Some people believe in God. But others may not believe in God. Then some believe in Jesus. And some may not believe in Jesus. Oh baby. The Holy Spirit. Oh you can forget about it. Some people don't even believe in the Holy Spirit. Amen. So. We have a lot of people. Who love to debate the word. I'm gonna tell you now. Do not. Debate the word. I'm gonna say this one more time. We are only here to help. We do not debate. God's word. How do I know this? Go ahead and get your Bibles. This is the first scripture. And I forgot ladies to give y'all these scriptures. But I want you to go to. Titus 3.9. Titus 3.9. Titus. Want you to be at. Chapter 3. We're gonna be at. Verse 9. Titus. Chapter 3. Verse 9. Amen. I'm gonna read to you from the. New Living Translation. New Living Translation. And here it says. Do not get involved. In foolish discussions. About spiritual. Pedigree. Or in quarrels and fight. About. Obedience to the Jewish law. These things are useless. And. A waste. Of time. What I don't want us to do. Is to waste time. With. People. That want to. Debate the word. We are not here to debate. We are not here to fall. Into. Any. False teachings. That goes for leaders as well. We avoid. Teaching. Lies. The enemy is going to always send people to debate the word. Because they don't believe. What they believe. Believe. Amen. So when you listen to them. You will hear. What you need to hear. It does not give us the right to judge. I'm gonna keep. Interrating this. Back in. But we will not debate the word of God. You got the scripture on it. We will not. Will not. Debate. The word. Of God. There are people who say that the Bible has been written. So many times. We will hear people saying that. You know. The Bible was written by man. Drive safe. I love you. Um. That. The Bible. Um. Was written by man. So they don't believe it. Okay. That's fine. But the Bible itself was inspired by God. To man. To write it. I'm gonna say that one more time. One more time. The Bible was inspired by God. To man. To write it. It is. It is not everything about God in this Bible. If it was about everything about God in this Bible. We will not be able to carry this Bible. Amen. We have a hard time. Reading the basic instructions before leaving earth. Which stands for Bible. Then we have to really understand who the father is. But he had this Bible written to guide us. Through all truth. And through basic principles of his word. How do I know that? Go to 2nd Timothy. Go to 2nd Timothy. I want you to be at 2nd Timothy. I want you to be in the third chapter. I'm going to come from the 16th through the 17th verse. Amen. Here we go. This is all scripture. This is not scripture of Alicia. Amen. So here we go. 2nd Timothy. 3. 16 through 17. It reads all scriptures. Is inspired by God. God. And is useful to teach us. What is true. And to make us realize. What is wrong. In our lives. It corrects us. When we are wrong. And it teaches us. To do what is right. God uses it. To prepare and equip his people. To do. Every. Good. Work. Good. Work. Now let me. Let me go back here. Remember I said. The Bible. Was inspired by God. The Bible is not all about God. We wouldn't be able to carry it. He. God has passed this mindset baby. It passed this brain. This brain can't hold the capacity. The reality. Of what God has. For us. If we were to go deeper. Into knowing about him. Amen. I don't know why my camera is off. I'm not going to worry about that. I pray that you all can still. See me. Amen. Let me do a check here. I mean hear me. Rather. You know. If you can't see me. Okay. There I go. All right. To God be the glory. All righty. So if you look at the scripture. It's saying that all scriptures. Is inspired by God. And is useful to teach us. What is true. And make us realize. What is wrong. In our lives. It corrects us. Amen. When we are wrong. It teaches us to do what is right. That's God. So. There's no easy way to answer these questions. When we're ministering to people. That if they are saved or not. There's no single answer. That works. Every time. Therefore. We must be. We must first ask questions. And discover what that person believes. Before we start defining or defending. The Bible to them. What do they believe? Amen. Amen. And so. I want you to stay in Timothy. And I want you to go to Timothy. Um. Second Timothy. I want you to be at chapter. Four. First Timothy. Chapter four. And I'm going to read all the way down to. Verse eight. Amen. Amen. And here it reads. I solemnly urge you in the presence of God. And Christ Jesus. Who will someday judge the living and the dead. When he appears to set up his kingdom. Preach the word of God. Be prepared. Whether the time is favorable or not. Did y'all hear that? If the time is favorable or not. If the time is favorable or not. If the time is favorable or not. Did y'all hear that? If the time is favorable or not. Patiently correct. Did it say angrily correct? No. It did not. It said patiently correct. Rebuke. And encourage your people with good teaching. For a time is coming when people will no longer listen to sound and host. Wholesome teaching. They will follow their own desires. And we'll look for teachers. Who will tell them. Whatever their itching ears. Want to hear. They will reject the truth. And chase after myth. But you should keep a clear mind in every situation. Don't be afraid of suffering for the Lord. Work at telling others the good news. And fully carry out the ministry God has given you. We all are called to minister. Amen. Whether it's on your job. Do you know your job is a ministry? Do you know when you go in the grocery store and you meet someone that's a chance to minister? When you're in your complex or you're in your community? That's a chance to minister to someone. Amen. Do what God has given you. Verse six. As for me. My life has already been poured out as an offering to God. The time of my death is near. I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. And I have remained faithful. And now the prize awaits me. The crown of righteousness. Which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me on the day of his return. And the prize is not just for me. But for all who eagerly looks forward to his appearing. Are we looking forward to this? So today we're going to dive into some basic principles of soil. I'm still laying the groundwork. I'm not even into the word yet. I'm still laying the groundwork. Amen. Because I have to lay this groundwork so that we can understand where we're going. Right? So Jesus' message was simple. Even when they were in parables, they were still simple. See, Jesus didn't simply tell stories to entertain people. And this is why we can't minister to entertain people. We are not here to entertain. We're not here to do the whole show because we want attention. No, no, no, no. Jesus told parable because he wanted the change. He wanted people to change their lives. Parables tells a story using something we see every day to help us understand a spiritual truth that we can't see with our own eyes. Oh, I'm going to say that again. Parables are stories using something we see every day to help us understand a spiritual truth that we can't see with our eyes. So when Jesus taught in parables, he used things that people of his day were familiar with. Right? Jesus, if Jesus were to be here to teach us parables today, it would look different than the culture of what he was in. So the parable would look different. So as we explore the parables of the sower, this is the soil, but the sower, we will reflect on the different types of soil that represents various responses to God's word. Each soil tells a story about spiritual receptivity. Receptivity. Ah, can't talk today. Receptive, which means openness and willingness. It helps with growth and the potential for transformation. So, let me go ahead, because we're going to be talking about the first soil. This is all we're talking about today, the first soil. It's the footpath or the wayside soil. God, you are amazing. I hear you. The seed here that we're going to be talking about is the birds that come and snatch things away. But we're going to, that's just symbolic. And those that hear the word don't understand or retain it. So, let's go on this, this, this guideline here. I'm going to talk about receptivity here for our heart condition, right? The first thing I want to talk about is the heart condition. Soil symbolize the condition of a person's heart and their receptivity to God's word. Just as different types of soil affects plants when growth, when needed for growth. It states our heart influences on how we respond to spiritual teaching. I'm going to say this one more time. Just as different types of soil affects plants, affects the plants growth. Do we also know that every soil do not work for every plant? Amen. So the state of our heart influences how we respond to spiritual teaching. Spiritual growth, the type of soil reflects our ability to grow spiritually. Good soil allows seeds to take root and flourish. While poor soil leads to stunted growth. So, I'm not going to use the word failure. I'll use the word stagnant. So, this underscores the importance of nurturing our faith through prayer, study, and community. Receptivity to God, soil represents that openness to receiving and understanding God's word. So, this is the word a word. So, this is the word a word. So, this is the word a word. So, this is the word a word. So, this is the word a word. We need to cultivate an environment in our hearts that is receptive to spiritual truth. Obstacles of faith. There are different types of soil that illustrates various obstacles that can hinder our faith. For example, the rocky ground. Many represent a lack of depth. While the thorny soil, it signifies distractions from worldly concerns. We're not getting into those yet, but we're going to come back to them. So, recognizing these obstacles can help us address some of the proactivity that we have with God. There is a potential for transformation. Soil holds the potential for transformation. So, when we cultivate good soil characterized by humility, willingness to learn, and openness to grow, we position ourselves to bear fruit and to positively impact others. See, this is our responsibility. The condition of the soil that carries responsibility, we are called to examine, to tend to our hearts, ensuring that we are not allowing hardness of heart. That we are not allowing distractions to be set up. Or superficial realities to take root in our lives. So, this self-examination allows us to grow in our faith and reflect God's love in our lives. So, the whole summary of that is, soil serves as a powerful metaphor for our spiritual journey. It challenges us to consider how we are nurturing our hearts and responding to the divine truth being sown in our lives. By understanding the significance of soil. Because remember, I said the farmer, before he plants the seed, he has to look at the ground. He has to cultivate that thing to make sure that the seed will stick. And that the seed will prosper in the soil that it's in. So, we can better align ourselves with God's purpose and cultivate a fruitful spiritual life. So, I'm still not into the message. I'm still not into the message. I'm still not into the message. I'm setting the ground still. So, now, we're going to go over some common misconceptions. Right? Y'all know I have my work here cut out for me. We're going to go over some common misconceptions. So, that we'll have some understanding. The first one I want to talk about is the quality in people. Okay? Understanding this type of soil quality of individual is essential to their spiritual reticivity and readiness to grow. Now, this can be a little complex. But here's what we're going to talk about. All right. Observing behavior. Here's the method behind this. Observing how individuals act in a various situation can provide insight into their spiritual condition. For example, consistent kindness, patience, humility. All of that may represent good soil. But here's the misconception of this. Assuming that outward behavior always reflect inner spiritual health. That's a misconception. People can appear kind. People can appear kind. But may be struggling internally with doubts or fear. Again, that does not give us the right to judge. We're only here to help. Okay? But that's a misconception. Assuming that outer behavior always reflect inner spiritual health. It does not. But that's a misconception. Assuming that outer behavior always reflects inner spiritual health. All right. All right. All right. Number two. Listening to conversations. All right. All right. Number two. Listening to conversations. Here's the method. Engaging in conversation can reveal a good thing. A person's mindset and openness to spiritual matters. Listening to how they discuss challenges, beliefs, and values offer clues to their heart. To their heart condition. But here's the misconception. Believing that a person's knowledge of scripture or theology directly correlates to spiritual maturity. It does not. Amen. Some may be well-versed in religious teaching. But lack genuine faith or application. Still laying these ground rules. Assessing reactions to adversity. Here's the method. Observing how individuals respond to challenges can indicate their depth of faith. Those with good self-fulfill may demonstrate resilience and trust in God during tough times. Okay. Well, here's the misconception. Judging someone's faith based solely on their reaction to adversity. Some people struggle deeply. Some people struggle deeply with their faith in difficult times. Reflecting a complex spiritual journey rather than the lack of faith. Did y'all hear that? The misconception of judging someone's faith based solely on their reaction to adversity. We gotta stop. Some may struggle deeply with their faith in difficult times. Everybody is not where we are. Everybody is not where we are. So, they're reflecting that complex spiritual journey rather than their lack of faith. Look at the spiritual journey. Some people still have faith even if they're struggling. Yeah. So, we gotta stop the misconception. Number four. Seeking spiritual fruit. Here's the method. Longing for signs of spiritual fruit such as love, joy, peace, meekness, temperance, goodness, faith, and service can help assess soil quality. Good soil tends to produce a rich harvest of positive attributes. So true. But here's the misconception. Assuming that spiritual fruit must be abundant and consistent at all times. Everyone experiences or experience seasons of growth and dormancy. It fluctuates. It's just a part of the nature of faith journey. Encouraging self-reflection. Encouraging self-reflection. Let's get to that one. Encouraging individuals to engage in self-reflection and prayer can help them assess their own soil quality. Personal introspection allows people to evaluate their readiness to receive and act on God's word. Now, here's the misconception. Believing that self-reflection alone is significant for growth without the need for community support or accountability. Baby, we all need accountability. We all need support. We are not on an island by ourselves. Amen. We all need support. Spiritual growth often requires relationship that fosters encouragement and challenges. Amen. So now, I'm just going to give you all misconceptions. Number one. One size fit all approach. The devil is a liar. Because if that was the case, we would be measuring up against other people and then we would be feeling like we are not worthy, that God don't love us, that God don't care about us. All of that. One size does not fit all. That's a misconception. Assuming that everyone responds to God's word in the same way or needs the same approach for spiritual growth. Every person's journey is unique. And their soil may require different nurturing methods. Oh, I'm going to say that one more time. Because this is one of the biggest misconceptions that people put out here. It is not a one size fit all. It never has been. But, everyone responds to God's word in, let me take that back. Not everyone responds the same way to God's word. Not all the time. Everybody's journey is different. Everybody's journey is unique. Their soil may require different nurturing methods than the one that we have now. Amen. The next misconception. Instant transformation. Boy, if that ain't a misconception, that's an understanding. Let me just stay on course. Because I can go into that and I will mess somebody up. Let me just stay on course right here. Because, woo, baby. Expect an immediate change or growth in others once they hear the gospel. That is a misconception. Just as soil takes the nature of growing, spiritual growth is a process. When a farmer plants seeds into the ground, he can plant watermelons. He can plant oranges. He can plant just regular plants. He can plant whatever. Right? All of them don't grow at the same time. They don't have the same processing time. It unfolds over time. Which means they grow over time. We think that a babe in Christ should be eaten on meat. No, a babe in Christ is still on milk. Now, they should not stay on milk forever. But they're on milk at this time. And spiritual growth is a process that unfolds over time. So we have to stop the misconception that everybody is supposed to transform at the same time. Here's the next one. Ignoring external influence. Here's the misconception here. Underestimating the impact of external factors such as life experience, trauma, or culture background on one spiritual condition. These influences can significantly shape how someone interacts with faith. Boy, it's a whole lot of misconceptions, I see. All right. Here's our next one. Neglecting personal responsibility. Here's the misconception. Believing that spiritual growth is solely the responsibility of the church or the spiritual leaders. That's a lie from the pit. Each individual has a role in tending to their own soil and nurturing their relationship with God. We are only here to help. So many have that misconception that their spiritual growth is solely the responsibility of the church or spiritual leaders. Get that out your head. Because that is a misconception. Uh-uh. Stop it. Each and every person has their own responsibility in tending to their own soil, nurturing their own relationship with God. You got to get in there and do some work. Get in there and do some work. Amen. Here's the last one before we go into the word. Judging worthlessness. Here's this misconception. Assuming that some people are beyond help or unworthy of spiritual growth based on their past actions or current struggles. Everyone has the potential for redemption and transformation regardless of their history. So we get to the point where we want to judge people and their worthiness. Stop it. I say. Because everyone can be helped. They want the help. We have to stop making people feel like they're unworthy in their spiritual journey based on their past or even their current struggle right now. Everybody is struggling with something. I may not see yours. You may not see mine. Does not mean that it's not there. Everybody has one. But God will do that. Who will help people along the way? Because everyone, and I mean everyone, has the potential for redemption and transformation regardless of their history. We got to stop the misconception. Everybody's soil is not going to look the same. Amen. Amen. So, I want you to go ahead and get your Bibles. I want you to go ahead and get your Bibles. Let's jump into this. I want you to get your Bibles over to Matthew. And I want you to go to Matthew 13. I want you to get to Matthew chapter 13. I'm just going to go over some breakdowns. I want you to be at Matthew. Chapter 13. I want you to go down to the 18th. And we're going to read from the 18th to the 23rd verse. But I'm going to do a breakdown with this reading and teaching here. Amen. It reads. Everybody got it? Matthew 18. Matthew 13. I mean, Matthew 13. Down in verse 18. It says, now, listen to the explanation of the parable about the farmer planting seeds. The seeds that fell on the footpath. This is the first one that we're talking about, the footpath. The seed that fell on the footpath represents those who hear the message about the kingdom and don't understand it. The verse calls us to pay attention. The message being shared. Just as the source spreads seeds, God is sowing his word into our heart. Are we ready to receive it? Are we ready to receive it? Hmm. Well, let's find out. Then the evil one comes and snatches away the seed that was planted in their hearts. The seed on the rocky soil represents those who hear the message and immediately receives it with joy. But since they don't have deep roots, I just got to do this here real quick. I got to bring this back up. I got to bring this back up really, really quick here. And I want you to look at that picture and I want you to look at the root. I'm going to keep that picture up because I want this to be a reminder of what we're talking about here. Right. OK, so I'm going to keep that up just for a moment. I'll come take it down. Let me let me finish with what my scriptures here. All right. But since they don't have deep roots. They don't last long. They fall away as soon as they have problems. Or are persecuted for believing God's word. Verse 22. The seed that fell among the thorns represent those who hear God's word. But all too quickly, the message is crowded out by ways of life. And the lure of wealth. So no fruit is produced. All right. Here's our last one here. The seed that falls on good soil represents those who truly hear and understand God's word and produce a harvest of 30, 60, or even 100 times as much as had been planted. Amen. So I wanted to just throw that picture up there because I wanted you to see the roots in the ground on the picture. I wanted you to see the soil. I wanted you to see the hand of the soil and the green hand representing the plant. I just wanted you to look at that. Now I'm going to take that down because I want to go back and I want to break this down real quick here. So verse 18 was letting us know that here during the parable of the sower. So that example is that that verse calls us to pay attention to the message being shared. Just as the serpent spread seeds, God is sowing his word into our hearts. Right? Verse 19 gave us, when anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, that even one comes and snatches it away. It snatches what has been sown in their heart. So this footpath represents that those who hear the gospel but do not understand it, leaving them vulnerable to distractions and doubt. Consider someone who hears a sermon, right? And then they quickly forget what they just heard because something else came up and snuffed out what they just heard. I just heard a powerful word, right? Because most people can tell you what the quiet song and who ran across the church and all that stuff. But when you ask them, what was the word? The word gets snuffed out. And as for those who sow on the rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, but the roots are not deep enough to hold on to it. They're excited, but it lacks depth. So when challenges arise, they kind of falter. Someone may be in through, just be in, I'm just overloaded with enthusiasm. They start attending church. They're excited about the word. They're loving everything around them. And then all of a sudden they stop. Why? Because they begin to face trials and tribulations. They take it personal. And they leave church. They leave the church. Because it comes to nothing out of them. That's what the enemy does. That's his job. That joke will be on your job. Do y'all hear me? But we also got to be on our job. We got to counteract everything that the enemy tries to say. We cannot just lay down and let him say what he want to say and then just roll over and say it's done. No, no, no. Because now we have diminished the power of God. And we act like God don't exist or God can't help or God don't bring us out. That's a lie from the pit. Verse 21 is saying yet he has no roots in himself. He endures for a lot. But when those tribulations, those persecutions arises, they fall away. They fall away. That's why it's important for community. That's why it's important to stay connected. Amen. Because the enemy will study, try to bring things up in your mind. Bring your mind under subjection unto the Lord. We know that the mind is the enemy's playground. And some of us let him come in and have a ball on the playground. Some of us got to be spiritual bullies and tell them you ain't welcome on this playground over him. You're not welcome on the playground of my mind. You will not lie to me not another day. And nor will I listen to what you have to say. So that's going to require some strong roots to get up and not just deal with whatever the enemy said. Even when the doctor gives a report, you cannot always believe the doctor's report. You have to believe the word of the Lord. You have to believe that you can be delivered. You have to believe that you can be saved. You have to believe that God got your back. He got your side. He got your front. He got you from head to toe. God is with us. But we continue to let the enemy prey on our mind. What type of soil are you? What type of soil? What type of soil? What type of soil? Whistom? Toss. What type of soil? What type of soil? Hi. What type of soil? What type of soil? That limbs four? What type of soil? 친절ical snails,v man live in a tree. What type of soil? What type of soil? Just like fish. What type of soil? And basic needs those thisолomnium. What type of soil? What type of soil? it proves to be unfruitful. The soul I'm using is very symbolic. Believers who are entangled in worldly concerns all the time but never in the world, there's a problem. Imagine a person who prioritized their job, success, and all of this other stuff of the world over their spiritual growth and leads to buryingness. And then verse 23, as for what we sow on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundredfold, another 60, and another 30. Those who cultivate their soil, cultivating your life, cultivating the ground. See, some of you got to have seeds plucked out of you of things that were so into you that didn't belong to you and you held on to it. Discouragement, you'll never be nobody. You're just like your mama. You're just like your daddy. You ain't worth two cents. You get on my nerves. You can't do this. You can't. All those were seeds that were sown on the ground. And when you see these negative influences coming up, you see these negative things that the enemy is trying to speak into you, you have to understand what ground am I standing on? Because if I'm standing on good soil, if I'm standing on good ground, oh, I know that challenges may come. I know weapons may be formed. Oh, I know all this, but it will not prosper. It shall not prosper. I produce abundance of fruit. And I'm impacting others positively. That's how you have to speak. That's how you have to speak. If you're speaking anything other than that, it'll bring you down. It'll be your demise. So you have to carry the words of the Lord in your heart. Thy words have I hid in my heart. It's in my heart that I might not sin against thee, O God. It's the words in my heart. Isaiah 6. Isaiah 6. I want you to be at 9 and 10. Isaiah 6, 9 and 10. Father, we thank you. Isaiah 6, 9 and 10. And it says, and he said, yes, go and say to this people, listen carefully, but do not understand. Watch closely, but learn nothing. Harden the hearts of these people. Plug their ears and shut their eyes. that way they will not see with their eyes nor hear with their ears nor understand what their hearts and turn to me for healing. God told Isaiah that the people will listen but not learn from the message because their hearts became hardened beyond repentance. God's patient. He's very patient with chaotic rebellion. We thank him for that because some of us have been a rebellious people, right? But he's patient. He's very patient. But he said, go tell the people. Go tell them what I said. They keep on hearing but they do not understand. They keep on seeing but they won't perceive. Make the hearts of these people dull and their ears heavy and their eyes blind. This warns us of the danger of becoming spiritually numb. We must strive to be receptive rather than indifferent. I don't want to be spiritual numb. Some people can handle that but that won't be this chick over here. Amen? Go to Luke 9. Do I want you to look? No, I want you to go to Luke 8. I know that's right, Jackie. I know that's right. Go to Luke 8, chapter 8. And I want you to be at the 9th verse. We're going to go to the 18th verse. And it reads, his disciples asked him what this parable meant. He replied, you are permitted to understand the secrets of the kingdom of God. But I use parables to teach the others so that the scriptures might be fulfilled. when they look, they won't really see. When they hear, they won't understand. This is the meaning of the parable. The seed is God's word. The seed that fell on the footpath represents those who hear the message from their hearts and prevent them from believing and being saved. The seeds on the rocky soil represents those who hear the message and receive it with joy. But since they don't have deep rips, they believe for a while. Then they fall away when they face temptation. Y'all see how we went from Matthew to Luke. You see the same things being said here. The seeds that fell among the thorns represent those who hear the message, but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the cares and riches and pleasures of this life. And so they never grow into maturity and the seeds that fell on good soil represents honest, good-hearted people who hear God's word, cling to it, and patiently produces a huge harvest. No one lights a lamp and then cover it with a bowl or hides it under a bed. A lamp is placed on a stand where the light can be seen by all who enters the house. For all that is secret will eventually be brought to the open. That means we can't get away with nothing. What you do in the dark shall come to the light. Trust and believe. Amen. Trust and believe. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Everything is concealed. Everything that is concealed. Everything again that is concealed. Amen. Will be brought to the light and made known to all. So pay attention to how you hear to those who listen. See, those are two different things. Listening and hearing. Amen. Two different things. If they pay attention to how you hear, to those who listen to my teaching, more understanding will be given. But for those who are not listening, even what they think they understand will be taken away from them. them. Why didn't the crowd understand Jesus? I just want to ask that question. Why didn't the crowd understand Jesus? Hmm? Maybe they were looking for a military leader or a political messiah. Hmm? or could not relate to his gentle teaching style because of their preconceived ideas. Yeah, a lot of people have a lot of preconceived ideas and preconceived notions. So sometimes when you have those preconceived ideas and notions, you won't understand something. Or perhaps they were afraid of pressure from the religious leaders and did not want to look too deeply into Jesus' word. Okay, we have people right now today, they might feel pressured if they change their lifestyle. They might feel like their friends won't like them anymore or family members will talk about them. I'd rather change my lifestyle for Jesus and have people that talk about me because I don't give a flip. I care about him. I care about God. I care about Jesus God for my wretched soul. I care about the Holy Spirit living in me versus people. You got to choose. Do you believe God or do you believe people? You want to serve God or do you want to serve people? Do you want to let the Lord use you in a dynamic way in anything that you do? Or do you want to have people to try to just use you and then talk about you? I mean, come on, let's lift the tables over here for a moment and just think about those type of things. We don't take no thought into that. I'm taking thought into my seeds that fell on the footpath. And you got to go back and evaluate some things. The seeds that fall on the footpath represents those who hear the message only to have the devil come and take it away. He's a thief. That's what he do. He's a thief. He steals it from their heart and prevents them from believing and being saved. We want to have our own thoughts. That's so cute. It don't work for God. But it's cute. Stop letting the enemy snuff out the word. You're either going to believe God or you're not. You're either going to be saved or you're not. The seeds that fell on the footpath represents those who hear that message. Now let me say this. God is the sower. the word of God is the seed. Guess who the ground is? God is the sower. The word of God is the seed and we are the ground. How are you going to till your soil? How are you going to let your ground be cultivated? How protective will you be about your ground or would you let your ground just look any kind of way and the enemy just come and snuff and take any and everything from you? The devil is a liar. We bind you up right now in the name of Jesus. Everything that you thought you saved. Baby, you didn't have nothing. You don't have my spirit. You don't have my soul. You did not create me. So you cannot kill me. God can give you permission to try to test me. But I learned how to study for the test. How did I study for the test? I got in the word of God. And I put it in my heart so that I might not sin against him. Oh, you can try to pluck the word out, but I'm stronger than you, devil. You're weakling to me. You try all amount of evil, but it will not stand against the word of God. See, your time is short. And because his time is short, he going to wreak havoc all around the world. And it is our choice. It's a choice. It's a choice. I ain't telling you to do it. It's a choice. How do you want to tilt your ground? How do you want to cultivate it? What do you want it to look like? Let me move on from here. I done got mad at the enemy. Little joker. Go to 1 Corinthians. Go to 1 Corinthians. I wanted you to be at 1 Corinthians chapter 1. 1 Corinthians chapter 1. 1 Corinthians chapter 1. I want you to be at 1 Corinthians chapter 1. I want you to down at the 21st verse. Listen to what it says. since God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never know him through human wisdom. He has used our foolish teaching to save those who believe. Paul is emphasizing something here to us. He's emphasizing that human wisdom often leads us away from God. We want to be, we want to strong arm God with our own thoughts. We want to stronghold God with our human mindset, thinking that our wisdom is better than God's wisdom. Our wisdom would never be better than God's wisdom. I don't care how much wisdom, hey Ted, I don't care how much wisdom you think that you have. Our wisdom would never, ever be as wise as God's wisdom. I don't care about your schooling. I don't care about your degrees. I don't care about all your theological, whatever. Your wisdom will never be better than God. He said, I use your foolish preaching to save those who believe. He emphasizes that human wisdom will lead us away from God, and it is vital to approach his word with humility and openness, allowing our faith to grow from what seems foolish to the world. And many of us will stop ministering in a way when we feel that people are not receiving us. Do what God has called you to do, because those that are called to you will hear the word, and they will follow. No. Because something in their spirit will say, wait now. Hold on now. Now I've been feeling this thing, but I didn't know how to correlate it. I didn't know how to put it together. I didn't actually know what God's saying, but somebody is speaking to me now. They're speaking to my spirit, and I'm going to follow this. They're not actually following us. They're following the spirit of the Lord that is in us, and they're listening to the words that are coming out of our mouth from God. Some people hear the truth, but like hardened path, they do not let it sink into their heart. They just don't. Zechariah 7, 12. I ain't going to go to it. You can read it. They made their hearts as hard as stone. So they could not hear the instructions of the message. When somebody comes and hear the message, and they're already angry, they're, you know, and sometimes this right here, and I have to watch when I'm doing this, if somebody's correcting me on something, because do you know folding your arms sometimes block what leads to get into your heart? It's almost a form of rebellion. You know when we used to get angry as kids, we'd fold our arms and be like, hmm, okay, whatever. Think about that in that aspect when we do that. Open your heart. Open your mind. Don't let your heart be on stony ground. We ain't even got to that ground yet. We're still on the footpath. But heaven's army has sent them by the spirit through the early prophets. Nobody want to hear what prophets really got, the true prophets. Everybody want to hear what the false prophets have to say, because the false prophet is going to have, you're going to have itching ears, and they're going to know how to soothe your ears. That's just like friends that don't hold you accountable. For your foolishness. They just love everything you do, because you're my friend. Not on my watch. Ah, we're afraid. Oh, baby, no. Uh-uh, uh-uh. That ain't right. Oh, ooh, honey sugar. No, we're not doing that. No, no, no. No, no, no. That's not right. And that's not judging them. That's saying, hey, listen, you're going on the wrong path. You're going in the wrong direction. So we must remain soft and palatable, ready to shape, be shaped by the word. Your heart needs to be soft and palatable, ready to be shaped by the word. I'm going to do that one more time for the Holy Spirit. Your heart must be soft and palatable, ready to be shaped by the word. This is why the Lord's heavenly armies were so angry with them. Satan came to take away the truth. If the people do not receive and respond to the word with faith, the opportunity will be stolen by the enemy. He said the heavenly army was angry with them. You cannot allow Satan to keep treading on territory, snuffing out the word that God has already placed in your heart. You have to be open to receive the word. Be responsive to the word. Oh my God. But believe in the word. Have faith in the word. The faith of a grain, of a mustard seed. I'm going to have my mustard seeds over here in my hand so people can see how small a mustard seed is. That's all the faith that he's asking us for. But then he said, oh ye of little faith. Woo. Can you not believe? Can you not receive? Come on now. Listen. It does us no good to know the power of the word, receive the word, hear the word, but then we let the word keep getting choked out. Come on. Listen to what God is saying. You know the power of my word. You know the powers that you speak. See, we always want to speak doom and gloom. But we ought to speak the word of God over every situation in our lives and everything that the enemy tries to bring up before us speaks and put the word on it. When we was in the world, everybody was getting alcohol. Everybody was talking about I got five on it. But how about we just put the word on it? Amen. This is the reason why this happens is the enemy knows his time is short. He knows when life hits, we can't deal because we begin to speak it. When the cares of life hit, busyness hit, problems hit, struggles hit, stress hit, life is overridden. It overrides the word of God. That should be vice versa. When life hits, when problems hit, when struggles hit, the word of God should be coming forth like a mighty force, like somebody getting ready to punch somebody dead in the face. They cock it all the way back and put all their weight into it on the back of their feet to come forth. That's how the word should be. Make the word come forth. Overthrow the lies of the enemy. God's promises are yes and amen. God is not a liar. We're not going to keep making God seem like he's a liar. And we're not going to keep making the enemy seem like he's more powerful than God. Nope, that stops. And we can't keep letting life supersede the power of the word. It's easy to become that type of ground. It's easy to become that type of soil. It's even harder than we realize. We become stubborn. We get the mindset that God hates us. That he's not thinking about us. But God is always punishing us. Everybody else is prospering. And I seem like I'm going through this dry season every time I turn around. Stop thinking like that. That's the enemy speaking into your ear. He sends out a whispering spirit to speak into your ear to tell you you are worthless. Baby, you better know scripture and tell them, I don't know who you talking to. You must be talking to one of your kids because you surely ain't talking to me. Put the word back on. The scripture that comes to mind that we need to hold on to, maybe you are stressed in life. Maybe you are going through something. Maybe your circumstances are looking overwhelming at this point. But Philippians 4, 6 and 7 says, Be not anxious for anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving. See, we forget that part. Oh, let me stop right there. Let me stop right there. We forget that part. Thanksgiving. We have to be thankful for everything that God has already done. And then we have to be thankful for what God is going to continue to do. We get anxious. And he said, Don't be anxious. We get weary in well-doing, but don't do that either. Come on. It's by prayer and petition with thanksgiving. Be thankful in all things. With thanksgiving present, your request to God, present it to God, present it to him. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your heart and your mind in Christ Jesus. Isaiah 41, 10. That was talking about don't fear. For I am with you. Don't be dismayed. For I am your God. Listen to what he's saying to us. I don't need y'all to fear. I'm always here. Don't be dismayed. I'm your God. I will strengthen you. I will help you. I will hold you up with my righteous right hand. Do you believe the word? Do you believe the word? Come to me all who are weary and heavy burdened. He said, And I'll give you rest. Take my yoke upon you. And long for me. For I am gentle and humble in heart. And you will find rest for your soul. For my yoke, he said, is easy. And my burdens are light. How about give them your burdens? I'm sorry. I can give y'all a scripture. Matthew 11, 28 to 30. Amen. Oh, sorry about that. Forgive your burdens over to God. I'm reminded of 2 Corinthians 4, 17 to 18. For our light and monetary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory. That far outweighed them all. So fix your eyes. Not on what you see. But what is unseen. Because everything we see is temporary. Everything that you don't see is eternal. I'm going to say that again. Everything that you see is temporary. But what is unseen is eternal. God is our refuge and our strength. He's the present help in the time of trouble. You're in trouble. Go to God. God. Y'all all know the scripture here, Romans 28. And we know that what? All things. One thing. All things. Two things. All things. All things. Good. All things. All things. All things. God's work for the good of those who love him. Who have been called according to his purpose. Are you in the purpose? Do you live on purpose? Even 1 Peter says, cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you. 1 Peter 5, 7. John 16 and 3. I have told you these things so that in me you may have what? Peace. Peace that surpasses all understanding. Thank you, Father, for your peace that surpasses all understanding. Thank you for your peace when trouble is falling on the left and the right. Thank you for your peace when the job is cutting up. Thank you for your peace when chaos is going on. Thank you for your peace. You see how that works? Because in this world you're going to have troubles. But take heart. I have overcome the world. Do we not believe that Jesus came and overcame the world? He overcame the world. So if he overcame the world, he overcame our problems. He overcame the situation. We should be in peace. We should be in much peace. There is no way in the world we should be in turmoil. Not at all. Not at all. Trust in the Lord with all your heart. Lean not to your own understanding. In all your ways submit to him. And he will direct your path. He will make your path straight. We're talking about the footpath. He will make your path straight. You got to be strong in the Lord. And in the power of his might. But in order to be strong in the Lord, you got to get dressed. You got to get dressed. What do you mean? Put on your full armor of God. So that you can stand against the devil's skin. Put on your full armor. Get dressed in the morning just like you get dressed. Get dressed in the morning. I know uncertainty and stress. It's, you know, I know it's happening all around the world. People are going through many different situations. And there are some people I talk. I love when I hear excited Christians while they're going through. They're not all gloom and doom. And oh, well. Some of us been going through in these stomachs of ours. Good God, Almighty Jesus. But we still pressing. We still showing up. We still doing what God is asking us to do. So we must take care of our spiritual ground. We must stay vigilant. We must support one another. Especially navigating this life. Remember, you're not in this alone. God is always with us. And you have brothers and sisters that are with you as well. That help strengthen you along the way. To provide that strength and that peace. Admit all the turmoil. Stay on post. Keep your faith alive. When we take care of our ground, especially in these stressful times, I know we live in a world that is going through so much foolery, grief, violence. I can name all of it. But I won't. When we look at this world, sometimes we're like, dang, this thing is messed up. But there's going to always be hope. But the only hope is found in God's word. I'm just going to give y'all some quick scriptures here. You ain't got to go to it. No, wrong page. Matthew 13, 23. Please write these down. Because I'm not going to read them. But I just want you to write them down so you can go to them. We just went through that. About the seed falling on the soil. Luke 8, 15. We just talked about that one as well. I'm just reminding you of these scriptures. Please go back to them. Jeremiah 4, 3. This is what the Lord said to the people of Judah and Jerusalem. Break up. Break up your unplowed ground and do not sow among thorns. It's time to break up the fallow ground, y'all. Break it up. Break it up. Break it up. Isaiah 61 and 3. Isaiah 10 and 11. I love that one. So righteousness for yourself. Reap the fruit of the unfailing love and break up your unplowed ground. See how the scripture reminds us? Because most people say the Bible repeats itself. No, there's different scriptures in the Bible. Because we kind of get off track sometimes and something else will come up in the Bible. And you'll be like, dang, I just read that. Wait a minute. Where did I just read that at? And it'll take you back. It'll take you back. That helps your mind stay focused. Amen. So I want to, I just want to say, whoo! God is amazing. That was just, that was just one of them. That was just one of them. It's four of them. But that was just the first one. That was just the first one. And I'm just so glad that you all were able to come in and join us on this message today. I believe it was a powerful message. I thank you for exploring this powerful theme with us. What type of soil are you? I thank God for the teaching that he used me to come through to his people. And I pray that you all have been inspired, that you've been encouraged by the word of God. Remember, I'm going to tell you that part later. Let me, let me do this. Heavenly Father, as we conclude our time today, we're never out of your presence.

If you have not accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, the decision can be made today. It's a beautiful step towards experiencing God's love, His grace, His transformation, to be in that relationship with Him. I love being in a relationship with God because it involves acknowledging that I need Him as a Savior, confessing my sins, inviting Jesus into my heart, and then letting Him guide the forces of my life. And you can do that as well with a simple prayer. Dear Jesus, I ask that I come before you with an open heart, acknowledging that I am a sinner, in need of your forgiveness and your grace. I believe that you died on the cross for my sins and rose again with all power in your hands, granting me eternal life. And I confess my sins and ask for your forgiveness. I surrender my life to you, Jesus, and invite you into my heart. I invite you in, Lord, to lead my life. Please come into my heart, fill it with your love and your peace, and then guide me all the way through. thank you for your unconditional love and the gift of salvation. I commit the following to you, and I want to live a life that honors you in the precious name of Jesus. Amen. And if you have said that prayer, you know, I say this prayer all the time. Amen. Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot to take that down. Why y'all didn't remind me? Anyway, God is phenomenal. God is phenomenal. I am going to do this before I actually close out here. I want you all to remember something. I want you to remember that you are here on purpose for purpose with purpose to complete God's purpose. I'm going to say this again. Put this in your heart. You are here on purpose. Don't let the devil tell you you don't have no purpose because you have purpose because you're here on purpose. You are here for purpose with purpose to complete God's purpose and I need us to live on purpose. That purpose have a perfect work. And as you go on through the week, take time to reflect on the condition of our heart and how we can cultivate the fertile ground from the word of God. just the fertile ground of our lives in general. James 1 4 says let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking what? Anything. So I want to say tune in next week for part two of this transformative service. we look forward to you coming again and continue to deepening your understanding and your commitment to being good soil in the kingdom of God. Amen. I want to do this here as well. What the Lord had lead me. I said, God, you are amazing. I have finally, it's blurred, y'all won't see it, but it's in my hand. It's my new edition.
