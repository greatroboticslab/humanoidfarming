 Good morning everybody. My name is Jessica Kelton. I'm an REA with the Farm and Ag Viz management team and I was going to talk about the economics of moisture sensor, using moisture sensors for irrigation, but I kind of wanted to back out and do just a little bit about irrigation scheduling in general and then focus just a little more on the moisture sensors. So I was looking at some numbers last night. I was looking at the Census of Ag and you can kind of see how our irrigation acres have changed over the past few years. There was a big bump from 97 to 02 and then from 02 to now we really haven't seen a huge increase in the number of acres and looking at some of the numbers out of Georgia and Florida, they've got a lot of irrigation acres and they started back in 97 with way more than we had, but our number of farms have kind of gone down, but the number of irrigated acres and I kind of stayed the same. But the one thing I kind of want to point out is these are numbers for the survey from 2012, but there is a 2013 Farm and Ranch Irrigation Survey that USDA put out. If you look at those numbers for what was expected to be done in 2013, farmers were reporting an expansion of, for new irrigated acres, almost 18,000 acres and they were looking to invest over 11 million dollars to put those acres into irrigation. So I think when we have the new Census of Ag come out, we might see a huge bump in the number of acres that we have under irrigation for Alabama. So that's just really one of those things to keep in mind. We do have a huge increase in people who are interested in and using irrigation in the past few years. So my question is, how are these acres going to be irrigated? How are we going to manage them and does it really even matter? So we know that we can look at a lot of our budgets and it's pretty common knowledge if you have irrigation under a typical year that irrigation acres are going to have an increased yield. But are we spending too much to get that yield? Are we spending too little or putting it out at the right time? Is there a better way to manage it? Unfortunately NASS doesn't really track irrigated scheduling methods. So a lot of the idea we have of how our growers irrigating those come from a lot of surveys. I know there was one back in March. Anis Buscemi, I think is in the speaker later, he did something so just to get an idea of what farmers are using as a gauge for when they need to irrigate. And a lot of our farmers are using visible plant stress as an indicator for irrigation. So how is that affecting our yield? Are we getting our full yield off of that? Are we spending more to get that? Are we spending too little? And a lot of the other surveys coming out of other states are showing the same thing. You know, plant stress is one of those things that go to for farmers to determine when they're irrigating. Some are using checkbook methods, some are using software, you know, consultants. Very few are using anything like a moisture sensor to determine if they're going to irrigate. But one of the problems we have is because we are, we don't have as many acres in irrigation, that we don't have a lot of research that's kind of geared towards looking at our economics behind how we schedule our irrigation. But some, in recent years Georgia has done some of this research. Wes and Adam out of the University of Georgia have looked at this and how the irrigation scheduling affects yield and economics behind that. So just to cover a little bit of that, I've seen a lot of this in some of the presentations, mainly because this is some of the only stuff we have access to to kind of give us an understanding of what those, the yield differences are for irrigation scheduling. So they did this over in Georgia looking for three years and different treatments. For irrigation scheduling. And then they did an economic analysis of that, just the net dollar benefits of how those scheduling methods affected the yield and the net return versus a dry land system. So just to point out really quick on here, they looked at Irrigated Pro and the checkbook. They also used a smart sensor out of Georgia to use as their moisture sensors. And they did have returns for most of the varieties of the peanuts they had in this study. They did have an increase by using one of these methods to get their irrigation determined on that. But the one thing that we don't have in this that I think would probably be a really good indicator for us is visible plant stress. If we're using that as our means to determine if we're going to irrigate or not, how is that going to affect our yield? Especially if that's what a lot of our producers are doing. But this wasn't included on their study, so we don't really know how much a scheduling method besides visible plant stress increases the yield over just using the irrigation and turning it on when we see the yielding out the field. But some of the conclusions that they had from this, really the main thing to look at is that in a dry year the sensor based systems did have a better dollar net return over the other scheduling practices. But then in a wet year we know that sometimes we don't have to turn on our irrigation we're not going to see a benefit for our irrigation regardless of what schedule and practice we're using. And then when they were looking at rainfall that was kind of sporadic, the checkbook method was preferred. But mainly they got to have more information and that's one of the shortfalls we have with this. We don't have a lot of information and we don't have any hard numbers on those, how each schedule and practice affects our net return. Not only that but there's so much variability in there it's hard to say definitively this schedule and practice is going to be the best for you and your farm. So those are some kind of issues we have when we're looking at trying to determine what the best or what the most economically feasible schedule and practice is going to be. But just to get into some of our soil moisture sensors, I wanted to cover what we have on the market, what we're using, and what some I've used some things we can use, some of the producers can use to do it. There's pros and cons for all of them. One of the biggest shortfalls for some of our moisture sensors that we have is just the cost on those. We've used the Syntech moisture sensor here on the station and on the farm. One of the major problems we have with that, it's a great moisture sensor but if you look at the price of those that can be very costly just for us for our research rate is about $1,800 per sensor. Now the Syntech moisture sensor is a Pacitense sensor. The best part of one of these sensors is that it's wireless so we actually have that data is available real time. You can have it at your smartphone, on your computer, so you're not actually having to walk out to the field to get that. So that's one of the best parts of that sensor is that we have accesses. We don't have to spend the time to go out there and get that information. Not only that but it's pulling readings from different root zones so we can kind of get a better idea of especially early season or later on in the season where that moisture is and how much we need to get out there to get that moisture to the right level. But again it's expensive so and especially if you've got a lot of variability in your field on your soils you can't just use one of these sensors to kind of get an average of when your field needs irrigation. So anytime you need to put in another sensor you're looking at another $2,000 for a sensor. So but here's kind of what it looks like if you've seen one of these this is what the Syntech moisture sensor looks like. It's relatively easy to put in depending on what kind of soil type you have but once you get it out there there's not much else you have to do with it and again you're not having to go out to the field and pull that information. So there are the difference in the moisture sensors I'm not going to get into to how they're reading that moisture level but we haven't really looked at to see how how different those readings are across the moisture sensors. But another one that does have the wireless capabilities is one out of Georgia the smart sensor array using the watermark sensors. Again it's very costly looking at roughly $4,000 if you go with a solar power system. So the good thing about that is if you have a lot of variability in that field or if you have fields that are close enough that you have that base station that can communicate between nodes you can have one base station and as long as those nodes that are in line of sight to that base station then kind of reduce your amount of money that you're going to put out there because you're just having to add another node and that's about $750. Again they've designed this so that you're not having to walk out there you've got you've got the cost of the telemetry you're paying for that software and being able to get that yearly so that is an annual price that you've got to pay for that but it cuts down on the time out there to actually pull that information out of the field. It's designed to where that you're with the Centech you have that housing unit out there so you've got to be careful about that post especially if you're adding more to get it over the top of the canopy with this it's designed where you should be able to run over with a tractor with no issues. Again one of the major drawbacks for this system is the cost associated with it and there here's kind of an idea of what it looks like that it's got that antenna that'll it should you should be able to run over it no issues and no bounce back. Another one of them we have is just the basic watermark monitor. I've used these out in the field before and they give good data you've got different levels that you're reading at you can hope for one of these monitors you can have up to eight sensors in there typically you can run four down for one profile compared to the others it's a lot cheaper. The major drawback for this is that you have to walk you actually have to go out into the field and pull that data out of there and if you're a producer and you've got a lot of fields you're having to pull information out of it can be time it can take a lot of time to do that and so you don't have access to that information. I know watermark has some newer ones on the market where they do have the wireless capabilities but again once you add that wireless system in there you're going to increase the cost of that so but it is it is something you could use as long as you're you're out there pulling that information because if you're not pulling that information timely you're not going to be making those irrigation applications when you should be but this is kind of what that system looks like that's the the sensor those are relatively inexpensive the sensors are again that box is about 750 dollars they're a little more difficult to install than something like a Syntec or something where you're just dropping that probe in the in the ground but again it is one of the options that you can use if you're a producer and you're not looking to spend three or four thousand dollars right now and then the aerometer is the one that's it's relatively inexpensive like a lot of fruit and vegetable growers are using these very inexpensive compared to the others again you have the drawback for that is that you've got a manual reading and depending on the length of that moisture sensor that's where you're getting your your measurement it's just at that if it's a 12 inch moisture sensor that's where you're going to get that reading so you're not moving you're not changing your readings as that crop grows and so are you getting as accurate as you need to but for fruit and vegetable production probably works but maybe not so much for your root crops but if you're looking to start using a moisture sensor to begin with this is something you can use without investing a lot of money in it so these are what these look like like again like i said they're relatively inexpensive so if you're just looking to start now kind of using a sensor to gauge when you're going to irrigate it it's relatively less little investment to use but again like i said we have so much variability across farms it's hard to say what's the best moisture sensor to use do we use the costly ones where we have access to that information real time where we're saving that time going out to the field to pull that information um what works best for us and it just it's going to depend on an individual farm but one thing we did kind of want to look at this year on some of the research here on the station is um because we don't have as much research and we don't have so much data some of the other states around us that have been irrigating a lot more acres than us um for a longer time just to kind of compare what our irrigation scheduling practice is are and how that affects our yield and the economics behind that so we're going to look at it this year on under drip and peanut here at the station in headland and we're looking at some different scheduling methods we're going to use peanut farm and checkbook we're going to compare these to dryland but not only do we want to use one moisture sensor but we really wanted to look at the syntax sensor as well as the smart sensor just so we're getting a better idea of how the capacitance moisture sensor which is the syntax or the um the gramometric matrix sensor the smart sensor from georgia how those differ and do we need to to look at the what type of moisture sensor we're using um when we're making our irrigation scheduling if we're using those to to schedule our irrigation are there any differences between sensors so um that's what we look forward to having this year starting in 2017 and kind of continue on and as we do have more involved more producers involved in irrigation looking to install irrigation or expand their irrigation so we can kind of have some better some hard numbers for them to look at so they can really kind of see how those moisture sensors um you know is it economical for them to to make that investment in those moisture sensors can they go to something like a um checkbook method or can they use the online application peanut farm or where it's a cheaper something that they can start utilizing but hopefully by the end of this year we'll have some preliminary numbers on this and in the next few years have some more um numbers out of this and see kind of where we're going so that we can have that information available for to producers so um like i said that that's what we're looking forward to doing here in 2017 and kind of moving on into the next few years but short and sweet that's all i've got right now um if there's any questions feel free to ask and i'll turn back up
