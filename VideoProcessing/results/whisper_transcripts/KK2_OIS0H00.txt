 This is Duke University. So first of all, I would like to say welcome to everybody. I'm Giovanni Zanalda, and I'm co-chairing with this Globalization, Governance, Development University Seminar Series with Gary Giraffi. And Gary will tell you more about our honorable speakers. I will just briefly say thank you very much to all our supporters, in particular to the Africa Initiative that is co-sponsoring this particular workshop with us. And then DUCES, which is the Duke University Center for International Studies, the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of the Vice Provost for Global Strategy and Programs. And now, Gary, it's your turn. Thanks very much, Giovanni. And let me also thank all of you for coming to this seminar. The DUCES seminar this year has been focusing on Africa and different topics. And for this particular seminar, we really wanted to look more closely at African agriculture because it's one of the most dynamic areas of development in Africa. And we have a very kind of special opportunity to tell a story about a research project that's pretty unique. The seminar is called Realizing the Potential of African Agriculture. But it's really about a project that is focusing on the 10 leading agricultural innovations in sub-Saharan Africa over the past century, which is a very daunting sort of topic. And the reason we came to this topic last year was because the Rockefeller Foundation was having its centennial last year. It wanted to focus on this particular theme of agricultural innovations in sub-Saharan Africa. And to do that, it asked for some collaboration with different, a couple of other research and development groups. So one of those groups is Oxfam America, very well known for its work in the food security and nutrition area, but more broadly as a development NGO. And the other group was the Center on Globalization, Governance, and Competitiveness here at Duke University that I direct, and one of the panelists, Ajmal, is from that center. So the collaboration last year was Rockefeller asking Oxfam America and CGGC if those two units could try to help identify the 10 leading agricultural innovations from a much bigger list of about 150 or 180. So Ajmal and Kimberly might describe a little bit about that process. But what resulted from that was a report that came out, talked about these innovations, and then a major conference in Abuja, Nigeria last July. And that was the culminating event. And the results of that conference are on Rockefeller's website, Oxfam's website, and we'll also have it on Duke's website. So in holding this event, what we wanted to try to do was to bring together some of the pieces of that effort. And in particular, we wanted to try to bring some of the flavor of those agricultural innovations to Duke. And we tried very hard to actually increase the panel by bringing in some of the African nationals who were also involved in that conference. And because of schedule problems, we couldn't get some of the people here we wanted. But we still have a great panel with three people who represent different aspects of the project. So what I want to do is just introduce who our panelists are, and then each of them will tell you more about their piece of the project. And we want to leave plenty of time for questions from the audience. So the first panelist, the one who will lead us off, is Kimberly Pfeiffer, who is the research director at Oxfam America. So Oxfam is a big international NGO, and Oxfam America is one of the components, and they were the ones involved in this project with Rockefeller and CGGC. Before working at joining Oxfam, Kimberly worked for the AFL-CIO as a researcher, and they're a center for strategic research. She has both MA and PhD degrees from the University of Florida in political science and African studies. But Kimberly also worked for the Aga Khan Foundation in Zanzibar, Tanzania. And recently she has been getting into the blogosphere. She just showed us a recent blog that she did where she engaged with New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, talking about the challenge to academia and researchers more generally, and trying to get engaged in relevant policy debates. So I think this session will be an example of one of those relevant policy debates, and we'll see whether or not the kind of research that will be discussed here meets the high bar that Kristof and Kimberly are pointing us to. The second panelist that I want to introduce is Ajmal Abdul-Samad, who's to my right. Ajmal is a researcher at the Center on Globalization, Governance, and Competitiveness, and our offices are just next to East Campus by Irwin Mill in something called the Gray Building, and we've been around for 10 years. Ajmal got his degree from, well, one of his more recent degrees, a Master in International Development Policy here at Duke. Ajmal was a Master in the Center on Globalization, and he worked for over 10 years as a project manager, working with international organizations and UN development agencies in Afghanistan. So he brings a lot of on-the-ground experience as well as research experience. And Ajmal was really the leader of the Duke CGGC team in collaborating with Oxfam America and pulling together the empirical research you're going to hear about. And then finally, we're really pleased to have Peter Bolt with us. Peter Bolt is managing director and founder of an organization called Dadco, a Dutch agricultural development and trading company. Peter is also very important because he was one of the inventors or innovators of one of those 10 agricultural innovations that was considered particularly influential, which focused on cassava and mobile processing units for cassava, and Peter will tell you about that. But I think when I think of Peter's background, several things come to mind. I'm an agronomist, kind of engineer, entrepreneur. He joins these things. He spent 42 years. He has spent 42 years in Africa and counting. He lives in Nigeria most of the time. So he's both own holiday country. Okay. So I think what we'll do is I'm going to turn the floor over first to Kimberly, then to Ajmal, then to Peter. They all know how much time they have, so I'll let them sort of try to summarize a rich amount of information, and then we'll try to leave plenty of time for questions and comments from the audience. So without any further ado, Kimberly, let me ask you to start us off. Thank you. Let me make sure everyone can hear. Great. In case you aren't familiar with Oxfam's work, I'll just briefly say that we are an international development and humanitarian assistance agency. We work in about 92 countries, and we work in a number of ways. We are a partner-based organization. We have two countries, and it also involves advocacy, policy work, and campaigning on various issues that we work on. I have the control. Great. But you also, as Gary was suggesting, may know us very well as a hunger and food security organization. So I'm going to start at that point with today's conversation, give you a feel for Oxfam's perspective on these issues and how we came about to working with Rockefeller and CGGC on this project, and just give you a flavor for what came out of that project. And as Gary said, why? Why do this kind of work? So one of the people will go to bed hungry tonight, and that's nearly three times the population of the United States. Ninety-eight percent of these hungry people live in the developing world, and half of them are from smallholder farming communities. And so Oxfam believes that smallholder farmers not only have a right to food, but have a right to a sustainable livelihood and stand to gain from investment in agriculture, and henceforth why we have put a lot of our attention and effort into programming around agricultural issues and as they relate to global food security. We see smallholder farmers as part of that solution, part of the solution of achieving global food security. In particular, smallholder farmers are a big part of the solution to achieving not only global food security, but growing economies in Africa. Sixty-three percent of the sub-Saharan African population lives in rural areas. Sixty-two percent of the sub-Saharan population is employed in agriculture, it is estimated. And about 80 percent of all farms in sub-Saharan Africa are smallholder farms. So Oxfam believes, given this reality, that it's critical to support smallholder farmers. Sorry. So Oxfam believes, given this reality, it's important... It's important... ...access to and develop innovations in agriculture and food production. And this is what related... This is what attracted us in the Rockefeller proposal when they came to us to work on these issues. But very quickly, let me just touch upon the... ...smallholder farmers. There's... There's... Sorry, I keep changing on the wrong place. ...framework for our market systems approach. But... ...support to collective organization, building assets, integrated risk management, and then increasing smallholder power along agricultural value chains. And here what you're seeing is... Sorry, our market systems approach to our work in agriculture. And more generally, our work even beyond agriculture to working to develop pro-poor markets. So from our perspective, there are... There's a triangle of critical actors and a set of relations that go along with that. That then, of course, Oxfam and other actors... ...can to benefit from these gains into those relationships. But we see government, civil society, and private sector actors all as having key... ...relationships in... ...increasing farmers' access to markets. So... This is just, again, a conceptual framework for our risk management... ...integrated risk management programming. But let me go ahead and skip ahead and talk a little bit about this project that we did with CGGC and Rockefeller Foundation. So the Rockefeller Foundation last year celebrated their centennial. And as... They wanted to reflect on their work in agriculture over the years. The accomplishments or achievements they've made in collaboration with various actors across the globe. And... ...approached Oxfam and CGGC with the idea of doing a scan of the most promising innovations across agricultural value chains in Africa. That improve access to finance, market access, and integration in... ...and how to imagine taking those promising innovations to scale. So... They approached us and we said, that sounds like a great project that we should be working on. And the idea here was to develop this work for one of their centennial events. They were holding a high-level summit in Abuja, Nigeria, where they were bringing together policy makers. They were bringing ministers of agriculture and ministers of finance together to have open... ...honest conversations with one another in a big public forum with civil society, private sector... ...actors and... ...but it was... It was quite a powerful convening and they asked the ministers to even get... ...sort of the... ...the... ...man of... ...the... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...
