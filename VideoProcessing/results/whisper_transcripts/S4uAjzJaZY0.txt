 Innovation powered by collaboration. 5 Benefits of Composting for Small Holder Farmers When you think of composting, you might imagine the image of ripe fruit and vegetable scraps slowly breaking down into usable material. If so, you're on the right track. Composting activities contribute to 9 of the 17 SDGs in the UN 2030 goals for a more climate-friendly world. In Nigeria, 20% of annual GDP is generated from agriculture and 88% of farmers are classified as smallholder farmers. There are approximately 38 million smallholder farmers in Nigeria operating farms sized from 5 acres to 5 hectares. Food waste makes up about 40% food losses between farms and markets in Nigeria. Welcome to our video on the benefits of composting for smallholder farmers in Africa. It's a simple, natural process that has a host of benefits for smallholder farmers in Africa. As you may know, composting is the process of breaking down organic material, such as food waste and yard trimmings, into a nutrient-rich soil amendment known as compost. Compost. 1. Improved soil health. One of the main benefits of composting is that it helps to improve soil health. Compost contains a variety of nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, that plants need to grow. It also helps to improve the structure of the soil, making it more porous and easier for plants to access water and nutrients. 2. Reduced reliance on chemical fertilizers. Many smallholder farmers in Africa rely on chemical fertilizers to boost crop yields, but these can be expensive and have negative impacts on the environment. Composting can help farmers to reduce their reliance on chemical fertilizers by providing a natural source of nutrients for their crops. EarthCare Nigeria Limited is already practicing regenerative farming methods, with a composting facility that has the capacity of processing 200,000 metric tons of food waste into organic fertilizer. 3. Carbon sequestration. Sequestration. Finally, composting can help to sequester carbon, which is a major contributor to climate change. When organic material decomposes in a compost pile, it releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. However, when that material is incorporated into the soil as compost, the carbon is stored in the soil, which helps to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 4. Increased water retention. Compost can help to improve the water retention capacity of soil, which is especially important in regions where water is scarce. By adding compost to the soil, farmers can help to reduce the need for irrigation and save water. The nature of the soil structure critically impacts the root growth ability of plants on a farm and can either positively or negatively impact plant health and crop yield. 5. Pest and disease control. Compost can help to reduce the incidence of pests and diseases in crops by improving the overall health of the soil. Healthy soil is more resistant to pests and diseases, which means that farmers can use fewer pesticides and other chemicals. Composting would impact rural communities bringing about business and job creation, reduced capital and operating costs as well as alternatives to fertilizer, fuel for food and for power generation.
