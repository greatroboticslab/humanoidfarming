Howto & Style
 When you're done making coffee, don't throw out the coffee grounds. Instead, what you want to do is dump it into a container, add one teaspoon of cinnamon, then add some club soda. Right now, what you have here is a super powerful nutrient-rich mixture with potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen, plus other minerals. Pretty much what that means is that it's a natural fertilizer for plants. So once every few weeks, supply this directly to the soil of your plants and watch them be happy. That's some good coffee. So don't buy this chemical fertilizer, save your money, and recycle coffee.
