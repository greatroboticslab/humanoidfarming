 This pig was once very poor. Because of his poverty, the city people beat him and chased him away. Broken and hurt, he runs back to his village. There, he works day and night, growing a field full of corn. As the crop ripens, he loads all the corn onto a truck and takes it to the market to sell. Slowly, his life begins to change. He's no longer just a pig, he becomes a farmer. But despite all his hard work, no one has liked or subscribed yet.
