 operation and maintenance of tyson tractors thank you for choosing tyson series wheel tractors this video mainly introduces the operation and maintenance of tyson wheel tractors please fill in tyson wheel tractor file card after purchase and upload to the manufacturer for archiving please carry out the maintenance work according to the requirement of the maintenance instruction if you have any question please bring the purchase invoices three package service voucher and contact with the dealer or service department so as to avoid any inconvenience chapter one safe rules of the tractor and points of attention for use to avoid any accident during using the tractor the safe operation rules must be observed and illegal operation is prohibited section one safety rules of the tractor read the operation and maintenance instruction manual before using examine the warning marks on the tractor the drivers must have been professionally trained and get the tractor driving license when you're sliding down a slope don't flame out the engine hanging neutral or stepping on clutch pedal the ground slope should be less than 20 percent and swinging left or right should be no more than 15 degrees otherwise it would be dangerous obey the traffic rules strictly when you drive the tractor on the road section two points of attention for use of the tractor one the bolts nuts and other parts easily loosened at all connecting position on the tractor must be inspected according to the requirement and they should be tightened in time if found loose two when the electrical system is maintained the negative hole bond strap of the storage batteries must be disconnected so as not to burn the electrical components of the tractor three when the tractor and farm machinery tools are inspected clean adjusted repair and maintain it must be parked shut down and place the shift lever at the neutral position the maneuvering lever of the power output shaft at the disengaged position and all the moving parts at rest four when the power output shaft of the tractor is working with load the tractor is prohibited to take a sudden turn so as to avoid damage to the universal joint five when the radiator needs to be inspected the cover must not be screwed off until the engine is stalled and cooled so as to prevent the liquid from spraying the tractor is not to be in the internal elements seven forbidden to modify the tractor by the user without permission any consequences shall be borne by the user not including in three package services chapter 2 use and operation of the tractor section 1 control mechanism be familiar with the position and function of various parts of control mechanism and instruments main clutch pedal control the engagement and disengagement braking pedal braking pedal control the braking operation foot throttle pedal control oil supply of diesel engine hand throttle lever keep constant oil supply multi-wave valve maneuvering lever control the hydraulic output valve hand braking lever used when parked four-wheel drive lever drive the engagement and disengagement rear power output shaft maneuvering lever control the engagement and disengagement main power switch control the whole vehicle circuit section 2 preparation before using 1. preparatory before using the tractor 1.1 check if the height of the hydraulic oil level of the gearbox is in between the upper and the lower scales please add oil if insufficient 1.2 check the oil level of the transmission shell at the end of the front axle place the oil injection plug at the horizontal position and screw out the plug the oil level should reach to the plug hole please add oil if insufficient 1.3 check the shell oil level of the front axle and screw out the oil injection plug the oil level should reach to the plug hole please add oil if insufficient 1.4 pull the hood lock lever and open it to check the position of the cooling water add cooling water if insufficient 1.5 open the steering oil tank to check the hydraulic steering oil position and confirm that the hydraulic oil level reach to the upper limit position of the hydraulic dipstick 1.6 check whether the connection points of various oil pipe and water pipe are tightened and whether there is any seepage or leakage 1.7 check whether the air filter is broken 1.8 check whether the tire pressure is sufficient 1.8 check whether the tire pressure is sufficient and whether the repair outfit is complete 1.9 check whether the electrical, lighting and signal lamps are perfect 1.10 place the main and auxiliary shift levers at the idle position ETO lever at the disengagement position and the multi-wave valve lever at the neutral position start the switch 2. start of the diesel engine 2.8 place the hand oil lever at the starting position 2.8 step on the clutch pedal 3.8 and rotate the key clockwise to gear 2 after starting 3.8 the key should be back to gear 1 immediately when starting the engine 3.8 must be no more than 30 seconds each time 3.8 if it cannot be started for the first time try again after 2 minutes 3.8 if it fails to be started for 3 times start the engine after troubleshooting section 3 driving and operation of the tractor 1. start of the tractor pull the lifter lever raise the hanging farm tools step on the clutch pedal and hang the main and auxiliary gearbox joystick at the gear position required loosen the hand brake sound the horn 3.8 the manual operate the maneuvering lever of the hand oil throttle or step on the foot oil throttle pedal and slowly release the clutch pedal then the tractor starts 4.8 during the uphill start step on the braking at first step on the clutch pedal and hang the low block then step on oil throttle and release the clutch pedal when the clutch has been partially engaged release the brake at this moment the brake and the clutch pedal are in the process of simultaneous release until the tractor is started and driven 2. steering up the tractor slow down before the tractor running the revolving of the steering wheel must be started before the turning is over when the tractor turns on soft ground or in paddy field it should be turned early and turn slowly less played and less resumed when the front wheels turn in a large corner duration of the steering wheel kept in the limit position must be no more than 10 seconds so as to avoid long term overload of the hydraulic steering system when the tractor is steered with farm tools traction or hang when the tractor is steered with farm tools traction or hang please look forward or backward when operated in the fields the steering operation of the tractor cannot be implemented until the working parts of farm implements are raised above the ground 3. revamp the tractor the flag lowering depending on the throttle Lowing the speed when the tractor is alert to the speed when the inducted the pickup feature of the trailer is holding without When the tractor is reversed, when raised area is encountered, the oil throttle might be appropriately increased. Once passed, immediately reduce the oil throttle and reverse slowly. 4. Choice of tractor gear shift and working speed. The main and auxiliary shift and shuttle gears are operated by three levers, which can realize 12 forward gears and 12 backward gears. The selection of the operating speed in the fields should preferably make the engine to work at 80% of its load. When the tractor load is large or when the tractor is started, driven uphill and passed through the low-lying road surface, choose low-speed gear so as to get big traction. When used for transport or small load field operation, high-speed gear can be chosen so as to raise the productivity. The user can choose the right speed according to the different environment and different area. 5. Tractor parking and engine flame-out. Reduce the oil throttle to lower down the speed or load and step on the clutch and braking pedal. After the tractor is stopped, place the main and auxiliary shift levers at idle position and push the parking braking maneuvering lever backward. The farm tools must be lowered down to the ground when the tractor is stopped, then turn off the tractor. 6. Tractor. 7. Tractor. 8. Tractor. 8. Tractor. 9. Tractor. 10. Tractor. 10. Tractor. 10.
