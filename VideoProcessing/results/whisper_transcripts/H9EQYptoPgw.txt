Science & Technology
 The Vermeer 604R Classic Baler, designed with the customer in mind. A customer who wants to put up six foot tall by four foot wide bales needs a baler that's convenient to run and doesn't require the bells and whistles of a custom hay operation baler. The 604R Classic Baler is the ideal fit for small to midsize operators that want the ability to bale with net wrap or twine. A lower recommended PTO horsepower of 80 horsepower lets you hook it up to most tractors. While the 71 inch 4 bar camless wide pickup features fewer moving parts, including no cams or follower bearings, which helps reduce maintenance. The rotor system helps provide positive bale starts and bale shape, while a new hydraulic density system allows the operator to adjust bale density from the cab using the Atlas control system. Its 4.3 inch color touch screen display lets you view field stats, such as bales per hour and average bale size. Know how much net wrap is left on the roll with a net wrap gauge that works like a gas gauge, along with optional readouts for bale shape and moisture levels. Useful information completely at your fingertips from inside the cab. A new net wrap system gives operators the ability to control net tension, also using the Atlas control system. Adjust tension on the go to maximize the net wrap spread over the edge of the bale. And with the Vermeer 3-year pickup warranty that covers internal components and includes parts and labor, this is one classic you can't afford to miss.
