Howto & Style
 We bought our property with neglected fence along the whole perimeter. After four weekends of removing this 800 foot section of old rusty wire and digging out the stumps and brush that were in the way, we were finally ready to roll out the new wire. We hooked the wire to the tractor bucket with a chain and a pipe in the center of the wire. Then my wife and I backed up the tractor and unrolled the wire. When we got to the end, we installed the fence stretcher. We put a little tension on the fence, then held the fence up against the post with one staple. Then using a come along, we tightened the fence wire until we got it as tight as we wanted it. If you've never done woven wire fencing before, you can never get it too tight. After we got the proper tension, we let it sit for about an hour, and then we went down the line and put four fence staples in each post to hold the wire in place. And here you see the final product.
