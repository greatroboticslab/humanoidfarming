 Hello farmers, my name is Erasto Zingaruka. I'm the technical advisor for livestock in Ringland. So here's the tip of the week for you. We are looking at observation, your footprint in your crawl. So as a farmer you always have to be observant, you have to observe your livestock condition and behavior all the time. And anytime that you go to your crawl make sure that you look at the animals for example look at their reaction. If you are approaching an animal and it's just standing, no movement, it can mean that this animal could be weak. Look at the animal body condition, look at the muscle for example, is it dry or it's wet. And one important aspect is that all animals should be active in the crawl or they should be participating, maybe eating or have access to the lake trough. But if you have some, maybe one animal very weak in the corner, probably it will tell you it's a message that that animal is probably not well. So and one important thing also most of us that we have to now start doing is to have our own Bible. What do I mean by that? If you slaughter an animal, be it a sheep or a goat for Christmas or for your own long consumption, please that will use that time or use that animal as the Bible or as a library for your crawl. So open it up before you start cooking or cutting pieces for cooking, open it up and observe all the organs, observe the lungs, observe the intestines, observe the hearts and so forth so that if there's any abnormality, probably it will be an indicator that there could be a problem in your crawl. So please keep your eye there, keep your feet or your footprint in your crawl. Thank you.
