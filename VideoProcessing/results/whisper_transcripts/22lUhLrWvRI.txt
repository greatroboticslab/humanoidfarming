 Welcome to another insightful video. I'm Ryan Chan, CEO and founder of Upkeep. Today we're going to explore the top eight trends transforming the agriculture industry. We'll be uncovering how biotechnology, water management, vertical farming, data-driven decision support, pinpointing agricultural needs, regenerative agriculture, rewilding, and asset operations management are shaping the future of farming. Whether you're running a small family farm or a large-scale operation, these trends will help you navigate the changing landscape of agriculture. So let's get started. The agriculture industry might be as old as civilization itself, but that doesn't mean it's stuck in the past. In fact, it's constantly evolving thanks to global warming, various shortages, and even the COVID-19 pandemic. These challenges encourage changes within the industry, and because farming is so intertwined with the earth, farmers are becoming more cautious about the materials and processes they use for food production. So whether you're running a small family farm or a massive industrial operation, here are the top eight trends that will guide you in the coming year. First up, we have biotechnology. Traditional farms have to sort crops because a percentage of all produce contains imperfections and flaws that won't sell in a store. Imperfect produce is usually sold at a reduced price or used to make processed food products. But here's where biotechnology comes in. It essentially edits the DNA and RNA of produce, giving it a better chance of reaching maturity with minimal flaws. By genetically modifying crops, bioengineering protects them from diseases and harmful outside influences like insects. This ensures a higher percentage of produce is free from imperfections and can generate greater profit. Next, we have water management. The earth is 71% water, but more than 96% of it is in the oceans. This means there's actually not much fresh water, which is essential for agriculture. The majority of available water is used in agriculture, so water optimization is a priority. Artificial intelligence has proven useful for irrigation innovations. For example, sensors can detect leaks and malfunctions instantly and automatically. This means irrigation systems can be repaired sooner, reducing water loss. However, water is so essential to agriculture that there can never be a single solution. Solutions to reduce water usage will continue to develop and improve throughout the coming years. The third trend is vertical farming. This brings crop production to controlled indoor environments, where light, temperature, humidity, and air are managed to optimize production of popular crops, such as lettuce and tomatoes. Vertical farms can be built closer to urban areas, increasing access to fresher produce, and reducing storage and transportation costs. This trend could reduce carbon emissions involved in transporting produce from warmer climates to those with shorter growing seasons and encourage people to purchase locally grown items. Fourth on our list is data-driven decision support. Several technologies can help provide farmers with data regarding their soil makeup and microbe life, enabling them to make better, smarter decisions about their farms. Monitoring technologies that provide data about soil temperature, moisture, plant health, and nutrient levels can help farmers determine actionable priorities regularly. Much of this information can be shared and accessible through the Internet of Things, giving today's farmers access to big data. The fifth trend is pinpointing agricultural needs. When it comes to sustainability, farmers must find ways to more accurately use fertilizers and pest control technologies to minimize exposure and reduce waste while still boosting the quality of food production. Today, technology such as drones can support this accurate farming by planting seeds, injecting fertilizers such as nitrogen only where needed, and watering in an optimal manner. Such technologies will help farmers maximize yield with minimal resources. The sixth trend is regenerative agriculture. This conservation approach focuses on regenerating topsoil, boosting biodiversity, improving water usage, and increasing the health of the soil. A wide range of technologies and practices are included, such as recycling farm waste, using compost from other sources, and employing no-till farming methods. Regenerating the soil is crucial to increase food security and minimize the impact that the agricultural industry has on our overall environment, protecting the world for future generations. The seventh trend is rewilding. This practice works to restore an area of land to its natural state, which means replanting a diverse set of species in that particular area. This not only beautifies the space, but also provides cleaner air and water, restores soil nutrients, and mitigates erosion and the effects of extreme weather. Rewilding also draws down carbon from the atmosphere through restoring areas such as peat bogs, grasslands, and wooded areas, and helps wildlife adjust to changes in our climate and the overall environment. The eighth and final trend is asset operations management. This can give enterprise-grade functionality to any size farm. Asset operations management supports streamlined workflow, deeper reporting and analytics, resource optimization, and improved visibility and control. As farms around the country seek ways to address seasonal and market demands, they will turn to asset operations management solutions to help streamline their maintenance, reliability, and operations in 2023. As we ring in the new year, these and other similar trends will dictate the priorities of the most successful farms. While many of these improvements are geared toward increasing the quality, yield, and profitability of farming businesses, a majority are also designed to help increase overall food security and minimize the impact on our environment.
