 Vintage tractor enthusiasts will get an opportunity to add to their collections at a special auction of restored tractors which takes place at the yard of the late Richard S Moynan near Balacolla, County Leish, just off the M8 motorway at Junction 3. The late Richard Moynan was an avid tractor collector and talented restorer. 25 of his tractors go under the hammer on December 8 at a very special vintage tractor auction. The tractors are all in pristine condition and include a very rare Ferguson Brown from the 1930s, a number of Ferguson and Massey Ferguson tractors as well as some beautiful David Brown models and a single cylinder stire. All the tractors have a local heritage and that makes them even more interesting. Auctioneer Richard Malone will have a large number of other vintage items from Richard Moynan's collection as part of the sale. This promises to be a very exciting auction opportunity for vintage tractor collectors with viewing of all of the lots from Sunday December 7. SB1 26 stands on the diskutese cartors.
