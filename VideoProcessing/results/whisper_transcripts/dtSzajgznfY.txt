 The Kogira River in eastern Africa is the source of a quarter of the water flowing into Africa's largest lake, Lake Victoria, and forms part of the upper headwaters of the River Nile. The river basin is also home to over 16 million people living in Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda. Rapid population growth in the basin has led to intensification of agriculture and livestock grazing, combined with unsustainable land management, all of which are putting pressure on the environment and on livelihoods. These problems are being exacerbated by climate change, with rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns leading to longer periods of drought. The main goal of the Kogira River Basin project is to adopt the ecosystems management approach, which will bear benefits that would include the selection of degraded lands, carbon sequestration, mitigation and adaptation of climate change, agro-biodiversity conservation, contribution to international waters. But most importantly, to improve food security and improved livelihoods of the communities. Rwanda's eastern province has been heavily affected by the changing climate. It's a bitter irony that despite the province's abundant water resources, rising temperatures and much longer droughts have led to famine. So the focus here has been on introducing small-scale irrigation. Here in the village of Gikindo, this farmer's cooperative received piping and a pump to get water from the stream up to their fields, so they can water their tomato crop.

The project has also planted trees and set up a tree nursery. These saplings will eventually be planted along the water's edge to prevent farmers from cultivating too close to the stream and silting up their water source. The area is facing a great issue of drought because of deforestation and then coming the climate change. Then we advise them to start planting trees and dig some trenches on the hills in order to retain water when they have the rain. These trenches also help to reduce soil erosion, a serious problem given the hillside. Hilly topography of Rwanda and neighbouring Burundi and another contributor to climate change as erosion speeds up the release of carbon from the soil into the atmosphere. And it's a vicious cycle as climate change in turn increases the likelihood of high intensity rainfall that causes erosion. irradiating conditions. A line of sepidings with investors over-grazing with Amaz— to bear a님 out of his own, whoever thinks of terra— Over the border in Tanzania, people are facing a slightly different set of challenges. Overgrazing has depleted the vegetation cover, degrading the landscape. The cutting of trees for firewood and charcoal, and the use of fire to clear land for crops has also reduced the ability of ecosystems to retain water, causing the drying up of rivers and streams during the dry season. In the village of Kamatenderi, the Kigerra Tamp project has been working with local farmers to rehabilitate degraded pasture land. The cattle have been moved elsewhere and the land has been replanted. Fire lines separate the degraded from the rehabilitated area to ensure that the rehabilitated land won't be damaged by fire. They will meet under the planned Olympics near the monastery of Manitia in Malaysia. While the cattle areандchen tree growth, there is noosos to grow like a nice spot.

The locals have also noticed a significant increase in water since the project began. New springs have appeared and now there's enough water to feed into this small fish farm in the valley. In addition to the rehabilitation of pasture lands, certain project sites have planted woodlots or tree plantations that the local community can use to harvest firewood, rather than cutting down trees from the natural forest. Bertha Tiofya has six children. She cuts firewood from the community woodlot, sells some and uses the rest to cook for her family. The project has also provided her with an energy conserving stove, which uses considerably less firewood. On a level of sanitation, she cannot be squeezed into frogs, because she has the feeling of recovering aviation, a lot of the outreach, a lot of volunteers can get rid of it as a search victoria, to do the work of the people who are living in the land, and to help them to help them to help them and help them to help them. The project is also encouraging people not to cut down the natural forest in other ways, promoting economic activities that require the forest to be intact, such as beekeeping. Not far away, at the Magareza Primary School, the children are being taught sustainable land management techniques, such as how spreading dried grass or mulch over the roots of their banana trees will help the tree roots to soak up more water when the rains come. We are doing different things to address issues of climate change. One is to promote sustainable land management technologies that address land degradation. but in turn address climate change. For example, when we come up with technologies for improving moisture conservation, this is actually addressing soil erosion control, but also addressing climate change at the same time. There's a lot of work to be done in this region to reverse the damage that has already been caused, but with the community, young and old, directly involved in activities that benefit both them and the environment, there's a good chance that real change can be achieved.
