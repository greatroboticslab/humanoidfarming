 I have tried to manage things in a way to get a healthier soil where I can get by with less fertilizer. I'm concentrating more on fertilizer placement where it's more usable and higher quality where it's better utilized. I guess I've probably cut my total fertilizer usage by between a fourth and a third and maintained or increased yields just by being a little bit more careful about timing of application and style of application. That's definitely a big thing for the GPS is you know just cutting overlaps on spray and fertilizer. That's huge. With the GPS guys can board or say a grass waterway and spray around it where they don't kill out the grass waterway and then with the GPS technology they come along and spray and the sprayer automatically shuts off when they go over it. You've got a machine that can automatically shut off every nozzle individually on a 120-foot boom as you cross into stuff that's already been sprayed or fertilized you know there's going to be a dollar savings but there's also going to be environmental benefit too.
