 They get another place to graze in the winter and we get a better nutrient cycling on our cover crops. Hello and welcome to this edition of the State of Soy. I'm Michaela Jordan reporting from Southwest Iowa where we're joined today by farmer Chris Gasser. Chris farms corn, soybeans, and a variety of other crops here in Corning, Iowa and has become a leader in the conservation space especially related to grazing cover crops. Chris start by telling us a little bit about yourself and your operation. We farm in Adams County, Iowa mostly between Corning and Creston and a little bit down towards Lenox. We do corn, soybeans, cereal, rye, a little bit of triticale. We've been doing conservation for a long time. Our family's been no-tilling for over 30 years and we've been doing cover crops and some of that stuff since 2010. What got your family involved in implementing cover crops and how have you made that profitable for your operation? We had a lot of years in a row where we'd kind of gotten them like four inch rains in an hour and we realized that the stuff that we were already doing with like the no-till and terraces and waterways just wasn't enough like it used to be. We were really small at first. Like we started with like, you know, 20 acres here and then like a hundred and then two hundred. Finally last year we got up to where we can actually cover all our acres, which has been really nice. When we got into cereal rye, we realized we could grow our own seed, which became really helpful just for being more cost effective and things like that. Two years ago my wife and I started our own part of the farm called GX Agriculture. And so now we sell cover crop seed. We also sell a bunch of rye to a distillery over at Osceola, which is really awesome. We partner with a lot of local people on grazing. We partner with about six different groups right now. We found out that for the cattle and stuff they get a little better feed value in some of that off of triticale over rye. People still like both, but we're kind of branching more into that market. There's lots of cattle in this area. How did you get involved with the grazing aspect related to cover crops? It kind of really started with the cover crops where like they would bail the straw or use it after we harvested the rye. And then it turned into, hey, can we graze some stocks? And then, you know, once we really started to put cover crops on a lot of acres, you know, all the lifestyle guys will tell you if they can get a little extra feed in the winter, it's a really good deal. So it started with people we were already working with and then it just kind of branched out. If we were close to somebody else, they would just be like, hey, can we work out a deal and graze that? So it kind of like formed like really organically over time. Those kind of relationships really turned into a net gain for all of us because they get another place to graze in the winter and we get better nutrient cycling and stuff on our cover crops to the point where like even where we harvest our cereal grains in the summer, now instead of just putting like a normal cover crop in, we do like a more diverse mix, some of it specifically for grazing and some of it for soil building. What benefit have you seen specifically as the landowner, operator and farmer? The nutrient cycling is so much better. They're actually like going through the rumen and like processing the cover crops. So ideally we're getting a little less nutrient tie up. We're still getting the benefits of having those growing roots there, you know, taking up the nutrients in the off season. So we're not leaching them out. And we typically have the cattle come off the end of February, early March. So then that way, you know, it still has time to grow back and get green again before it gets too warm. And if you pick something like a triticale or a rye, as soon as it gets above 32 degrees, it'll start growing. And then we still get the benefits like the weed suppression and some of those kinds of things as well. We still do like a standard chemical termination on all of our cover crops. If you're not going to hay it, we spray it. Ahead of beans, you can do it with your pre-spray pass, but we try to be a little ahead of that for corn. For farmers that may have diversified operations that are running both livestock and crop acres, what benefits would grazing their own cover crop offer them? You're getting the benefit of extra feed for your cattle and the benefit of weed suppression and having a green crop out there all the time just so you're not leaching nutrients and things like that. You know, ideally we'll keep having, you know, those conservation programs and they can help with cost share and things like that. And so you can get that added benefit as well. And then the other thing I would say is like start with one field or part of the field, you know, kind of get the hang of it and ask people like there's going to be people around, like even if they're not directly in your area that can help you so you don't have to go through all the growing pains. Cover crops provide a variety of opportunities to ensure that your soil is staying in place and that your water quality is remaining high on your family's farm, along with providing opportunities to add additional income or grazing opportunities for livestock that you may have. Chris, thank you for your time today and being a leader within the conservation space, especially with cover crops and being willing to share your knowledge with others. Reporting for this edition of the State of Soy, I'm Michaela Jordan. The reason I chose to go with FMH was I feel I've always been taken care of. I trust the people. They all seem to be tied to ag and they care too. And I also appreciate their American company. As a farmer, I appreciate their family owned, that it's here in the United States, that they're owned in the United States and they're working for us. All good people. We've been with them for 10 years probably now. They're a great company and I will stay with them forever. That must be good for them forever. That must be good for the number of organizations within the center,
