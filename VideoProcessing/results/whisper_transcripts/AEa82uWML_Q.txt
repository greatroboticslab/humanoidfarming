 The Earth's population will approach 10 billion by the middle of the century. Meanwhile, agriculture represents the planet's largest use of fresh water and second largest producer of greenhouse gas emissions. Leaps by Bayer builds and invests in companies that develop seeds tailored for vertical farming, which requires dramatically less water and land, and teaches microbes to fix atmospheric nitrogen, significantly reducing fertilizer production, use, and runoff. Imagine filling your kitchen with produce that's healthy for you, much more sustainable for the planet and future generations. Ten huge challenges facing humanity. Some call them impossible. We call them leaps.
