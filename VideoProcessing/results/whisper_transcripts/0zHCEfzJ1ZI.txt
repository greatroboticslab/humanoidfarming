 hey guys welcome to episode 4 of life on the farm today we are joined with a special guest our very own equine health manager Lynn so welcome Lynn to the show she was super excited to join us today we thought we'd take this time to ask her a few questions about our rehab horses and our rehabilitation process so Lynn thanks for joining us for one and also we would like you to answer the question of how many horses that we have in our rehab program currently right now we have seven horses in the rehab program okay and off the top of your head do you could you quote us a cost of how much it cost days in to rehab a horse probably for the first three about three to six months so for each month for each horse it costs about two thousand dollars and most horses take between three and six months to fully rehab and I know a lot of people probably pretty pretty curious about our refeeding program would you give us a little insight on that program sure so when we get horses and impounds a lot of time they've been starved for a long time so their gut is empty so we start them on a tiny little bit of forage usually a quarter of a flake of hay and a nibble net that slows their intake of the hay we increase that every three days for about a week and then if they're doing all right with that we'll start them on hard feed so we'll take a quarter of a pound of TCSR which is triple crown senior feed it's about this much you wet it down we give that to them every four hours or so and increase that in a five quarter of a pound every three days all right thank you it sounds like it's a lot of work and we're really grateful for you and all of our barn staff that are keeping all these horses going through the rehab program so now we're just gonna head up to the field I guess and check out some of our rehab horses so so Lover's Lane, or Lainey, is a 14-year-old mare standing at 15-1 hands high. Lainey is a sensitive, sweet soul with gorgeous paint markings. She would love to have a home with a person that is quiet and confident. Lainey has been ridden English and Western and she looks lovely in either apparel. Lainey is currently going walk truck canter and has been out exploring on the trails. Her favorite part of the trails was splashing as hard as she could in the streams along the way. She loved getting her rider and the other horses as wet as she could. Even though she has been diagnosed with navicular disease, Lainey really would love if she could have at least a small job to do in her new home. She likes to work and she is an honest little worker bee. She has a soft mouth and moves off of leg beautifully. She ties, loves bath time, loads, stands great for grooming, tacking, and mounting, and is always ready to be caught. Lainey loves scratches, water, and being told that she is the prettiest of them all. If you're looking for a drop dead gorgeous girl with a little bit of chrome, Lainey might be your match. An intermediate rider with a well balanced seat and quiet hands would be the best fit for Lainey. She is fun to ride and she makes the rider look really good. Lower level dressage, hacking out, lessons here and there, this girl has your back. For more information about Lainey and other horses available for adoption, be sure to check out our website.
