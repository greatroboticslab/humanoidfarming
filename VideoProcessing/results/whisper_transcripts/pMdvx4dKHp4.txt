Howto & Style
 There's a little compartment with your Allen key. Use the Allen key to unscrew. First, you need to press the button on the other side to unlock it. Then twist the Allen key and the screw will come out. Next, you want to remove the washer behind it. Then you want to move the lower blade guard over and slide the blade in. You want to be sure that the blade arrows are going in the direction of the arrow on the side of the upper guard. Then we want to put the washer back and the screw. Then to make sure that that screw is locked in place, we're going to press that button one more time and lock it while tightening. Now pop your battery in. Line your guide up to your mark. On the handle, there are two buttons. You want to press the top button first and then you're going to press the bottom and let go of the top. This will get your blade running. As you saw through your wood, your lower blade guard will move out of the way on its own.
