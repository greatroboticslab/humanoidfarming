 Hello everyone! Have you ever planted trees and raised fish on your farm? This model is called aquaponics. Aquaponics is a combination of the art of fish farming and growing plants in the same loop system, which not only provides high yields but also saves up to 90% of water compared to traditional methods. What's even more special, this system does not use toxic chemicals at all. With aquaponics, we not only produce food in a sustainable way, but also protect the environment and provide optimal nutrition for human health. Let's discover the magic of aquaponics through this video. Concord is the first and only aquaponics system in Singapore, combining greenhouse technology with hydroponics to produce clean vegetables. With a special approach by taking advantage of underutilized spaces, such as multi-story car parks, Concord transforms these areas into agricultural production areas. Here, greenhouses are built to protect the environment while using hydroponic methods to optimize cultivation. This aquaponics system not only provides a clean and safe source of vegetables, but also makes effective use of urban space, minimizing adverse impacts on the environment. Concord contributes to the development of sustainable agriculture and the improvement of the quality of life in Singapore. In Texas, aquaponics systems use an environmentally controlled greenhouse space of about 12,000 square feet to grow trees. Here, it is possible to produce up to 7,000 lettuce plants per week, thanks to aquaponics techniques. This greenhouse not only helps regulate the temperature, but also protects the plants from the scorching heat of the Houston summer. The system starts with the farming of freshwater fish, namely Blue Nile tilapia. These male tilapia are powered by Americulture, a reputable breeder from New Mexico. This aquaponics system creates a sustainable and efficient agricultural production environment, making the most of available space and resources. In particular, the aquaponics system is an extremely effective solution to help you save water. Here, wastewater from the tank is continuously circulated through pipes that feed the planting beds. When the water rises close to the top, the siphon tube will work and the water will flow quickly. The peculiarity of this system is that there are additional valves and taps at the end of the supply pipe, allowing water to be discharged when necessary. Thanks to the intelligent water circulation mechanism, this system helps to minimize water waste and ensure sufficient water supply for crops without the need for regular addition. At a farm on the outskirts of Bangalore, India, I experienced a modern aquaponics system, a unique combination of aquaculture and agricultural farming. The farm has fish tanks and advanced hydroponic systems, besides rice fields, tomato and chili orchards. Here, aquaponics systems eliminate the use of chemicals altogether, instead using biological reactions from the fish and plant circulation systems for farming. This system not only saves water, but also creates a natural ecosystem, helping plants absorb nutrients from fish waste. It is an eco-friendly and advanced agricultural model that opens up a new direction for Indian agriculture. Another benefit is increased productivity. Thanks to the continuous and balanced supply of nutrients, crops grown in aquaponics often grow faster and yield higher yields than traditional growing methods. This not only helps to increase farmers' incomes, but also meets the growing demand for food in the modern world. To get started, we need to understand the main components of this system, including the fish tank, filtration system, planting tank and water pump. First, choose a fish tank that is suitable for the space and type of fish you want to keep. Fish tanks can be made of plastic, glass or metal, and the capacity of the tank will affect the number of fish you can keep. Next, install a filtration system to remove solid waste and impurities. Next, install a filtration system to remove solid waste and impurities from the water. The filtration system consists of a mechanical filter and a biological filter, which help keep the water clean and safe for the fish. After installing the filtration system, you need to prepare the planting tank. The planting tank can be placed on or near the aquarium, and it must be ensured that the roots can access the nutrient-rich water from the aquarium. Finally, install a water pump to ensure that water is constantly circulated between the aquarium and the planting tank. The planting water will help maintain the oxygen needed for the fish and provide nutrient-rich water to the plants. Next year, we will go on a detailed tour of how I dispose of solid waste in my aquaponics system. The aquaponics system is a unique combination of fish farming and growing trees in a closed environment, bringing sustainability to agriculture. To ensure the efficient operation of the system, care and maintenance are extremely important. First, water management is the core factor. Make sure the water is always clean and balanced with readings such as pH, hardness, ammonia, nitrate and nitrite. Regularly change the water to remove waste and maintain an ideal habitat for fish and plants. Fish care requires health monitoring and disease treatment to prevent infection. Provide the right amount of food and monitor to avoid contaminated excess food. With plants, it is necessary to monitor growth and pruning to maintain light and air for the plants. Provide proper nutrition through organic fertilizers or nutrients. Periodic inspection and maintenance of equipment such as pumps and filtration systems is necessary to ensure efficient operation. Adjust water flow, light and temperature to meet the needs of fish and plants. Aquaponics is an efficient and sustainable agricultural solution that combines the natural interaction between fish and plants in a loop system. This method not only saves up to 90% of water compared to traditional agriculture, but also completely eliminates the use of toxic chemicals. This brings great benefits to the environment by reducing pollution and protecting water resources. At the same time, aquaponics also provides clean and nutritious food, which plays an important role in meeting the food needs of modern society.
