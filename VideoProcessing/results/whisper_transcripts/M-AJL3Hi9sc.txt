People & Blogs
 All right, well thank you for that introduction Wayne. And as you mentioned, I'm an agronomist with the Institute and been working on these economic assessments projects. And Wayne, one of my roles with the organization is this project that's been supported and funded by Cargill, so we're very grateful for that. And in that role, I've been working with the Cargill's leadership team to identify farmers participants for these interviews. And it's been my pleasure of conducting these interviews with my colleague, Archie Flanders. We've actually, we're targeted 100 interviews and we've completed 89 of those interviews. We'll be wrapping up and putting, closing the book on those interviews here in the next couple weeks in Michigan. So it's been, it's been just a real enjoyable experience for both Archie and I. And it's my distinct pleasure today to introduce three of those farmers to you. And we're going to, we've asked them to share a little bit of their experiences and their journey in adopting these soil health practices. I think what you'll find as you listen to them, that we've picked some, that this group farmers that we've talked to, they're just outstanding role models. They've not only been very successful in adopting these practices on their own farms, but they've also had some great leadership roles, not only locally, but across the country and even internationally in mentoring other farmers and, and adopting these practices. So, so, so the order of business here is what we'll do. So I don't, as you can see on the screen there, we've got, you can see the names and pictures of the three farmers that we plan to interview and we'll, we'll go in that order. And so what I've asked each of the panelists to do is we'll, we'll use about eight or nine minutes for each, for each grower to talk about their experiences. And then we'll move on to the next one. And, and if there's any time left over at the end, we'll try to answer some questions during the Q and A. So, and it's my pleasure to introduce Ms. Lisa Lutz from the, as our first panelist and Lisa and her husband, Jim farm in Northeastern Nebraska. They have three children and two grandchildren. Their third generation farm consists of dry land, corn, soybean rotation, and they've grown alfalfa and they've raised livestock in the past. And so Lisa, I've kind of given a little bit of introduction there for you. Is there anything I've missed in terms of anything about the farm, overall characteristics of the farm that you want to share with our audience? No, I just would like to, I would like to say hi to everybody. And I would like to add that my husband and I have been farming for 30 years and right now we're corn, soybean rotation, but we've raised alfalfa in the past. And we have, we have about 400 acres of both and we're complete, constantly corn, soybean rotation. And I grew up on a family farm and how we farm today is a lot different than when I, we've, how we farmed 40 or 50 years ago. Thank you, Lisa. So the next question for you is, so what cell health practices have you adopted in your operation and how long have you been using these practices? So we've been no-tilling for about 25 years. We started out with a no-till drill and we've used chicken manure and we have experimented with cover crops, but haven't quite found a fit for them on our farm. In Northeast Nebraska, we depend completely on water. And so sometimes trying to seed them in the fall has been a challenge. And if you use a drill in the fall to seed them, then it breaks up your residue, which is counterproductive from what we're trying to do. So we're very proud of the no-till soil that we have and, and continue to do that. Great. Thanks, Lisa. So the next question here is that I have for you is what agronomic and economic benefits have you seen from using these practices? So there's been several and we farm in the hills in Northeast Nebraska. And so we always say we have nine acres of flat land and everything else is a hill. And one of the main things we've seen is if you take a yield map today and looked at that, you could not pick out the hills on our, on our, on our fields. The yields have been consistent going up and down the hills and in the bottoms. And so we've also, that means we've had less erosion, better water retention because water is very important. And then, you know, less fuel, less labor, all of those things that go with that. And, but the consistency and the yield in all of our, on all of our fields has been, and then just the less nitrogen and less other, or other inputs we've used. Great. Those are great answers. The questions, the questions are, Lisa. So what challenges have you faced in implementing these practices? Things like, looks like maybe we might've lost Lisa. Well, John, they told me to shut my, turn my video off. So we should, we should mention Lisa just texted me and she said their electricity went out. So she's having some technical challenges of your own, right, Lisa? Correct. Well, we can, we can proceed without, without video. So, so anyway, anyway, back to the, this question here is what sort of challenges have you faced in implementing these practices? Have you like, in terms of the, the, the planters that you use in your operation, things like cover crop seeding, methods of planting cover crops, the planting depth, a whole bunch of these things. Just what are some of the, maybe if you just highlight for some of the challenges you've had in adopting these practices? Okay. Well, my husband is the manager of, of the team here and he, and so I can just go by the things that he talks about. And, you know, when he talks about starting no-till, one of the first steps is to spread the combine residue evenly, because if you don't do that, that creates all kinds of planning issues in the, in the spring. And we, like I said, we started with a no-till drill and now we have a split row planter and, and he uses row cleaners, but on our hills and with the precipitation we have, he, he likes to make the comment that we can, we cannot have enough residue, especially with the corn soybean rotation. So if you have, you, if you have your residue spread, planting goes a lot easier. And then the first few years you need to use more fertilizer and, and then water hemp and weed control seems to be a problem just because I think it's a problem for everyone. And in no-till systems sometimes you don't have as much weed pressure just because you're not disturbing the soil. So I think we, I mean, I think he does a great job at doing that. Great. So maybe one final question here for you is what sort of advice would you have for growers that are starting these practices brand new and how do they, how do they slowly engage in these adoption of these practices? Well, there's lots of resources out there today. And in the past, when we started, there wasn't those resources out there and you, and you need to do what works for you. Every person's farm is different. So you need to do what works for you and you have to do, you know, the first two to three years are tough and you have to stick with it. You can't just, you can't just, you know, do it one year and, and give up. And you have to remember looks, the look, how the field looks does not equal yield. And starting with the smooth field helps too. So those are all things to consider. Great. Great. Lisa, those are some, some great comments about your, your journey around soil health practices. So I guess what we'll do now is we'll switch over to Matt Griggs. So Lisa, if I can get you to mute yourself and Matt, if you can turn on your video and, and unmute yourself, why we will introduce you here. So, and I would also just encourage everybody to read through these folks' bios because they, they have some pretty impressive credentials. And so take a look at them at your convenience. I'll, I'll try to highlight the high points of their, of these folks. But again, they're, they're very accomplished in their business life. So our next speaker again is Matt Griggs. Matt is the fifth generation farmer and owner of Griggs Farm LLC in Humboldt, Tennessee. Griggs Farm began operating in 1982. And they currently grow 2000 acres of cotton, corn, soybeans, and wheat. And like I said, Matt has a lot of things on his list of things that accomplishments, but maybe one of the most notable, noticeable, noticeable accomplishments is that he served as a speaker at the 2018 National No-Till Conference. And probably even more notable is Griggs Farms was featured in the 2019 eight part docuseries on the History Channel called the American Farm. So, so Matt, that's an introduction for you. And if I've missed anything, maybe just share a little bit more about the general characteristics of the farm. And then we'll, we'll kind of go back and forth on the Q and A thing again. Matt Griggs I'm glad to be here and I appreciate the invite. One correction, we began operations at our location in 1882, not 1982. Matt Griggs Okay. Matt Griggs You're right. Matt Griggs Personally, I took over the farm from my dad in 2005. He passed away suddenly in the middle of the season. And I was four years out of college and had to take over the farm then. Matt Griggs Currently this year we grow, we grow a mixture of corn, cotton, soybeans and wheat on about 2000 acres. Matt Griggs Okay. Matt Griggs Thanks, Matt. Matt Griggs So, so what kind of soil health practices have you adopted on your farm and how long have you been using these practices? Matt Griggs We've been using a terracing for decades. Matt Griggs We've been doing no-till for about 22 to 23 years or so. Matt Griggs But the one thing that I noticed after taking over the farm a few years later was we just weren't seeing the improvements in the soil with no-till and terracing. Matt Griggs Basically we were maintaining the status quo, but we weren't actually improving anything. Matt Griggs At that time we really took a look into ways to increase the organic matter of our soils to build them up. Matt Griggs We use manure and cover crops to accomplish that. Matt Griggs So what sort of agronomic and economic benefits have you seen from these practices? Matt Griggs We started experimenting with cover crops in 2010. Matt Griggs We actually started planting them large scale in 2014. Matt Griggs In 2015 we started planting everything green into high biomass cover crops. Matt Griggs But over the last five years we've seen our organic matter close to double. Matt Griggs You know it's really increased the water infiltration, the ability of our soils, our water holding capacities. Matt Griggs We've seen the standard water infiltration rate on our soils and no-till. Matt Griggs We've seen the same as the soil is about two inches per hour. Matt Griggs We've documented upwards of 60 inches per hour infiltration rates behind cover crops for the first inch and then for the second inch we've documented up to 12 inches per hour infiltration rate. Matt Griggs The most immediate improvement we've seen is probably in weed control. Matt Griggs Palmer Amaranth pigweed is a tremendous problem in our area. Matt Griggs And we were quickly running out of herbicide options to control it. Matt Griggs And cover crops has been the best cultural practice that we can use to help us control these weeds. Matt Griggs We've also been able to reduce our fertilizer some especially in cotton. Matt Griggs In corn our testing has shown that we still have problems with nitrogen types Matt Griggs So we haven't really been able to decrease our nitrogen use in corn. Matt Griggs But on cotton we've been able to cut our nitrogen use in about half and maintain the same yield. Matt Griggs So it's really in cotton where we've experienced the most problems implementing cover crops Matt Griggs But it's also where we've seen the most rewards whenever we're able to do it successfully. Matt Griggs Great. And so Matt you mentioned those challenges and you shared those during the interview a little bit. Matt Griggs So could you kind of detail some of those challenges a little bit more for us? Matt Griggs The biggest challenge we've experienced utilizing high-level biomass cover crops has been Matt Griggs It's been in planting time and not necessarily so much in corn and soybeans Matt Griggs Because we're not quite dealing with as much biomass when we're planting those crops Matt Griggs And it's also those crops are also planted deeper too. Matt Griggs But cotton is a very shallow planted crop. Matt Griggs It doesn't have much bigger to get up out of the ground. Matt Griggs And then when you're dealing with a thick mat of residue and cover crops that you have to cut through and accurately place the seed. Matt Griggs It's really been difficult at times and we've had to come up with some unique ways to modify our equipment in order to be able to do it successfully. Matt Griggs Over the last two or three years I feel like we've really solved the riddle on being able to plant successfully in the high biomass cover crops. Matt Griggs And maybe that highlights the point of good point to make here is that you even in spite of the challenges you stuck with it and persevered and that maybe there's a moral moral to the story there around perseverance. Matt Griggs I mean we I mean we found out that that farming out of a jug is not going to be sustainable long term nature's going to find a way to the to to get by all these chemical means that we Matt Griggs That we that we've come up with and we've got to depend on the tools that we've got to depend on the tools that good Lord gave us in order to farm successfully and that's going to include a lot of a lot of cultural practices and you know just you know sticking our heads in the sand and thinking the scientists are going to come up with a way to combat a lot of these weeds in the next few years is not not realistic. Matt Griggs We've got to take it on ourselves to try and stay out in front of in front of the problems of these resistant weeds in order to be able to farm long term. Matt Griggs Yeah. Yeah. So maybe one final comment from you is what what sort of advice would you have for folks that are starting these practices anew if you will. Matt Griggs There's probably several several things we've learned. One thing is is is to start small. If you've never planted into cover crops before or planted green. I'd say just leave a sprayer width wide in your field and then look at the Matt Griggs Let it grow up and then try to plant into it and see what it does. It probably won't be a success. But if you look at it closely and examine what went right and what went wrong and maybe be able to come up ways on your farm to be able to be able to be able to mitigate the problems. Matt Griggs Also do do a lot of testing. Don't don't depend on other other entities other companies to do the testing for you test test these things on your field and replicated and then replicated plots. Matt Griggs And figure out what exactly works for you on your farm. We do a lot of testing on our farm every year because we found out what works on other people's farms won't necessarily work on our farm and vice versa. So doing a lot of testing and experimentation, you know, trying crazy ideas, all that kind of stuff is we've learned of what really works on our farm and what doesn't work and it's allowed us to be successful. Matt Griggs Some great points there. And we really appreciate Matt you sharing your experiences with the audience here around around your journey. So health management system. So, so I think what we'll do is we'll move on to our, our final panelists here and Matt. Matt Griggs Alright, and Mark. Have you brought on your video and unmuted yourself up there we go. There's Mark Mark. So our next speaker then is Mark Jackson. Mark Jackson is a fifth generation grain livestock farmer in southeastern Iowa with more than four decades of experience farming. Matt Griggs Conservation is a cornerstone of his farming philosophy. Matt Griggs And he's has several accomplishments and achievements and awards on his list. If you read through his bio again, so I'm just going to ask you to take a look at that bio but I'll just mention that one one just just here he received the the. Matt Griggs I'm just looking at the email he sent me here this morning Iowa Conservation Farmer the Year Award 2020 and it's sponsored by Farm Bureau Iowa Department of Ag and John Deere so Mark if I've missed anything in terms of your farm operation why go ahead and fill in the details there. Mark Jackson No, thank you john very much appreciate the opportunity to be here today I guess. Mark Jackson I guess not unlike previous two panelists I too am a family farmer. My son is sixth generation. We have land that is parceled land that dates back to 1890. Mark Jackson So that's a legacy that always. I mean it drives drives that legacy of the next generation making it better that sort of thing and sustainability has always been something that this farm has used as their part of the next generation. Mark Jackson So that's a great thing that this farm is used as a guiding cornerstone for for moving forward in that continuous continuous improvement model. So we do corn and soybeans. So I'm not kind of halfway in between you might say where Lisa and where Matt are located kind of across the 900 mile stretch if you will across the Midwest at an angle. Mark Jackson I do corn and soybeans. We do cereal rye. I've been doing cereal rye. No till corn soy but cereal rye has been a scenario I've been doing since about 2012. Mark Jackson And I think when we use a lot of livestock manure we have a swine finishing operation here as well which has allowed the expansion of our farm through the next generation. Mark Jackson So you touched on it a little bit but Mark would you review for us the soil health practices that you've adopted and how long you've been using these practices in your operation. Mark Jackson Yeah exactly. So from from those regenerative I like to call them regenerative health practices where we use cereal rye in addition to our no till practices. Mark Jackson I began no tilling in about 1985 and that was an economic driver during the Great Depression when a lot of farming lifestyles changed. Mark Jackson It's a cultural mindset to get involved in this the no till and the cereal rye scenario, but we've adapted quite well. Mark Jackson Machinery come along sometime in the 90s along with the chemical acts access so we can do no till soybeans in the corn stalks. Mark Jackson So we've been doing that for going on close to 25 years now. Mark Jackson So I think our goals there were actually you know erosion control nutrient banking and increasing our organic matter and soil health wasn't actually discussed back then as we do today. Mark Jackson So I think that's great that we can create that. Mark Jackson But I think it's all about the basics. Mark Jackson You know I use waterways headlands grass headlands buffers. Mark Jackson My manure management plans come in on a regular basis where. Mark Jackson You know four year cycle every acres is retested so that we can maintain not over apply. Mark Jackson Because water quality at the end of the day is is just as important as soil health as several of your speakers talked about earlier on. Mark Jackson So I think that soil stewardship is just a good cross section. Mark Jackson Thanks Mark. Mark Jackson Yeah, so in terms of agronomic and economic benefits that you've seen from these practices. Mark Jackson You kind of highlight those for us. Mark Jackson Well, from an agronomic standpoint, I think it was discussed earlier three to five years is a good goal when you're working with your starting your no tail starting your cereal rye when you're working on that health soil. Mark Jackson use to kind of help you know prove that baseline that we are getting better. From an economic perspective obviously we're saving time in machinery. We use a lot less horsepower dollars saved per acre is just as valuable for the profit margin at the end of the day as it is to increase our yields and I think that's an attitude we we like to utilize with those cover crops. That's you know it goes towards reducing the impact of some of those noxious weeds that are everybody's least best friend and so I think from that perspective I think it's it's moving forward. And so like the other speakers have mentioned this this wasn't all a bed of roses for you there were some challenges for you and maybe if you just kind of highlight some of those challenges for us. Yeah I think one thing that we haven't talked about in this whole conversation one of the major challenges I've seen as this is just a an anecdote comment if you will that the cultural mindset is our biggest hurdle sometimes getting farmers to change because we are talking generations deep farmers and doing what my father did my grandfather sometimes it is terribly hard to change that and feel comfortable about doing it but once you can get past that obviously then we can jump into the more basic scenarios such as machinery you know equipment which is modern now when I started farming in 1974 you know open station tractors where the mantra and everything was plowed and it was it was clean cover so we deal with you know the cost of the technology and I utilize a lot of technology which is very important I think to help not only help my mental stress but it also gives me good baseline data and that sort of information so we move forward in today's world but yeah we getting good seed placement is is a major hurdle when you're no-tilling when you're driving into five foot tall rye trying to put a soybean seed that's you know a quarter of an inch across and place it at a specific depth when you're driving on nothing more than you might say you've thrown all the laundry in the house on your living room floor and you try to try to plow through that with your you know cedar and establish a perfect depth that's not unlike what we're dealing with today so getting that trench closed not creating a smearing effect which will cause problems down the road access to good GMO seeds I know that conversation may stir some people's ire but at the end of the day we're we're about reducing pesticide loads on our on our soil and through that seed modification we're able to put a plan out there that resist pests weeds that sort of thing much less impact is has been very important element for me to to go so with the stay green elements of a seed where you're talking corn that has a good variety for dry down drought resistance those sort of things so at the end of the day we can actually reduce our costs once again okay um so any any final parting comments and suggestions and advice you'd give to folks that are starting new at this these practices well I'm only going to be echoing my uh panel mates here but yeah starting slow is definitely something you want to do um get good education background know your risk uh concerns because it's more about what's going to happen as to what you don't be thinking about pie in the sky as much as what what's the worst case scenario moving forward with the resources we have moving forward um but seeing that next generation and my ability to show people that I've um farming that same acre of ground that my great grandfather farmed and I can produce four times as much output with less inputs I think speaks volumes today great those are those are some great experiences that you've shared with us mark um so I'm just looking at the Q&A here I don't know maybe someone might have to help me here are these questions intended for our panel Wayne do you have a sense yes yes the top one you see it five but how many but five yeah yeah so one of the questions here and I don't know who wants to answer this question but whoever feels compelled when I I'll answer read it off and you whoever wants to chime in can do that we just heard about the importance of economics and promoting cell health management for any and all the farmers how much are you motivated to enhance cell health by economics and how much by other factors mark you're you're unmuted so maybe you can start on economics is definitely right at the top of that scenario I mean if you can say 40 to 80 dollars right up front by reducing machinery costs per acre I think rather quickly you can see you can actually offset that concern about yield drag right up front so yeah definitely okay do we have any other comments from any other other panelists Matt John this is I'll answer that question too uh I'm driven primarily by agronomic considerations I'm a lot stronger than in that area than that and more more so than in business uh but we do spend a lot of time trying to put a pencil to paper and figure out the actual financial benefits or the cost to utilize in our our soil health practices but it's really hard because there's so many variables to to consider to actually nail to actually to actually be able to nail nail it down Lisa did you have any thanks for that Matt Lisa you have any comment well I just I guess I just wanted to stay say I think you know when we started we we started because of the soil erosion and to keep soil in in its place and for conserving water and then you know then it led into um the economics and making you know the economics were positive and so that helped us move forward with that thank you and if I may add one more comment would be to remind everyone sustainability it's not about the economics because at the end of the day we still have to focus a balanced conversation with the environment and our social element in that conversation which was I think very well laid out earlier by Sean McMahon yeah yep yep um I guess we have time for maybe one more question and the next one I see here um I'll just try to capture what growers need to aggregate their problems and pose them to scientists we may not know about them so it sounds like maybe there's some folks in the scientific community that aren't aren't always aware of the challenges you have so I don't know if there's an if you need to respond to that but that's just a that's a question that if anybody has a comment their way I think technology allows that data transfer a little more seamlessly once we get through the conversation of sharing that data but I think it's it's definitely sometimes you have to share your data to see the bigger problems from afar where sometimes I'm too close to the forest to see the trees right right and John to that I would like to add you know sometimes in the research world they look at one thing or maybe two and you know look taking a whole systems approach is kind of hard especially when it comes to soil health and some other things but that systems approach is what's important yes thank you uh there's one more question I think you guys might be interested in responding to and that's uh do you think resistance to GMOs will reduce as pressures on the food chain increase and prices rise many crops such as bananas may not have any future without GMOs Mark you kind of talked about that a little bit earlier maybe you want to start off there right yeah so I think there again there's that comprehensive uh working together with with our seed providers uh our legislators you know that's where our commodity groups have worked wonders to help educate uh knowing and doing sometimes the hardest part sometimes the biggest hurdle for those that want at the most so as we move forward and the pipelines have changed we've got uh you know elements involved internationally where now you can maybe work with China a little better when China for example owns part of uh the seed driving uh suppliers and we're down to only three or four main major suppliers today so a lot of these things it's a smaller circle so maybe it's an element where you work very much closer together to solve the problem great thank thank you Mark anybody else Matt Lisa any comments sir uh I would like to think that the pressure on GMOs would reduce especially if the food supply does become tighter but I think we're facing a lot of external forces especially in the media that propagates a lot of a lot a lot of left-wing uh opinions that aren't aren't always that aren't always that aren't always necessarily true so uh I mean I think we're fighting an uphill battle battle on it mm-hmm can you say any thoughts sir no I just want to say that I mean the whole GMO conversation will change as the Arctic Apple and other um things are you know the GMO technology will help that will benefit the consumer because and I think that'll be an important part of the conversation well I think we've I really appreciate the responses you've you all have given to the these questions and I think we probably better close here at this point in time we've used up our time and uh I'll just remind everybody that we've got a break now and we'll be resuming here at 305 but I'd again just like to talk thank Mark and Lisa and Matt for taking the time out of their day to visit with us uh Matt Matt interrupted his vacation so we appreciate you doing that Matt so anyway you all have a good summer and best wishes on the upcoming growing season we appreciate it thank you you
