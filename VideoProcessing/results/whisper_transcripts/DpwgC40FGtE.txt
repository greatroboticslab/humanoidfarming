 During the winter, I like to spray all of my fruit trees with horticultural oil once every 10 days or so. This coats the leaves and stems and basically smothers out a lot of spores and pathogens that are dormant on the tree, or it smothers the eggs and larvae for a lot of pests that will infest your tree once they wake up in spring. This is the number one way to prevent a lot of these issues.
