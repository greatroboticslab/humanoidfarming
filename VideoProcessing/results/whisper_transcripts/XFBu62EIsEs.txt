 In Hypixel Skyblock, the garden is considered to be a pretty annoying addition, as it takes hours upon hours to complete, and regular farming doesn't really make a lot of money. However what does make a lot of money in the garden is pest hunting. This is the only farming activity that even has the chance to compete with mining, kudra, or dungeons. And in this video, we're going to be explaining everything that you need to know. The basics, gear requirements, and most importantly, how to actually grind pests. So with that, let's begin. Really quickly, this video took a ton of time and effort to make. So if you guys do find this video useful or entertaining, please subscribe as it helps me out a ton. Also comment down below any other guides that you want me to make, and I'll consider doing so. But anyways, back to the video. Firstly, we need to explain the basics of pest grinding. Pests are mobs that spawn in your garden after you have reached garden level 5. However there are some unlocked at higher levels. The spawning mechanics of pests are incredibly complex. Normally you see pests spawn in your garden when you farm, since pests have a 0.2% chance to spawn every time you break a crop. However, pests are also able to spawn while you are outside of your garden. Although the rates of spawning are incredibly low. This is why there's often 8 pests waiting in your garden when you log on for the first time that day. There are 10 different types of pests that can spawn in your garden. And they each have a certain crop that they can drop once killed. The fly drops wheat, the crickets will drop carrots, locusts drop potatoes, rats drop pumpkins, mosquitoes drop sugarcane, earthworms drop melons, mites drop cactus, the moths drop cocoa beans, slugs will drop mushrooms, and the beetles will drop netherwort. This information will be used later. However, for now just know that you're able to get certain drops from certain pests. And when I mean that pests drop certain crops, I mean that they drop a lot of them. And these crops can quickly add up in profit. If you want further information, you can go to Pomela, who will show you every single pest, as well as their drops. And as you can see, they drop a lot more than just their specific crop. Now here you will also see the field mouse, the 11th type of pest that will only spawn in pest traps and mouse traps, which are items that will come to play later. However for the time, just know that they are items that you can buy from Phillip over here. And they are used to catch pests while offline. These pests don't have a single drop, and will drop a variety of different things, as well as their own unique items. Now some people actually dislike spawning pests on their garden, as pests take away from farming fortune if left unchecked. This can hurt regular farmers, and can be seen as quite an annoyance. There are several ways to decrease the amount of pests that spawn in your garden. However since we want pests, we won't be covering those. But let's quickly explain how we can increase pest spawns. In order to increase pest spawns, you need to increase your bonus pest chance, as well as reducing your pest cooldown. Firstly, bonus pest chance is a stat that will allow you to spawn multiple pests at once, with each 100 pest chance guaranteeing an additional spawn. Reducing spawn cooldown does exactly what it sounds like. You see pests have a default cooldown of 5 minutes, meaning you can only spawn a group of pests every 5 minutes. However with certain upgrades and items, you are able to reduce that, meaning you can spawn pests more often. Essentially, you want to increase the amount of times you can spawn pests, and increase the amount of pests that can spawn every single time. Ok so now that we know the basics of pest spawning mechanics, why we want to kill them, and how to increase the rate of pest spawning. Now let's get onto the gear requirements. Alright so of course, you want gear that is not only going to increase your bonus pest chance, and reduce your spawn cooldown, but gear that will also give you a decent bit of farming fortune. This is because keep in mind, you are going to be farming crops while pest grinding, as that is the most efficient way to spawn pests. Let's get straight to it, you're going to need 3 fourths of the biohazard armor set, excluding the boots since we are going to be using ranchers boots. Upgrade all of these items, with the pest terminator 6 enchant, the mossy reforge, and el recon bobbulator. Since all stats on this armor is multiplied by 3 at night, you are going to buy a day and night saver, in order to modify your garden time, and always keep it as night. For your equipment, get the full pest hunter set, however do not upgrade the pest hunter cloak. Next, if it is finnegan, get the pest vest from the trapper, or just buy it off the auction. This is because if we compare them side by side, you will see that the pest vest decreases the spawn cooldown by 15%, while this guy only does it by 10. The pest vest also has 12% bonus pest chance, and has a base rarity of epic, while this guy has a base rarity of rare, and only has 5 bonus pest chance. So while farming, this is going to take the place of the pest hunter's cloak. However when you are killing the pest, switch to the pest hunter's cloak for the full set bonus, which will give you, um, an extra 100 farming fortune on pests. On your main set, put the squeaky reforge, a recom, and of course green thumb, however I'm not going to force it, since it is extremely expensive. Now you are going to need the infinivacuum hooverus. This is the highest tier of vacuums, and also make sure you have all the vinyls on it. You should also give it the BD reforge, which will give you some more farming fortune on pests. I just realized I don't even have this guy maxed out. Go ahead and give this guy 2 peridot gemstones, I'm going to give them flawless, since I don't want to spend too much money. However you can go for perfect. Now you don't have to put a recom on it, I did, since the mythic rarity looks a lot cooler, but it is completely fine if you don't. Along with that put the 5 bookworms favorite book on it, for the extra damage. For your pets, you're going to want a legendary hedgehog pet at level 100, with the green bandana, and a legendary slug pet at level 100, with the brown bandana. Additionally have your sprayinator with you, as it gives some bonus pest chance, and get the squeaky mouse mat, since you're going to have to get up very often, and it can be a pain to set your yaw and pitch manually so many times. Get the pest hunters artifact, for the extra bonus pest chance, and also eat 5 wiggling larvas, each giving 2 bonus pest chance. Finally, of course, get your main farming tool for whatever crop you're going to be farming. You can now get the other random bonuses, like the harvesting harbinger potion for the extra farming fortune, and whatever this potion is called, for the extra bonus pest chance. You can also get the 200 farming fortune from emptying your vacuum bag, and yeah, you should be good. Alright, so now that we have discussed all of those items, it is finally time to show you how to grind pests. Alright, so firstly make sure you have your main armor and equipment on, as well as your slug pet out. This is going to be the main setup that you're going to be using when farming. Set your vinyl to whatever you want, as well as spray the plots that you're going to be farming in. Now personally, I like beetles, since netherworks makes a ton of money, and the pesterminator books are pretty common to get. But of course all of them makes a reasonable amount of money, and it's really just your preference. Make sure you have the most amount of bonus pest chance and farming fortune as possible. Are you not able to drink this or something? Alright, screw this. Alright, make sure you have the most amount of bonus pest chance and farming fortune as possible, and start farming. And when I say that, I do mean that farming fortune is secondary. Pest chance is more important. Alright, you might have missed that, but I just got 4 pests. Pretty cool. But as you see, there is a cooldown in the pest tab list, saying how long it's going to be until you can spawn your next pest. When it says ready, that means you're actively rolling for a chance to spawn pests. Now after you spawn them, don't just immediately get up and start killing them. Instead, continue to farm until you get the second batch of pests. Which should come in around 2 minutes. After you get your second batch of pests, you can get up and kill those pests. You can see that right now, my cooldown says ready. Meaning, I'm just waiting for that 0.2 chance to spawn the pests and there it is. For killing the pests, take off your pest vest and put on the pest hunters cloak. This will grant you the extra 25 farming fortune on pests. You also have to equip your hedgehog pet and kill the pests with your vacuum. Now, I highly recommend getting the Sky Tales vacuum mods as it can show you the plots that have pests in them and guide you to where the pests are. Once you're done, put back on your pest vest. And also equip your slug pet again. Click on your squeaky mouse pad and get back to farming. You're gonna repeat this for as long as you want. However, this is the basic state. Also I just got 4 more pests. So yeah, that's pretty cool. Alright so now we're gonna run a 15 minute test to see how much money this actually makes. We're gonna clear out all our sugarcane. And we're gonna start a new session on our pest profit tracker. Alright and with that, let's go. Alright so during this 15 minute test, I got booted out of the garden 3 times due to server resets. And even crashed out of the server. I'll show you the highlights of which but be aware, this is a bit flawed since there was so much downtime. Alright that was the most oogra boogra test of my life but the 15 minutes are up. And it is time to check the results. I got 3327 enchanted sugarcane during this time, which adds up to around 2.3 mil. Also I do have bountiful on my sugarcane hoe and I wasn't accounting for that. However since I was farming 700 crops on average every second, I'm gonna do the math and say I got 117,000 coins from bountiful. So we'll say that's 2.4 mil from sugarcane itself. Even now pests have made 4.42 mil total. This means I got 6.8 mil in this 15 minutes. Times that by 4, that is 27.2 mil every single hour. Now I did get interrupted by 3 back to back server resets so that's pretty fun. It screwed up my timing a bit. However 27 million coins is insanely good for farming. Along with that I also entered a Jacob's farming contest and I'll probably get silver in that. And you are able to increase your profits by saving up your pest terminator books, combining them and then turning them into pest terminator 5, which you can then sell for a lot more money. But anyways, that's everything that you need to know in order to grind pests and make millions of coins an hour.
