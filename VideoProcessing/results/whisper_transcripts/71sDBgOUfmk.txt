 Music Helene called and said she had a 50 pound bag of Kernza and asked if we'd like to play around with it in our kitchen. So of course my first question was, well what the heck is Kernza? Kernza is on track to becoming the world's first commercial perennial grain crop. It's a cousin of wheat. It's a grain crop, produces edible seeds by humans and it's perennial. So you plant it once and it continues to come back year after year producing seed. What better way to get cover on the landscape than with something that's a perennial so that we can save time, we can save resources and we can have something that we hope wildlife will like. Music It was introduced to the United States in the early 20th century. In the 1980s, the Rodale Institute started making selections to breed for intermediate wheatgrass that had large seeds and high grain yield. They handed it off to the Land Institute, which is located in Salina, Kansas. And it's very close to the Konza Prairie. The Land Institute took a play on the name of Konza Prairie and Kernel, since they're developing a grain crop. So you combine those and you have Kernza. And in 2011, the Land Institute partnered with the University of Minnesota to develop varieties specific for these two different regions of the United States. Kernza is sort of a distant cousin of wheat. It's actually three species that cross together in nature to end up with this species. Weed has been bred, obviously, for a number of centuries now for certain characteristic, whereas we're just getting started with this crop. So it's really in the infancy of breeding efforts. Predominantly, what we're trying to do is increase the seed yield of the crop and make it more agronomically acceptable. Here I have four different years or lines of in-wee grass. So from here, I have 2004, which is very early stages of the breeding of in-wee grass. And then up to more of now. So we have 2015, 16, and 17. So these seeds, you can see that over the years, the size of the seed has increased significantly. Compared to annual wheat, in-wee grass is higher in protein, which is great, higher in dietary fiber, and a lot of phytochemicals that have been shown to be beneficial to the human diet. By relaying the information between the food scientist and agronomist, we can go towards breeding a superior or at least marketable and desirable crop. I would like Kernzer Stance to be in the field at least three or four years. We found out that Kernzer requires less nitrogen fertilizer than most other annual grain crops. That's because it has this deep, dense root system that's really good at capturing nitrogen that's applied to it. Kernzer can be planted in fields that are prone to nitrate leaching. Nitrate leaching is this issue of nitrogen flowing through the soil and into groundwater. We think it has a really high potential for our organic crop. We think it has a really high potential for our organic crop. We think it has a really high potential for our organic crop. We think it has a really high potential for our organic crop. Last fall, they had enough seed to plant about 100 acres in Minnesota. And out of those 100 acres, I was able to plant 15 acres. And my acreage is unique because it is a certified organic acreage. In July of 2019, they officially released this Kernzer variety. It has a great possibility under the name of MN Clearwater. This MN Clearwater really appears to be quite productive even the first year. So, there may be the possibility that we might be able to get four years of great productivity out of it. The interest is really growing among farms. I think for several reasons. They look at it as another crop in the rotation, but they also look at it for its soil building qualities. And a crop that I think at least initially does have a lot of income potential. Carmen Fernholz, I was really lucky to just meet him this last winter. And he's so excited about all the things that make a farmer excited. Soil, namely. How do I keep it on my land? How do I keep being profitable? How do I keep being productive? And so, through this conversation, I said, I love it. I think that's a great idea. How can we do that? But also, how can we make wins for wildlife along the way? After harvest in southern Minnesota, the ground, the landscape is pretty bare. And so, what we're trying to do is figure out ways that we can carry wildlife through the winter. We're creating food plots on the landscape. We're interested in kernza, or intermediate wheatgrass, because it's a perennial cover. Now we're dealing with a perennial cover that's about 10 feet compared to a traditional crop, which may only be within the top foot of the soil. So, you're talking about roots. That has an incredible potential to really do a lot of good things for the land. The sustainability, the non-GMO, the whole grain, the nutritional aspect, animal wheatgrass hits all of those. And so, for consumers, from what we've seen, they're very interested in that. The taste of kernza in its rawest form, if it's milled, in my opinion, has a nuttier flavor than whole wheat. It's a little bit darker in color. It has a lot of fiber, a little bit less gluten. So, it functions differently in different products. In the beers that I've had with kernza, it does have a sort of earthy flavor to it. Once I learned about it, it was such, it just was a perfect fit for what our mission is, to tell the story of our food and where it comes from. We cooked it up and featured it in some whole grain deli salads. We also put it into waffles and pancakes. At this point, the Kernza Carmelita Bar has become a staple on our menu, and people love it. Another staple item that we have on our menu is the Kernza crackers. About five years ago, we were invited by the Minnesota Farmers Union to partner with them, with their coffee shop at the State Fair. The last year, we brought in another item. We brought in a Kernza bacon lettuce tomato sandwich, and this year, we brought it back with an egg on it. I grabbed two volunteers out of the line. They graciously volunteered with Michelle and Jill. I asked them about the BLT, what they thought. Jill. This is the best sandwich at the Minnesota State Fair, hands down. We always come here first to eat it before anything else. I'd say it's our favorite. We think about getting another one to go as we leave. My favorite part is that all the ingredients are local, and you can taste the freshness in every single bite of the sandwich. You don't feel bad after you eat it. You feel like better. We were just thrilled with how much people love the BLT at the fair. This year, we sold over 8,400 BLTs at the Minnesota State Fair. That means that 8,400 people got a taste of Kernza. We were delivering a keg to the Birchwood Cafe in Minneapolis, and as we're rolling the keg through the kitchen on the way to the cold room, Chef Marshall Paulson stopped me and said, would you guys do a beer with Kernza? And I'm like, yes, of course we would. When we first brewed with it, we were cautioned. We said, you know, it's a little earthy and a little grassy, and it might not be the best grain in beer. I think collectively, everybody was stunned and really happy that the flavor profile's fantastic. We're brewing a batch of gold, so we call it a Kernza Blond Ale. Easy drinking. Mm-hmm. Low bitterness and just a nice, nice malty beer. It's pretty incredible. We would love to do more. It's, I think we have a luxury at our scale. We brew on a 10-barrel system. So when we have 100 pounds of Kernza, we can design a recipe where that's going to be 15% of the grain bill. You know, larger breweries to get that much Kernza would require, you know, much more poundage than we do. This grain and its perennial nature and the roots that it puts down and all that it's able to achieve to really build soil, clean soil, clean water, is just above and beyond anything we ever anticipated from an ingredient side, you know, behind the awesome perennial hops that we use. It's just a dream. We care about the people that grow grain in that farm. Yeah. And it's one of those things where they can conserve with a perennial, keep topsoil, you know, pull all that nitrogen poisoning out of the land. When we first started featuring Kernza on our menu, we made sure to communicate with our customers, you know, what exactly Kernza was and what exactly they were supporting by choosing to eat it. Food is one thing that connects us all. Please join us to tonight and those things that connects us all. Mm. All right.
