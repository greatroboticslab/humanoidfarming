 Advantages of farm mechanization in India The speed and effectiveness of farming activities are increased through mechanization. The need for human labor is reduced when agricultural machinery is used in farming methods. The use of chemicals, better seed kinds and quality, as well as enhanced farm equipment, all contribute to the rise in output. With the use of mechanization, production has also significantly increased labor productivity. Rural farmers benefit from mechanization since it saves them time and effort while also changing their overall position. Utilizing adaptable agricultural equipment, such as rotavators, cultivators, power tillers, combined harvesters, etc., considerably reduces the need for labor, while also enhancing the standard of living for farmers. Any piece of land that hasn't been utilized for farming can be converted into a profitable farm quickly and easily with the use of farm equipment, resulting in proper land utilization. Only mechanization can assist farm owners in growing crops and grains to fulfill the demands of food for supplying a big population. This is because the world's population is growing, and this trend is expected to continue. Since many Indians still rely on conventional farming practices, mechanization is also vital to improve the situation of farmers in a nation like India. The use of machinery could trigger a new agricultural revolution in India. Modern farm machinery, such as a combine harvester, aids farmers in producing cleaner, higher quality grain in the shortest amount of time.
