Howto & Style
 Mark, this is shocking. How not to keep bees? That was my bee mentor Peter checking our beehive when I was away on vacation for four weeks. I didn't harvest any honey before we left so our bees swarmed and the queen, Dottie, flew away to establish a new colony because the hive was full of honey and there wasn't any room left in the box. Peter tried to save the hive by adding an extra box or super with nine more frames. In the hope that the remaining bees would use this extra space instead of leaving. Two weeks later I returned home from holidays and we were shocked to find that those extra nine frames were almost full. That's about 40 kilograms or 88 pounds of honey in just over two weeks. The bees hatched out a new queen called Beatrice and the hive was saved. What a buzz.
