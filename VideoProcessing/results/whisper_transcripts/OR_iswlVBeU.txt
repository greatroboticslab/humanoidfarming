 Creating abundance on your homestead can be simple. You just need to add a few permaculture principles to the mix. Today, in this fourth installment of the Ultimate Homesteader Design podcast series, you and I are going to be talking about a few ways and ideas that can help you implement permaculture principles 9 through 12 on your homestead. Let's get growing. Hello and welcome to the Pre-Just-Plant podcast, the show that talks about growing. Growing a garden, a homestead, a healthy family, and most importantly, growing closer to God. I'm your host, Crystal Media, owner of the Red Ridge Farm Homestead, where our mission is to help women of faith find the courage to grow healthy food for their family while building a closer relationship with our Lord and Savior. That's you. Don't let the world hold you back. Pre-Just-Plant. Welcome to the Pre-Just-Plant podcast. I'm your host, Crystal Media, and today, in episode 10 of season 6, we're going to be diving into our fourth installment of the Ultimate Homesteader Design Guide. We've talked about this on the blog. Now we're talking about it on the podcast. And we're going in deeper into the individual principles today, 9 through 12. If you want to check out what is permaculture, making goals on the homestead, or permaculture principles 1 through 8, be sure to check out the other episodes in this season. I will link a few in the description below. But the best place to find all this information, to find all the links from back and forth between this complete guide on the blog and here on the podcast through episodes, you can go to the show notes of this episode. So let's get started. The goal of this episode is that we're going to go through those permaculture principles 9 through 12. I'm going to restate what that permaculture principle is. And then I'm going to give you a few ideas of how we here at the Red Ridge Farm Homestead use these principles in everyday life. So that maybe you can glean some of those ideas. And if you have more ideas, I definitely would love to hear them in the comments below. Principle 9. I like to call this slow and steady wins the race. Principle 9 is about using small and slow solutions. Permaculture isn't about making big changes overnight, but making gradual changes and working slowly on systems makes them much easier to maintain. Plus, they tend to have more sustainable outcomes. When it comes to permaculture, slow and steady wins the race. I think if you've been with this podcast for a while, you know that I'm probably going to mention soil here. Soil takes time to build. Soil takes time to improve its health. Soil takes time. All of God's procedures, all of his paths on how things grow on earth, take time. And that's why this principle is so important to implement on your homestead. So you can easily implement this process when you're taking and thinking about soil. Because in this process of building your soil, you're going to want to choose slow solutions. Slow solutions are going to be the key to your soil health. I have told you before that amendments are not always the solution. Amendments are usually the fast, quick fix. But if you use organic or natural amendments, they are also the slow solution. So there's many ways that you can learn about soil and changing the soil. And thinking of it as a slow process will help you grow through that area. Because a lot of times we as growers, as modern humans, feel that everything should be fast. We have, we live in a world of instant results. And sadly, a lot of things that are developed on the homestead are going to take time. And soil is one of those. Another idea is permanent beds. In our garden, in my garden, I, for the longest time, have tilled every single year. This is very detrimental to the soil. The soil does not like to be exposed to the air all of the time. And work you've been putting into the soil, you're shortening that life by exposing it to the air. So permaculture means permanent culture, doesn't it? So when we convert our tilled garden into a no-till garden, we do two things. We respect the microorganisms, and we allow them to do their work in our garden. Building soil takes time. Remember, a slow process. There are no quick fixes. But when you till, you're not letting this soil system work. Because every spring, you are destroying the previous year's work. It's kind of a vicious cycle when it comes to tilling. You till that spring, you work really hard all that summer to build soil health, to take care of your soil, to grow your produce. And then fall, you put the garden to bed, winter comes, and you till again. And everything you worked hard to do, probably not everything, but most of the things that you worked hard to try to do are destroyed, are taken apart. Because the essential part as a gardener, the essential part as a grower, is that we are stewards of the soil. And this is a way that we can do that and bring permaculture design to our homestead. Permanent beds are a system of growing that allows for the slow process of soil to build and grow every year. Because when you're dealing with permanent beds, you're only putting a top cover. And you're allowing God's design of the microorganisms doing their job, of the worms bringing the compost down into the soil, you're allowing that to happen. And yes, it's going to take time. And if you're thinking about going into a no-till system from a tilled system, I wrote a blog post, and I think it's a podcast episode as well, but it talks about the mindset that needs to change so that you can go into that type of system, that you are going to struggle. Because it's kind of a story about my struggle of how I went from tilling every single year. Tilling can be a great process when you think of it from a certain mindset, like you like a clean slate to begin with every year, or you want to change things up all the time, or it's a thing you've done for years and years. But when you change to that no-till design, when you change to that no-till growing, you're going to have to also change your mindset. You're going to go to the garden every year, and it's not going to be a clean slate. You're going to have to instill practices that will help you get there. You're also going to have to instill practices that you may never even thought of before so that you can grow efficiently in permanent beds. I'm talking about solarization. I'm talking about top dressing, maybe cover crops, lots of those different things that are going to help build your soil, but you're going to have to approach them in a different way than you would in a tilled garden. Cover crops, to me, in a tilled garden, really simple. You plant them, you let them grow, you cut them down, you get out your rototiller, and you rototill in that carbon, in that organic matter. But in a non-tilled garden, you can't do that. You're going to have to think outside of the box. And in that blog post, I talk about the different processes that you can do to change your mindset from a tiller to a non-tiller. And I will share that episode in the show notes. But also, what are the show notes? Well, the show notes are where you can go even deeper, where you can find more information about this topic. In the description below this episode, they give me a limited amount of words. So I got to tell you what the episode's about. I got to tell you a few quick links and social media things, but I can't tell you everything. And in fact, a lot of these episodes are connected to a blog post. So if you are a reader, or if you want notes already taken, or find notes, you can go to the show notes and find all of that. And the link will be in the description below. So what is another slow process that we can be using on the homestead? Our compost pile. The compost pile is a great example of a small, slow solution. Building soil health starts with organic matter. And the reason it starts with organic matter and carbon is because the microorganisms need that. Building a compost pile is a slow solution that you can do to make your own carbon, to make your own organic matter. Plus, the process of making a compost pile can be slow or it can be fast. But if you do it kind of in between, you're going to get that good black gold. Now, let me give you an example of fast. When I first started building a compost pile on my homestead, I quickly, and I'll put a picture of this in the show notes, I quickly went to the three bin system, right? You fill up one bin, that bin gets full, you flip it over into the second bin, and you work on building that first bin again. And then when that bin's full, you flip the second bin to the third bin, and the first bin goes to the second bin, and then you work on filling up that first bin. It is a great system, but it also is a system that works compost very quickly, depending on how quickly you accumulate your materials. If it's the fall, you can quickly accumulate loads of materials, and those compost piles are going to be turned to fast. In my Build Your Compost Pile Masterclass, I talk about the benefits of aerobic and non-aerobic compost piles, and the difference between the two. There is a use for both of them. One is you turn a lot, you make compost very quickly, but what you're doing there is you're speeding up the process. Now, speeding up the process isn't a bad thing, but you can speed up the process so quickly that a lot of the nutrients leaches out or doesn't get converted properly because the microorganisms are just moving through the material too quickly. It's kind of like, in a way you can think of it as heating your home with a wood-burning stove or a coal stove. If you put in really hot, high-burning wood, and it burns really quickly, you do get a lot of warmth for like 15 minutes. But then what do you do for the rest of the night? You need to be using slow-burning materials so that you can last through the night. The same goes into a compost pile. You're going to be turning compost, but you need to turn compost when the compost tells you it's ready. Not when you have set up a system and said, oh, this bin's full, now it's time to turn. That's not how it should go. If the bin's full and the compost pile is telling you that it's ready to be turned, that's when it needs to be turned. And in that masterclass, I talk about what the things your compost pile needs and also signs of how to know when you should be turning your compost. Your compost is going to naturally warm up and it's going to start to steam. You're going to feel heat inside of it. And then once it cools down, that's a sign that it's ready to turn. Because why is it cooling down? It's cooling down because it has lack of oxygen or it has lack of materials to be utilized or used into decomposition. So you need to be watching your compost and let your compost know when it needs to be turned. You can't just put it on your schedule. I tried turning it like once a week. It was a great exercise. You know, I was going to go to the compost gym once a week. In that system, you're going to reach good compost, but you're never going to reach that amazing compost. God made this world to work. You and I need to use a little patience and allow the things to work as God intended. And that even includes the process inside your compost pile. Yes, compost pile is a slow solution, but you also need to use that slow solution in its available time. Not on your time schedule, on the compost time schedule. And I have had great results in a compost pile that I don't hardly ever turn. It is one that we pile up all our winter things from the goat barn and the horse barn and the cow barn. And it's just a big, huge pile. There's no way I physically could turn it. So we use a tractor to turn it. So it only gets turned when it needs to or when we need to start the tractor up in the middle of the winter. And yes, you can build compost in the winter also. We're gonna get to principle 10 in just a moment. But now it is time for the tips and tricks segment of this episode, where I share a few bonus tips and tricks I use here at Red Ridge Farm Homestead. This week's tip is brought to you by the Building Soil Health Handbook. This handbook was designed to help you take the guessing out of improving your soil, to help you become the expert your soil has been waiting for you to be. Many of us think that we're gardeners of vegetables and gardeners of fruits, but we're not. We are stewards of the soil. In this handbook, I walk you through the four steps I've used here at the farm to improve my soil. I wanna help you become the expert that you never realized you could be. To grab your free copy, go to redridgefarm.org backslash resources. Tip for this week is, I'm reminding you to get your oyster shell out. Spring is a heavy season for your layer chickens. It is a heavy laying season. It's their natural cycle of chickens. If you're not running a bunch of lights, it's their natural cycle to lay very heavy in the spring. It's kind of why the baby chick and eggs are used so much around Easter, but it's just their natural cycle. So they're gonna lay lots more eggs in the early spring, late spring, and start slowing down through the summer. And then fall, they'll shut down completely because they start molting. So they're more putting their energy towards feathers. And then they go into dormancy where they just don't lay any eggs through the really cold part of the winter. And then they start laying again. Oyster shell is calcium. And it's a very organic way to make sure that your chickens are getting that extra calcium that they need. If you're buying a layer feed, it's going to have some calcium in there. But having oyster shell available means that they can have a free range of it. They can go and get it if they feel like they need more calcium and they'll use it. And then if they're not using it a lot, then you know that the feed you're giving them, it has a lot of calcium or they're finding calcium other places. A lot of people I know on the internet and different blogs suggest breaking up your eggshells. But in a way, I don't like doing that because I don't know, to me, it always seems like if they're getting used to eating eggshells, will they start eating their eggs? And sometimes they won't and sometimes they will. Eggshells depend on your chickens already having a high calcium level in their body because what they're doing is they're laying the egg, the egg has calcium in it, and then you're breaking up the shell and feeding that back to them. Is that high enough level? You don't know because if your chickens are already depleted in calcium, there's not going to be a lot of calcium in those shells. I just suggest it's very inexpensive. Go ahead and get the oyster shell. You don't have to get the, I buy the 50 pound bag. You don't have to buy the 50 pound bag. I buy it. It lasts for years. It's like 20 bucks, I think. But you can get the smaller ones. Other thing that they need, which is grit. Grit is very important. If you're not free ranging your chickens, you need to make sure that they're having small pebbles to chew on. An oyster shell can be that so that you can fluctuate in between both of those. But just make sure this spring that you're putting out a little extra oyster shell for your chickens or filling it more often so that they are getting the proper amount of calcium they need to lay those delicious eggs for you. Okay, we're talking about permaculture. We're talking about permaculture design and specifically using principles nine through 12 on our homestead. We're going to be talking about a few ideas and defining each of those principles. So now we're ready to talk about principle 10. 10 is what I call use and value diversity. Principle 10 is all about using and valuing diversity. Conventional farming is all about monoculture and many farmers traditionally only grow one or two crops. Permaculture is big on diversity. A diverse system is much less vulnerable to threats like pests, disease, and other problems than a homogeneous one. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. When you grow potatoes and all you grow is potatoes, the pests know exactly where those potatoes are and you're going to have more problems with them. The same with diseases. Potatoes have certain diseases. They're going to go in the ground. So how do you keep growing potatoes in a place that already has problems growing potatoes? Growing diversity, growing... And we talked about this a little bit in Permaculture Principle 8 in the past episode where we talked about diversity in our animals. How we could mob, graze, and we can rotate not only our cows, our horses, our goats, but also our chickens through that same area to create an environment that is like what God lays out. He doesn't make all the deer graze in one area and the birds graze in a different. They each get access to the land because each of them has a benefit that the land is asking for. The same thing can happen in our garden and in our homestead when we're thinking about plants. Last episode, we talked about a food forest. A forest is diverse. There's cover crops. There's trees. There's sub-canopy trees. There's canopy trees. There's bushes. There's tons of layers and different kinds of plants in a forest. So we as growers need to be thinking about diversity. Simply, we cannot always plant the same thing. We ourselves can get stuck in ruts. I know I like to grow red Lissota potatoes and Blue Lake green beans. We are creatures of habit, not only in our gardens, in how we do our chores, in how we function on the earth. Habits can be a good thing, but they also, if taken to extreme, especially on the homestead, they can start causing problems. Maybe a year, you don't grow Blue Lake green beans. You grow purple green beans and you change up the idea of what you're going to grow. Or maybe you can, better yet, grow enough green beans in one year to last you several years so that you're not planting green beans every single year. I know here on our homestead, my garden has changed a lot from what it used to be. When I first was growing, I grew everything. Broccoli, cauliflower, beets. I had a long list of like 20 different fruits and vegetables that I grew because I wanted to try things. I wanted to make sure that my kids, they were younger. I wanted to make sure they were exposed to all the good fruits and vegetables, and especially homegrown. But as time has moved forward, as I've realized that the green beans sit on the shelf for a really long time because nobody really likes them in my family but me, I have changed the way I grow. I don't grow all 20 every single year. I grow a different variety. So this year, I'm really low on green beans. I love green beans. I'm not going to not grow them just because I'm the only one that eats them, but I'm going to put in three beds and I'm going to have green beans for the next two or three years. And I won't have to grow green beans for the next two or three years. Potatoes are a staple that all of my family eats. So yes, we're going to have to grow those every year. But do I have to grow the same kind every year? Another thing is we can do is crop rotation. Crop rotation is a great example of diversity. Yes, there's things that we're going to have to grow every single year like potatoes, onions, celery. But do they have to be grown in the same spot every single year? No, they don't. They can be rotated. Companion planting is also a part of this. I think I talked about companion planting in principle eight, but this is a great way also to create diversity. And you can create diversity by crop rotation. Like say I'm growing three beds of green beans. I don't have to have those three beds of green beans right next to each other. I could have green beans, then I can have potatoes, then I can have onions, and then I can have green beans. I'm creating diversity throughout. I'm still growing the same crop, but I'm creating diversity throughout my garden. Why do we want to do crop rotation? Well, there's two simple benefits to crop rotation. One, you're ensuring that multiple plants are being planted. You're doing different types of plants, right? Because you're not doing your whole garden in potatoes. You're doing potatoes, onions, carrots, celery, those type of things. You're creating diversity. And then you're also rotating those crops to different areas of your garden. Crop rotation also gives diversity to your soil. When a single crop is grown in the same place year after year, the soil then begins to conform to only what is being asked of it. So let me give you an example of that. Let's look at potatoes for an example, because I grow potatoes. Every year you probably grow potatoes. Potatoes are a very easy vegetable to grow. Potatoes need a large amount of potassium because they are a root crop. Potassium is what supports roots. So they need a large amount of potassium because they're a root crop. But also because they're a root crop that grows under the soil, the soil is damaged a little more in a bed that is growing a non-root crop. Think about when you're harvesting your potatoes. You are putting your potato spud fork or your broad fork or whatever you use to dig your potatoes. I use a potato fork. You're lifting the soil and you're turning it. Usually in a no-till system, you're lifting a soil, but you don't turn it because you're trying to get down underneath to those potatoes. A little more air is going to be, not as bad as tilling, but a little more air is going to be brought into the soil. And if you repeatedly do that in the same spot over and over, you're going to be limiting what your soil can do. Now, if you rotate that crop, if you say we'll do beds one, two, three, bed one is potatoes, bed two is carrots, bed three is onions. Those are all three root crops, right? Should they all be put back to back? Probably not. So maybe let's change that up a little bit. We have number one is potatoes. Number two is green beans. Number three is celery. Then we have number four is carrots because it's a root crop again. I harvest the potatoes, are flipped over a little bit. And then that next year, what's coming around to the end? If we only have three, what's coming back to number one? Celery. And then number the next year would be green beans. So that soil gets two years of resting without being completely flipped over before another root crop is put in there. There's many multiple ways. You can look at books and you can get all geeky about it. But the most important thing is you just want to make sure that you are doing it. You want to create that diversity and that you give some time to rest between digging soil crops between each one so that you can protect that soil as well and also create diversity. Another thing that can be, and I think I mentioned it in principle eight, this is an added bonus and I don't think it's in the blog, but you can do succession planting. So not only are you growing potatoes in bed one, but say you harvest your potatoes in July. You still have July and August and a little bit into September to grow something. Maybe you could put a cover crop in there. That'll repair that soil from those potatoes. If you pick a cover crop that puts a lot of carbon in the soil or even replaces that potassium, you're creating balance in the soil. Maybe one great thing is you could, say you're growing corn in one spot. You harvest the corn. It's a short growing season corn. Then you grow peas after it because peas naturally pull nitrogen from the air and put it back in the soil. And corn uses lots of nitrogen. There's other plants that use more nitrogen than just corn. But do you see the idea that you could bring into your garden and into your homestead? Diversity is amazing. So let's talk about principle 11. I call this use edges to find abundance. Principle 11 is where you use edges and you value the margin. In nature, where two different things meet is usually where the most interesting stuff happens. It's usually the most productive and diverse part of a whole system. Think about riverbanks or forest edges. This is where you find a multitude of abundance because you have the benefits of each ecosystem working together. So let's look at the forest. You have the edge of the forest. In the forest where it's darker and we're talking about a mature forest, you're going to have more shade loving plants and things that grow in a forest. But if you come to the edge of the forest, you're not going to only have a few of the shade loving plants, but you're going to get a few of the plants that come from the meadow. The meadow is going to bring in more diversity because a few of those meadow plants are going to be protected with big tall trees and you're going to create more abundance because you're getting both types of plants. You also are creating with more abundance, you're creating more diversity for animals. So a bird that naturally flies over meadows to collect insects, they could make their home on the meadow. But if an edge of a forest was available, then they could put their home inside the forest where it'd be a little bit more protected from the environment and still fly out to the meadow to gather its bugs. Edges are a great part of our ecosystem. They're just amazing. Think about a riverbank, how much abundance you can find there. And you can take advantage of these edges on your homestead. Think about your homestead. What are some edges that you can think of? Well, a very simple edge could be a fence line because you have a fence of permanent structure in between two different pastures. What usually happens on that permanent structure? Well, a lot of the grazing of the animals can't be as harsh there because you have a fence in the way. Another edge that I can think of is, what about trees? We talked about the forest edge, right? What about having just a few trees at the edge of a pasture or in the middle of a pasture? Then you're creating edge inside that pasture. When we talked about food forests, one of the great types of a food forest was called a savanna type. So you can think about the great plains of Africa. You can think about the grasslands of South America. Throughout those places, even the great prairies of the United States, throughout those places, there are little spots of trees. There's little pockets of trees that create abundance, usually located around a pond or some kind of water source, but they create abundance because the tree brings in shade and grass will grow better in shade and animals will navigate closer to shade because they want to get out of the sun. They get shelter from the sun. So there's many different edges that you can do. One great edge, speaking of food forest, one great edge that I like to take advantage of is the fence edge and also finding little pockets of diversity throughout my homestead where I can grow things like a fedge. But a fedge is a food hedge. By creating a hedge along an edge, and I'll say that 10 times fast, you can be creating more abundance. And if you put food into that mix, you are creating a fedge. So one of the things that we talked about in the food forest is there's the savanna type, then there's the mature forest type, and then there's the recovering forest type. So I've kind of made a, I think it's, I think it would be a recovering forest type, but I've used the idea of my fence line along my yard to plant some apple trees and a few bushes underneath. And this year I'm planning on putting in a few perennials. I think strawberries are going to be planted in there. I'm creating abundance along that edge, which normally along a fence line, it's hard to mow, it's hard to weed eat, it's hard to do all those things. So instead I am growing food. I'm growing a fedge. And if you want to learn more about developing a fedge around your homestead or even food forest and things, be sure to check out the show notes because I will include those links as well. Another edge that can be utilized on the homestead is the garden edge. Picture your garden, right? You've just planted all your vegetables in the garden. It's been a few weeks, now it's time to weed. Have you noticed that the weeds along the edge of your garden are growing a lot faster and are almost growing just as fast as your produce inside the garden because that edge is getting two benefits. It's getting some of the compost that you put on those beds is leaching into the edge of the garden. Also, if you're using overhead water, which I use here on the homestead because I use well water, I've tried to use drip line. I really have tried, but it just clogs up too much. I'm watering those edges. So that grass, those weeds, or whatever's growing along the edge of my garden is flourishing just as equally as my garden is because it's getting the benefits. One benefit that it's getting is I'm not taking care of it. I'm not in there weeding that area. I'm looking at my rows of peas and I see the little weeds in it and I pick all those, but I don't notice the weeds on the edge of the garden as quickly because that's not my focus. I'm not growing there. But should we not be growing there? That's a perfect place that we could be growing and not only growing weeds or grasses, we could be growing food. We could be growing perennials. Along my garden, I grow several different perennials. My patch of asparagus grows along the edge. It's not completely up against the fence, but it's pretty close. And in fact, on the other side of that, I plan on putting some raspberry bushes this year right along the fence line. I'm putting the cardboard underneath the fence so that I'm blocking, you know, the grass that just grows up in the fence and you can't weed eat it because then your weed eater hits the fence. And then I'm growing raspberries right there along the edge. I'm creating a bed right along the edge of my garden so that one, perennials are low maintenance, right? Not going to have to weed them as much. Perennials, you're going to be able to use mulch and really mulch in those beds and not have to think about the weeds as much. They're going to need to be weeded a little bit, but they're going to be growing something you want there instead of a weed. A weed is any plant, any plant, that is growing where you don't want it to grow. Another thing that I grow on the edge of my garden is roses. When I talked about permaculture connections, permaculture principle number seven talks about connections on the homestead or making connections between the different parts of your homestead to unite things on your homestead, like pigs being raised next to the garden because the garden can feed the pigs and the pigs can feed the garden. Or my chicken coop is directly in the middle of my garden. Do I have to pack weeds and things way off to somewhere else? No, I can just feed them to my chickens very quickly. So having those kinds of connections. But what I'm getting here too is that connections are used with you and me as well. We are connected to our homestead. We are part of our homestead. And when we design our homestead, we need to include ourselves. Because if we're not a person who likes to haul water all the way to the edge of our homestead, then we're going to have to think about ways to get water there without hauling it. So roses make that connection to me and my garden. A garden can be seen as something that is always just fruits and vegetables, but you can also use it for joy. You can use it for happiness. Roses are happiness to me. I love walking by them. I love taking care of them. I love including them in my garden. I love bringing cuttings inside and smelling the roses. And they can be a perennial that can be placed on that edge to create joy, to create happiness for me. Plus it creates happiness for bees because then it brings in more pollinators, of course, is the other benefit. Perennials are great to put on the edges of your garden because they are low maintenance and give you a continued abundance through the years. And if you plant something that gives you joy as well, you're going to be creating that kind of abundance too. Don't forget about yourself when you are designing your homestead and using permaculture principles because we are part of the grand plan. We're going to get to principle 12 in just a moment, but now it is time for the Growing With God segment of this episode where you and I dive into the Bible and learn more and build that relationship with our Lord and Savior. We're going to be continuing our series on growing confidence with our Lord and we're going to dip back into Ephesians. Now, if you want to get into a whole series we did on Ephesians, make sure you check out the beginning of this season, season six and into season five where we went through chapter two, three, and then back to one. And we're going to continue Ephesians in a few weeks, but I just wanted to stop and have this little series about building confidence with the Lord. Today, we're going to be reading out of Ephesians three, verse 12. In him and through faith in him, we may approach God with freedom and confidence. I'm going to read that one more time. In him and through faith in him, we may approach God with freedom and confidence. I ask you, I'm going to read 13. I ask you, therefore, not to be discouraged because of my suffering for you, which are your glory. In our Bible study that we did a few weeks ago on Ephesians, I told you that the Ephesian chapter, the Ephesian book was letters wrote to the Ephesian church by Paul. Here he is reiterating to the church saying that Jesus is the way. He is the truth. He is the way. And when we believe in him and have faith in him, we may approach God with confidence and freedom. Freedom from this world. Freedom. We are breaking the chains from sin. We are breaking away and we are free. We also have confidence. Confidence that Jesus and God are going to do what they say they're going to do. And we have to remember that during this time, a lot of the church of the early church were Pharisees and Sadducees who were trying to relearn a few things. Now, how did a person become a Pharisee or a Sadducee? And that was because they memorized the Bible. They knew the Old Testament from all of the current Bible that was wrote. And the more they knew, the higher they rank. In fact, Paul himself was Saul and he was a Pharisee. So he knew the Bible. He knew it very deeply. So he's talking about here that we need to break away from a lot of the things that the world says that we need to be Christians. Break away from the thought that our sins don't get us there and only our works do. Away from the thought that we've got to be timid, be weak and not stand up for our rights, not stand up for what we believe in. It also is talking about that we can approach God. When we believe in God, we are given the Holy Spirit. We're also given grace, grace from our sins. And when Jesus came, the purpose of him coming was to wipe sin away. Even in the very beginning part of the Bible in Genesis, when Adam and Eve and God were walking in the garden, before they ate of the fruit, they were cleansed of sin. They could walk in the garden with God. Once they chose to eat from the tree of good and bad, they learned about sin and got the stain of sin. We have the stain of sin. But when Jesus came, he has wiped that away so that when we go and we believe in God and we go to heaven, that sin is no longer there. We can go and be with God. We can have that confidence that we can approach him. We can come to his throne. It even says in John that Jesus will be sitting right at the side of God and he will be our mediator, our person in between. I just want you to think about this week that you, in your belief in God, you are already free. You are already given the courage to approach our Lord and Savior. And the confidence, you now have the confidence to talk directly to him and include him in your growing journey. Okay, we are continuing to talk about permaculture, permaculture principles, specifically 9 through 12. And now it's time to talk about 12. Change is inevitable. This is my little nickname for principle 12. Principle 12 is all about creatively using and responding to change. Change is inevitable. By making careful observations and then stepping in at the right time, we can make a positive outcome based on change instead of negative ones. We as growers, we as homesteaders, we as mothers, as stewards of the soil, we're working in an unpredictable world because we go through seasons, the weather is not under our control, and we have to just move forward even though we don't want to. Even though things might go completely and utterly wrong, we as growers still need to move forward because we as growers, our main job besides being a steward to the soil is our job needs to flow. Our job needs to move with the changes. We need to be able to be flexible. And I know being flexible can be hard. I've gone through times where being flexible was just not what I wanted to be. I remember a few years ago when I had a sudden hailstorm and it wiped out my whole garden. I felt devastated, completely devastated. But as growers, as stewards of the soil, we have to be able to see that, yes, things like that are going to happen, but we also have to see that the sun comes up, that there's always a good side to all the things that happen. That hailstorm hit my garden, I could have moaned about the loss of abundance, which I did, or I could have moaned about the wasted hard work, which I did. And I could have dwelled in my loss, which I did. It's okay to do that, but it's also our job as growers to keep moving forward, to keep putting that one foot right in front of each other, letting go of the past. One of the greatest things that farmers are known for is that next year will be better, and next year will always be better because the Lord says that he will continue the earth, you know, the sun will keep rising, the sun will keep setting, the earth is going to keep moving forward, and we as growers need to follow suit. It's going to be okay to feel sad. I wrote a whole poem about that hailstorm, and I got it off my chest, and I found a way to work through it. I found a way to work through it with my family, through a few Bible verses and things, but one of the easiest ways that you're going to get through it is that you're going to see that the path of a grower is unpredictable, and there's nothing we can do about it being unpredictable. There's nothing that we can do to prevent something, to change something, and we have to realize that if that hailstorm hits, if that crop gets turned under, or we mess up and pick our green beans at the wrong time, I've done that before, it's going to be okay because God has a plan, you have a plan, and the plan is always going to bring you good. It may, you may not be feeling it right at that moment. You may not be even thinking about getting back on that horse. You know, it's just a saying that we say here on the ranch that my father always instilled in me that if a horse fucks you off, yes, it's going to hurt for a little while, and it's okay to feel that hurt, but it's not okay to give up. It's not okay to not get back on that horse. It's not okay to not get back on your growing journey because out of that tragedy of my garden being completely destroyed, I could have dwelled and stayed on that path of sorrow and been completely devastated, which I was for a while, but the grower in me wouldn't stay there. It wanted to move forward, and the grower in others didn't want me to stay there. That was the one great benefit that I got out of that tragedy was that the others around me, the community of growers around me had a chance to step up. They had a chance to not only be growers, but to instill one of the greatest principles of permaculture, which is fair share and taking care of people and taking care of the earth, they took care of me. They gave me part of their produce. They even, some people even sold me part of their produce at a very reasonable price. My neighbors said, oh man, I'm so sorry that you lost that. I have an overabundance of this. Would you like some? Family reached out to me and said, hey, I've got a bunch of corn. Would you come pick some so you can have some for your garden? We still had a full larder that year and it wasn't because of my hard work. It was because of the kindness and hard work of others. And all of that is still part of permaculture. All of that is still part of being a Christian and following God's plan. When you have abundance, you reach out to help others. When you don't have enough, others reach out to you. And that was a lesson that I had to learn. I had to learn that growing a garden was not all about me. That growing a garden was not all about me doing all of the hard work. Growing a garden was about stewardship. It's about helping others. It's about giving to others. I grow a garden to feed my family. I grow a garden to spend time out in God's nature. I grow a garden to feed others. I grow a garden for so many other reasons. And when we sit there and focus on only the things that we can control, we can't move forward. So this principle really wants you to think about that. And one way that we can move forward is we can be ready for change. We can accept that the world is unpredictable. We can accept that the hailstorms will come, that the frost may arrive early. We can accept that those things are beyond our control. But we can also accept that there are some things that we can control. And that comes down to a plan. We can make a plan to get through some of those troubles. Even though I experienced this just a few months ago, I had a plan. I, one of my breeding does, one of my dairy does, I have a small dairy here on the homestead. She was scheduled to kid in April. I thought it was in April. I, the buck, I saw him in action in April. I know I pulled the cedar in March, where she would kid in March, but I knew it's gotta be April. So I wrote down the plan that it was April. That's still something that's unpredictable. I don't know exactly when that's gonna happen, but I still made the plan of getting my kitting box ready, of getting the pen ready, of making sure that I had all the things that I needed in case she kitted early or anytime. I had all the utensils. I had all the needles and the syringes and the vitamins and the molasses and all the things that go into my kitting kit. I had the extra towels all put in a spot. So when it happened, when it happened early, completely three weeks early, because I completely miscalculated, I could have freaked out, which I did for like five, 10 minutes because I was in complete shock. But then the plan took action. What is the first step I need to do? I need to weigh these babies. I need to get iodine on their umbilical cord. I need to give them their vitamin shots. I need to give mom her molasses water. I need to do this. I need to do that. Everything moved forward. And it was because I had that plan. So we can still make plans. We can still make goals. In fact, one of the first episodes in this series talks about making goals on the homestead because we can make big dreams and we can make, have all these big ideas about what we want to do on our homestead. But if we don't make goals and we don't make a plan of getting to that goal, we're not going to achieve it. Now, with that being said, a plan is a roadmap. It is a way of getting somewhere. But that doesn't mean that roadmap is not going to have mountains and valleys. No, it's going to have those. But it's still a roadmap. Your growing journey is going to have ups and downs, but it's also going to have detours and it's going to have road construction. I'm talking about road, a road kind of example here. Because you as a grower are going to also have two things as your guide. You're not only going to have your map and maybe the map isn't going to go directly to the spot because you've hit road construction or you have to take a detour, but it's going to get there. And you have God. God is always going to be working for you for the good. And when we take our growing journey or the designs we're going to have for our homestead and think about it from that direction, we are going to be prepared for the change. We are going to be prepared for what the world brings us, what weather turns up. I still have beautiful baby girl dolings from that birth. I still have all of those things that may not have happened at the time that I wrote down on the calendar, but it still happened. I still move forward with the plan. I still use all the things that I had ready. And you yourself are going to need to do that and be prepared for something to go awry, some kind of change, because the world changes. You and I change. I mean, we change our mind probably 20, 30 times a day. So I think you know what change is like, but with a plan, with God's guidance, you're going to be able to move forward in building this permaculture homestead of your dreams. So that wraps up this episode about permaculture principles 9 through 12. We have another installment coming where we're going to be bringing all of these ideas together, bringing in some guidelines to help you really think about making those big goal dreams, making a plan, and moving forward with it. So I want to thank you for joining me in this installment of the Ultimate Homesteading Design Guide Series and here at the Pray Displant Podcast. And I just want you to remind you that permaculture design can feel like a daunting venture, but by looking at God's design, you can find the keys to bringing it to your homestead. So again, I want to thank you for joining me. And if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to comment below or go to my show notes and put your comments there.
