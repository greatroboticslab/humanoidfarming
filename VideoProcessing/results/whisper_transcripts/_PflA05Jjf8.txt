 What do you sell here? If I was still farming like my grandfather. Everybody knew my grandfather. He was a legend. My dad didn't take on the farm and then my grandfather had to sell it. And I don't think he had this cart here. I could do the farming thing, but I don't have a farm. If I was still farming, I'd be able to buy this cart. I am qualified. I was thinking about the other day, my grandfather was like, do you guys have a popcorn stand or anything like that? He was telling me this one time, he went to this restaurant. The fact that you give out pens and like, and the waitress came up and he's like, I want some steak and eggs. I just love this, this agriculture. I mean, you guys are the backbone of what's going on. And in the coffee, I don't think he had creamer. Actually the creamer was not really. Oh, Hey, Larry, Larry. Hey guys, Nick Welker here from Welker farms. I'm at the big iron farm show. We are going to have a great time. So anyways, guys, some of the food here at the show is some of the best stuff. Oh, you gotta kid me. Okay. All right. Yeah. So if you really want to check us out. Um, so I'll show you guys real quick how this thing works. Yeah. Actually, you stay right there real quick. So I'm here at the ready booth with Jennifer. So I'm Lisa. So you guys are on YouTube. Yeah. That's cute. So equipment here is huge guys. This is the meter roller. So, uh, you guys do what again? Right now it's at least five times bigger than the nearest machine on our neighbor's farm. So anyways, I'm just going to go ahead and spend some time showing you guys a little bit around their booth and show you what I think is cool and maybe what's not cool and what I think you guys should not worry about and get. So let's get a shot. And the product comes down into your roller, which then distributes it at a certain rate. Just realized this is a great lighting right now for a selfie. So we're hopefully going to spend some time over at the perfect. There we go. Oh, new. Oh, you know what? I better just send that out right now. So I see you're doing some bearings in the closing alarm pivots. Where are you buying these from? Coyo, Pier, Timken, KRP. Hey, so I see you're interested in a conveyor here. I'm looking for stainless steel parts for my seed master. Do you have a deer? No, seed master. Oh, okay. We don't make one yet. It's quite long enough for you. How long till I be able to get one? It's going to be a while. Do you have any of this stuff for seed masters? No. I have a blockage system for you. I'm sorry to disappoint. We actually don't for your seed master, but I got a great blockage monitor I can sell you. Could I write your name down? No, that's all right. All right. How about I just grab you a bucket? We appreciate you stopping in. Yay! Hey! All right. We're at Big Iron here. We got school coming up and we need to get our free stuff. All right? Everybody ready? Hands in. Free on three. One, two, three. Free! Oh, so are you giving out buckets? Yeah, you got an air seeder? I don't, but I'll walk around and advertise for you. All right. And would these guys be able to have one too? All right. All right. We're going to have this little auger we have here. That'd be a really sweet thing to have if only I was a farmer. Oh, you're not a farmer. No. Oh, okay. Yeah. Hey, how did we do today? Oh, great job. Oh, great job. Hey, you did pretty good too. I wonder if they have anything faster. Hey, are those flags for sale? What? Are those flags for sale? Yeah. Hey, I'll take two of them. Throw them in the back. All right. Don't worry about scratching it. It's a rattle. Wait. Jenny, do you have your hair help? Have you there? Oh, we've got him to drop off the top. Come on. Let's go. Oh. Oh. grooming. Yeah. SavageRA outputs. Let's see you later. Oh. That's got to go back. Larry. Larry. Larry. Hey, buddy. Good to see you, bud. Seriously. I want to show you the picture of the friend that you... Larry! Larry buddy! Just look how many people are out here. Isn't this amazing? I bet they're all here for my autograph too. Don't I know you from somewhere? I don't think I've ever met you. No one has anything for me.
