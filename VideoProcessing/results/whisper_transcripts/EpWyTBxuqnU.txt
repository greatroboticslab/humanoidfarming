 Suggestions a £100 million straw-powered energy plant could receive extensive funding from the government has been met with criticism. The East Anglian Daily Times reports how local livestock farmers are unhappy with the news that Mendeltschom renewable energy plant could be given £20 million a year. If the site is given the go-ahead, the funding would be paid annually over a 20-year period as part of a government incentive to build renewable energy plants. However, partner at Blythburgh Free Range Pigs, Jimmy Butler, claimed such a move would be totally unfair as other farmers receive no subsidy. Mr Butler warned the new energy plant could kill off the local pig and poultry industries in Suffolk and East Anglia, as the lack of straw in the area would disrupt many livestock farms. You could save up to £1,300 a year on your commercial energy bills. Visit energyhelpline.com or call us on 0800 008 7772.
