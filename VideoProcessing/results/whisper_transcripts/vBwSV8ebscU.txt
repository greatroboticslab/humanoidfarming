 Here's the truth about biodiesel. Both petroleum-based diesel and soy-based biodiesel will get you from point A to point B. We all know that. The difference is that only biodiesel starts and ends in rural America. Biodiesel starts in our soil. Soybean oil, the primary feedstock for biodiesel, comes from soybeans grown right here by America's farmers. After the soybeans are harvested, they will be crushed and processed in the meal and oil at a local crusher. The soybean meal will be used for animal feed and the oil will be used to make a variety of products, including cooking oil. The excess oil will be taken to a refinery where it's turned into biodiesel. The oil goes through a chemical reaction when methanol, a catalyst, and heat are added. Glycerin is separated and used for many different uses, including soap and animal feed. Then the finished biodiesel is blended with diesel fuel and shipped to distributors across the nation. It's then used by retail stations, farm co-ops, municipalities, and more. Even farmers who help support their soybeans every time they fill their tanks. Then the whole renewable cycle repeats when soybeans are planted again next spring. Biodiesel is a sustainable, environmentally friendly, advanced biofuel. Good for farmers. Good for local economies. Good for America. Learn more about biodiesel at biodiesel.org.
