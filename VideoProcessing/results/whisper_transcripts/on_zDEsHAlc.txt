 project Brinkerhoffs have the first cutting on the ground. Looks like it's going to be a good first cutting for 2017. This field we're moving on to right now is planted into corn that they'll chop for silage later this fall and use to feed their calves when they wean them. Background them in their 500 head feedlot. It's just starting to come up now. Looks like it's all come up. Might be a good year here. This is another alfalfa field at the Brinkerhoff ranch that's been cut and will be raked here shortly and failed soon thereafter. I believe there's just cut today. It's pretty good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
