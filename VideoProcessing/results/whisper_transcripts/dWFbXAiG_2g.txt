 Watch as relentless machines and vigilant safety measures transform hay bales nonstop. Constantly in this press runs 24 hours a day. So we are in the hay press building now. It all starts to the forklift loading the blocks onto the shelf here. This feeds them over onto the unstacker. This grabs them, lifts up the upper two halves and the bottom two go over in towards the part that pulls all the twine off. But once those bales come from the unstacker, they come in here. This machine pulls the pline off of it and these poles right here, by the way, which on Jesse, these right here are light beams. So if anybody crosses the beams, the beauty thing is touching the whole machine down. So there's no way someone can reach into the machine and use, wow, it's ridiculous.
