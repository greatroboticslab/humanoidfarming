 The telephone poles that were holding it up were moving at the base of the ground and okay this is no longer safe. I don't know that you ever really get to profit. No, so we are handling our breeding and we're finishing because we wanted to fully control our genetics and our inputs from day one. With 100% grass fed, with south poles, it's a two-year process. Quickly like feedlot in the conventional side, they're usually able to do that at nine to ten months of age. So they're utilizing byproduct and soy and corn to get them fat and get them fat really quickly and that's how they're shortening their time to get their profit. Direct from the farmer anywhere from 35 to 5,000 a piece but I think you can see that little newborn calf in the back over there. We have to schedule out all of our butcher dates one to two years in advance. So I not only had the investment in raising that duck to a laying point but now it's just gone and I'm not getting the eggs off of it. Very loud chicken over here. We woke up one morning and they were gone and we spent all day searching for them. Couldn't find anything, couldn't find a track, nothing. And you guys Airbnb this out? We do, yes. We go and hit camp as well. And so we try not to really live off of that a whole lot and we utilize more of our camping and things like that as more of our... Your living expenses. Yeah. Good morning guys. Today we are just outside of Murfreesboro, Tennessee over here at Brass Horn Coffee. I'm getting our morning coffee. About to head down to a farm about 30 minutes from here called Crossing Creeks Farms. They, from what I understand, they raise grass-fed beef, heritage pigs, poultry, and probably a lot more than that. But they have agreed to let us come and take a tour of the farm, give us some behind the scenes of their operation. It should be really fun. And it's a bit of a special trip as well because my family and I, we're actually taking a trip from Greenville, South Carolina, all the way to Waco, Texas, to go see the eclipse that's coming up here in just a few days. And so as we make our way over, we're stopping to see a couple farms along the way and do some farm tours and some videos for you guys. So yeah, if you're excited for taking a look at some of the behind the scenes on that, stay tuned. Today should be great, should be informative. But yeah, we'll be there in just a little bit. All right. media do Thank you. All right, guys, we just arrived here at Crossing Creek Farms. Elizabeth is one of the owners. She's going to give us the grand tour today. But man, check out this beautiful property they have. It is something else. Look at this. This is just gorgeous. And I think the name actually comes from the fact that we had to cross two creeks to get in here. Put two bridges over some beautiful creeks down there. I'll try to get some footage of in a little bit. But apparently they bought this property and it didn't even have access. And they've kind of done all of this since they got started. So I think this is going to be a really cool episode. I'm excited to hear more about their story and more about their farming practices. This is their cool little farm store right here. Looks really nice inside. I'm sure you guys will get a peek at that in just a few. But yeah, Crossing Creek Farms out in Middle Tennessee. If you're ever out here, definitely, definitely come out here and take a look at it. All right. Stay tuned. I want to change the small and ten lot of juice to pinch a lot. Hello. Hey. Hi. I know. Look at this. How are you guys? Good. How are you? How are you? Are you coming? Are you going to make it? Hi. This is my wife, Jackie. Hey, Jackie. I'm Elizabeth. Well, super nice to meet you. So nice to meet you. Thank you again for having us. Yeah, thanks for coming out. For sure. Yeah, this is great. So, yeah. So this is the farm store. This is the farm store. This is my dad back here. Oh, nice. Reed. Hey, sir. How's it going? So it's my parents live here on the farm with my husband and I and our boys. And so we all started the farm together over a decade ago. Wow. And so, yeah, this is our farm store where we sell all of our products direct to consumer as well as a lot of other local like-minded products and other just convenient items that are cleaner ingredients, more organic-minded, holistic kind of things. Okay. So, yeah. So not everything in here you guys are producing yourself. Some of it's from other cooperative farms and that kind of thing? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So we do almost everything that's in the case here, the freezer case here. Obviously, we're not doing the jumbo shrimp or the salmon. Sure. That's coming from a fisherman in Alaska. Oh, wow. But all of the take and bakes are coming out of our commercial kitchen. We do bone broths. They're made with our bones. All the meats are here. So we do beef, pork, chicken, turkey, and chicken eggs. Oh, wow. Year-round. And the stores open year-round. And then we have local organically grown vegetables that are in here seasonally. Okay. Lettuce, microgreens, carrots, things like that. And then we have a bath and body section. Oh, very cool. The soaps are made with our cow's milk. The dish soap's made with our tallow as well as the face bar is made with our tallow as well. So we have local handmade candles made of beef wax and things of that. That's super cool. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, this is like. Is that my alley? We, hey girls, make sure you're being careful. Yeah. This is our dream. Like, this is, that's one of the cool things about doing this. Yeah. You guys are only our second farm that we toured. We have, like I told you, we have one more tomorrow in Memphis. And then on the way back, we're going to try again for pots. Yeah. And then that guy, Bill Allen. Yeah. And then I have like a handful this summer. But this is the coolest thing because we are, the multi-generational farm thing is the vision. Yeah. As I'm sure you're well aware, it's very expensive to buy land nowadays. Totally expensive. And so. Well, and not just the land. And, you know, obviously when we bought our land 10, 11 years ago, it was cheaper than it was now. Yeah. But it was still expensive for us to go into. Sure. But then the overhead of farming in general, especially to do livestock and the larger size of doing beef, the overhead is much larger because the infrastructure is needed. You're needed. You need a full size cattle barn and shoots and trucks and trailers and all of those things where you start with chickens. Yes, there is still expense in providing a chicken coop, but it's much lower than starting with beef. We usually don't recommend people start with beef. But that's what we jumped into head first. So y'all jumped straight into beef. We did. Oh my goodness. We did. Yes. But my husband and I both were kind of out of the horse industry. And so we were more comfortable with large animals. Got it. That's kind of our niche. That's kind of what we do. And so large animals was more easier for us to just walk into because we had a large animal experience. Okay. And I went to school for agriculture and so that was, I had had cattle experience and things like that. So that was where we were more comfortable with. I see. And that was what we needed first for ourselves. So we were looking for 100% grass fed, grass finished beef. And at the time in the area, we just couldn't find it. So we actually started it in beef about 15 years ago before we started, before we had the land. Oh wow. My dad invested in registered South Pole cattle, beef cattle. And we, we leased a family friend's farm in Cookville, Tennessee. So it's a good, ended up being like a good hour and a half ish from here. Okay. And so he helped us manage and learn and, and start. He didn't have regenerative farming experience, but he had grown up farming. And so we got to kind of learn with him. And he, he really helped guide us in the beginning with things and whatnot. So we did that before we actually had our farm. Then we got the land, how to fix all the fencing, watering systems, electricity for fencing, get all of that infrastructure up and then move the herd down here. I see. So that was kind of a little bit of like a segue for you guys to where you're jumping in the deep end, but not like with no float or anything. You had some experience and a little bit of knowledge that helped you get this thing off the ground. Is that, is that like a forward assessment? Yeah. Yeah. Kind of for sure. Like it was a way we knew we needed to start and we knew that, um, while we were, it actually took us a long time to find the property that we could afford in the size that we could afford it. Um, and so in those years it was a, okay, let's just start somewhere. And so, um, we started with that initial investment and just a small foundation herd of heifers and a bull and what's a, what's a small foundational herd of heifers? Um, for us, I mean, that's, that's different for everyone and depending on what you have to invest and how much land you have to put towards it. But I think we initially, I think my dad initially bought 10 to 15 heifers and one bull. Um, so it was decent. It wasn't like we just started with two or three. It was, it was a decent size, but we weren't buying like a hundred. Yeah. Um, we, we, we knew we were going to have to breed up to the numbers that we needed because we could not make that huge, huge investment where we needed to be initially. So just kind of bought a nice small group of foundational, um, heifers that, um, and then a bull and they were bred. And so, um, started over on that family friend's farm, which was a huge blessing to us to be able to have a place to go to start. And so we did that for a few years, which also gave us that freedom. When we did purchase this, um, we weren't necessarily in a rush to re, to immediately bring the cattle here. Got it. This needed a lot of work when we got here. There weren't any, there was one old barn and miles and miles of barbed wire. And we knew we didn't want barbed wire fencing. So we took it all down by hand and spent every weekend doing it out in the cold and everything. And I heard that, um, I read on the website that you guys didn't even have access over the creeks. We didn't even have access. There wasn't even a driveway in. Wow. So we actually, if it flooded, we could drive through the creeks if it was dry enough. But if it was, if it, if they were full, we couldn't drive through them. You were stuck. And our neighbor was kind enough to let us use her bridge and driveway. There was still kind of a, um, uh, at the time she, she owned the 30 acres next to us and it used to be one whole farm, one whole track. And so there was still an access way up, but I had a way to go through the pastures to get up here. Um, and, uh, so yeah, so, so now last spring we had the opportunity to, to purchase, um, that 30, she passed away. Um, she was a wonderful neighbor and, um, she wanted to see it go to us, which was so kind. And so we were able to have the opportunity to purchase it. So now it's all back into one, one track. It's also that you guys do hosting for like RVs. Is that, that's pretty neat. How's that been? It's been really cool. Uh, it's been a huge blessing to the farm. Uh, it actually was a big chunk of helping us get my husband here full, full time. Really? Um, he farmed off what we farm full time and he worked full time in Nashville and commercial construction. Oh, wow. So, um, it, uh, it was a, a big part of making this profitable enough that we could actually feed ourselves. Okay. So. Now do y'all do that through like Airbnb or? We've done Airbnb and Hip Camp. Uh, we're part of Harvest Host. Uh, but most of our bookings currently are going through Camp Spot. So whether it's from our website or from Camp Spot, you can find our RV sites. Very cool. We have a handful of just really nice premium RV sites. And then we also have a open air cabins, uh, that are seasonal, um, that are really kind of fun, fun, different stay. And then we're working on finishing up an Airbnb house on the farm, which we've not actually announced yet, but it's almost done. All right, guys, keep that on the down low. Yeah. It's not there yet, but we're, we're really close. Hopefully this month we'll finish it up and have it live. Okay. Very cool. Yeah. Well, um, I guess we can, uh, follow you around and yeah, see what we get into. Okay. Sounds good. They've been cooped up in the car so much. Oh yeah. I'm sure they're just, they're enjoying it. Totally ready to play something. So I see like, you know, there's all, all the structures, the barns and that kind of thing. Did you guys put all this here? Was any of it here before when y'all first got here? It wasn't here where there was no homes. There was an old barn that we remodeled and used as long as we could, um, for several years. And then eventually the telephone poles that were holding it up, we're moving at the base of the ground. And so we said, okay, this is no longer safe, but we had to have like a hay barn. We had to have a cattle barn. Those all didn't happen at once. Those happened as we had the cashflow for them. Okay. Um, that part is more recent, which is our horseback riding facility where lessons are done, uh, Monday through Saturday. And, uh, so that was our most recent add on, but it's all just kind of came as we could do it. Sure. Um, and there were a couple of years where we didn't have a shoot, a cattle shoot here and it was challenging to do our operation and do it well. And so what is a cattle shoot? Um, the cattle shoot would be, um, well, right here, actually, this is the back part of it here. This is the tub. And then the shoot is going up that direction. And so this is kind of the backside of where we hold all of our extra things. But in here is our working, um, facility for the cattle. Uh, so a couple of times a year, we need to bring the cows up. We have a scale here on this platform. Oh, wow. So they can come in and we can get a weight on them. They go through it to the head catch, which is where we can get an ear tag on them, which is our identification for who they are. Um, we can do an overall health check and, uh, we also can band, uh, would castrate. Okay. Bulls that need to become steers, those sorts of things. Um, and so to be able to have a place to safely handle them, this is also where we can load them, um, safely from field to trailer for if they're going to butcher or they're being sold as heifers or whatever it may be. Um, we, we've got to have some kind of facility to, to handle them. They're large animals. Yeah. You know, it's not like a chicken where we're just going to pick them up and go. You just going to pick them up and take them in. So, um, so this is, this has been a huge blessing to have, but there, in the beginning and the first few years we were just scrappy and did it without it. Just chasing them around and trying to wrangle them up. It was really challenging to take panels and kind of get them into where you need them to be, corral them where you need them to be. So this helps like basically just bring them into single file and then you guys can lead them and guide them through this process. Yeah. Most of them, once they've gone through it once or twice, they, uh, once they've gone through it once or twice, they kind of know the drill and, uh, South poles are great. They're super docile. Okay. Um, so they're easy to work with. They are not overly crazy for the most part, but, um, we just got done. Same with our spring session. So they've already been, uh, through here and any calves from last year have been weighed, made sure their tags are on properly, that we know exactly who's who keeping track of who's who's challenging. They all look the same. I see. Okay. And who do they go with? Who's their mom? All those kinds of things. So, um, yeah, that's what this, this barn is for is, is that, but. Okay. Now, one of the things I'm curious about, so like for cattle, what is the life cycle for how you guys, I think if I understood right, you started with the herd and then you breed them to build your herd up. And then, um, just kind of take us through, uh, if you don't mind what it looks like to raise cattle to the point of what, you know, how do you get to profit? That kind of thing. Sure. So, um, I don't know that you ever really get to profit. No. That's what I hear from farmers. Yeah. Um, so for on the, so we're, we're doing a cat was considered a cow calf operation. So we are handling our breeding and we're finishing. So a lot of farms aren't doing both. A lot are maybe they're, they're buying calves from a cow to calf operation and they're finishing them out to beef or they are the cow to calf operation. And they're selling to a beef finisher. We do both because we wanted to fully control our genetics and our inputs from day one. Okay. Um, but that limits the amount of beef that we can produce because part of our land is being taken up by our breeders. So, um, but we also have double-sided income happening. So we do beef with a hundred percent grass fed with South poles. It's a two year process from birth. Okay. So, um, so to kind of put that in perspective, typically like feedlot in the conventional side, they're usually able to do that at nine to 10 months of age, get to the same weight that we have to do in two years to do on a natural hundred percent grass fed diet. Um, so they're utilizing by-product and soy and corn to get them fat and get them fat really quickly. Um, and that's how they're shortening their time to get their profit. Um, so that is, that's what it takes for us to do on the beef side of it. Um, as far as longevity on our, our cows or our moms, um, some of those original heifers that my dad bought 15 years ago are pregnant right now. I'm going to have babies. Oh, wow. So that's the beauty of South poles. That's not in every breed. Um, but South poles were breeding for longevity. We want, so it may be an initial, very expensive, feels like it's very expensive startup to buy those heifers, but it's because our goal is that they are with you for a really long time. So they can continue breeding for quite a while. Okay. Yeah. And it's well on the bull side as well. And we have bulls that are easily breeding 10 years and up, um, without any problem. But our moms stay with us for quite a while. So, um, if you don't mind me asking, what does, um, a typical, like for one South pole heifer, what does that cost to like when you got started? Constantly different. Okay. Um, they're really, really popular right now. So, uh, and they have been for the last few years and that's great that the breed is gaining traction. Sure. Um, they're smaller. They're, they're meant to, um, they're meant to be that long, that long-term animal for you, but they are going anywhere from just direct from the farm or anywhere from 35 to 5,000 a piece. But then upwards, upwards at auctions, they're, you know, they're getting, they're getting up there at auctions. So it's an investment to, to start with them. But the goal is that they're with you long-term. So you're not constantly turning. What's more expensive is me turning over heifers. Heifer is a heifer because she doesn't know what she's always doing. And so I would, I have such value in my older moms who know what they're doing. They get pregnant every year. They have a baby every year. They know how to raise their little babies. They know how to raise them. They're teaching the young ones. They're teaching the heifers how to raise their babies. They're quite a family unit out there. That's cool. And so, um, there's, there's a, there's worth in that. Mm-hmm. Um, and a lot of people are switching to South Poles that have done other breeds because they see the value of that. Okay. Of, Hey, I'm not, and we don't pull calves. Like we're not pulling calves. They should be able to do that all on their own. I don't want to be out there handling that, you know, that's time and money for me to be out there doing that. So they take care of their calves. They take care of their calves. We just had the first one of the season drop this morning. So maybe we can go check it out. Yeah. That'd be awesome. Yeah. Very cool. Yeah. Well, um, okay. So if I'm doing that math, right, it's tens of thousands of dollars with just in cattle when you guys first got started, not to not even considering the land and the infrastructure costs and all of that. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. So you have your land costs. You have several, several thousands of dollars into starting up a foundation herd. We have a little bit more in that because we chose to go with South Pole. We've done our research and that was what we were wanting to do. We wanted something that was more heat tolerant. They're built to, um, withstand the, the heat of the South of the South. Okay. And so that was a big one. Plus they're bred to fully manage themselves on grass alone. So they're, they've got stronger grass genetics than other breeds. Um, so they'll hold better at their weights. They'll forage better than other breeds. And so for us, that was an investment worth our wild to have something that was needed less of our time, hands on. Um, again, like I said, we don't intervene with calving. They just drop them and we go, Oh, look, there's a cute calf. That's so crazy. Wow. We're not doing anything real hands on with them in that regard. That's, that's really cool. Is that your husband over there? Yes. So that's Shane out there. Um, it looks like he just got done unrolling a round roll of hay. Grass season's just starting up for us. Um, so they're still on hay for right now as we are trying to get some growth on the grasses. Gotcha. Um, so he just unrolled a bale for the hemp for them to munch on. And, but that group over there is our moms. Okay. And I think you can see that little newborn calf in the, in the back over there. Oh yeah. He'd be the only one out there right now, but. Okay. We're just. Is that the one that you said was born today? He was born this morning. Yeah. This morning. Wow. And I'm actually not sure if it's a boy or girl. I haven't heard yet. Okay. All right. Gender reveal. Yeah. Love it. Big gender reveal party. Um, so as we're coming out here, um, you know, if you don't mind, like while we're kind of walking out to see the cattle, what, what was the big influence behind you guys deciding to just up and start this big operation of the cattle? It's like a huge risk, you know? It is a huge risk. And honestly, we had no idea it was going to get this big. Uh, initially we started it just to feed ourselves. Okay. Like I said, we, we, at the time locally, weren't able to source a hundred percent grass-fed beef to well done to the extent that we wanted it done to feed ourselves. We realized that our health really needed that and in our diet. And so that's why we really started it and thought, well, maybe we can just sell a little beef on the side. Um, and it is, uh, yeah, we see, we see what happened with that. Yeah. It's turned into, um, more than that. And so then it was, okay, well, I kind of miss bacon. Uh, we had kind of given up grocery store meats well over a decade ago. Um, like I said, closer to 14, 15 years ago, as we had just dove into that and our nutrition and our own health. And so we were like, but there is, there is nutrition in pork when it is raised properly. The same with chicken and turkey. And so we knew we wanted to raise pasture raised, um, with, and here's some of our laying hens here with an organic diet and no stone or no corn. Hey boys. Hey puppies. Hi boys. What are you doing? Goodness. These are, these guys are a new addition. Hi guys. That's awesome. They're only about eight or nine months old. They're huge. Yeah, they are. Goodness gracious. Their name's Rooster and Hondo. Rooster and Hondo? Hondo. Yep. Hondo. I love it. Yeah. So, um, yeah, that's really why we started was to feed ourselves. Okay. And then our community kind of friends and family figured out and told friends and family and, uh, just kind of grown from there. Okay. And so, so have you guys noticed like, um, any kind of difference in your health since you started, um, kind of feeding yourselves off the land with, you know, grass fed, grass finished cattle and fresh farm chickens and pigs. Like what kind of, what kind of changes have you noticed? Um, absolutely. We are, I think it's really quite amazing to see it at my parents who are in their early, mid seventies. Oh, wow. And if you look back at pictures, I don't have any for us today, but if we look back at pictures of them, um, 20 years ago in their fifties compared to their seventies, they are, it is night and day. I mean, they are way healthier now. Wow. And they were then. And you see that little guy there. Oh, look at him. Yeah. Um, and mom's doing her job. She sees us coming. And so she's like, we're going to move over here. I'm going to make sure this baby's okay. But they'll really act like a big family and nursery out here. That's awesome. Help take care of all of them. So are all of these cows or any of them bulls? These are all cows. Okay. There may be one or two first time heifers in here. Gotcha. But these are all of our moms. Okay. Our bulls aren't in right now. Our bulls are up, uh, kind of in front of the, my house there. Okay. Um, it's not their season. I see. Okay. Uh, they're hanging out doing nothing, but getting fat. Sure. And their season will come here once calving season's coming to an end. Okay. Uh, so this is beginning of calving season. It usually rolls for about two months. Gotcha. Mm-hmm. Man. And so, um, for the meat, do you guys harvest, is it only females? Do you harvest the bulls? How does that work? So for us and our operation, because we're running registered South Poles, it does not make sense for us to, uh, finish out our heifers as beef. Okay. So we sell them live for those that want to either add to their existing herd or want to invest in, in doing South Poles. And so, uh, currently in our beef operation, all of it is our males. Okay. Um, now we castrate them, um, so they don't stay bulls because they're here for two years and I don't need a whole bunch of bulls running around. Um, and we are trying to track our genetics. So we don't want just anyone lollygalligan around breeding with anybody. Sure. So, um, our, our bulls become steers. Okay. And that is what we take to finish. Got it. Okay. Very cool. So none of your heifers become beef. Not, not on your farm. Not here. Okay. Because it just does not make, uh, financial sense for us to do so. Plus we are really passionate about the breed of South Pole and want to see those, uh, that want to get into it, be able to have access to some heifers. Okay. And, um, right now it's kind of hard to get your hands on them. Got it. So let me ask you this. So you, you got a big property here and a fair amount of cattle. What does a day in the life of a farmer on this kind of a farm look like? Well, you can probably ask Jay who does more of that. Okay. My husband definitely does more of that. I am, uh, still involved, highly involved in the farm. I'm just handling all of the office side of it. Got it. Okay. There's a ton and ton and ton of paperwork and office side of it that people don't realize, um, a lot of marketing, um, a lot of customer service. Plus we have to schedule out all of our butcher dates one to two years in advance that we're working. Oh my goodness. We're constantly working on our calendar. Um, we're working on our calving schedule, our, uh, breeding schedules, um, all of those sorts of things. We're constantly, constantly go. So I kind of handled that for Shane as far as the actual physical labor of the day. And one of the things that we found was really valuable to us was when we did start, we took the time to put in infrastructure that made our day-to-day, his day-to-day more efficient. Okay. And the reasoning was, was because he was still working full-time off-farm. He worked full-time off-farm for about eight years at the beginning of this farm. Oh, wow. So, um. That seems to be a standard story for, as I'm talking to more farmers, um, most people are having to start full-time off-farm work and then just grind it out. We do too. Yeah. Okay. We encourage people to, um, now, of course, remote jobs are such much more, uh, available. We are like, hey, if you can get a remote job and work from the farm and make a great income and come do this and learn and grow as to that place that you can then leave that job. We encourage you keeping your job as long as possible. Okay. That's what we did. We did it to the, like, literally breaking point of. I couldn't, you couldn't take another day of having to handle both responsibilities. Okay. Um, and it didn't, it got to the point where it didn't make financial sense to keep it. Um. Okay. Because it was to the point that we were going to have to hire somebody to do this here. I see. And that didn't make financial sense to pay someone else to be here. Yeah. When he already knows what needs to be done when it needs to be done. Just pay yourself. Yeah. So we did a lot of things, um, to make his day more efficient. And one of the things is, is like every hundred feet in these big pastures is a water hookup. Oh, no way. And so it's just like a manhole cover. And, uh, we could probably find one up here if you, if you want to. Yeah. Um, that really helped speed things up and made it easier for us to integrate other species to the farm. So it wasn't necessarily our plan at first, but it really has paid off so that we can easily rotate. We rotate our pigs. They get moved, um, every two days to a fresh slice, just like the cattle are. Okay. Let me see the chickens out here. Yeah. They really could care less about electric fences. Um, let's see if, oh, right here. Let's take a little pop and keep moving. We almost passed it. Here it is. Um, so these manhole covers are, like I said, about every hundred feet. And they just run like straight down this, this huge pasture. And then we, Shane makes slices kind of according to the density of the, of the grass season. Okay. And they're in all of them. So there's well over, I don't know, I think we lost count 7,000 feet of water line here, but they make for, I don't know if they can open it without a tool, but there we go. Oh, there you go. Uh, so it's just a quick disconnect. Gotcha. So that flipped open and then we have quick disconnects hooked up. And what, what are you, what does this help you be more efficient at? Just watering every day. The grass? Watering the animals. Oh, the animals. Yeah. Watering animals is a full-time job. Wow. That's something you just don't think about unless you're doing it. You don't think about it until you're doing it. And then you look up one day and you're going, it took me four hours today to water every animal here, you know, and that's a lot of time is money. And, um, we just, we didn't have that time to spend because we were still building out a farm and we still are. We're still adding in different other profitable sides of our business that, um, need our time. And so if we could get all of his chores into a manageable time period, that's not the same every day or every season. He may have more time involved than other times, but we try to keep it manageable where it's just a two to three to maybe four hours at max a day. That frees him up to be able to manage the rest of the land, any weed eating or fence repair or, um, needing to work the cows or, you know, any of those sorts of things that add up. If your daily chores are taking eight hours a day, you don't have time to actually do all the other bazillion things that are going to come up when it comes to farming. I see. So efficiency is really important to us. And we were willing to spend a little bit more money and time on the upfront into really efficient infrastructure, like fencing and watering and coops and things like that in order to, um, maximize our, our time, which actually ultimately helps us make our money. Wow. So, um, are you guys anti-financing? Did you do everything with cash? Did you use financing? Um, like how does a person, like let's say this, one of the viewers, they want to get started on something maybe smaller or whatever, what advice would you have? Is there any government assistance or maybe you should stay away from that? What do you think? Um, so we did go in as, as a two family income. So my parents kind of led the crusade and said, Hey, you're young, you're young and you have the energy to do the work and we're getting closer to retirement and we want to invest in this. Um, so we both have time and investment into this. Um, we felt led as a family unit to do as much of it debt-free as possible. Okay. And I do recommend that. Um, but that meant that we had to wait two or three years for that cattle, cattle barn to be built or the hay barn to be built. We have utilized some, uh, state agriculture grant programs, uh, in the past to help us with different infrastructure things. Uh, they're getting a little more challenging to participate in, but they are an option and they're different state to state. Of course, you can also do the fed level of ag grants as well. They're even more complicated to get in and typically you need a grant writer for those. But our biggest advice is to attempt to do it debt-free with cashflow as you can. Got it. Okay. So like start where you can and then try to grow bigger as your cashflow allows. Yep, absolutely. Um, in fact, I just, I recorded a podcast for a farming park podcast this week and they said, what's your kind of same question? And I, my advice was start small, but aim big. Okay. So it's not that you can't get there. It's just that you can't get there all at once. Sure. And the overhead of farming on a day-to-day business is high, no matter how hard you work to keep it efficient and low cost. It's just high. And so to have that pressure of an immense amount of debt added to you on top of regular expenses is quite a lot. Sure. So it was something that we personally just did not want to be weighed down by. That makes sense. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I, I can see how if, you know, if you have this huge debt payment you're constantly having to make, like it makes it harder to do infrastructure improvements. It makes it harder to, it just kind of probably takes the joy out of farming. Exactly. It was like a, are we going to sleep at night at all kind of thing. Sure. If we not only have this debt hanging over us, but we're over here and there's a storm coming and you're thinking about your livestock and, oh my gosh, did that, you know, did that, that animal die? Sure. You know, there's, there's loss, there's death. That is a reality of this. Now, speaking, speaking of like loss and death. So from, for a lot of farm operations, it seems like this one included, you have these huge infrastructure and capital costs up front and then, you know, you don't necessarily reap the rewards of that investment for a couple years. Mm-hmm. Do, for cattle farming, do you guys have things like herd insurance or any kind of thing like that to help protect? We don't. Oh, man. That is just, that's the gamble. Wow. You got to kind of like a little bit of risk. Okay. Um, you, you got to kind of be comfortable with that. I mean, last year for the first time in 10 years, I said, those livestock guardian dogs are new. Okay. For 10 years, we've not needed livestock guardian dogs with our poultry. Last year we had an just overabundance amount of skunks come into the area. Oh, wow. And we estimate that we lost throughout the year over a hundred head of poultry. Wow. Um, something took out 40 of our duck layers. So we no longer in the duck egg business. What? Ducks are very expensive to purchase. Um, there's nobody coming to bail us out. That's crazy. That was our risk. So y'all had to just eat that whole. You just eat it. Dang. You just eat it and you go on and you figure out how to, you figure out if you're going to keep going or not. What, um, what would you say like that, that situation, if you don't mind sharing, what would you say like a retail level loss that was like, what did y'all lose? Um, well, it's kind of hard to put a monetary price on it because if you want to calculate what we would have made off of eggs and how long those ducks and everything like that. But, you know, the value of those ducks was easily at their age and they were newer layers. Um, you know, if I was to have sold that duck live to somebody that wanted a laying hen, um, I would have easily sold that for a 30 or $40 a piece. Okay. Um, but then you take away the fact that I not only had the investment in raising that duck to a laying point, but now it's just gone and I'm not getting the eggs off of it. Yeah. So it's kind of hard to put an actual number on that. Because of the future potential that you're losing. Right. The income that we would have gotten off those eggs for years is kind of just gone. So it might be, the number might not be exorbitant just from the initial loss, but when you multiply that out over the course of time, that's like a significant loss that you guys had to incur. And there's no, there's no insurance. There's no one coming to bail you out. There's no one coming to bail you out. Man. So those, those dogs have an important job then. They do. And thus far they're, they're doing a great job. They're still young. Still figuring ourselves out. Still puppies. Still babies, even though they're massive, but they're doing a great job. And, um, very loud chicken over here. Uh, yeah. So we decided, well, it's time to add the dogs. Well, the dogs are an expense. We've, we've gone without them this long because it's something else to feed. Yep. Um, but it was a, well, do we add that expense or do we just keep taking losses? I see. So, uh, it was a decision that had to be made and we chose to not get out of poultry and see if, see if dogs would help. Okay. But yeah, it's, uh, it's definitely, um, those things aren't even necessarily calculated into the price of our product. Right. Gotcha. So, um, I imagine that's a tough thing as I'm like thinking through this, it's probably tough as a farmer to like truly calculate numbers when it comes to what you're actually making profit because there's so much that goes into it. There's a lot of factors. And, and that's one of the things that's, that's, is hard to see other farmers miss, miscalculating them. They're what their worth is, what the product's worth. Um, we try to do our best to be pretty diligent in it. Okay. Uh, and make sure that we do have some profitability in there. Sure. Um, but some of the things are more profitable than others. Um, what is your customer base willing to pay for? Uh, we have an amazing customer base. They show up and support us constantly. And we, they literally are the reason why we keep going. There's days where we think we're done. And we think of them and their children and that they can eat our food. They're dependent on you guys. They're dependent. Yeah. We're one of the few locations that offers soy and corn free, like chicken, eggs and chicken and turkey and pork. And there are people and children with severe food allergies that this is the first time they've been able to eat meat in years or eggs or their, or their two year old can't eat eggs. Only our eggs, um, because of those food allergies of what's being input into the animal is being transferred to the end product. Okay. And so it's not that they're actually allergic to eggs or that they're allergic to pork. They're allergic to the grain and the soy and that kind of stuff. They're allergic to whatever the input was. Now some people do have a true egg allergy, but a lot of it we're seeing and the testimonies we've heard through our store of people that can now eat more and have more food freedom. Um, that's what keeps us going. That's amazing. Yeah. Um, well running a farm with all these cattle and chickens and pigs and all this, I'm sure you guys have probably had some crazy stories. What are some of the craziest stories y'all have experienced so far on the farm? Oh my goodness. It's one of the craziest stories. Um, one day we woke up to about, Hey, um, I don't know. I can't even remember how many it was. It was like eight or 10 totally finished hogs gone. They were just gone. Just left. They had left or we thought, we thought maybe someone stole them. They were gone. They were ready for butcher. We'd spent over six months feeding them organic soy and corn free feed. So we had a lot of money tied in them and we woke up one morning and they were gone and we spent all day searching for them. Couldn't find anything. Couldn't find a track. Nothing. Oh my goodness. We were done, exhausted, emotionally exhausted, um, physically drained. And on a whim, I looked at Shane and said, let's go out. It was just before to us, just before, you know, the sun was going down and I said, let's go out and check one more time. And they were just headed back up. Oh, they just went on a gallivant and adventure. Standing at the gate. They had tucked themselves down into woods. We probably drove by them 10 times. Um, our neighbor's game camera picked them up and we literally, there was a picture of the pigs and us driving by and like, we couldn't see them the way they were camouflaged in. Wow. And it was a lesson learned and now we can laugh about it, but it was terrifying at the moment. And they were just like standing at the gate like, Hey, it's dinner time. Why did you stress about us being gone? We're going to come home for dinner. We're coming home. Yeah. So it was a lesson learned too of like, okay. Don't stress too hard. We really didn't need to stress that much. Okay. I guess that would be the first time they leave. You don't know if they're going to come home or they just. I mean, they've never left. Like we've had groups and groups of pigs here and have never had anything get out. And it was like a fluke in the fence and they saw an opportunity and took it. And, um, it was wild. It was a wild day. Um, but it, it all worked out. Okay. So, uh, I read on the website as well that you guys said you're not organic as a farm. Do you want to go into a little bit about what that's about? Why you chose not to go organic and how that works? We didn't want government interference. Okay. So we're all about organic, organic production. Um, we have no problem if a farm is certified organic. Great. Good for them. Um, for us, we wanted to be held to our own standard for us. It was a, what we feel like is a higher standard. Okay. And we wanted to, um, we wanted to connect on an individual level with the consumer. So full farmer transparency. And that's why our store is here on the farm too is, is farmers markets are great. Um, but for us, we didn't just want you to take our word at the farmers market. We wanted you to actually come out here and see that. See the operation. There is no pesticides. There's no herbicides. We're not using Roundup or on the property. Um, we're, we're doing intensive rotational grazing. We're feeding what we say we're feeding. Um, and so, and to bring back that relationship that has been lost through the grocery stores, you no longer know the person raising your food. And we really wanted to bring that back. And we felt like if we had that relationship, the, the label, the label's not necessary. We're not relying on a label anymore. Because people know you, they come to your home. Yeah. They come here. They know us. They know that, um, we're wanting the best because we're feeding it to ourselves as well. Not just them. Yeah. It's funny, you know, now we got all this science coming out, um, about how our food supply is just like, it's slowly poisoning the nation. Like, yes, we have access to all this food that's relatively cheap, though it's getting more expensive. But now we're starting to see these studies, you know, like seed oils that are so highly processed. And in every single thing you find in a grocery store nowadays almost. And, um, you know, all these, uh, the, the cows that are mass produced, they're raised on GMO grains and Monsanto sprayed everything. Um, and it's like, you would think that people would inevitably understand that that's going to eventually pay us back for taking the easy route. And that, um, I think, I think it's starting to come around, but, um, you know, I don't know, there's so many agendas in the world now with, with trying to move away from meat and this, it's just, it's crazy. It is crazy. It's definitely a fight for food and for land. And if you can control that, you control the people kind of thing. And so, um, we're seeing that constantly. We, well, we, we really try to keep an eye on our state at our state level laws, what's happening in the ag and the farming. What laws are trying to get passed, what's not trying to get passed. Um, we, we have to do due diligence and keeping our eyes open to what is being passed and what's not passed. More regulations on farmers is not what we need. Yep. Um, the farmer needs to have much more, much more freedom to do what they need to do. And, uh, cheaper isn't always better. Sure. And for me, for us, for our family, it was, uh, let's put an investment in our health on the front end. And maybe we're going to be paying it on the back end. Um, I don't know about you, but I just, I don't want to live forever. I don't know if tomorrow's my day to go or not, but I know that I don't want to spend it in a prescription line. Yeah. Or the doctor's office or waiting for an x-ray or an MRI or a scan or whatever. And those are useful, grateful tools when needed, but it seems as though everyone is needing them now. Yep. And we are sicker. And the reality is that the way we've been farming in this country for, it's only been this way for less than a hundred years. We've all been guinea pigs. Mm. Um, this is not, this isn't tradition. This is still a very new way. The conventional way is a very new way of farming and feeding people. And a lot of our farming practices in the conventional world in the United States are banned in other countries like Europe. Isn't that crazy? And so, um, we, we, we've got to open our eyes and be aware and educate ourselves as to what we're putting in our bodies and where we're coming from. So, um. It's almost like there's a design to the way things work. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of like maybe God knew what he was doing. Yeah, exactly. But, uh. Very cool. Yeah. So we're just trying to bring it back to, um, bringing people honest food through an honest relationship with our farmer. And we're not perfect. We don't have it all figured out. We're still learning as we go when it comes to farming. But, um, our heart is to serve our community and feed them and feed them well. Okay. We just can't do it cheap. Yep. That's what we've realized is we can't do it cheap. And, um, it has to be a priority for the consumer. How many total acres do you guys have? Uh, we're, we're now just over 150. Oh my goodness. Wildly many more. Really? Yeah. We're on our max. We, we would like to be able to produce more product, meat for our community. Um. Is it just because you need more grazing space for more cattle? We need more grazing space. Yep. Okay. We can't put any more pressure on the lawn without, uh, destroying it. And the whole point of what we do is to restore it. So, um. I see. That's not stressful right now. Oh, this is a really cool setup. Yes. This is the outdoor bath house. Uh, it's still winterized right now. Sure. Everything gets mowed and things out and put out here in a few weeks, actually, as it gets a little warmer. And you guys Airbnb this out? We do. Okay. We do. We do. We do. Um. We've been doing this. We built this, the spring of, of COVID, actually. The pandemic. No way. So, they're just open air. They're electricity. But there is hot running water. Um. Running toilet. All those kind of fun things you're welcome to go in. It's like, it's kind of fun. Oh, just push it open? Yeah. Okay. It's just going to open. Wow. This is really cool. And so, in the summertime, you would just come and you'd stay in here. Yeah. Um. Yeah. It's really busy spring and fall. People love it. I love it. In the summer as well. There's a queen in my bed. And then there's a cot. So, technically, you can do five in each cabin. Um. But whether it's one of you or ten of you, you rent the whole space to yourself. Oh, wow. So, we'll put you down here with strangers. Okay. It's really private. It's really nice. So, you'll have this whole area. You'll have the whole area. Wow. To yourself. You can do a fire. We have a grill and camp stones that come out as well for the season. And hammocks. And, yeah. It's a really fun space. This is really cool. And so, what percentage or portion of revenue comes from this kind of stuff versus the cattle farming and the animal farming? Um. Well, it's kind of separated. Okay. So, it's kind of hard for me to, like, give you an actual percentage there. Um. Um. But, uh. It is definitely beneficial. I can say that for sure. Okay. It helps us be able to take. What we try to do is, um. Take whatever worth profit we do get from the farm. We've chosen not to actually pay ourselves. Oh, okay. So, we've chosen to feed it back into the farm so that the farm can keep being very sustainable. We can grow as we need to. We can fix and maintain as we need to. Um. We have a loss for one year. We're not totally upside down. Um. We have just for us have found that that's a better cushion. Okay. And so, we try not to really live off of that a whole lot. And we utilize more of our, um. Camping and things like that as more of our. Your living expenses. Yeah, our living expenses. Okay. That's what we've kind of done here. It's a little different. Um. But until we feel like the, the farm is really set up and profitable enough, we've just chosen to keep feeding it back into itself. I see. Um. In hopes that it can feed the next generation. Right? Yeah. So, one of our sons maybe wants to become the farmer. Then there's actual, you know. There's a leg for it to stand on it. Yeah. By itself. By itself. I see. That's kind of how we are investing in the next generation. Is we've just chosen to live below our means. Yeah. Live, uh. Comfortably. And get to do what we get to do. Um. But, you know. We've chosen to just pay ourselves where we have to pay ourselves. Got it. Okay. Well, that's really cool. Yeah. Um. I think, uh. I think we've covered a lot of ground so far. And, uh. Guys. It is so cold out here. It's really cold. We're playing it. We're playing it off smooth. But it's. I'm freezing. Are you freezing? It's pretty chilly. I'm losing fingers. Yeah. My fingers only move so fast now. Yeah. Um. But before we wrap up. I do want to make sure, um. I let the audience know. Even though there's not a lot of them right now. Yeah. Um. I let them know how they can find you guys. How they can, um. Purchase products from you. Like, where do you want to point people to? Anyone who finds this video? Absolutely. Our website's the best place to go. That's crossingcreeks.com. Um. That's where you can really learn about what you're doing. How you can stay with us. Or shop with us. Okay. Um. We've also just recently, last summer, we started our own non-profit here. Oh, no way. It's still new. It's getting out there. But, um. It's educational based. So, we want to educate the next generation about farming. But we also are really hoping to step into a place where that non-profit can support other farms. So, we would love to do our own kind of grant program for that. So, it's called the Bridge at Crossing Creeks. And you can donate to that online. That's very helpful. So, yeah. Our websites are the best place. But we are also on Instagram and Facebook under Crossing Creeks Markets where you can follow the store more. And, uh. And then our, my pages as well. The Bridge at Crossing Creeks Farm. And we do have a YouTube channel. It's really for our email newsletter group. Okay. And that is really where you get the weekly information about what we're doing. Our restock information. When things are opening up for the season. Um. You can join that on our website. Awesome. Um. Anything else for us or the audience before we get going? Support your local farm. Support your local farmer. But if it's not us, find another one. They all need it. I love it. Well, thank you so much, Elizabeth. Thanks so much for having us, right? I really appreciate it. This has been, um, super informative. And, uh. Hopefully we continue getting to do these, these farm videos and show off people's stories, their operations, the life of farming. And, um. I really appreciate you having us out. We appreciate you focusing on farms. Yes, ma'am. All right. We'll take it easy. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. We'll see you next time. We'll see you next time. Bye! Bye! Bye!
