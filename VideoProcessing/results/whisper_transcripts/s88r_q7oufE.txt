 We get some rules to follow That end this, these end lows No one knows We get these pills to swallow How they stick in your throat Tastes like gold What you do to me? No one knows I realize you're mine In need of who am I? I realize you're mine In need of who am I? I journey through the desert Of the mine With no hope I follow I drift along the ocean Dead lifeboats in the sun I'm a commandant Pleasantly caving in I'm a commandant I realize you're mine In need of who am I? I realize you're mine In need of who am I? I realize you're mine In need of who am I? I realize you're mine In need of who am I? I realize you're mine In need of who am I? I realize you're mine In need of who am I? Heaven smiles above me What a gift here below But no one knows I gotta put the new hidden An arm straight away LS4 Theور Çiğ
