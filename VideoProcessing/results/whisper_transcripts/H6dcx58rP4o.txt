 We finally got some landscaping on the homestead. There's one of our gardens. And Sully. So planted that. Got that one as a pot. I need some work with a pot. Got that one planted. Got all the wood chips for free from the local tree trimming company. All the potting soil is compost from the chicken run. Those made work so that's not done. He's planted. That's a pot right there as well. So finally got some stuff done around here. Make it look like a little more like a home. A house on some land. It's been here for seven, eight years now. And now finally just got some landscaping for the front of the house.
