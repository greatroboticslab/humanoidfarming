 Water quality management is becoming increasingly challenging as shrimp farms intensify their farming practices. With extremely high stocking densities, maintaining optimal water quality conditions with outdated practices can be difficult. Water quality management is crucial for aquaculture, and shrimps are extremely sensitive to drastic changes in water chemistry. Less than ideal water conditions can lead to stress, disease outbreaks, and poor growth affecting harvest and yield. As water quality monitoring is labor intensive, often slow and inaccurate, farm operators are unable to respond fast enough to rectify problems. But what if we could change that with technology and see the problems before they get out of hand? Rhinin Spectro is a compact and user-friendly spectrophotometer that provides quick, on-the-spot testing and analysis. Farmers can test up to 12 water quality parameters with a 98% accuracy rate, and eliminate the need for transporting water quality samples to a lab and having to wait for results. This speeds up efficiency and promotes faster decision making and intervention. Data is automatically synced with the Tom Goxie app for data recording and analysis, simplifying data collection and trend monitoring over time. Alkalinity is important in maintaining shrimp health and is responsible for acting as a pH buffer, supporting shrimp molting, and providing a carbonate source for algae within a pond's ecosystem. The Rhinin Alkalysense is a high precision and accurate alkalinity measuring device that measures calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, and sodium carbonate via titrometric analysis. Data is effortlessly synced and stored, allowing farmers to access historical data for quick analysis through the Tom Goxie app. By combining the right technological tools and best farming practices, and seeing trends and fluctuations in real time, it allows for preventive actions before water quality problems escalate, reducing the risk of disease outbreaks and shrimp mortality. Build a future where challenges become triumphs. Revolutionize your journey, one shrimp at a time. Reimagine the future of shrimp farming with Rhinin Aquaculture.
