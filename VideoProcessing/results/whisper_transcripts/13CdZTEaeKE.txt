 Grain farmers are price takers and so when you think about marketing something you maybe think about marketing a product or a brand or a company but when you market your grain you are literally taking the price that the elevator or the end user posts at that time and they they will tell you what the price is and there's a lot of transparency between the buyers so it's very competitive but nonetheless you call and ask what the price is or you look it up and that's what you get a good grain marketing plan is risk management it is looking what's up ahead what is the potential upside in a market and what's your downside so are you going to miss out on you know a dollar a bushel or you know 20 percent increase in the price but are is your price maybe going to drop 50 percent in that time too you don't know and you can never know you only guess grain is traded on the futures market in Chicago and the price of corn can go up or down you know a 10 percent in one day that's huge we are in a really big way impacted globally on our our commodity prices if you think about it the price of my soybeans that I'm gonna grow this year are right now being affected by weather in South America America and if you are not selling right or you're not you're not hitting the the right part of the market then you're basically being left behind as far as your potential revenue goes and it can be stressful like weather stressful but grain marketing is very stressful because there's so many things that you don't control you can't control the outside markets and you can't control whether you know the flour industry in Ontario isn't doing good and they're not buying Ontario wheat you can't control those things you can only look at the price every day and see if you are going to take that price or you're not going to our corn soybeans and wheat are all priced on the US commodities exchange the exchange rate plays a big factor in our grain prices because we're selling them in US dollars you have to not only watch the grain markets you don't have to watch what the end users are paying and the futures and the basis but you really have to watch you have to be almost a currency expert as well in Ontario and that's actually a very unique and challenging aspect of selling in Ontario you're always looking in the rearview mirror thinking man what could I have done differently but you can't can't let yourself get bogged down by that I always think you got to learn for the next year maybe maybe we'll sell a little bit less before harvest but the other thing about grain marketing is you can't have a hard and true plan that never changes either because the dynamics in the market are always changing things sometimes happen at times of the year that they don't normally happen so the market might rally at a time when it doesn't normally rally and you have to be ready you have to know the price that you want to sell at and be prepared to make a percentage of your sale at that time so you have to always be paying attention so I would check the grain prices every day most farmers would check them multiple times a day when I sell to a grain buyer we have a contract and I'm promising him I'm gonna bring him all those bushels but if I over sell more grain than I actually grow then we have to have a talk about being short on that contract because I've broken the contract and then it gets a little complicated because if the price goes up if you sell at 14 the price goes to 15 then you owe him a dollar times however many bushels you're short when you're short on a contract you make it good because you can run out of places to sell to pretty quick if you just walk away we have a very large port system in Hamilton and that grain goes all over the world so we can sell direct down to Hamilton and it will go corn beans wheat shipped all over the world and then we have local Ontario feed mills we've got flour mills we've got ethanol plants we have just if you can imagine something to do with grain it happens in Ontario like there's just so many places you can go to and if you sell to you know maybe a third party and they can send you to five different feed mills that they can pick so there's just so many different end users and trying to keep it simple in a complicated and intricate little area on the same hand that's also a blessing because you have just almost a world at your fingertips
