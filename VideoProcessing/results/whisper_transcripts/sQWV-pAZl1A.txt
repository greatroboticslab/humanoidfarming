 Hi, I'm Ben from AcreTrader. We're here on 63 acres of soybean crops in Desark, Arkansas. And today we're talking about the growth stages of the soybean plant. The growth stages are split into two main phases. You've got the vegetative state and the reproductive state. Most of this field is in the vegetative state, which is measured from roughly V1 to V4. And what we're looking for is a number of trifoliates on the plant. So the soybean crop sends out these shoots with three leaves on each of them. And so we'll count how many trifoliates we have. So these look like they're probably in V2 or V3 stage for the most part. When the plant begins to mature, it gets into the reproductive stage. And the telltale sign of the reproductive stage on the soybean plant is the emergence of these purple and pink flowers. And that indicates that the plant is beginning to be pollinated and then it will begin to set seed pods.
