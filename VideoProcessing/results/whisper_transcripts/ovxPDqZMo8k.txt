Harvesting Lentils From Our Home Garden

 We tried growing our own lentils this year to eat more sustainably, but when each lentil pod contains just one or two lentils, how does one harvest this crop with any efficiency at all? Here's what we did. When the lentils were nearly mature, we pulled the plants and laid them out to dry in our high tunnel. Then we stripped the leaves and lentil pods by hand. This was a bit tedious, but it gets better. At this point we had several bins of leaves, thinner stems, and lentil pods, and we just needed to somehow separate the lentils from all this junk. For that task we turned to our trusty threshing machine. Yeah, I built an electric solar-powered threshing machine, that's another story. Anyway, when we dumped all that lentil junk into the top chamber, the beater bars helped the lentils break free from their pods and drop into the lower winnowing chamber, which uses forced air to separate the lentils from any smaller chaff. Meanwhile, all that bulky chaff still spinning around in the upper drum is just released out the back hatch so we can start another load with a clean drum. Is it perfect? Not yet, but it's worked well enough to justify scaling up our lentil production for next season. Check out the description for a few more details.
