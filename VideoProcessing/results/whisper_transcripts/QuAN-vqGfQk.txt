 Here are 8 effective land restoration strategies for farmlands. Agroecology, this approach integrates ecological principles into agricultural systems, promoting biodiversity and sustainable farming practices. 2. Agroforestry, planting trees alongside crops can stabilize soil, reduce erosion, and enhance biodiversity. 3. Regenerative agriculture, practices like crop rotation, cover cropping, and reduced tillage help restore soil health and increase carbon sequestration. 4. Riparian buffers, establishing vegetated areas along waterways can prevent erosion, filter pollutants, and provide wildlife habitat. 5. Reforestation, planting native trees and shrubs on degraded land can restore ecosystems and improve soil quality. 6. Wetland restoration, rehabilitating wetlands can enhance water quality, provide flood protection, and support diverse plant and animal life. 7. Rehabilitation of degraded patches, restoring areas affected by mining or other intensive land uses can bring back productivity and ecological balance. 8. Boosting the small water cycle, techniques like rainwater harvesting and soil moisture management can improve water availability and support plant growth.
