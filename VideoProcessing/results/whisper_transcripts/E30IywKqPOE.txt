 In today's class, we will discuss the topic cropping systems. The term cropping system refers to the various patterns of growing crops and combinations of crops on a farm. A. Monocropping. Monocropping is a system where only one type of crop is grown on a farm at a given time, as seen in oil palm plantations. Advantages of monocropping. 1. Facilitates easy mechanization of the farm. 2. Simplifies the application of fertilizers at precise levels. 3. Enables effective control of weeds, pests, and diseases. Disadvantages of monocropping. 1. Risk of exposing the land to erosion after harvest. 2. Potential heavy losses if the sole crop faces pest or disease attacks. 3. Possibility of reduced selling prices in a market with low demand due to oversupply. B. Multiple cropping. Multiple cropping involves growing two or more crops on the same farm within a single year. Two types are relay cropping and intercropping. Relay cropping. Growing two or more crops sequentially on the same farm within the same year. Intercropping. Growing two or more different crops on the same farm simultaneously. Advantages of multiple cropping. 1. Maximizes the use of farmland. 2. Provides soil cover, reducing erosion and weed growth. 3. Discourages the buildup of insects and diseases associated with a particular crop. 4. Acts as insurance against crop failure. Disadvantages of multiple cropping. 1. High competition among crop plants, leading to reduced yields for less competitive plants. 2. Difficulty in using machinery for farm operations. 3. Challenges in applying chemicals, especially herbicides, to mixed crops. C. Continuous cropping. Continuous cropping involves growing the same crop or a mixture of crops on the same land annually for five or more years. Advantages of continuous cropping. Suitable where land is scarce, and environmental conditions limit the types of crops. Disadvantages of continuous cropping. 1. Rapid depletion of soil nutrients, requiring frequent fertilizer application. 2. Accelerated buildup of weeds, insect pests, and diseases with each cropping year. 2. shirts, nied sanctus, andщества. 3. dan again. 3. dansa summer. 4. woah der Transport ville gepness really cost 1. gaulo Bock 2. klass Rainer USD 4.
