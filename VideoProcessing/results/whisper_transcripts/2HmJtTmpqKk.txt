 Hello, my name is Chris Boyer. I'm an associate professor in the Department of Ag and Resource Economics here at the University of Tennessee. And today I'm going to visit with you. The title of my presentation is Farm Management Considerations for Row Crop Producers. Now that's a very broad title topic and what I want to spend our time with, talking to you about is using cost of production in making those decisions. So how do I, the three questions I want to try to address and look at is one, how do I use my cost of production in my mid production year to make wise decisions for the rest of that year? How do I use that cost of production information to figure out where I need to maybe focus on looking for different or lower cost inputs in the future for the next year's production year? And then also how do I use my cost of production in making wise marketing decisions for this year? So typically what we see or encourage producers to do and what you probably do is you have a given field and within that given field every year you decide, well I may plant corn, I may plant soybeans, I may plant cotton. And so you can December, January, February time frame start thinking, okay, these would be my cost productions for corn, my cost productions for soybean, cost production for cotton. And how do I, you know, or what yields I may get on that field for each one of those commodities and then figure out what my break-even price may be. And that way you can make a wise decision on how do I allocate that land to a certain crop that's going to maximize my profit. Now you may be, also be in a crop rotation that that field may need to be in soybeans that year or may need to be in corn that year. And it's, it's still helpful to calculate that, that cost production on before planting so you can figure out, okay, what my break-even price might be and then what the future harvest price is looking like. And it can help you make wise management decisions of trying to figure out how to, how to control your costs during that production year. So to answer the three questions or to look at our three questions that I mentioned earlier than being, how do I use my cost production mid-season and making a management decision? And how do I use it for making future management decisions? And how do I use it for making wise marketing decisions? We're going to look at two examples or case studies. So the first one will be a corn case study. And so you may see a slide pop up here that's got a pie chart that should breaks down cost production for corn. And this is a, just a cost, we pull from the UT budgets again, this is just a case study. Your farm may be, well, is likely different in a lot of areas. But if you look at the kind of the pie chart of where your costs are currently and what future costs you may have, you may, that may include hauling your grain, storing it, things like that, you can see, okay, what my current costs are, what I expect to spend on drying, storing, hauling, to get a really strong estimate of what my total cost production is. So in this example, I've got to use my notes there because there's a lot of numbers, it's $638 an acre is my estimated cost of production. So if you look at the next slide, we'll show these break-even prices. So if you take your total cost and you divide it by your total output, so I made kind of a worst case, average case, or expected case, and best case scenarios of different yields, and you divide that total cost divided by that yield. So for example, in the average case, if you divided the $638 an acre divided by the 170 bushels an acre, which is your sort of average yield expected for that year, you'd have a break-even price of $3.75 a bushel. So now you know, okay, upcoming I need to sell my corn for $3.75 a bushel to break-even to make no profit. So I need to sell it above that to make a profit for growing this crop. So if we look at this example here, and we think about our pie chart again, the inputs of land, seed, fertilizer, and machinery make up about 70% of our production costs. So using this estimate right now and looking at production into next year, we can answer that question, maybe I need to look at ways of lowering my machinery costs or different sources for buying fertilizer or seed to lower my seed and fertilizer costs. Land costs is something that you may not have much control over based on negotiated leases, but these are the machinery costs may be something you say, well, do I replace my planner or do I not replace my planner? What would that do to my machinery costs and then result in my break-even costs? And then currently, you know, you can use this number to decide, okay, should I store or not store? Storage cost is going to add additional costs, which is going to drive up that break-even cost. So those are ways you can use that information today in making those storage decisions, other input decisions, and also in your looking at next year and lowering your cost production for next year. Now, the next slide is a similar pie chart for soybeans. And if we look at our pie chart where we break up the case study of soybeans, and again, this is an example that's kind of pulled from the UT extension crop budgets, our total cost production was about $486 an acre. Now, if we look at our pie chart here, we can see that the land, seed, chemical, and machinery are making up about 67% of our input costs. So then again, we can look at this number today and say, maybe in future years, I really need to look at ways of lowering my machinery costs, figuring out ways to lower my chemical costs. And in doing that, you're going to result in lower total cost production and lowering that break-even price. So again, the next slide will show some break-even prices for soybeans. And similarly, I did a worst average and best case scenario. And these are helpful for some sort of sensitivity analysis, right? So you haven't yet harvested yet. There's still some unknowns out there in production, but you may at this point have a good ballpark of saying, this is the worst case scenario yield I'm expecting. What I sort of expect are average and then best case scenario of everything goes right, this is what I could get. So using our sensitivity analysis and dividing our total cost of production by our yields, as far as best case scenario, we can see that we need about $8.68 a bushel to break even. Now, again, let me reiterate, this is just an example case study that I came up with. Your numbers could be slightly different or completely different depending on your specific operation and situation. But we know that now that, okay, I may have some other input decisions, specifically applying a fungicide. So several years ago, there's some research here that we did at UT where we looked at applying fungicide to control frogeye leaf spot and soybeans. And we found that on average, it was between about seven to five bushels an acre is what spraying could increase your yields. So if we think about that, this in-season decision, right now I could make a decision to spend more money to spray to control fungicide if it's bad. But I would expect maybe an additional additional seven bushels an acre. And so assuming soybean prices are $9 a bushel, roughly seven more bushels an acre, that means you could increase your revenue by $63 an acre by making this one application. Now, if you can do it for less than the cost, if the cost is less than the return, so if you can spray for less than the, our example here of $63 an acre of our expected returns, it would be a profitable decision to do right now. So that's how that's really helpful in making these in-season production decisions and then controlling for the future decisions and trying to figure out, should I replace equipment, should I not replace equipment, how do I lower other input costs? So our third question of how do we, how do we address, how do we use this information to make wise marketing decisions? So how do we need to know what we need to sell for? Well, this is a pre-recorded video, but if you, if we looked at harvest prices today for corn, it's about $3.32 a bushel, and soybeans it's about $8.84 a bushel. So if you have an understanding of your current cost production and you have an idea of what you're expecting on your yield, and we can look at this, right now, the harvest, expected harvest price for these commodities, and we know our basis on what our cash price may be, we can start looking at, all right, how do I, how do I need to market my crop? Should I go ahead and lock in and sell? Or do I need to look into storage? So what's the storage availability? Maybe something to start thinking about right now. And then what's that cost of storage? I, I would say that one helpful way of figuring out of, of whether you should store or not store, there's a, a really great cost of storing grain calculator that, that Iowa State Extension is, is made available. If you're to Google Iowa State cost of storing grain calculator, it's a really simple Excel decision aid that can help you look at on-farm storage versus commercial storage. And you can plug in your own numbers and it can give you a good ballpark on, okay, what's my cost of storage going to be? What do I expect the price to go to? And when to sell, when not to sell out, out in the future past harvest. So that's, that's another thing to, it can help you figure out because again, that storage cost is going to be adding onto your total cost, which is going to increase your break even cost. So in wrapping up, I would just say, you know, I want to say if, when time allows, it's really helpful to, to sit down and figure out what your cost of production is. But I, I would maybe even more strongly say, really fight to make time to sit down and pencil out what that cost, your cost of production is for each commodity. It's really informative information for marketing, future investment into machinery, sourcing inputs in the future, and making decisions right now today in the field. And if it's, if that's a difficult thing, which it is, it's a difficult thing for, for a lot of people, people, I would encourage you to reach out to UT Extension. The, the, there's a managed program, the, the area farm management specialists are individuals that are highly equipped to sit down one-on-one, go through your costs, particularly fixed costs and your machinery costs, the difficult costs to, to sit down with you one-on-one and do an unbiased, completely confidential analysis of your farm, to help you get a good understanding of your costs so that you can make these other decisions in the future. So, thanks for your time. Again, my name is Chris Boyer. I'm in the Department of Ag and Resource Economics. Any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. You can find my information on the website. And I hope you enjoy the rest of the field day. Thank you.
