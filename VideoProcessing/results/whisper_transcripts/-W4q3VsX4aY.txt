i'll be presenting my screen now okay is my screen visible yes ma'am it's visible can you tell me if the slides are moving yes okay a very good evening to ayuriana community uh i'm dr harshita case and today here we are to discuss one of the unique cases and to see what ayurveda could contribute in health of this particular patient so today we'll be dealing a case report on the disease lupus thrombocytopenia evaluating the impact of personalized ayurvedic protocol on platelet indices in lupus thrombocytopenia a case report so as we all know and as we have all heard of and seen cases of systemic lupus erythematosus it is a systemic autoimmune disorder so what is a systemic autoimmune disorder so the scope of treating an autoimmune disorder doesn't only restrict to the symptoms which are initially seen but are also the systemic features for example if you take rheumatoid arthritis which is an autoimmune condition the systems doesn't only restrict to the painful or swollen joints it also leads to systemic complications like a plant syndrome deformities in the hair deformities in the scalp then deformities uh in the joints right so that's why the scope of treating an autoimmune disorder doesn't stop by treating one particular system like musculoskeletal respiratory it is a combination of all the systems which will be involved at various points of time similarly in systemic lupus erythematosus various systemic features can be seen apart from the malar rash apart from the joint pain so and it is often gets it often gets a little bit difficult to diagnose whenever it is especially associated with the hematological conditions for example if the patient comes with anemia rarely we see or rarely we think of an approach which where the autoimmune disease is contributing we think of malnutrition induced anemia or we think of iron deficiency anemia we think of secondary anemia where like this is like irritable bubble syndrome inflammatory bubble syndrome can contribute to uh hemolytic anemia but rarely we think of an autoimmune disease causing anemia okay or that's why these uh initial symptoms or this late latest symptoms like thrombocytopenia many of the times it gets masked even though it is contributed by sle so as per the systemic lupus international collaborative clinics 2020 amongst all the patients of sle 20 to 40 percent of the patients land in thrombocytopenia that means if 100 patients of sle are there amongst them 20 to 40 patients they will land in thrombocytopenia that means they will land in systemic lupus thrombocytopenia and in general if you see not just the census of 2020 but all the years around 5 to 20 percent of the patients of the patients of sle generally develop idp so the good point is the green signal is ayurveda can identify the root cause can identify the pathogenesis which is happening in the patient which is definitely unique from one patient to another patient then we can contribute not only in improving the quality of life not only working on the diagnostic parameters but also taper down the modern medicines patients and then give them a new approach to life so what are we looking at today so today we are as i told you it is a case report so today we are looking at a case which was diagnosed with sle itp and the ayurvedic approach to the particular case especially in today's case we have steroid dependent sle itp and the two parameters why am i discussing this particular disease is because the systemic lupus erythematous disease activity index it was reduced from 13 to 2 from 13 points to 2 points in this particular patient and also her platelet count as we are dealing with lupus thrombocytopenia her platelet count from 0.37 lakhs per mmq was increased to 1.9 lakh during the last visit so this is what we are looking at so the case ayurvedic approach and this was the assessment parameters and how did we reach with these two parameters so we'll just take a brief sle and what is sle thrombocytopenia and in the present era what are the medications which is given as a standard of care sle as i told you it is systemic autoimmune disorder many of the times it often gets difficult to diagnose whenever especially it is associated with the hemological conditions like hemolytic anemia leukopenia thrombocytopenia and as per the sle collaborative clean 2020 around 20 to 40 percent they get diagnosed with sle itp the first manifestation of lupus in up to 16 percentage they have this particular complaints persisting for months or 10 years before the diagnosis before they do the cbc check for the platelets so they will have the persisting complaints to minimum 10 years or some months so the main reason why thrombocytopenia can be caused is due to the thrombotic microangiopathy antiphospholipid syndrome and many of the times sprenomegaly so when whenever sle is associated with these many complaints especially lupus thrombocytopenia there is a bad prognosis and also high mortality and as we all know as i previously mentioned it is a systematic disorder there is definitely the symptoms or systems of neuropsychiatrics involvement the renal involvement and also the presence of hemolytic anemia along with the antiphospholipid antibodies revolving in the circulatory system so thrombocytopenia they seem the main standard of treatment for them for that particular case is high oral prednose or high doses of methylprednose or the second line of agents includes include hydrochloroquine or azupioprine or cyclosporine and many of the times it can also be corticosteroid resistant or these particular cases can also be very less responsive to the corticosteroid treatment so i am specifically specifying uh you know specifying on splenectomy because this aspect comes in the case in which we are discussing today so splenectomy it is also one of the important marker to show that that particular patient is resistant or is being very less responsive to even high doses of corticosteroids so okay in such cases what can ayurveda do so ayurveda it can contribute point number one in tapering the dose of medicines point number two to improve the quality of life and point number three to work on the platelet count and also the symptoms in the which the patient is suffering from so the multimodal management whatever will be planned by ayurveda based on the sampraptivikar tanna and the chikitsa siddhanta it can target all the possible pathogenesis factors in thrombocytopenia which is associated with the sle so as i told you this is an image which is showing the multi-systemic involvement of systemic lupus erythematosus so there is involvement of the neuropsychiatric system there is involvement of the respiratory system there is involvement of the reticuloendothelial system musculoskeletal system uranial system there is involvement of the blood which we are discussing in today's session and also the skin so let us start with our case report today so a female of 35 years she approached the opd with the main complaints of multiple joint pain with mild fever and rashes increased frequency of urine around four to five times in a day and two to three times at night loss of body weight three to four kilos from two months along with that the concomitant presence of thrombocytopenia so these were the may four major complaints with which the patient approached the opd so along with these symptoms on the reading the reports which were was medical reports which was bought by the patient she was also positive with the antibodies like anna anti-nuclear antibody and her platelet count was also less it was just 12 000 per mmq and we're taking the surgical history she has undergone splinectomy in 2010 and her present medicine history she was under two mixamab 500 mg two tablets per day she was on tablet visalon 60 mg one tablet per day she was on hydroxychloroquine 200 mg and she was taking all these medicines for 16 years so by all this medicine history drug history and also the surgical history her present status of the platelets her so many complaints even though which persisted even though she was taking medicines for 16 years this case was diagnosed as corticosteroid resistant sle itp on clinical examination so her pulse rate was 96 beats per minute blood pressure was 160 by 60 mm hg respiratory rate was 20 cycles per minute uh in the general examination aspect there were no any signs of lymphadenopathy or edema on gi system examination there was no any abdominal scars no visible pulsation uh the breathing pattern was the breathing pattern was her abdominal and on palpation there was no tenderness in any compartments of the abdomen and there were no signs of any organomegaly and even in the respiratory system cardiovascular system there was no any predominant clinical findings everything was quite physiologically normal when it comes to the cns system she was conscious oriented to time place in person when it came to the musculoskeletal system there was tenderness in the bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints bilateral wrist joints bilateral elbow and bilateral knee joints and there was also warmth along with the tenderness and pain okay so now we have a puzzle in front of us a female has come and she has given the symptoms of the multiple spectrum there is also weight loss there is also weakness there is also a fever there is also increased frequency of urine so this symptom symptom complex is in the one part of the puzzle in the second part of the puzzle we have all the investigations with increased levels of anna antiphospholipids and decreased levels of platelets and in the third part of the puzzle we have all the current medications and even though she's taking so many medications in 16 years she is not having any relief and in the fourth puzzle box it is empty that is one which we have to find and make this puzzle a complete one so that we can find the solution so now we will start approaching all the symptoms and this particular disease not just name wise but according to the siddhanta of ayurveda as we all know there is a concept in charaka nidana 8 which is told nidana artha kararoga where a disease gives origin to another disease okay so briefly to tell the history of present illness in this particular patient the first symptom of this patient was fever so she was diagnosed with fever and then it was not treated properly she didn't take any appropriate medications and after that there was relief in that fever but again after three to four months she got severe episodes of high temperature high febrile uh episodes of fever along with the rashes so along with the rashes when she got the fever it was diagnosed as the typhoid and that fever was treated but again the episodes of fever repeated with the rashes this time the rashes were more severe but the rashes were painless and then when the platelet count was done and the antibody levels were done she was diagnosed with sle and then itp because from then on her platelet count got on uh progressively reduced so this was the phase the timeline of the symptoms and along with that she had increased frequency of urine she had lot of weight loss she had she had weakness so this was a timeline of her symptoms so now putting that in the ayurveda siddhanta seeing through the lens of ayurveda so that the better samprapti vighatana we do the better will be the approach to chikitsa and better the patient will be relieved from all the symptoms so as i was telling you before nidhanartha kararoga so in the nidhanartha kararoga one of the examples is between juara and raktapitta so the siddhanta says juara can give rise to raktapitta and also raktapitta can give rise to juara so both together can also lead to sorsha so if you see this particular siddhanta and look at our case today the the initial symptom was juara it led to the raktapitta then raktapitta she had got raktapitta we can i'll tell you why raktapitta and raktapitta even after getting the raktapitta again it came back to the juara because in the presenting complaints we saw that with the multiple joint pinch was also having fever and both of them had led to sorsha which we can see in the majority of the today's complete complaint that there is loss of body weight right so all the main point main three complaints we could correlate with the one siddhanta of nidhanartha kararoga so initially in the primary stage it started with the juara it led to raktapitta both together they had they took the path of sorsha so in the present case the complaints of the patient started with juara after a few days she developed symptoms of lupus lupus thromocytopenia that is internal bleeding which can be correlated with so hence based on the concept of nidhanartha kararoga our this puzzle has been solved so we have come to the diagnostic assessment that based on the concept of nidhanartha kararoga juara is an initial manifestation of the disease but also it is can it can act as a contributing contributing factor of so hence this particular case was diagnosed as so one important point which i have to tell all of you today is whenever we get a diagnosed previously diagnosed case it can be amavata or it can be billion-beard syndrome or it can be a systemic lupus erythematosus or it can be any xyz disease the moment we see that this is we jump on to the possible correlation for example if it is gout we go to the chikitsa siddhanta of vatarakta if it is a rheumatoid arthritis we go to the chikitsa siddhanta of amavata right but many of the cases this will not be the scenario until and unless we evaluate the nidana until and unless we don't know the timeline of the pathogenesis or the samprapati we cannot just randomly take a chikitsa siddhanta and make it suitable for that disease okay so whenever a patient comes that's why purusham purusham vikshya is told that's why chikitsa siddhanta varies based on the patient not based on the modern correlation so even though we study in theory that this system complex suits this particular disease and the possible correlation in this but many of the times in practice it will not be so so gullivan berry syndrome you need not always treat as vatavyaati but also amavata based on the dakshanas based on the samprapati based on the nidana many of the times even sandhigata vata we have to do amapachala we have to apply agni lepa and not always go with nirupastham vata vata because there is ama so the better you understand this the better your chikitsa approach will be made and better you will be a and you will be a better clinician in ayurveda so the clinical diagnosis of this particular patient with the treatment principles of the ayurveda was diagnosed as raktapitta okay so now i have told you that i have not diagnosed this case as raktapitta now what about the symptoms of increased frequency of urine and the weight loss which she was suffering in this so the later manifestations of increased frequency of urine in raktapitta itself uh in there is a shloka in the prameha where the eloge discoloration of urine will be there whenever whenever the patient is having eloge discoloration of urine why can't we consider it as pitta ja prameha or why can't cannot be considered as pitta ja raktapitta there will be a confusion the agnamesha asked this question to charaka then charaka says that whenever this particular complaint is associated with the prameha pora ropa then diagnose it as prameha if not go with the raktapitta so even though there is increased frequency of urine which is a lotion color it is not prameha because this patient did not come to us with the subset of prameha pora ropa hence this was also considered as the manifestation of raktapitta itself reference is and what about the splenectomy so how do we fix the splenectomy in this particular person so if you see charaka chikitsa sthana raktapitta chikitsa in the dhushta raktas thambhana janyavya there is pleha also so in the initial stages when the patient developed fever with rashes and all the medications were given not to do the amapachana but to suppress the bleeding that will be counted as the dhushta raktas thambhana janyavya which led to pleha or splenovegali which is a consequence of dhushta raktas thambhana janyavya hence splenectomy was done to overcome that splenomegali which can be considered as pleha which is a dhushta raktas thambhana janyavya now coming to the fatigue and weight loss which the patient was complaining from how do you fit again fit that into our box of answered puzzle or puzzle here the fatigue and upadrava are considered as the ekadasha upadravas of raktapitta so all the symptoms symptoms like fatigue weight loss increased frequency of yellow urine the uh splenomegali now everything will fit perfectly in the disease of raktapitta so now the approach to the chikitsa what should we know so how should we understand now with respect to the disease we have understood we have diagnosed the case now we have to go to chikitsa so we have to better understand the chikitsa uh to in terms of dosha and dhatu so now the dosha dhatu interaction in systemic lupus arythematosus so here we can consider the pitta dushti in rasa dhatu led to then the uttarottara dhatu after rasa dhatu and rakta dhatu when chikitsa is not done at the correct time at the proper kala there is involvement of the uttarottara dhatu that is rakta dhatu so pitta dushti in rakta dhatu is led to rakta dhatu so jwara rakta pitta even though they are nidhanartha karavyadis the dosha here is pitta dosha pitta dosha first did there is dosha dusha sammurchana pitta pitra sadhatu and later along with the parinama from kala it led to the pitta dushti and the dosha dusha sammurchana between pitta and rakta dhatu so now what is the approach to treatment what are the chikitsa siddhantas which we are applying in the treatment of this particular case so first is amapachana and rasadhatu and rakta dhatu next is pitta dosha prashamana and rakta dhatu prasadhana because pitta and rakta are ashraya ashraya bhavas and third one grita panna and jirna vyadi because this patient she has come with a 16 to 20 year long history even though she has been taking all the high dose corticosteroid she's taking visolon she's taking hydroxychloroquine she is not having any relief in the complaint so from the amapachana till the grita panna and the jirna vyadi all the three important targets have been focused in the chikitsa so we'll see the timeline of investigations and medications and later we will go on to the discussion why this particular medicine was given so first visit was on february 4th 2020 so medicines like vasadi kashaya was given amalakki guruchi mustasadita jala was told and mahatik takagrita was done so the kashaya was told to take in the dose of 60 ml twice daily before breakfast and dinner amalakki guruchi mustasadita jala the patient was told to sip this water whenever she's thirsty mahatik takagrita 10 ml twice daily before breakfast and dinner so allopathic medications when we started the treatment so one vizalon after breakfast and dinner she was taken so on December 2019 the recent investigation before 2020 before we started the treatment the platelet was 0.37 lakhs fps 125 ppbs was 198 and feb 8th 2020 platelets were 80 lakhs fbs 137 ppbs 149 hba 1c 92 anna was positive with 10.50 international units so in the visit 2 that is in the february 13 2020 so the dhani shunti sadita jala was given purama pachana dadi mashti kachurna bilba churna was given now with three grams each one teaspoon before breakfast and dinner again the dose of allopathic medication here you can see it is still one tablet of vizalon the third visit on march 18 2020 was continued amalakki churna here the vizalon was advised to take once in three days so in the previous two daily she was taking the vizalon but now we had advised the patients because the platelet count was slightly increasing 1.22 when compared to our first visit which was 0.37 so we started to taper the dose of vizalon which was advised to take once in three days so in the visit number four which was in april 10 2020 so it was the same medications was advised to take vizalon once in a week so on march 10 2020 so again the same medicines here in the allopathic medicines as most of the improvement she had shown advised to stop vizalon completely so on jan 2030 2021 so from 2020 we have come to 2021 okay so see the make some efforts to see the year also so last march january 30 2021 she was on no allopathic medicines in the previous visit also vizalon was completely stopped even in this visit the allopathic medicines were completely stopped now the approach was for the thumbbana after ramapachana doing all the amapachana now tablet was given two tablets daily after breakfast and dinner was given 60 ml twice daily before breakfast and dinner and the churnal jala sadhita jala amalaki kudu chimustachurna was advised to take whenever she is thirsty so the final investigations on feb 6 2026 the platelet count was raised to 1.9 lakhs fbs was reduced to 89.97 mg per dl hbmc had come down to 6.17 ana has come down to 10.10 so you can clearly see the difference in the platelet counts from the first visit till the last visit and also the medications as we told in the treatment principles it was stuck on to the same treatment principles in the same medicines were chosen the medicines which will do the the ratha prasadhana which will do the rasa and ratha dhatu pachana amapachana and also the grita and the jirna vyadi the simple treatment principles as told in the siddhanta and the simple medicines which was fixed in the box of our samprakti so if you see the shamanau shiddhis which were chosen in lupus swam was aytopenia it was vasadi kashaya amalaki kudu chimustachadita jala mahatik taka gurita and so from 2019 after 2021 you can directly see the improvement in the platelet counts from 0.37 to she had reached 1.90 so based on the grading scale her improvement in the symptoms so her initial symptoms fever was there it was not there after treatment or at the final visit sandhishula from 3 plus it was reduced to 0. anorexia aruchi from 2 plus to 0. prabhuta mutrata from 3 plus to 0. haridra mutrata 2 plus to 0. daur balya from 3 plus to 0. and sla disease activity index you can google this uh you will get the series of questions and uh grading to each question or marks to each question so when it was assessed it was 13 points in her first visit and it was reduced to only two points at the last visit so now let us discuss uh how this treatment was planned and what was the mode of action of these particular medicines and how did they work in lupus thrombocytopenia so in this case based on the symptoms especially she was having rashes and also bleeding from nose and blackish patches it was considered as urvagarattapitta and the treatment principles which we stuck on to our pitta shamaka rakta shamaka rakta shamaka rakta sthambaka and along with that rasadhatu pachaka and agni depana medicines so mainly they wanted medicines with tiktarasa shita vidya kapha pitta dosha hara so all the medicines what you saw in this timeline of medications all were tiktarasa shita and kapha pitta dosha hara with the mode of action of pitta shamaka rakta shamaka and rakta sthambaka so now the probable mode of action of the drugs in vasadi kashaya so vasadi kashaya has a number of drugs like vasaguru chi triphala katuki nimha bu nimha and amalaki so after assessing the rasapanchaka of this particular kashaya it is tiktarasa pradhana and it is shita virya laguguna it has rakta pitta kapha shamaka karma which is rightly apt for this particular disease and vasadi kasha is indicated in a number of diseases like pitta jabikara rakta jabikara pandu kamala and vasa is also a drug of choice in urdhva karakta pitta so the recent research says that vasadi kashaya it is having the capacity to control capillary hemorrhages and also the correction of drug induced bone marrow depression so it has the capacity to control the capillary hemorrhages which eventually happen in the rakta pitta or thrombocytopenia and vasadi is an ideal drug of choice in this okay so the contents which are like antioxidants they uh and also the component like vasesin they're having strong antioxidant activity which will prevent the further progression of the disease so next amalaki guduchi mustah saadita jala why only this three drugs were selected because amalaki is tridosahara guduchi and mustahar kapha pitta so the combination of these drugs in the form of paaniya kalpana it mainly acts on amalaki which helps in amapachana and also agnideepana so we wanted a drug with multiple actions with and which is also easily available which is not definitely adulterated at all because amalaki mustah guduchi you can trust the drugs whatever you get in the market and also they do both of this action together they work on all the three doshas and also mainly kapha and pitta and they do amapachana in the rasa dhatu and draktadhatu and also do the agnideepana so if you look at the present research so all the three drugs are having anti-pirotic effects which we wanted for the jwara to act on the jwara and also anti-inflammatory because the anti auto antibodies like anna phospholipids were positive so anti-inflammatory activity was also needed and as guduchi is there it is also immune modulatory as we are acting on autoimmune disease we also needed guduchi to act on the immune modulation and guduchi amalaki and mustah especially guduchi mustah it is also having anti-arthritic effects so whatever the patient presented with if you see the joint pain fever and the disease all this is also proven by today's scientific research it is anti-pirotic analgesic anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory and anti-arthritic effects so all of this was taken by amalaki guduchi mustah sadhita jala along with the amapachana and next is mahatiktaka grita as we all know grita is indicated in tiranajwara prakarana so mainly tiktagrita is indicated in punanavartakajwara so in the punanavartakajwara also there is mentioning of tiktagrita intake okay and this patient as she was having repeated episodes of fever in the pathogenesis or in the samparakti it was considered also as punanavartakajwara and tiktagrita was selected so mahatiktagrita it is having most of the dravyas which are dhatu pachaka especially and which help in the digestion of toxins at various levels so whatever uh the dosha pratyanika chikitsa and roga pratyanika chikitsa was needed this was taken by taken care by mahatiktagrita and mahatiktagrita is also indicated in pandu and raktapitta so pandu we need not always consider it as the decreased hp level but also the formed elements of the beard so both pandu and raktapitta mahatiktagrita is indicated and rightly it was used in this case also so the many of the previous researches which was done on mahatiktagrita especially in uh patients they showed recovery as soon as within 21 days so when the research was done on thrombocytopenia with mahatiktagrita so within 21 days the patient had recovery or showed the signs of improvement next is raktarodhakavati so raktarodhakavati it is a rasavushadi it is having components like swarna makshika basma which is madhura tiktarasa and sheetavirya and it is mainly indicated in jirana jwara and raktapitta which is nothing but the components which the patient had presented so whenever jirana jwara is there and also raktapitta is there in such condition raktarodhakavati is indicated so one more important component of raktarodhakavati along with swarna makshika basma is daruharidra so daruharidra it is grahi and also it is rasayana in nature and as we need it for today's case it is kapha pitta dosha shamaniya also so along with being rasayana and yoga vahi it also increases the bioavailability of the other medicines and also it works on the thrombocyto thrombocyto piosys because berberine sulfate whenever when it was done used in a research trial it induced thrombocyto piosys in the in the patients of thrombocytopenia and both it had worked both in primary and secondary thrombocyto piosy so now if you see the treatment and if i have to summarize what did each medicine do so vasadhi it is tiktarasa pradhana it is raktapitta kapha hara and it has a component called rassacin which is used to control the capillary hemorrhage and it is also an excellent antioxidant to prevent for the progression of the disease it is it works on the amadosha and amapachin and agnidipana along with that it is having an algesic anti-pirotic anti-arthritic anti-inflammatory you know modulate the reaction maha tiktakagrita it is dhatupachaka especially asadhatupachaka and drakta dhatupachaka and also it is one of the important tool which will be given in punadavarthakajwara raktarodhaka vati it is rasayana and yoga vahi in nature so it works both in primary and secondary thrombocytopenia along with swanamakshika bhasma which is indicated in uh jirnajwara and also raktaputta so all of these approaches with three medicines with three medicines all the targets of this particular patients were met so i would like to conclude today's case that the better we approach the patient in terms of samprapti based on the nidana panchaka the better we'll be able to diagnose even though it may not make sense in the contemporary system of science but the chikitsa will definitely work because you will have the strong solid support of the ayurveda siddhantas assessing the nidana then looking for the purarupas the lakshanas samprapti then looking for any upadravas as we saw in today's case the urbalya was one of the upadrava of raktapitta so from nidana to upadrava whenever we assess completely and form the samprapti and make all our efforts in doing the samprapti vighatana so for samprapti vighatana it is not like we need 10 20 medicines so you once you decipher once you decipher the samprapti and look for the dosha dosha sammurchana look for the status of the agni and look for whatever medicines and the properties most of the times two three medicines or even a single medicine will be able to take over all those complaints by the number of drugs which are used in this that's why the ayurvedic formulation not only contains one two drugs it could be having a spectrum of drugs to target each and every receptor and each and every complaints with the patient will be coming from so in today's case i want to conclude that even though it was a steroid dependent a 16 year long case with no or less improvement with the contemporary system of medicine with the ayurveda treatment principles there was significant improvement not only in the symptoms but also in the platelet index so i'm not stressing you that whenever a sla itp case comes you should always think in this line whatever samprapti you may form or whatever the lakshnas the patient come with you it may differ you may think you may assess the lakshna samprapti and then you may go with the vatarakta if you feel if you feel and if you have the strong evidence from the samhitas okay the samprapti goes on with the samprapti father then you should be witty enough to take the chikitsa of vatarakta and also whichever the disease which are submerging in that particular disease i choose the drugs drug of choice and treat the patient or it can be amavata or it can be just juara jirna juara punaravar takat juara so the take-home message is do not correlate this this is this that will only sound good in our theory papers but whenever a patient approaches to us always use the nidana panchaka as the first investigation tool because the patient will always come with a bag of reports that has already been done the one thing what you have to do is your investigation of nidana panchaka and then give him a tailor-made prescription and then make sure you're assessing the patient with the right assessment criteria so that you can note down the improvement and also provide good result to the patient that's how ayurveda should be practiced and uh if there are any doubts i'll be happy to take thank you mom it was a wonderful session actually uh i have few doubts mom uh one thing uh is usually in navajwara grita pana is contraindicated uh in jirna juara uh grita pana is indicated uh i understood that in navajwara in because of amavastha uh grita pana is contraindicated uh in jirna juara uh due to of vataja it is uh indicated uh so uh as you only mentioned uh first it is in amavastha uh and you prescribe uh mahatik takagruta uh can you please uh justify this you're not audible properly you're not audible the last few sentences i could not hear uh okay yes ma'am in uh actually uh in samirtha uh uh in amavastha grita pana is contraindicated because of ama ama will be there and in jina avastha and in jina juara grita pana is indicated due to uh as a it is in uh vata avastha at it in jina avastha water will be in uh prakopa avastha so grita pana is indicated so in this case actually uh in starting you mentioned it is in ama avastha so that you selected uh that three drugs along with mahatik takagruta uh actually i there i little bit confused how it should be understood antha so please can you justify that one yes yes yes as you have rightly said in avajvara langhana is the first line of treatment because in the grahani chikitsa they say shari dano gattesa may rase langhana bachana so now the sama avastha is there in the rasadhatu there even your medicines will not work so give go for langhana is what acharya says but if you see the history of the patient since 16 years she's having all the complaints right and the fever what she used to get it is like she gets fever subsides then again recurrent fever many of the times it is high grade many of the times it is low grade so that will be considered as either punna vartakajvara or jirana so in jirana jvara in punna vartakajvara in jirana jvara they have told grita you give not just not only because of the vata pradhana avastha also because of pitta pradhana yes if you see grita is the shteshthasneha for vata pitta doshas okay so and in the punna vartakajvara if you see the chikitsa siddhanta punna vartakajvara there is one mentioning of the grita that is tiktaka grita okay and in this today's case what we are giving we are not targeting on her navajvara jvara has led to rapta pitta rapta pitta has led to jvara both are now leading towards the shosha so she has come in the jirana avastha for us one more point is she has landed in the upadravas of rapta pitta that is weight loss fatigue which come under the ekadasha upadravas of rapta pitta at that time it is not navajvara we should approach this as a jirna vya because since she is presenting with the same complaint since 16 years so in the jirna avastha you should do amapachana also take care of kapha pitta doshas and rakta dhatu also and also remember that it is not an avivyadi now it has become a jirna vyaadi so i should add that too a tiktaka grita because again tiktarasa is excellent pachana okay and yes yes now my doubt is like during uh it it is in jirna avastha only in amavastha that grita may intent cause amavanta but it as it is mahatikta ka best pachana drug uh it is uh yes yes so when this patient comes this series of complaints and since 16 years that made me choose grita but if the patient of fever comes to me then grita will not be an ideal choice of drug okay understood yes so here in this case it is not jwara alone yeah okay uh one more doubt on during uh you know during she was taking medicines how her symptoms like and whether it is aggravating gradually or it is decreasing or uh it will be uh like uh aggravating or decreasing like that how was her symptoms during taking medicine i have shown it here one second i have uh are you able to see the screen yes now yeah so that's where a timeline of uh the investigations of medications were done right so in the first two visits you can see first two visits platelets in the third visit from the third visit itself the vice one was told to take once in three days only when we observe the improvement in symptoms and also now here you can see the platelets 1.22 lakhs in the first visit you can see it is only 0.37 so only when both the symptomatic improvement and the platelets 1.22 we noticed we started to taper down dialopathic medications so it was told to take once in three days and later it was told to take only once in a week and if you see the treatment no it has started from 2020 till 2021 the patient was with us so she has only the graph has uh gone high here she had improvements from 2019 to 2021 she had improvements but yes uh the visits were from once in a month or once in one and a half months so that much time she was taking medicines regularly then only her symptoms were improved so there were no episodes of like uh bleeding or fever once we started ayurvedic medicines uh there were no such any complaints okay um did you advise any patya ahara for her or normal food so patya as such as i told you that she was having a history of 16 years most of as she was also an educated patient most of the things she had only had stopped by herself so all the food which was like which was ultra processed uh which was not made very fresh that was completely stopped and along with that we had advised her to take like pomegranate uh fruits and as i told you guduchi mustamala kijala was given from time to time whenever she's thirsty and we had advised her to eat only whenever she's hungry and the portions which she could digest not based on the just the time to have food and also to sleep well and work on the stress management only this much was advised to her and all the uh especially pickles and fried foods that was told to completely avoid okay okay thank you mom thank you for clarifying my doubts and it was really an interesting case that do you manage uh with shamanavshadi that is very interesting uh without shodhana you did a very nice uh uh treatment for her uh thank you mom i'm still reeling from the mind-blowing session
