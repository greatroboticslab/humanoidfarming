 Hello, today's recording is all about the yellow discount balloon. Now if you click on it you get the option for a discount with the diamonds but that's your choice if you wish to accept it or not. Now this video is not really focusing on that, it's more about the balloon. At the moment Tom's holding the string half way up or half way down, your choice. Now as he stands there the string gets higher and higher or basically he's holding less and less until he finally lets go. Now once he lets go you've got the option of clicking on that balloon and bursting it. Try not to let it fly away. Now I don't know if it being low or high gives you a better option but sometimes I get diamonds, sometimes I get XP, sometimes I get a little gift. Now let's see what I get this time as the balloon flies up. Ok I'm going to click on it and it'll go bang. Ah, I got 50 XP. That's ok, I'm not going to complain. Now Tom's finished, I'm going to send him back to sleep and that's Tom's balloon. Thanks very much, bye bye. Here we go. Here we go. Yup. Good to see you. What did you see? Now take it to us. This point we didn't get busy, tightening up. Okay, let's next he Б fellow to you. What did you see? What did you see? Let us grow out! We gave you. We gave you an interesting process of bringing down the balloon obviously
