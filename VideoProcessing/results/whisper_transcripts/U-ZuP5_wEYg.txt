 The reforms to APR and BPR represent just another significant blow to the farming community. And not only the farming community, but small businesses. Your local fishmonger, your local plumber, builder, blacksmith, all these people are going to be affected through the new changes through BPR brought in by Keir Starmer. To bankrupt the stewards of our land into submission to big foreign corporate companies like BlackRock, big henchmen to take the lands of this country and turn it into solar farms, property. The agricultural budget has just been cut by 100 million. So on top of this, farmers now are having to put all their efforts into becoming net zero, even though they only contribute 12% of the CO2 emissions towards the UK. Support the farmers, buy local, and support movements like Together that are trying to enact positive change to a corrupt government.
