 You've likely heard of the famous fainting goats by now, but you probably haven't heard of these guys. They're generally hard workers, I'll give them that. They just fall down more than most folks do. In the middle of the heartland USA, these fainting farmhands put in an honest day's work. But, like their goat counterparts, these two are sometimes, let's just say, perpendicularly challenged. Well, it doesn't take much to spook them. Sometimes it's something as simple as seeing another human, shadow, dragonflies, or even just a light breeze. But as quickly as they fall down, they pop right back up again, back to their daily chores. We tried to talk to these lightheaded laborers, but we didn't get very far. We'll see you then. You can do it here. You can do it here. You can disso the wood with Primary Wealth drauf and zaklat it. You can't do it on the roof and travel after Göring thee.
