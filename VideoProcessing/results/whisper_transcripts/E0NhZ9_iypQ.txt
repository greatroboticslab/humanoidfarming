 This is Latashi with the American Indian Foods Program through the Intertribal Agriculture Council and we really appreciate everyone taking time out of the day to join us for this awesome webinar led by our amazing colleague Stephen Bond. He is our Southern Plains Region IAC Technical Assistance Specialist and he'll be covering small-scale farming techniques and he'll go ahead and share more information about that but I want to let everyone know that we will have a Q&A session towards the end of this webinar. We do have if you can submit all of your questions or even just comments be back in the Q&A chat area or even just in the chat and then we'll revisit towards the last end or the tail end of the webinar. Again thank you guys for joining us so take over Steve. Okay so we're gonna we're gonna just jump into a real broad subject that that traverses a series of crops. I'm gonna set my timer for... Wadi should... are we going 45 minutes and then questions? Yeah we can go ahead and do 45 minutes and then questions after. Okay I'll set a timer because I'm terrible at keeping that. So small-scale farming techniques that's a real broad range. It could involve subsistence production up to you know more commercial definition of a small-scale farm into the $250,000 and proceeds from crop and that's more of a like that's when you get into food safety regulation changes and and and different and a lot different issues and and you know obviously we're gonna and we'll talk about a broad range of equipment. 45 minutes isn't long and so we were gonna continue this discussion and in more of a series format and so in your comments after you know after we've after we've done the talk you may provide provide some ideas for things you would you you want to hear about in more detail. We'll discuss irrigation and we can talk food safety. We can we can talk all kinds of equipment selection and and the actual cultivation techniques your irrigation and greenhouses irrigation and soil so let's let's just get started. Oh let's see all right so I thought I'd pull up this definition of specialty crop production from USDA so you can see where where we're most importantly for us American Indian groups that are doing some novel things they do include wild harvested plants as long as there's a management protocol and so it could be a fire regime that that could bring your your specialty crop into inclusion so it would have access to programs because we're we're also going to try to parallel the talk with with USDA programs and opportunities and although that may be a moving target right now with with the current COVID conditions the there should be a lot of programs still out there in the in this this farm years or this this farm bills budget and it may be some new programs available but hopefully that was enough time for y'all to read that in depth definition there and we've got wild harvested so you can see I bolded in in order for a plant to be considered cultivated we need some form of management for application so in my mind that could be a an IPM strategy in an area or fire or clearing hedge rows in a forest system and I know that this is this would be especially applicable for Alaska folks and I found it fascinating just digging this up I had never just actually pulled up this definition but if y'all if you go back to the the section 101 here you can you can pull up more information on that and in the Agricultural Act of 2014 and and use that at your local offices if maybe if we're doing crop insurance for instance and you've got records of the last three years so so I thought I would I would kind of tackle this and skele scope of equipment because equipment's one of the most important things I'll go right into a discussion of irrigation every small-scale producer or specialty crop producer on the on the on the vegetable and and berry and nut and fruit side is is is going to be tied to the machines except for your your subsistence production and and and and extremely small scale and so so we go from hand tools and small tillage machines and it brings up the classic garden type with a clap with a rear tine tiller I had a craftsman I believe it was like a five horse or or or or maybe a 3.5 horse for years and I used to I would till up a rectangle and you know you you you you have a row of vegetables that was probably 24 or 30 inches and then you run your tiller between for your footpath and another row of vegetables and a lot of us grew up with with that kind of classic garden and and even within that that the tillage machines you can bump it up to a a more of a commercial approach with the BCS and I'm sure most of y'all familiar and we'll talk about BCS in detail that's particular brand of two-wheel tractor I like but there are others and and that's a more intensive cultivation technique and that that gets you into some precision seeding folks that are doing micro scale farming or the micro farming are usually doing stacker planning so not all of one crop is coming on at one time so you do like one tenth of your of your lettuce every week so you're harvesting for the market if y'all have seen paper pot transplanters they're a really great way to plant alliums and to get lettuce out and people are doing all kinds of things with those now they're in a very intensive system you have to have your own trans transplant greenhouse essentially to grow these specific pots in flats that fit into a paper pot transplanter so you need vacuum seeders and and to have quite a bit of foresight to to use those and they're pretty pricey a lot of this BCS specialty equipment is the speedo potato diggers can fit on the larger BCS's and they're also something that would fit work well on a 12 to 35 and they've speedo makes things for for 120 horse tractors so with a BCS you can get into some plastic culture I'll share a link to earth tools and they have video on a series of videos that you can watch on applying plastic culture on for flat ground production and that doesn't work as well for the ridge beds because the BCS is very close to the ground and so you have a limitation there I've started using a a I believe it's a 12 horse Sato beaver Sato tractor and they're they're pretty rare they're they were the predecessors for a lot of the Mitsubishi tractors but 12 12 to 20 horse Mitsubishi tractors are readily available on Craigslist and and used throughout the country and I found them to to usually be in pretty good working order it's just a a solid tractor for market and the these specialized tractors what what sets them apart from from just any other tractor I mean is is really the the configuration and so the the you have narrower tires that are taller so that gives you less waste between the rows allows you to to set taller beds and allows you to go over and cultivate for for for weeds so you can use finger weavers and different three-point attachments on the 12 to 35 horse tractors and on up the the BCS I've got a series of of examples of things I use with that and you can also do some some basic weeding in the front front part of a planting before the plants get tall but but I usually hand hand work those beds so you've got your 35 to 65 that's going to do all of your the everything that a 12 to 35 can do but but but better usually and and you might you might get into some double rowing but but usually not now when I talk about market beds and and cultivation beds we're we're we're usually in the the 28 to 36 range some people do four foot beds but but it's usually going to be a 36 foot bed 32 30 31 inch bed and when it comes out the 65 to 80s you can do a double um uh transplanter so you can have a um it's essentially a a if you if you're not familiar with that we'll pull them up and in the next series we'll we'll have a lot more about equipment and and um initial uh choices as you're developing a farm uh but the these transplanters skirt the ground as a three-point attachment and you can have two people that are pulling transplants off of flats and the water will transplanter makes your dibble um into your bed or a double dibble and you put your plant in the ground and so you can traverse acres uh very very um very quickly and less painstakingly and of course 80 and up um you know there's all kinds of specialty equipment and those scales and um and we it'd still be within the the context of this talk um for small scale producers um but but we're getting into some very you know you could also have large large scale production at the 65 up um you just may have multiple tractors so um especially crop production is kind of how i'm going to frame this going forward um is very site specific it's very regional program accessibility can vary regionally for instance if you were in um oh the uh in vermont and decided you were going to grow sweet potatoes and peaches they they may look at you cross um or or vice versa if you were in southern texas and you were going to grow um see fox grapes and you know you're you're probably not going to get any um assistance from from your usda office because those crops aren't aren't um regularly grown in those counties and so they so the um for um most most particularly insurance is what i'm what i'm mostly talking about but um you're not going to be able to insure your crops if that's something that people don't grow now if you find that you're you're trying to insure a crop that folks don't you know that we're not normally insuring in that county and you can find um you can go three counties out they can do an average well if you're outside of that scope um then you have your own records you you can use your own records and so it's not a dead end but um typically um you'll find when you find a peach producing region you'll find many producers producing one one type of crop or a lot of peaches because you also need secondary processing and so you're going to sell a lot of those peaches as as beautiful specimens right in a box um out the door but you're also going to have a lot that had bug damage or or or don't meet the food safety guidelines if they fell on the ground and that that you're going to want to try to recover some income on and secondary processing is important for that reason um irrigation is incredibly important for for um even the smallest commercial scale production um and so we're we're generally talking a 60 cubic acre feet for for vegetables that's a lot of water um the wells that you'll see on a on a on a 10 acre plus site um are going to be in the 100 to 300 gallons per minute and so that's a commercial um irrigation well and you just don't get that water just anywhere and so um um beyond that um the the depending on what type of crop you're going to grow we would we would engineer entirely different irrigation systems and and head houses and packing sheds and everything's going to be site specific and so um so the it's good to be um think thinking about i know some of y'all are already in production and some of y'all are are are we're putting together an operation amidst all all of this um um change um and and are are facing some challenges uh getting seed and different products right now but but the um if we think about how we're setting up an operation and we engineer it um for a five to ten year plan that's going to save us a lot of headache going down and it's going to increase our inclusivity into some of these programs and so i on this bottom point or second to the bottom i'd said required two out of the last five to qualify for assistance um for irrigation we can start irrigating um in a beginning farm operation and we we want to take records and if we're doing farm food safety we're going to be taking records anyways because that's going to be part of a farm food plan and that's beyond the scope of this talk but we might include some of that as well and so um nrcs will help you design irrigation specific to your region crop soil type environment they'll take in account transpiration and infiltration rates and and help you through that process which can be great greatly beneficial but they they also are usually akin to designing the larger scale systems so um so what we're looking at right now and hopefully y'all are seeing the same thing as i um is a this is a small scale raised bed system i was setting up for trellising um tomatoes and i had had a intern that year and we'd set up an irrigation system so you can see in the bottom right corner we have a water box and and i raised the pvc out of the ground so i could do um a venturi pump um where i would where you use a a vacuum pressure as the water goes through the tube to deliver the supply line you're pulling a percentage of us of a fertilizer solution and we'll go into depth on that on that type of technique which can be you know really simple and a great way to get distributed fertilizer for small scale production um here's another picture up close to the the box so this one just has one um one solenoid you can see down in the box it's black with an inline filter and we were just getting started on this and um here's matt running out the drip line this is poly tube um i use this on smaller scale systems and community gardens because it's more um it's not indestructible but it can take a whack from a hoe or or if you get too close to it with a till or you know sometimes it'll live but um i use a lot of um lay flat for a connection instead of pvc on your on your supply line and um on on the commercial systems and we use a lot of a tape because you can roll tape out on a three-point hitched over your tractor and i've got i've got some pictures of um of a of my little beaver sateau laying an acre of plastic ultra and some drip line to show you all too so i i adapted a bcs um plastic culture machine which i don't i didn't really like it so i'm not um giving it a huge recommendation but um with some modification it's it turned out to be a pretty decent machine so here's just um a picture uh of me sitting down in the trench we've we've trenched out our our um all of our delivery line because there's a lot of activity on the farm and so that way we we didn't run the risk of busting a pipe by running over it um and and also um the we have freeze here in oklahoma so i'm located and um and this picture is near strafford oklahoma but but um we you know our we we have to locate our supply lines a foot below ground to 14 inches um here's some more um variable variability when you're designing irrigation i just put this up as a um more of a a consideration there's the sole type your ph all these all these things go in designing your your farm and where you're at kind of dictates what you can grow based on the the hardiness map and and so um for for those of you all that haven't visited this in a while um it's got a cleaner detail so you can get down to the county level and um we're um we're working with the farm up in um gacquillo farms uh near irving new mexico new york um and they're in a microclimate and it's and so it actually shows that so um they're in um two two zones separate uh from from uh your typical growing environment up there and are able to to get away with a lot more um cool varieties so we'll just briefly touch in farm food safety there's a lot of online uh opportunities for training i'd say take it because it beats setting in a room for an entire day um you know of their of their choosing so you can do it from the comfort of your home and here's the produce safety alliance website um they also have some wonderful information on the the national good agricultural practices because when we're doing specialty crop production we've also got to consider what we're going to do with with the produce and and um by um although the the um fisma regulations and the produce produce safety um aspect of of of food safety is is required as certain scales most of us on this call would probably be exempt um if we're going to market our produce the gap or the national good agricultural practices isn't required by law um but more so um enforced by by industry and so a lot of folks won't buy your produce unless they're gap certified so if you're a certain size um the um i'll just read this verbatim for the purpose of part 112 a covered farm um that would be meaning you have to um abide by the fisma guidelines and and and and go through the food safety training um on a rolling basis the average annual monetary value of the produce on the farm sold during the previous three years is more than 25 but not no more than 250 000 then then you would be defined as a very small business and have to take this produce um food safety class and and um and follow follow those guidelines um here's the compliance states you can see that those had been rolling out and um at a um and there was some change um but the the crux of of of the farm food safety for for us very small farmers is um aid are we even growing something that's regularly consumed raw um because if we're not then then we they're non-covered crops and we we don't have to follow the the fisma guidelines on non-covered crops so here's a list it's an extensive list and here's the covered produce list um so these are the ones that would um have you in that class and have you doing a farm food safety plan and taking water quality tests and so it's gonna basically it's gonna increase your your record requirements which you may already be doing if you're trying to get into an organic standards protocol um or you're doing gap certification they're although they're different they're they're all moving in the same direction um so this would involve you know maintaining compost and keeping record um developing your standard operating procedures um having a a clean uh a clean sign-in sheet for bathrooms and and just writing down some of your your your mixing procedures and techniques and including that into your farm food safety plan which is also going to be site-specific for everyone and so we can go more into that um but i i thought it would be fun to introduce some of these two-wheel tractors and small-scale equipment um that i regularly use and have gotten out all over indian country and we're going to come back to these um web links and i i yeah i think it's gonna let me click them so we'll see if that happens if not i'll just pull up a website and share the share that screen but um earth tools they're i believe they're in kentucky and and um they're very knowledgeable about bcs and these small-scale equipment they've been utilizing them for um for for 20 plus years and and they were the first to bring uh some of these little italian tractors and and strange european gadgets to the u.s and i've had some bad experience with with other other um other folks throughout the country that are selling these and not knowledgeable because um one thing you'll um you already know if you're a specialty crop producer um it's specialized and and you can't just go out and buy the tool um always to to to make the um the particular row or the cultivation technique you need so it it sometimes it involves a welder or a very least a hammer um and earth tools it does a great job of getting you the the um the the parts that you need to add to to get to get going and and um joel's a wonderful resource and we'll get online with you and go through your problems um buckeye tractor company is going to be that next intermediary um level where we're going to get out of a two-wheel tractor or a very small 12 horse and we're going to be in to the up to the 6080 into the hundreds but they have some great implements for that 20 horse range as well as the 6080 range that we'll talk about more specifically um so this is a john deere 332 and it's a it's got a a um a kohler diesel engine on it and it's got a three-point hitch and there's front hydraulics and it's not what we think of as a farm tractor but but um these were some of the first estate tractors that john deere put out and their collector's items and i've i am i just i just gifted uh my uh partner in crime and and horticulture um one of these so he could have it at his place because i've got the beaver's toe and and we we lease a tractor uh you know when we need it when we're doing infrastructure development but but but this was a great machine and um you see this is a three-point hitch with a spray tank and i used that for a couple years here's the beaver's toe and we've got a a nice landscape rake on it that we use to clear off beds sometimes and just around the farm um i've got four acres where the where a lot of these photos are shot and um there's over 38 pecan trees there so um here's the the beaver's toe out at the ranch and we're putting in an acre of plastic culture and you can see this is us getting started and we've got some some barbell weights on the front and we ended up putting a log across the plastic culture machine just to get the right weight but um this was in heavy clay and plastic culture does not like heavy clay it's these techniques are usually site-specific and developed for purpose and and so you're going to be um you know a lot of the the plastic culture techniques were developed in in um arizona and california to to control precipitation um in addition to excluding weeds and um but the there you know they were developed around a sandy soil and in general it's ill-advised to to plant uh vegetables and anything but a sandy loam um but if if clay's what we got we work with it when there's some things we can do so i i bought this um this is a little uh uh mini ditch witch or mini skid steer and i use the heck out of this thing for for market farm skill all the time um so this is actually a truckload of um of nice soil amendment that we're putting on a community garden site and i was able to level that out and a little longer than it would have took me um doing with the tractor turning around and stuff but also it was too small to site to get a a regular skid steer in or and and not us you know not warranted with that scale of soil amendment um okay this is a a grillo two-wheeled tractor with a power haro and you can see in the background this is a tiny little thing i think it's eight horse um but in really soft soil it was able to to put up these raised beds that we've that we utilize in in this part of oklahoma i i switched to a pretty tall raised bed several years back because we get all of our spring rain um all all at once and um and it's i can usually plant before all the rains come in but then the seeds drowned out if you're planting our ancestral crops um you know like our like our corn varieties and beans and squash sometimes they would mold or rot in the ground so this this um heats up the soil faster um it provides a dry basin around a perimeter um to to act to act as a water uh catchment um and and i i think it minimizes the weeds i don't but it's they've they've been really great i've since i'm just kind of i do a 31 inch version of these now and we don't do these larger ones anymore um here's a bcs and here's a great introduction to a bcs because without modification and and putting on the correct tires the wheel extensions and all the things that you're going to need and weighting it down correctly it's just a big tiller and so right here you can see we've got a um their old style the old earth tools style wheel extension and what that does is that sets your 31 inch bed and so now your tires are on the outside of the bed and so you're going to take those off when you're doing like regular soil tillage or or heavy soil work there's ripper bars and all kinds of things for these little bcs units but when you're when you're doing bed work if you're doing precision seating or you're going to run a power haro you're going to have to have these will extensions and i've got a detailed invoice of a bcs purchase we just made recently so that'll give you an idea of cost and we can go over that in a second so here's a bird of rotary plow it's just a different kind of program on the bcs and and it's on the um this bcs is an 853 diesel and it has the old lomborghini diesel engines in it because i've had it forever but um um here's the here's the 853 with a tool bar these are the aldo biggioni toolbars and they um they'll they they accept a wide range of implements so the you see the big hunk of of of metal in the center that's attached to the to the bcs is one piece and then you can change out the tool bar toolbars um this is set up in a in a mound or a bed setter i i think that's what they call it or bed ridger um so we've got um opposing 45 degree angle disc on the outsides of the beds to set our 31 inch beds we're probably setting potato beds right now and i've got some weight on it just to keep it keep it straight and so if you find yourself with with uh swiggly lines you probably need more weight and so you can see we're fully weighted these have weighted tires and so i believe there's an additional 40 plus pounds of weighted foam in the tires so you don't have flats and that's an upgrade you can get through bcs i don't know if other folks do that um and then i've got a weight bar mounted to the the bolts of the of the tire well so i can slip barbell weights over it so i didn't have to buy specialized tractor weights and um and there's an additional 40 50 pounds on each of the tires so there's about 100 pounds on each of the tires and then we have the weights on the toolbar so anyways um we'd set the beds and now i'm coming through with uh um i i wish you could see it so i have that same hunk of red metal on the bcs but now i've got a a a ridger or a a plow um it's a a middle buster some people call it and so it makes a large furrow down the center and you can see um amanda in the background is dropping potatoes um and and then we'll come back over and and i don't have that photo but let's see let's go back yeah we'll i'll come back over with that same toolbar that's in this photo and we'll scoop the the disc in you know six to eight inches on either side and cover over our potatoes and we can plant an acre of potatoes in four to six hours and so that's pretty impressive work you know with the small crew um and so here's here's the potatoes growing on a 31 inch bed system which is you know kind of tied into that micro scale farming um this is uh later in spring us digging these first potatoes and with the bcs potato digger um and it's the well it's the aldo biggione potato digger and you can see so that's a that's your middle buster type plow but it has bars coming up so the potatoes go through it and it's it's pretty inefficient and it requires a lot of um you know hand labor but they're cheap and you can grow some potatoes fast um the speedo makes a excellent potato digger and i should have put their link on here but i'll tell you it's on everything implements they sell those little speedo potato diggers and i'll talk more about them in in subsequent videos so this is a a two this is a jp3 um precision seater and what i'm holding in my hand and my left hand is uh what i call the pucks and it's got little divots all around what looks like a hockey puck and in my right hand is the seed hopper and there's a a a felted um shoot and a spring and you're dropping one seed at a time um as you move forward a chain um cranks that that puck and you grab a seed and you drop it and you can see and just above that manila envelope um there's a shoe um and that makes your little furrow and then the the black will that that my partner in crime is touching um that that presses the soil down and this is a an incredible machine they're pretty expensive um but you can put a this is the jp3 with a with the two with two hoppers you can get a jp6 and a jp6 wide and you can on a 31 inch bed you can do seven six or seven rows of tot soy or arugula um carrots you know you'd probably be more in the in the in the four range on a 31 inch bed but depending on where you're at but there it's a great way for precision seeding because if you know as you all well know seed is expensive for these specialty crops and um and it it saves you time from going back and weeding it out so for instance we can put we can drop um any of the mustard family arugula tot soy um any of the tiniest little seeds every two and a half inches and it just it just helps the plants get established and it's really nice um here's uh that jp3 out at um with deb echo hawk at pawnee we did a little a little installation um and so okay here's the bcs again with the power the power haros um the power haros do a um horizontal tillage whereas um a tiller does vertical tillage so a tiller goes into the soil cuts and kicks it back up the power haros just spin on the top of the surface and so they're they're what you would use to to just knock down some weeds so for instance we'll we'll set our beds like we're ready to plant wait a week and then i'll come over with the power haro and knock out a huge percentage of the weeds and it greatly reduces our weed pressure and they make an exquisite seed bed and so if you're going to use the jp3 or any of the precision seeders and they've got some very fancy small scale vacuum seeders now that are in the six to eight thousand dollar range um you can you would use the power haro before you did that and they do make power haros for 35 horses and and up and they're they're pretty expensive but a phenomenal piece of equipment um you can also use it as a rock um a rock rake um but well okay so here's some beds that we set um several years ago in eagle butte south dakota and um there's an acre of beds and you can see we're laying out our our our um our our pvc for our water infrastructure and this was watered on on a zone because even though i you know i said earlier like ideally you have the 80 to 100 gallons per minute not everyone does and some people are on city and some people have a 30 gallon per minute well or um we you know that's one of the first things i ask folks um we can engineer holding tanks and and put timers on your pump where it runs um off hour but it will run you know through throughout the night and filling a tank and then we can use that tank and sometimes a pumping station or gravity flow um to get out and and an acre of of um of double drip um at 0.6 gallons per minute um on the emitters um point point six gallons per hour sorry in the emitters and the um the um the um prevent vegetable cultivation can be done on a on a 30 gallon per minute well um it's just we we'd have to look at at your um at your variables and we we can do that um so here's the bcs jpeg or the j the jb3 um a lot of irrigation and things going out to do a demo and you can see i've it's got this fit into an old f-150 um here's with our will extensions and um we're we're setting our beds um here's a a scale of beds and these fine ladies were were planting um ancestral seed and so they wanted to do it by hand and um they're they're planting the seed and packing it in um okay so now we've got um i'm i'm just gonna keep going and i'll come back to this page um okay yeah so the only thing that's left as far as slides are we doing on time all right we got eight minutes and 30 seconds um we're um we'll pull the earth tools and tell me bring your okay um i think i'm gonna have to get out of there and go back to sharing this this page and make it pull a little bit more of a little bit more of a little bit more of a little bit more of a little bit okay so our hopefully we're all looking at the earth tool page right now um now these guys are going to be extremely busy as are anyone um in in in ag um right now and um there's going to be some you know timelines to get equipment um typically in a in a in a in a schedule um you you do what you can you know if you're going to start in fall you start in fall if you're going to start in summer you start in summer but in an ideal world um you would be thinking about this in spring or summer and and so you can get some herbicide out if you're going to um knock knock your weeds down in the non-organic way um or get your um all your your your cover out so you can suppress them with with a weed suppression cloth or plastic um in the fall and and you would have already done a lot of your um soil incorporation if you're using manures and and bed setting and getting ready to go for your spring um season and and um but that didn't always work that way but um you know so we're going to be buying our seed and getting our irrigation components and things together um in in october um for the spring season but um so anyways that's a way to avoid the delays um let's go to the walk behind tractors just real quick and so you can see right here um that we've got bcs brands and grillo brands i've demonstrated a few of those i'll go um the 853 is is is still here but they're harder to to get um a lot of folks go with the 749 and it's essentially the same tractor but it's more of a hydrostatic or wet clutch system versus the dry clutch system of the 853 and that's just what i prefer um most importantly talk to the folks about what you're going to be growing and so if you're talking if you're buying equipment from someone that doesn't understand your your um your crop needs your your soul types um they're probably just trying to sell you equipment and you know and not a really good vendor for uh for any equipment they should they should have some ideas but there's some great videos here um we could we can pull this up and see hi there joel with our tools here and we're going to walk through the new tractor setup on bcs 749 walk behind track i could think of more exciting things to do um than the setup video but but you see there's there's a lot of videos here um we are going to go down there's more product videos on this this green bar right now we can get a 13 horsepower honda gas engine manual start for four four thousand four hundred and forty um the electric starts recommended on these bigger engines a 13 horse gas engine is not too difficult i highly recommend the diesel engines most recently there was a law that's keeping us from accessing the italian diesel engines and so if you can find one used go for it all right so i know that we're counting down on our time four minutes let's pull up i'm going to go out of here and and leave this to y'all product videos there's a whole myriad of videos they have bell wrappers and and sickle bar mowers for these things and you guys just enjoy that let's see if we can go to um buckeye tractor company and so it's um www.buckeye online um that's not the one that we want so i'm just going to type in um buckeye buckeye and well so a lot of these guys uh the websites are not all that great um because they're really good at making implements but their websites um you know aren't aren't the modern easy to use websites this website is a resource so on these videos there's a myriad of techniques demonstrated um they're in ohio they have exquisite implements that they make on site and they can custom make you anything um so we can go through here you see they have two different catalogs there's a 25 to 80 horsepower catalog and then there's the junior catalog we got a multi-roll catalog so that's going to be for your for your 75 to 250 they say and then the garden series that's going to be more of your your 20 horse range um and so this is for your four-wheel tractors and um i've seen their their production facility and it's really nice um let's go into the um just their standard catalog and um you'll see if you go to disk betters um this reads like a instruction manual disk betters rough embeds to establish furrows it has a lot of great information and i highly recommend it if you're just getting into this type of cultivation to go through this website start from the beginning and and just learn um learn the scale and and school techniques and and and their videos are amazing so we're i think we're probably the question time if we want to do that yeah definitely so let me see i don't know if you were able to view the questions but we have something submitted through the chat section um from natalie should have you have you seen alternatives of single use drip plastic irrigation for small scale farmers okay um let me so have i seen will you read that for me one more time so sorry no you're totally fine it um said or she asked have you seen alternatives of single use drip plastic irrigation for small scale farmers okay so so there um i don't know what you mean by alternative um the so you can special order netfm um and and and rainbird and in smaller scale because when i buy a roll of of drip tape it's going to be a 4 000 plus foot roll and they're really hard to handle and i'm assuming that's what you mean um so you you can order 100 foot rows um or um or 500 foot rows it's it's going to cost more but it's going to be better than something we would pick up at a at a um at a local um garden center such as lowe's or home depot now that being said um rainbird has has some um a a really good website and they cater to more residential and and and very small scale um and so you might find something on the rainbird website and in all their irrigation components um the i think that they're the poly i don't think that they do the the the throwaway um the dig is another um very residential um small scale more garden size but they sell it at home depots and lowe's and tractor supplies and atwoods or whatever you got um locally so that could be um that could be a a a way to get some irrigation line um at that smaller scale and i i bet you can you know google drip tape and small scale soaker hoses aren't efficient um for for any scale at all really and you would be running it at a short time um some people would maybe use a um pvc with a hole i mean there's you could get creative but but that's that's the hopefully that answers the question i'm gonna try to pull these questions up too so um um you're fine yeah if if anyone wants any to ask any additional questions you could hover over and raise your hand or um place your questions in the chat q a section and and specifically like the um the the types of crops you're growing and um is there a is there a great interest in greenhouse production because we didn't we didn't cover much greenhouse production but we can talk about high tunnels and um cat tunnels and hydroponic production facilities and i mean if you want to still we're at that very small scale well to a commercial operator that can mean a couple hundred thousand dollars so we would be into a more of a hydroponic production system um and you know in in a uh um three hundred thousand dollar uh budget range but but um but the the cat tunnels folks um are really digging right now as opposed to the infrastructure demands of uh of the high tunnels and we can now use that nrcs uh equip high tunnel incentive to to do cat tunnels and um although i imagine it very state by state they're also facilitating irrigation um development sorry that the chickens have started to grow um in any any specific questions okay so we got a hydroponic greenhouse info um so excellent so we we will um we will probably tackle a hydroponic greenhouse in its own session um because then we can talk about um automation which is killer and and required um to to to really do a good hydroponic system we can essentially you you have you know you're going to have temperature controlled water um with hydroponics you're going to have a nutrient solution that's going to be monitored regularly and you're going to have solenoids with sensors that maintain a certain total dissolved solution and your ph buffers on another sensor so they can they can adjust your ph simply um the we can go with beto buckets in the larger crops tomatoes and zucchinis and peppers um but what what folks are finding is that it's even it's less expensive to start with plastic bags and a soilless medium and you do a non-recovery form of hydroponics and um you know with with that being said you can use a venturi pump instead of a nutrient solution tank and go on the cheap and get something going um when you get into the leafy greens and herbs and things you're you're going to be into a nutrient drip technology um and those are they kind of look like rain gutters and i've seen some folks actually retrofit rain gutters to a hydroponic system but you're going to have a thin film of nutrient solution going through a gutter system in a recovery flow and water temperature is especially critical for for lettuce um more so than than maybe even the actual greenhouse temperature but um we can talk about that we'll we'll also we'll have we'll we'll do a session section or session on um just working in high tunnels i've got a lot of great photos and some resources for that um the bcs is obviously a great uh accompaniment to a high tunnel operation setup um i don't always um uh advise high tunnels it's it's they're very site-specific and um and depending on the model and kit that you get so if you'll have questions y'all can y'all can reach out to me um um and and tell me about where you're at um your your growing zone and and the crops you're trying to grow and what's your water um source and um and soul type i don't know if i said that but but all those things we can uh make recommendations site-specific so um oh venturi for the uh reservation tank instead of an air pump um yeah the the venturi's are are very simple um so essentially um it's a a a siphon pump jet um is another word for them um the if you google venturi siphon pump jet you'll you'll be able to to get all kinds of great info and you buy a specific venturi for your fertilizer um requirements and um they're they're they're fit in line and you usually have a bypass so so you can um run from a solution tank um with the venturi so um which would mean you would mix up your your fertilizer to like a one one hundredth in a five gallon tank and put a little tube over it you turn your timer on and as you're watering your crops you're gonna you're gonna be fertilizing at the same time and that's a really powerful thing and they can get especially fancy with pumping stations over you know 20 acre scale or 200 acre scale but but uh but the the the principle is the same and that's there's something to be said about that like the um a micro farm is using the only thing micro about it it's not the revenue generation it's not the amount of work and we're using micro scale um techniques that are that are the same techniques that are being applied in the in the massive thousand acre fields in california but it's just a specialized equipment that's honed in i'm sure y'all are familiar with um sean martin oh right now market gardener never sink farm a lot of the guys that do these online training courses are providing free training courses or free sessions and so i would recommend looking at them and getting on the facebook groups um the i might have a link um but just google the market gardener and never sink farm and you'll um you'll get to those sites and they have some great micro scale technique elliott coleman um four season gardening that's a great book to pull up um for the folks that like books the market gardener actually has a great book too i don't know if never sinks but went out yet um and there's a lot of other great um teachers and and in the world of agriculture people that like to share their techniques so steven there was another question in the chat box from kathleen she just asks can you do aqua in a greenhouse aqua in a greenhouse okay so she may be um wanting to to know about how to um to do irrigation in a greenhouse is that is that your interpretation of the question was it aqua aqua oh yeah aqua yep yeah yeah yeah so um so we can talk about that um um netafim is is um here i'm gonna pull up i can never remember um so netafim is a is a great resource for for greenhouse uh micro scale production they've got some some great emitters and we could i think a whole session on um on uh greenhouse for soil um could cover you know with that cut that topic would be in in there and um we could do that but but meanwhile let's pull up um i am just forgetting the name of of my irrigation supplier um so let me see if i can pull them up really fast i um so they're a pretty big outfit i just berry hill so sorry about that and so i recommend it's um it's b-e-r-r-y hill drip dot com and so i would go to berry hill drip dot com um they have they're a great outfit and they work really hard to get your stuff as soon as you can because every day is critical especially in irrigation and what i'm using right now is a netafim micro micro micro tubing and and so i i use a a half inch supply line in the small greenhouses and then we punch holes and pop in these these micro fittings and they have all of it on on this website and they go to uh related products and so we'll put a 0.5 gallon per hour emitter um um on on our on our poly bags and the ground um for when we're doing our seeds and seedlings uh drip it may be too difficult for me to get to every component because there's a lot of a lot of stuff but but they have a it's a wobble sprinkler that's for micro scale and they're very forgiving if you've got a little bit of sand in your soil um they pop on and off you can clean them and rinse them real fast and they have uh um some nice design manuals on netfm to help you with with that and i'll i'll make references to those in that session um so we can get you all going where you can design your own systems um but essentially low psi if you're doing a greenhouse i highly recommend a sand filter um just because you're going to be dealing with these type of micro heads and and irrigation components um the uh it's plug and play really it's pretty straightforward i usually have my my supply lines um on the outside of the greenhouse i'm going going in for bags with walkways down the center um you know depending on what crop you're growing i would make different recommendations for different specialized uh wobble sprinklers so um so would you advise what advice would you have for composting so um follow a a protocol um on composting um the the to to ensure food safety and also to ensure really good quality compost you're going to spend the compost or bucket with a tractor or your your forks and it depends on where you're at so you can go to a university extension guide and type in university extension composting and they'll have some detailed instruction on timelines if you've taken the the the produce safety alliance um training for for the produce safety rule um it talks about the the need to record those um those bucking events and and the frequency that you that you tend your compost um and then um compost um i mean essentially where i'm applying compost is for the heavy feeders and a lot of our our our our spring crops our our spring crops our heavy feeders a lot of the greens um um
