 well nothing in here hey good morning everybody this is organic dierman how's everybody doing today hope everybody's doing great i'm doing fine today is friday march i think march 27th i gotta look at my phone because the days just whip by so fast anymore yep march 27th so anyways guys please don't forget to go ahead hit the like button subscribe to the channel and tap that notification bell so that way you know as soon as i post a new video and it is somewhat of a beautiful day out i guess it's not the temperature wise it's not too bad and just a little cloudy and dreary but yeah i'm just doing my normal stuff here in the morning okay um we're all done with all the milking chores and stuff so we're getting ready the vets gonna be coming here pretty soon but we need to get um some equipment set up because uh well we gotta do some preg checking we gotta preg check the cows preg check some of the heifers the bread heifers just to make sure the ones that that that we bred fairly recently like within i don't know like 30 days that we could see if they're pregnant or not so anyways we gotta use this gotta unhook this so we can hook this up to that woman or spreader we just gotta fix up because we kind of need it is a use it as a barricade or just thing to kind of direct the cattle into the dry cow shed so we get the the heifers in the head gate and he can check them so i'm gonna get this thing unhooked and i gotta get the jack and a block of wood and uh yeah so that's something i do here today oh it's such a nice day i do hate working cattle i really hate moving cattle around and working them it's not my most favorite job not only that but today i just feel really sluggish i felt like i just got ran over by an 18 wheeler that's how i've kind of felt all morning i don't know why but i don't know maybe it's been trying to do yesterday was a long day that's all i can say oh it was a long day aha aha okay we got the i got it backed up there and the idea is the heifers are out there so we got to run them through here and we're going to corral them in here run them into the dry cow shed and run them in the head gate and pregnancy check them that is the idea here what we're going to do but we just need this to kind of close this up like i said corral them in there because there's the head gate the dry cows here we know they're pregnant so they're going to go in the switch cow pen that's the pen where we do switch cows that's where they go so we'll run them in there that's where they'll stay we run the heifers up here they need to be preg checked and and if i get my brother over there that's sitting on his phone playing on his phone hey pat want to come over here and help get these dry cows in the pen you gotta help me get these dry cows in the pen over here gotta get them off his phone well i guess the vet he ain't gonna be coming for about another hour yet i thought my brother's he was coming at two and it's like 10 minutes to two right now so i guess i misunderstood him but anyways i guess we'll have this ready right the time he comes so in the meantime i'm gonna work at some of the feeding chores i'm gonna feed the dry cows and then load the feeder wagon for the young stock and work at that so we'll get that done at least so but hopefully the other bred heifers will come they'll work their way up here and we'll be able to get them preg checked and get that job done out of the way but it's nice to know if they're pregnant so if they're not some of them might just go down the road or you know go for slaughter so i don't know today if i'm gonna get that thing out of here now i really want to get that tractor out of here and get it power washed but to do that i obviously have to move this bagger out of the shed to get that out so well we'll keep it going work with the feeding and see well i guess i changed my mind i think i'm gonna i'm gonna feed uh the the young stock first instead of the dry cows and yeah then before i feed the heifers we'll run them out of their lot always feed them they won't want to leave their lot so i guess that's what we're gonna do here first i'll just work at feeding the young stock and then with the dry cows last okay i'm gonna quick feed the the bread heifers lot and get that done so we can uh the vats still not here yet okay we got uh the bread heifers locked in there and my brother he's gonna take that and back it up there because sometimes they like to crowd here in this corner and this gate isn't very good we need to replace it someday they'll pop off and they'll all run out so we don't want that to happen so it's not a good thing if they do that but we gotta sort out the ones that gotta get prague checked here so that's what we're gonna do we got all the vets here they're working at prague checking in the barn here so that's what they're doing i think they're doing today's the 26th or something right 27th oh there's pierwszy Come on girls. Okay, we're all done. Craig checking now, we just gotta do some vaccinations and it'll be done for today. We're gonna park this spreader here. Some place, we're still gonna need it here, yeah? Some place. Nope, not there. Come on girls. I guess I gotta get a hook in that. I guess I'll be right back. I guess I'll be right back. Okay, we're all done working with the cattle. There's still a lot of a group of calves that we do need to move yet, but it's not that important. We have to get it done today, so it's getting kind of late. It's like 7 o'clock basically. And so we're not gonna move those other calves, we'll do it another day when we got more time. So probably not gonna be tomorrow because tomorrow's gonna be colder and windy, rainy, kind of a miserable day. Well eat fast bike and looking cold. We were driving. Bye, bye. Merry Christmas Tour! okay um i just got done loading the feeder wagon for the milk cows i'm gonna grab a bite to eat quick and uh my brother he's gonna clean the barn he just had something to eat a little bit ago and so yeah he's gonna do that clean the barn and my nephew he's out there helping too and then i'm gonna grab a bite to eat and we're gonna feed in the barn actually my youngest brother he just he left he went back down to his house he needed to check on his house and he just wanted to see his visit his girlfriend girlfriend too so and uh and i told him he's gonna come back but i told him just be careful be careful don't stop in any places be careful just just be careful i said because it's the last thing we want we don't want to bring back anything back here because obviously we can't afford to get sick with that coronavirus because we got cows to milk we can't we can't afford to be laid up this whole or should say this covid 19 um yeah so we this whole thing is kind of scary i don't know how it's going to be but i just have to trust in the lord that everything is going to be fine and he's gonna god has a plan and all this i don't know what it is but yeah so anyways guys i gotta eat something and uh it is very it's a very very nice evening out uh tomorrow it's gonna be different windy rainy and colder maybe a little snow in there too i don't know but it's not gonna be as pleasant as it was today so anyways guys i will see you tomorrow hey good morning everybody it is another day and guess what it's not uh not raining out it's not snowing the wind is blowing just a little bit i see that it's out of the northeast so it must be a low pressure system coming through usually that's what makes the wind come out of the northeast so my grandpa used to have a saying the northeast wind is neither fit for man or beast i think that holds true sometimes that wind could be a nasty wind out of the northeast at least in this part of the world it does not very it's not a very pleasant wind but but when is this picking up a little bit here but uh yeah anyway i started up that tractor there because when we had it there it kind of was a calf block barricade barricade thing and so i'm just uh getting it uh started up warming up i'm gonna move it out of there just so it's out of there and and then here in a little bit we got a guy he's gonna be coming and getting a bull calf um the guy he's a local guy he just he just buys all of our bull calves because obviously we have no need for him you know so we just this guy he's he likes to buy him so we sell him to him and that's that so anyways what's gonna go on here today i don't really know everything that's gonna all happen here it's kind of one of those days where you just kind of make it up well i do know there might be one thing here i have to do today um my cousin one of my cousins i was gonna say my cousin john he called me up yesterday he's got a fuel leak on his john deere 7520 anyways he wanted me to come over there and look at that and see what's going on for sure with that and uh so i might go over there and look at that today but depending on what happens with the weather and time but yep and there's no going to church because obviously today is saturday the 28th so there's no going to church because they don't have church anymore with this you know pandemic thing going on and anyways i gotta get going here finish up my stuff here i gotta weigh up my minerals and then we gotta go milk some cows and see what all happens here today is kind of a some days you kind of play them by ear and just see what happens okay um working at the feeding chores like i always do every day anyways yeah working on feeding chores and munching on some old rotted becker popcorn again and so far the rain has been holding off and um just kind of spitting out the wind is still you know picked up a little bit more out of the northeast but just just real light just kind of like i say just spitting out so um i haven't heard anything from my cousin john yet about going and looking at his track um i know we were gonna try to i was gonna try to look something up on youtube see if there's a youtube video on it but i doubt but there could be you never know what's on youtube sometimes and i do that sometimes when i have a question about something i look it up to see how to fix something sometimes you find it that's what our vet yesterday when i bet was there he was telling about he had a ford it was a ford flex yeah he had trouble with it um all of a sudden his daughter took a long road trip with it back um she went down to car rattle or something she came back and just anyway she had parked outside the next day was gonna drive it into the garage and he just just got in the garage and the vehicle died he didn't know what it was so he looked it up on youtube but um he found a video on it it was some i don't know if it was some fuel relay switch or something anyways he had a junked ford flex so he just took that right out of that put it in there and fired it right up so like i say you never know what you're gonna find on youtube sometimes how to fix things okay everybody i'm back oh i got the feeder wagon loaded for the milk house and i'm kind of winded because i was running up here to show you the sunset there it goes another day almost gone

didn't get any rain yesterday just just spit out a little bit that was about it so yeah i'm just working here at the feeding chores actually just getting going with the feeding chores here and my back feels a whole lot better today i don't know i think a lot of my back bothered me it was it was stress related i think um actually yesterday when i finished up the last video segment there i uh took an advil today i rested for a little bit and just laid down on the couch and rested my back and after that i just felt a whole lot better i just needed to relax i was so tensed up yesterday i don't know just a lot of this whole coronavirus thing and and then get the farm work done i guess everything kind of just stressed me out but anyway so yeah and i am gonna try i would like to get my tractor out here today i have to move this thing ahead this bagger head to do it and then i think i could get it out if i just drive it ahead let's hook this tractor up the bagger and pull it ahead and drive it out because i really would like to get a power wash today is a nice day so we'll see what we get done here today and uh go from there and hopefully we can get it done or at least get it i like at least get it out because oh if this weather keeps up we're gonna it's not gonna be too much longer we're gonna be ready to go out in the field so okay i am just putting the feed the high moisture corner on the feed wagon where are the milk cows uh mixing it is part of the blend anyways when my brother comes back i think i'm gonna have him clean these windows in here my brother that down that went back to check on his house he's supposed to be coming back i think on tuesday so anyways i'm gonna work at this here just a little bit and then i'm gonna see if i can quick move that tractor around get my 720 out here just a little bit okay guys i'm in the shed here and i am gonna quick um get this bagger pulled ahead so i get the tractor out i'm just gonna do that before i and then i'm gonna get down with this i'm gonna go back finish loading up the feeder wagon for the cows but um just so everybody can hear it i'll start up the tractor and then i'll put you on time lapse watch the rest i figure you all want to hear this thing start up so i'll set you guys right here and you can watch let me start this uh first oooh Okay, I just parked this thing over here for now because hopefully, I know, maybe tomorrow I'll get time to do it, but maybe not. I don't know. We've got to take care of some business at the bank tomorrow, I know, so we'll see if we get time to do it tomorrow. Maybe when my brother comes back, I'll get some time to power wash this off. But I would like to work in the power steering. They fixed the leak on here, and I almost forgot about this problem. I've got to get this fixed here too. This lever here, there's a snap ring down below that's got to come off. I've got to take the shifting quad and I don't have to do that. But yeah, it needs a good bath. And two, if you don't know, if you're new to the channel, I've got to replace the carburetor on here with the pony motor. So, yep. And then, two, I left the machine shed over there. I left the track hooked up to the bagger because what I would like to do is my brother's track that needs to get overhauled. I'd like to drive that back out here and park that where that was sitting because, of course, I'm still waiting for money to get that with my brother's tractor fixed up. So, yeah. So, anyways, I am going to finish loading a feeder wagon for the cows. And then I will finish up this video. And, yeah. So, see you guys in a little bit. Okay, I just got done loading the feeder wagon for the milk cows. And I decided I'm just going to finish up this video in here, showing you guys that we got this done yesterday. We got the right screening all on here. And it's kind of a job to do it. I don't really want to change it back to corn again. But, anyways, it's what we have to work with for this year because the place that we normally take it to is all booked up. So, yes, I wish we could use a regular fanning mill with, you know, sifting it and everything like that. But this will do an okay job. It's not going to be as good as that, but it will do an okay job. And so we're going to clean ours. We're going to do some of our cousins too. So, yeah. So, probably sometime this week, weather permitting. I mean, today is obviously nice. The sun is still shining yet. It was a beautiful, gorgeous day. And so hopefully this week we'll get to that and I'll get to that drill. And hopefully when my brother comes back we'll get some more time. We've got to get organized to do that so we can get going and get done or get the crop in the ground. It just depends on too what happens, like I say, with the weather. But at least that job is done. And hopefully too we'll get that tractor power washed here this week and we'll get working on that. Oh, and we're going to probably try to haul some manure too out on the cows lot here. Out over there. Right over there. That way we can let the milk cows out. It would be nice to get them out this week if we could because it would save a lot on chores. It would free up a lot of time. We'd have more time to get other stuff done if we didn't have to have the cows in the barn. You know, we don't have to feed in the barn every day. We don't have to clean the barn every day. And I just want to get the cows out of the barn. I don't like leaving me in the barn. I hate that. I like them to be able to go outside and feed them out there that way. So anyways, I need... I've got to grab a bite to eat. It's been good day. It's Sunday. I still got to watch mass on TV because we can't go to church. Well, nobody's going to church right now because of this COVID-19 thing. So I've got to do that yet and work on some other stuff and then finish up the chores and hope tomorrow's a better day.
