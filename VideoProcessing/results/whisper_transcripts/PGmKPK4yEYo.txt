How To Run Sprinkler Wire

Howto & Style
 I'm here with Steve, the owner of Sprinkler Warehouse. He's about to tell us how we run wire to our sprinkler system. What kind of wire are we running today, Steve? We're going to be running direct burial irrigation wire today. It's 16 gauge wire and it's made for direct burial, so we do not have to worry about running conduit all the way back to the controller. We can just run the wire in the ground in the same trenches as the pipe. And we'll just tuck the wire up underneath the pipe just to protect it from any shovels in the future or anything like that. The best we can, we'll tuck it up underneath. But again, we don't have to worry about running conduit because we are using wire that's designed for direct burial out here in the yard. We're going to be running our wire from the controller. In this situation, it's in the backyard, in the garage. We're going to be coming from that controller around the back of the property, down the side of the house, and then across the front over here to our furthest valves away from the controller. So starting here, we need to make sure that we've got a red wire or a hot wire for each valve. In this case, we've got three valves, so we're going to have three red wires. But you only need one common. That's it, not ten. Yes, daisy chain. Yeah, daisy chain. We would normally run the wire straight from these valves all the way back to the controller and tucking the wire underneath the pipe to protect it. But we've got to be careful. I always advise people, walk the property back to the controller and make sure you're not going to cross any obstacles that would prevent you from running the wire. In this case, as we've been discussing here, and you can see, we've got a sidewalk to deal with. We've gone under it earlier with a piece of conduit so that we've prepared ourselves to go into this with wire. So instead of starting here and rolling our rolls back, we're going to start here, bring the wire underneath in the conduit, over to the valves, hook up the valves, and finish running the wire around the side of the house to the backyard. After we've done these, we'll start over here on these valves. We'll run our two red wires all the way back to the controller again. And then we'll finish up with our valves that are in the backyard and do the same thing. All right, now I've pulled the wire down to the valve. I'm going to tuck it in underneath the pipe, and I'm going to leave about two and a half feet of coil because you want to have about two and a half extra feet to coil up to protect for surges. Here we go. All right, so this right here is a little coil, and we're going to make one on the rest of these wires. Now what this does is it adds a little bit of extra protection against power surges. So we're just going to take a little pipe like this. We're going to unwrap our cable. We're going to go ahead and leave some slack right there. We're going to wrap it around right down here like this. Boom. Coil. We're going to do that to all of them. Perfect. Just kind of tuck a little extra down there. That's good. Okay, now tuck that under and start your coil. How many did you do last time? How many? Yeah, that's good. See how we're just jumping from one to the next to the next? Yes. That's all we're doing. Yeah. Got it. You want to use the black? Yeah. You want to use the black? Yeah. Yeah. That one? Yeah. It's working with our microphone as it's a STPass. So that's it. It goes from this one to that one. Cool. That one to the control. Now I'm on the putt intendant pin 보�ums. I got it. You've got more now. Want me to have to go away. And don't forget your waterproof wire nuts. And don't forget your waterproof wire. And don't forget your waterproof wire. And don't forget your waterproof wire. I'm going to take the white wire only. And I'm going to pull the white wire. I need you to let the roll roll with more white wires. Now let go to place youribenob. Cut the opening right out of the Jewish bone. Here we go. Now in order to protect your wires from damage, you're going to want to run it through some PVC conduit from where it comes out of the ground all the way to your smart control. You don't glue it, there's no water. Right there. All right, now we've got all the wires running to our controller. We have our rain sensor wire right here, we're going to hook that up. We've got our common wire, we're going to hook that up as well. We're going to turn the power onto this thing and then what we're going to do is we're going to strip the red wires one by one and we're going to touch them to a powered terminal. What that's going to do is going to start to isolate which wire goes to which zone because we don't know which wire goes to which zone at this point. So if we turn on terminal number one and start touching a wire to it, what's going to happen is it's going to turn on one of the zones in our yard. Let's just say that turns on number seven. We count one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, connect it to number seven over here and go on down the line until we know which wire goes to which zone and then we connect it to that corresponding zone. Let's get started. Okay, that's number, hold on, that's the flower bed so that's going to be number six. Number six. Remember, Sprinkler Warehouse has everything for your irrigation needs.
