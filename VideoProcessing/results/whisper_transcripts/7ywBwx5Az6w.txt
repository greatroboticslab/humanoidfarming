Education
 40 days ago, I mowed this sorghum sedan grass cover crop with my lawnmower. Now its regrowth, however, is stressed by drought and it's toxic to livestock if they eat it. Rather than mowing it with my lawnmower again, I asked a friend to cut it while he was going by to cut hay. He went on and baled it for me and it was way too wet to bale. However, we got a 56-inch bale out of this 7,000 square foot paddock. I took the bale and unrolled it into the pig pen where we train pigs to the electric fence. We will be weaning a lot of our Berkshire piglets in the next few weeks and we need a lot of carbon-based materials in the pig pen to absorb nutrients that the pigs leave behind.
