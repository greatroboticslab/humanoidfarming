 Nearly 300 to 400 orders a day, with an average of 20 line items per order, will be processed. Goods receipt, quality check, barcoding with the product and expired details with bin allocation need to be performed in a short time. Rebus. A software that helps you streamline the process. Rebus. Helps this facility to process tons of fresh produce coming in from farmers and goes out of a warehouse facility in just a few hours. The fruits and vegetable industry has some unique requirements, with additional attention required, compared to other industries. This process begins with preparing purchase orders. These orders will be sent to the farmers. Farmers ship the fresh produce against the orders, based on the quantity available. The quality check and grading take place. After this process, when each item comes in, Rebus tracks the arrival date and the expire date of the products, by creating a lot for each goods receipt against the actual quantity received. This helps the picker to pick the product on FIFO method. Using Rebus Backoffice, our operation team will pull the orders from an e-commerce portal. Using API and B2B sales orders for the day. All the received orders will be converted into a single batch to process. This validates the duplicate orders and items not exist in the system. These orders will be converted into PIC and the back office operation team will enter the picker's name, who is going to perform the PIC activity for the day. Rebus will allocate the PIC order for each picker automatically. Coming to fruits and vegetables, each item will be checked for quality and the actual weight of a packed item and barcode will be generated with the details. As shelf life is just less than two days, with a quality check done, the correct product has been packed. Against the orders, in a short time, is a big challenge. Each PIC station will be provided with the items that need to be picked and the route number. Each PIC will not just have fresh produce, but also have FMCG products. These PIC items will be sent to PIC stations to scan against each order. Rebus. PIC system checks for product match with the order and pick the actual weight of the PIC product. Actual quantity PIC information will be updated back to the e-commerce portal immediately using API. Managing an effective supply chain is the key in this industry. The system gives error if the wrong item has been picked. As soon as the worker at the PIC station completes the PIC, an email and a message will be triggered to the customer about the product's been shipped.
