Howto & Style
 Indoor gardening for better health. Oh my goodness. It is amazing. I'm going to turn this up just a little because I'm a tall girl and it's hard to bend down and talk to you. So what do you see behind me? It is my raised bed garden. Yes, I am so happy to I'm sorry. Did I say raised bed? I just came from outside. Sorry. Yeah, I'm trying to get the outside done too. But this is my indoor garden. Yes, usually I am growing this outdoors. But this winter I decided to come inside the house. Yes, that was new for me because I've always grown year round outdoors, which has been no problem in the climate that I live in. But last winter was a little brutal to say the least. And it was brutal because not because the food didn't grow because my garden still grew outside, even though it we had, I think, like negative something degrees. Oh my goodness. It was terrible. Maybe not last year, but the year before that. I don't remember. But that last winter was terrible. So this year I said, I am going to do something different. I'm going to try my hand at indoor gardening. So I brought one of the gardens inside, same garden from outdoors. And I just added the lights to this. So I purchased the lights and you guys look at all this lettuce. And I just harvested some this morning. I harvested some three days ago. And this is what we still got more lettuce growing. I've got two more on the other side. I've got some cilantro. I'm going to cut that off. But check this cabbage out. I'm going to turn this around. This puppy. Can you see that? I cannot wait to see what grows out of here. There we go. Bring that up. So, but it is starting to create the bulb in the middle. If you can see that this is gorgeous. The leaves on here are beautiful. Now it is taking a lot of water from my plant, but from my water jug, water base. But that is what it does. So I'm just going in here. I just pulled this out of here. I'm going to put that in the trash. But look at these green onions. Celery. This is broccoli. No broccoli just yet. I have grown broccoli before in this outdoors. But this is the broccoli. And I'm going to use these leaves actually. So growing indoors is so economical. So much fun. I love it. Love it. Love it. Here's another lettuce. I'm going to turn it around so you can see what we got here. We've got some parsley down here. Some kale that, oh my goodness, we've been eating off of this forever. Some more broccoli. Oh, this is beautiful. And then celery. I've been growing this celery for two years. I'm actually about to shave it off and do some celery juice. Yes. I'm going to do some celery juice. These have saved me so much money. People say, well, how much does it cost? Well, they are not. I'm sorry. I'm pruning as I'm talking to you all. That's how easy this is. I got a couple of leaves for my cabbage that have decided to go a little bit. This cabbage. I'm going to leave this in here. Even though it's taking a lot of water, I usually don't grow cabbage on here. But every now and then I like to show what you can grow on these. And these are the grow lights. So again, I already had this unit, the actual Tower Garden outside. And I do sell these. So if you are interested in getting one, I can show you how you can get a percentage off, 10% off. Let me know if you're interested in getting that off. But what I did add was the lights. And these lights were just $30 a month for 12 months, no interest or anything. So that was really cool. And I have saved so much money because I don't know about you, but organic celery is very expensive. And this is the same seed from two years ago. I haven't even had to buy seed. That is huge. The lettuce, you can start from seed. I've actually got just came from outside in my greenhouse. I'm starting seeds to growing so I can put them in here. And also I'm going to put them in my outdoor unit because I am. We got the oak tree up, going to level out the ground a little bit more. And I've got the greenhouse set up, but I'm also going to set my Tower Garden up further out in the yard instead of on my deck. Because I want to use my deck and I want to screen it in actually. So we're going to move that out and it is going to get full sunlight. So we're going to be growing outdoors as well as indoors. So this is super easy to do. I just come down here when I want my lettuce. I'm able to get my lettuce, some parsley. I actually did a smoothie this morning with parsley. And look how much I have. I personally only grow one parsley for us because I decorate my food with it. I make pesto with it. I put it in, you know, I put it in smoothies. And this one plant gives us enough cilantro. I grew like three cilantro's a couple years ago and they grow so fast. And I don't eat that much cilantro. We literally were making cilantro smoothies. But I love to make like a pesto kind of cilantro lime dressing with it. So good. But I love to juice these, put these in smoothies. They are delicious. I'm going to harvest all of this and I'm going to keep letting this broccoli grow. I'm trying to see if it's going to do anything, but I can't wait to use these leaves. These gardens grow three times faster. You use less water because if you have garden before like me, you have probably had the drip system, the sprinkler system, the timers and all of that stuff. Well, the beautiful thing about these gardens is inside of the base, which is a 20 gallon or 13 gallon base. These can fit anywhere. This is in my exercise room. So it does not impede anything in here. It doesn't get in the way of anything. Even with these lights, you can actually have a 13 gallon, which is the size of an end table. So if you have an end table in your house, that's the size of that garden system. This one may be a little bigger size end table, maybe a coffee, a larger coffee table table. But literally you can grow whatever you want in here. I could extend this up higher outdoors. I usually go about seven feet tall, which is as high as I can reach. I don't grow higher than that. You can, but I didn't want to grow anything that I just can't reach up and grab, you know, just for safety reasons. I could grow taller and put a ladder on it and then or use a ladder and go up. But not doing all that. This is just enough for us. And I'm able to share with other people as well. So that is a great thing. And I just grow these two onions. That's enough. I actually have a freezer full of these green onions just for again from these two onions that I've been growing for two years. So, but the celery is amazing. It grows back so fast. It actually grows bigger than this outside. I have noticed that that growing indoors, my celery has not gotten that big. But when I grow the celery outdoors, I don't know if you guys have seen my reel before where I'm dancing with the two celeries. Those celeries grow so big, but nothing better than some nice tender celery to put inside of a tuna salad, chicken salad. Just eat it with some peanut butter. That's my favorite way to eat it is to come down here and cut a piece off and dip it in some homemade peanut butter. And because, you know, I have to make my peanut butter myself now. Ever since I start making it from scratch, I am not interested in buying it from the store. It's cheaper and it tastes better. But you can do celery. I'm going to cut this and juice this tonight and do a juice with celery. So do you guys want to learn more about growing indoors? Number one, you are the only one that touches this kind of garden. I'm the only one touching this food. You don't have to worry about people touching your food. Hey, Tammy, you don't have to worry about people touching your food. You do not have to worry about what is put on your food. I literally use no pesticides or anything like that when I grow indoors. I do companion planting and I also come and check my plants to make sure that I don't have any bugs, any things like that. Hey, Jennifer, like I don't have any things like that. And if I do have a AFib situation, I'm on top of it because every day I'm just coming in here. I do it when my garden's outside. I just go and spend time in my garden. It's so relaxing. It's de-stressing. And I couldn't tell you the last time that I had to buy spinach, that I had to buy lettuce, that I had to buy celery, any leafy greens. So when you ask how much is it, I tell people it actually, hey, Shirley, it actually saves you from buying. But they run starting at about six something if you pay in full. But we also allow you to pay monthly with no interest. That is a beautiful thing. But I have not bought leafy greens in I don't know how long. So that's the good thing about it. You had a salad today from your garden. Oh, that's really cool. I was showing my lettuce I picked three days ago. I picked them bare. Came back to all of this lettuce in just three days, three or four days. To all of this lettuce, I got three plants. The cabbage is starting to grow even better. It's starting to get its head on there where the cabbage is going to come out. But this lettuce, I had three and I cut them all down before I left and they are all growing back. I got here to these huge leaves of lettuce. So that's the beautiful thing about aeroponic gardening. Here's my other lettuce. I picked this thing bare, you guys. And look at it now. I've got these. I got lettuce still growing. And you see the little one down here. I chopped that whole bouquet off and it's already sprouting back lettuce. It's already sprouting back little lettuces that are grown. So you can cut these and they'll just grow back right inside of the port. I even have a leek that I got from the grocery store. I just plopped it inside of here and it's growing as well. So, hey, you can put anything in these gardens. People do grow bulby things. I don't. I just grow leafy greens, tomatoes, cucumbers, all of those things. But I don't grow like root vegetables. And indoors, this is my first time growing indoors. And I absolutely love it. I am not going to stop growing indoors because it has saved to me. It's a lot easier. I don't have to worry about the bugs. I mean, I still watch for the bugs. I have a fan on back here that blows fan to keep air flow going. I also have these little sticky things inside. And I only put them in the green onions and the kale. I got two in the kale because I noticed there were some gnats when I first brought the plants from outside in. So, if you do the indoor, you can start your seedlings inside, which will cut down, if not negate, the pest issue. So, for me, it's just easy to grow them outside of seedlings and then bring them in. And I usually just put them in cinnamon water and some dish soap just to kind of get whatever spiders or bugs or whatever off. And then plop them in here. You don't have a problem. So, that was the only issue that I had. But other than that, there was really no issue. And you see these broccolis just growing. I don't see a broccoli yet. But broccoli is a cool weather crop. So, I am not going to probably get any broccoli. But that's okay because the leaves on broccoli, I went to the store and they actually were selling cabbage leaves. Not cabbage, but cabbage leaves. So, you guys, you can grow anything. You can, you know, save some money. So, if you did spend $600 on this for a year, no interest. You paid, what is it, $52, $55 a month, no interest. How much do you spend on leafy greens? So, check out your grocery bills. See how much you already spend. How much goes bad in your refrigerator? When you buy it from the grocery store, it's probably already overripe. It's not picked green. I come down here and pick things when I need them. So, they're allowed to stay on the vine until they're nutritionally best. So, not nutritionally defunct or I'm not eating green produce. I'm actually eating ripe produce right from the vine when it's ready to be eaten. So, it's fresh, fresh, fresh. And things that I cannot use, like I'll cut them up, freeze them, put them in a freezer bag and use them throughout the year. So, these are all things you could do. And you save money. I own this tower free and clear after a year of paying on it. No interest. And I just added the $30 lights and that was it. Best way for me to grow. Again, I can't tell you the last time I brought lettuce or I got chives here. These chives. Oh, my goodness. I'm so glad I only grew one chive because these things are growing like grass. But they are really good inside of like I've used them in tacos and sauces and stuff like that. But I'm really glad I only grew one. It's amazing how fast things grow when their root system is strong. So, anyway, you guys have a good night. Thanks for watching.
