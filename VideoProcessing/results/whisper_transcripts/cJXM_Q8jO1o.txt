 If you're struggling on Liberty Falls, I really recommend doing this Easter egg. You might have heard of getting a free jet gun or a free ray gun from the cars on the map. And today, I want to sort of clear that up a little bit. So basically, there's a lot of cars all around Liberty Falls and some of them have just zombies trapped inside. But these ones look a little different to the rest. There are three of them in total. One is just here. The second is just here. And the third is just here. And what you're looking for as you go across all these cars is Mr. Peaks in the back. Once you find him, keep note of the fact that he's in there and be careful not to blow up that car. The reason for that is that we need to blow it up but in a specific way. So, go to a crafting bench and craft yourself a Mangler Cannon. It costs 12.50 salvage. And then, you can come back to this car with Mr. Peaks in the back and shoot your cannon at it. And when it gets exploded, the boot of the car will pop open and you'll get some free rewards from inside.
