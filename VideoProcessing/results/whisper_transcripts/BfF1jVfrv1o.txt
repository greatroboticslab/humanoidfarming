 Warm greetings good people. We meet once again. We are looking at a new chapter which is called production factors. We have four production factors that we will check. We have the first one which is the business of the day which is land. We will also check the second one later labor followed by capital and then we will close it by management. Management which is the one that coordinate and combine all the three factors. Okay fine. When we look at this one which is land, there are a few things that I want you to note when you look at land. One, you must be able to talk about functions of land, economic functions of land. We say identify the functions of land. One, in this case be able to list the functions of land. Two, you may be given a statement in that statement or else in a form of an example and then you will be recognized to match that statement with any of the four or five functions of land that we will talk about. We will also look at economic characteristics of land. We must be able to list, you must be able to list economic characteristics of land. Two, you may be given a statement again and then you will be asked which economic of characteristic of land is this one. Or else in an exam you may be given a paragraph, a scenario and then in that scenario they may say identify or indicate economic characteristic that is there in the paragraph or else in the scenario. Another thing that you may do. You may be given maybe a picture or else you may be given a graph and then you will be expected to identify that economic characteristic or else you may be given a table. You will also be, you will also be asked to identify it. But when we look at the presentation, you will see how easy it is to identify them. We have to also talk about ways or methods of increasing land productivity. We know that when, for example, when we plow, you must make sure that you get a high production or high yield. So we will look at the different methods on how to increase the productivity of land. Let's first look at the economic functions of land. One, we have the first one where we say land provide food for both human and animals. Land will directly or indirectly provide food for human and animals. What happens that there are plants in land. Those plants, they will be eaten by what? By animals. And it means animals directly benefit from land. And we can also eat the animals that have eaten the plants. We as humans. So we can say the first function, land provide food for both human and animals. Let's look at the next one. Provide space for agricultural activities. There are farms where we plow. There are farms where we plow. So we use that land or we use that space for what? For agricultural activities. For different agri-activities. Even Kekli is also raised there. We plow crops. We plow crops. It's also on land. So number two provides space for agricultural activities. It is a source of minerals. There are mines. In mines. In mines we get what? We get minerals from land. You have your gold. You have your silver. It is used as what? To generate money. So we can say that one is provide source of minerals. You also have phosphorus and other potage. Those minerals come from land which will be used by plants and animals as their nutrients. So we can say it is a source of minerals. We can also say land can be used as collateral. What do we mean by collateral? A collateral we say this is a form of security that is needed by a bank before they offer or they give you a loan. So we say it can be used as what? As collateral. We'll talk about this term when we talk about agri-marketing. So before they give you a loan, they can require something as a collateral. And you as a farmer, you can use what? You can use land as a form of security before they offer you the loan. We can also say it provides space for human settlements and industries. The growth in population, it results in more houses being built. And where are those houses built? They are built on what? On land. We also have industries. In this case of industries, we can also add schools. We can also add clinic hospitals. All those industries, those companies, they are built on what? On land. So these are the economic functions of land that we have. Provide food for humans and animals. Provide space for agricultural activities. It is a source of minerals. It can be used as a collateral. And then we provide space for human settlements and industries. Okay, fine. While we're still here, let's check something. Let's say we have this one. They say the flowchart below represented the characteristics of land as a production factor. It represents functions of land actually. Let's check what they're saying here. You have to match this flowchart with the functions of land. You match the A, B, C, and D. Let's check what we can hear here. It's Porsche's gym some mines. I want you to take note of mines here. Remember we said in mines we get what? Minerals. So which economic function of land is this? We can say it provides or it is a source of what? Of minerals. You also have B. B, they talk about maize. They talk about meat. It means there is food there. There is food there. So we can say it provides food for both humans and animals. You come to C. You see cropping fields, carefully ranging pastures. There are crops. There are crops. There are pastures there. So it means there is a space for what? For agricultural activities. You also have houses, schools, and factories. Houses are built for people. So it means there is a space for human settlements and also industries. So that's what we can check when we look at this one. But let's see whether we understand it in a nice way. A, we say source of minerals. Yes, we were right. We say it provides space for human and animals, which is B. C, provides space for agricultural activities. Yes, we were right. And then B, provides space for human and settlements. So this is just an example of how can questions be asked in an exam. But in some cases, they just say list two or three functions of land. So be able to list them. If you can just master a minimum of three, you will be safe. Okay, fine. Let's get to this very important part. Let's look at economic characteristics of land. I want you to make sure that you follow each and every argument that we will have here. We have the first one. Land is subject to the law of diminishing return. They like to ask us about this one. Land is subject to the law of diminishing return. What do we mean by this economic characteristic? We simply mean here, we simply mean when a farmer add a production factor while keeping other factors constant, what will happen is that the yield of the land will start to increase. When the farmer continues to add more production factor, the yield will reach a maximum production potential whereby now the production becomes constant. And when the farmer continues to add that production factor, then the production will start to decrease. So when we look at the law of diminishing return, we say once you add the production factor, we use fertilizer as an example. If you add fertilizer, the production will increase. When you keep on adding, the production factor will no longer increase, but it will become constant. And in that case, we say the land has reached its maximum production potential. So there's no need for you as a farmer to continue adding. But if you continue adding with an aim that maybe the production will increase, instead it will start to decline. So we put it in three ways. You add fertilizer, for example, the production increases. You continue adding, it reaches a maximum production potential whereby we see that it is now constant. You continue adding again, it no longer increases, instead it declines. That's when we talk about the diminishing return. Hence we call it what? The law of diminishing return. That's how we try to understand it. But then let's look at it. We say in this way, I have put it in this way. The law of diminishing return states that if you continue to add one production factor while keeping others constant, you will reach a point where the output per unit, output per unit is the production output, where the output per unit of the added variable starts to decline. As we have seen, you add, you add, it increases, it increases, and then it will start to be constant whereby it reaches the maximum production potential. And if you continue adding, what are they saying here? They are saying it will start to decline. Hence we say it is the law of diminishing return. Let's look at it in this way. Let's have this graph. What I want you to see, we will also look at in another slide. In this graph, let's say the input, let's say the input is fertilizer. So they have added fertilizer. Then this is our production or this is the yield. Let's say you add five bags of fertilizer. The production increases. You add the 10 bags of fertilizer. The production increases. You continue adding 15 bags of fertilizer. The production increases. But if you look at the level of increase, it gets lower as you keep on adding. From 5 to 10, there is a sharp increase. Or from 0 to 5 or 5 to 10, there is a sharp increase. But when you go to 10 to 15, now the increase is low. So if you check, in A, there is yield increase. In B, there is quick or faster increase. But when you check C, the increase of the production is now getting slower. Okay, fine. We will come back to that one. But what I want you to notice is that the more you add the fertilizer, the more the production increases. But then, here we have reached 15 bags of fertilizer. And then, the farmer continues to add the fertilizer. And if you add 20 bags of fertilizer, what happens to the production? The production no longer increases. We can say here, it has reached a maximum production potential. The land no longer increases. The land no longer increases. As you can see here in D. The land no longer increases. Or the production of the land no longer increases. So we can say here, the land has its maximum production potential. In this case, we say, an increase in inputs no longer results in an increase in the production or in the yield. So an increase, if you check here, take note of this one. An increase in inputs does not result in an increase in yield. So what does it mean? It means you will have high input cost because you have added more fertilizer here. You have high input cost which does not result in an increase in yield. As a result, you will no longer get a profit, but you will get less profit compared to the point where you were adding 15 bags of fertilizer. And then we can add this part. We can make this one our E. And say here, maybe we say now, the land production starts to decline or decreases. That's how I want you to understand this part in a very simpler way. Let's have a look at it in this way. One, in A, you can see that the production increases. There's increasing yields. In B, there is more yield increase. As you can see, it's faster in B. The increase is faster the more you add the fertilizer. But in C, now the increase starts to be slow. Yes, there is increase, but it starts to be slow. Then it has to tell you as a farmer that the land is about to reach its production potential. But what happens in D? The soil has reached a maximum production level or a maximum production potential. And then I say it to you. I say it to you. This one, we can say it's our E. Our E. Whereby we say in E, what happens to the production? We can say production decreases. Production decreases. So it's very important for you that as a farmer, you know when to stop adding the fertilizer. Hence, we say there is a point whereby the production will start to decline. Okay, fine. What does it say to a farmer? This means that the farmer can teach you that an increased input is not in proportion to increased production. The fact that you add more inputs, it does not necessarily mean that you will get more production. So you must know when to stop adding more inputs. Hence, we say that an increased input is not in proportion to increased production. Okay, fine. Let's use this one. What you must check here, in A, the production increases. The yield increases. But when you look at B, in B, take note of this one. You can even take it down. In B, we say an increase in input does not result to an increase in production or in yield. This results in high input cost not matched by increase in yield. Then this will result in reduced profit. That's what will happen in what? In B. Because we understand that in B, the land has reached its maximum production potential. So even if you put more fertilizer, the yield will no longer increase. Instead, you will use more inputs whereby you buy more fertilizer while their production no longer increases. As a result, you will get what? A profit. Then here, this is the diminishing return that we talk about. This is the diminishing return that we talk about whereby we say the land production starts to decline. That's how we can easily understand this part. We can also look at it in this form of a graph. When we look at it in this form of a graph, they say the table below shows the amount of fertilizer applied and the quantity of potatoes produced on a piece of land. What happens here is that the more the farmer put the fertilizer, what happens is that in bags of fertilizer, there was zero. The production of potatoes was 18. It increased to two bags of fertilizer. Production increased to 25. If you go to six, the production of potatoes is 28. Let's look at this part. Eight. What is the production? It's 29. The farmer continued to add 10 bags of fertilizer. What happens to the production? It remains 29. What does it mean? It means now the land has reached its production potential. If maybe he can add 12, you may find that the production will now start to decline and go to 27. So we can say here, this is the law of diminishing return whereby an increase in the input is not proportional to the increase of the output. So that's the simplest way we can understand it. We are done with that one. Make sure that you understand it. But most of the time we use the example of fertilizer. If we try to look at this one, agricultural land is limited. Sometimes they say it's availability of land. We say availability of arable land is limited. With this one. With this one, we say the land that can be used for farming is getting lesser and lesser. You have to ask yourself a question. Why the land that can be used for farming is getting lesser and lesser? One, it may be because of an increase in population. The more the population size increases, what does it mean? It means these people will have to build houses. And where will they build their houses? They will use the land that is used for what? For agricultural purposes. So in this case we say the agricultural land is limited. Because the land that was used for agricultural activities is no longer used for that purpose. Instead it is used for different reasons. And then in this example that we are saying here, we are saying it can be used for what? For building what? For building houses for the people because of the increase in what? In population. It's no longer, it's not only houses. We can think of, we can think of, of, of industries. Because that the increase in population, it means people will require work, jobs. And then it means we have to build industries so that these people can work. We can also think of what? Of schools. The people who are, who, the people, the more the people increases, it means that more schools must be built. Even clinics. So that, the development that will take place, it will result to a decrease in the land that can be used for farming. So that's how we, we, we try to understand it. So in this case we say, former agricultural land is used for what? For settlements. We can say it's used for what? For industries. It's used to build schools, to build clinics. But the main point is that this is caused by an increase in what? In, in, in, in, in population. Even, even, even if, even if it happens that the land becomes mountainous, the land becomes mountainous, it means it is now limited. Because it is no longer used for what? For farming. It is not suitable for farming. Hence we say the arable land decreases. That's how we understand the land is, the agricultural land is limited. That is number two. The first one is land is subject to the law of diminishing return. The second one is agricultural land is limited. Let's look at this table. The table below shows the population size and available arable land in certain region over a period of six decades. This is the table. What is happening is that if you can check the population size increases, when the population size increases, what happens to the land that can be used for farming, arable land available? The population size increases. And then this one, it decreases. So we can say here, there's an increase of population size. And then here, there's a decrease of what? Of arable land. Then you can come across a question and say, which economic characteristic of land is this? We will say it's what? It's agricultural land is limited. Why you say so? So that's the question that you will get like it or not. You say it's because the land that is used for farming, the arable land available, is decreasing due to an increase in what? In the population size. That's the simplest way to understand this one. So make sure that you understand it. Agricultural land is limited. What makes it to be limited is that the land that was previously used for farming is no longer used for farming. It may be used for different reasons. Maybe houses are built there, industries are built, schools, clinics are built there. It's no longer used for farming. So that's how we easily understand this part. Let's quickly look at this one. Land is fixed. This one is very easy. We say land is immovable in a simpler way. Meaning there's no way you can take land from one position and take it to another position. So we say land is fixed. They used to say the land that is used or that is good for farming specific crops is far away from the markets. That's how they put it. They say good fertile soil that is needed for growing specific crops. It occurs or it found in places that are far away from the market. Hence we say land is fixed or land is immovable. Let's quickly move on. Land is durable. In this case, good people will simply mean that. The land is durable. The land that was used by our great grandfathers can still be used by us in this present time. The land is durable. Hence we say a farmer still produces cotton on land that was used for the same purpose by his great grandfathers. Land has high durability. Land has durability. The land that was used by our great grandfathers can still be used even now and produce more. We also have another one. Indestructible. Land is indestructible. Land is indestructible. In this case, there is no way land cannot be destroyed. That's how we put it in a simpler way. Land cannot be destroyed. We simply mean a farmer experienced a drop in production due to monoculture by your plowing one and the same crop season after season. and after changing to conservation farming the yield started to increase the yield started to increase so we can say you cannot destroy land yes at the beginning you may find that the production is not as the one that we expecting but the more you plow the more you plow it will start to gain its momentum and then produce more we will look at another at another characteristic that is linked with this one whereby we say its value appreciates over time its value appreciates over time the value of land increases over time unlike machinery which loses value over time we say the value of land appreciates or increases unlike machinery that depreciates so we say the more you use land the more you use land it will give you more production but making it a point that you don't add more fertilizer which will lead to diminishing return but the more you use land the value of it lay over the land will increase not as same as the one which is machinery whereby the then the value of land depreciates the next one we say land has its specific environment we say a specific type of soil which is found in a specific environment has fixed characteristics so it means this type of soil will only allow certain type of vegetation or certain type of crops that can be plowed there you cannot go to a certain area and say I want to plow this crop you have to first check whether that crew is that crop good for that type of soil before you plow so that's what we that's what we we we we we we we we we check in this one then the other one we say land varies in production potential the production potential of land is not the same production of of a certain region is not the same of another region even even one farm the production of a certain plot is not the same to a production of another plot we say soil varies from exceedingly fertile to poor quality resulting in great differences in the production potential that's what we check that's what we check I want you to be able to master all of this one we talked about land is subject to the law of diminishing return with this one most of the time they use fertilizer as an example they will say an increase in the application of fertilizer is not proportional to the yield you can use any yield maybe maize yield or potato yield or what but once you see that they used what they used fertilizer an increase in the application of fertilizer is not proportional to the yield you must know that they took about the law the land is subject to the law of diminishing return make sure that you did again they can give you a graph the graph that we checked there still they are talking about it they can give you the table by this lady this fertilizer and the other you must know what they are talking about make sure that you must say it I could land is limited we talked about the fact that you'll find that the land was previously used for farming it's no longer useful for me but it is useful what for for maybe there's a construction that is taking place there and even even even construction of road even construction of law of road can also be applicable there whereby we're we're farming here but then they decided to to construct road where we're farming so we know we know I have a space for farming so we will see we will look at it in that in that manner but next note that it start with the increasing population with the result to the construction of what of human settlements you you you we say land value appreciates over time we talked about this one we say land is fixed we talked about this one land varies in production potential it's durable the land that was used by our great grandfathers can also be used by even us at this point of time we also talk about indestructible of land whereby we say even land cannot be destroyed even if they can be poor farming poor farming practices but once you start to use the land wisely it will give you more production we also talk about the fact that it has its specific environment whereby it requires specific crops or specific vegetation okay fun let's talk about this one this right to to round it up by looking at this one increasing land productivity when we look at increasing land productivity we say one you have to improve soil fertility you have to improve water management whereby we we we we we we we talk about water provision in improving soil fertility we talk about additional fertilizer you have to change cropping practices whereby you you you do double cropping you also do inter cropping we have to restore land potential whereby you you you do a maconto a maconto lines or maconto banks or you use the stone paths we have to also consider consolidate and economical units you you will see how we how we do that when we get rid of the of the small plots and then we we plough in one big plot we can also talk about multiple use of land which is what we just diversification let's talk about this one improving soil fertility it's use of fertilizer you just add fertilizer there and then the the the the the the the fertility of the soil can be improved we we we can also combine grains and legumes crops remember remember that legumes crops they they have bacteria in the roots the bacteria that can be used to to to to fix nitrogen so this legume plants will result in in the increase of nitrogen or the increase of nutrients in the soil hence we say it will lead to improving soil fertility you can also do a green green menu can also be planted to improve soil fertility and soil structure so that's what we we can talk about whereby you will then turn over before harvesting you turn over the green menu it will add it will add nutrients on the soil but one just know that during improving soil fertility you add fertilizer then we can have different methods of adding the fertilizer let's improve water management in this case we can link it with water provision water provision whereby you talk about what irrigation we say here this can be enhanced by improving soil organic matter and making use of water harvesting and water conservation practices you make sure that you save the water that you have or as you have we can bury pipes to reduce the damage and water and leaks so we want to make sure that we don't waste water so we say improving water management but more sure that you are able to list it we can do changing cropping practices and farming systems in this case is the one that I highlighted and say change to multiple cropping and inter cropping you you have multiple cropping or double cropping whereby you are able you have plants you have crops that you can plow in summer and crops that you can plow in winter you also have inter cropping whereby you use you plow two crops at the same time maybe you have your maize and you also have what beans at the same time you change the cropping practices and farming systems restoring the land potential in restoring the land potential we say this can be achieved by halting soil erosion you prevent soil erosion for example by constructing stone parts whereby you find that there's that fence whereby we have the stone parts which will prevent soil erosion and also you do and the control lines they do they help in preventing soil erosion let's have this last one this last one is whereby we say consolidation of an economical unit it's whereby you get rid of the small plots and then you just use one large field whereby a tractor can be used in plowing that whole field instead of plowing small plots differently in this case we say have one big field that is large enough to use a tractor on than to have the area divided into number of fields that must be prepared by hand so instead of having in this case instead of having small different plots you can just make these plots one big field whereby a tractor can just plow this one once it's also save in the cost but if there's more it means the tractor has to plow here go to this one but if you consolidate you consolidate these uneconomical units it means you combine all these plots to be one field make sure that you understand it in that way in that way you can't make sure that you understand it in that manner sometimes you can get a question whereby they say what are the scientific methods of increasing the scientific methods of the land productivity you can pick the use of fertilizer where by you improve some fertilizer you can pick the water management improving water management you can also pick the changing cropping and farming practices if they say if they say they if they talk about scientific methods of what of improving of improving land productivity and wise use of what of of pair or or or or or or or or or of pesticides that's what you you can pick that's what I wanted you to to understand that in this matter we we we will look at labor we will look at capital we will look at management but before we look at that I will try to to get some few questions that we will do together in order to see whether we will do together in order to see whether we are able to understand everything here three things that we have checked although we have we have we have went deeper in this we look at the functions of land we look at the characteristics of land we look at the ways of increasing land productivity so make sure that you you you you you you you you you you look at all of that are you all of that I do believe that you will be assisted good people thank you thank you for your precious time I I will come back with another lesson.
