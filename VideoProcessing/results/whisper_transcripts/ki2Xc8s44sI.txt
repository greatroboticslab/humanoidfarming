 What is going on everyone? Welcome to another very exciting episode right here on the MI Gardener channel. I am so excited about today's episode. So I was out here today topping off this raised bed here where we plant our cucumbers and our melons. We plant our melons here and our cucumbers here because the trellis for the cucumbers and the melons to trail out into the yard there where they can be you know out of out of the way of feet running around and and things like that so they can just kind of grow freely out in the yard there. So we've grown melons and cucumbers here for the past three years and we get a lot of times questions from people that notice that and they say Luke I've noticed you planted the same crop in the same bed for quite a while. Don't you crop rotate? And my answer to them is when I want to. So that's what I'm going to talk about today is why we do not promote mandatory crop rotations in a home gardening in a home gardening setting because I think many of you watching beginning gardeners in particular hear that it is it is vital and it is required to crop rotate. It can cause a lot of confusion. It can cause a lot of fear about messing something up with crop rotations and what if I planted this here and I shouldn't plant a carrot where I planted lettuce. I shouldn't plant a tomato where I planted potatoes because those are in the same family and I shouldn't plant onions where I planted garlic because those are in the same family and lettuce takes out the same amount of nutrients as potatoes in terms of nitrogen so I shouldn't plant those together. I shouldn't plant those where I planted each other. You run out of space really quickly where you pretty much just say okay I can't plant something somewhere what do I do? In the garden we should be simplifying things not making things more complicated and the fact of the matter is the reason why it's so complicated is because of the large-scale farming model. The large-scale farming model has done us a great disservice to the gardening community in terms of spacing. You see people spacing things out 12-14 inches even seed packets for heaven's sake say you know plant your lettuce 14 inches apart and it's almost as if they think we're going to be taking a large farming implement down our raised beds and you know and cultivating them up. We don't need 14 inch spacing because we don't have 14 inch tires to watch out for. And so when you look at the large farming model it's based off of monoculture and monocultures have done us a great disservice when it comes to crop rotations. Just like farming implements has done us a great disservice with spacing, monocultures has also done us a great disservice with our crop rotation because the reason why farmers have to crop rotate is because of monoculture. Monoculture for those of you that don't know what it is is mono is Greek for one, culture is plant so you have one you know one variety of plant growing among it could be 100 acres, it could be a thousand acres, it could be one acre, but generally it's like 10, 20, 100 acres, it could be a thousand acres or more. And a monoculture has done three things. It has done a great disservice with soil degradation. We talk about all the time how it's important to remineralize your soil, it's important to give back to the soil what you take out and then some so you build the soil being a good steward of the land. And monocultures they do the exact opposite. I mean the Dust Bowl for instance during the Great Depression was was based on over grazing of cattle growing too much wheat and too much corn. The Great Plains, the bread, you know the bread basket of the United States was absolutely pillaged for all it's worth because it was not being proper maintained. And so once it's not properly maintained the topsoil layer blows away and that topsoil layer has taken thousands of years to build thousands of years of crops starting with moss and lichen that dies, then small you know small weeds grow those die, grass grows and that dies, and then shrubs grow up and and those die back and those lead to you know larger forests and you know the prairie grasses and everything just thrives and flourishes because it's based on what we call a tertiary structure. And because we go in and we we till all that under, create great soil, there's great soil already there, we create better soil, and then we put a monoculture on top of that, sure things grow great for three, four, five years, but then then the negative side effects come in because what you're taking out is impossible to re-amend without either scaling things down and scaling things back or moving synthetic. And that's why a lot of organic farms are forced to scale down because organic can be sustainable if it's scaled down. You cannot grow organically unfortunately on 300, 500, 1,000 acres at a time. It's just not sustainable and I don't care what anyone says because again I have first-hand experience of a long lineage of farmers, commercial farmers, that tried to go organically and it led them to a world of hurt because they tried to take what they were doing or inorganically and just say ah just switch to organic. The whole thing changes because then you have to play by mother nature's rules and you can't use synthetic fertilizers which mother nature does not allow. Again what I was trying to say is you know you have a lot of people that here you have to crop rotate because of that soil degradation issue because so many farmers have scaled the home, you know you take the home scale and you scale the big the big farms down to the home scale much like we do with spacing. We do the same thing with the reasons why we crop rotate. We don't plant potatoes there because you planted potatoes there last year. Well the fact of the matter is is when it comes to soil degradation there is none because as a home gardener we have the luxury of quite literally taking that bed this raised bed behind us we can add like we just added right now three inches of compost. Do you have any idea how much compost it would require or any organic matter for that matter do you know how much organic matter it would take to add three inches over even an acre let alone 10 or 100 acres it's impossible it's an unquantifiable number I mean you could quantify it but finding it is a whole other story and so we have the luxury of taking in this 50 square feet here taking compost and adding three inches of organic matter that's like 20 percent of this whole bed's volume we've just added fresh stuff back to it that means any nutrients that were taken out are replenished and the soil is actually being left better than it was you know before we even before we were even here in the first place so the soil is then being built plus replenished and that's something that you just can't do on a large scale so when it comes to soil degradation I'm not worried about it the second thing that monocultures have hurt us with is pests people often say well you have to rotate your crops because pests can come in yes on a monoculture pests are an issue they become susceptible cotton crops have had the you know the the I think it's the bull weevil something like that some cotton weevil some type of weevil I don't know I don't know all the details but cotton crops were affected by the weevil the banana plants were affected by I think it was a disease or a fungus that affected the banana plants because it became susceptible or the banana plants became susceptible to this it found a weak point in the banana plant and then it became immune to the fungicides being sprayed on the crops and it wiped out the entire banana population and that's why they had to come up with a whole new banana and that's why bananas back in the 70s tasted dramatically different than they do today because we had to find a whole different crop that was not susceptible to this fungus I think it was called Panama disease and so um you have a you have a case in which a lot of home gardeners are fearful of planting tomatoes in the same area or potatoes in the same area or whatever as as they were in years past and that's just not the case because when you put fresh compost down like we did here you take a bunch of fresh compost you re-amend the bed what happens is you actually uh you actually increase the biodiversity in that bed you increase the amount of beneficial bacteria and beneficial fungi and you also have what's called a polyculture you know so a polyculture is many different types of crops grown closely together so this might be a bed let's say of potatoes or i have a bed of potatoes right over there i have a bed of strawberries right here a bed of tomatoes right there it's a full bed technically it's a monoculture but because there's so many different crops grown in a small area it's really for all intents and purposes it's actually a polyculture we have peach trees cherry trees plum trees apple trees pear trees onions potatoes lettuce garlic peppers herbs brassicas radishes more herbs eggplants strawberries melons cucumbers more herbs beans you know list goes on and on and on i mean it's just crazy how many crops we have here and so you don't really have a you don't really have a monoculture and if you do have pest issues because i know you're going to say well i have had aphids before i've had tomato hornworms before won't a crop rotation fix that and the answer is no because those are going to be those are going to be there no matter what you do that is not affected by crop rotation on a small scale on a microscopic scale crop rotations will not affect when you're only moving them 50 feet away the fact of the matter is aphids will be present on your plants regardless they will be better and worse year to year but they'll still be there and so if you have tomato hornworms one year they might not be there the next year if you have aphids one year they might not be there the next year those are totally based on differences of of the year and so you won't have as many issues as say a monoculture where that pest sticks around and it decimates the crop year after year after year and it becomes susceptible and then eventually wipes it out entirely you know you're still going to have so many other crops to choose from that it's not like you're growing just all tomatoes on your property if you were that'd be a little bit of a different story but since you're not and you're growing many different crops again you're not as concerned about those pest issues as say a farmer is with uh with their monoculture the third thing that i want to talk about and the final thing that is a big reason why people crop rotate is they're worried about soil-borne bacteria and soil-borne diseases so when you get things like tomatoes potatoes a lot of your solanense crops you get blight right blight is a soil-borne fungus but also things like powdery mildew on your cucumbers your pumpkins any of your cucurbeda crops you get powdery mildew powdery mildew is also a soil-borne fungus and so you have two soil-borne funguses that are on a home scale probably one of those probably two of the most prevalent uh type of soil-borne funguses found on a home scale and so people think well i'm just going to crop rotate because i had powdery mildew on my plants so i don't want powdery mildew on on them this year so i'm going to move them or i had blight on my tomatoes so i'm going to move them the fact of the matter is is moving them 50 feet will not matter because those two soil-borne funguses are found in every single bit of soil every single bit of soil if you have a raised bed here chances are there's just as much powdery mildew in the bed that's growing lettuce as there is growing tomatoes this year and if i were to change that up it won't do me any bit of good because it's really in how i'm growing my plants is how it's going to affect the amount of uh powdery mildew and and blight that i'm going to have if i increase airflow if i prune the plants up if i space them out a little farther apart you know if i don't water at night these are things that i can do to reduce the amount of blights and powdery mildews that i have but simply rotating the crops around won't do me any bit of good because like i said it's it's found in all the soil so you can crop rotate if you want to but it's not a necessity by any means because you're still going to be battling the same type of issues so those are the three reasons why i don't actually crop rotate and the final thing too is that so much of this as you're kind of hopefully catching on is is predicated on building the soil you know if you didn't build the soil year after year in the spring and the fall if you did not give back to your soil you might be facing some issues but reamending the soil with a lot of organic matter tends to solve most of those problems that are a reason why farmers have to crop rotate and so i hope you guys enjoyed i hope you learned something new again if you disagreed or if you do crop rotate based on principle and you you still want to that's fine i have nothing against people that crop rotate and like i said we rotate crops too but just i want you to to remember that i don't do it based out of necessity i do it based on just aesthetics i just want the garden to look differently but i've never once had any issues with growing the crops that i have grown in the same bed for multiple years it's never occurred and i'm getting just as good if not better harvests in years in years to come or you know in uh later years rather than the first year if anything my soil is growing and getting better and so um there's just not a whole lot of truth to doing it on a home scale so i hope you guys enjoyed i hope you found this informative if you did enjoy it and you did like it make sure to like this video and share with a friend i think crop rotations is something that again it's just ingrained in us because of our ancestors and the way we've been growing and still are growing today that the more we realize that there are mistruths there and we're um you know we're we're taking the large farming model and scaling it down and it's causing a lot of misinformation to be formed i think that we're actually going to be better off in the long run because what we're doing here is actually not only sustainable but it's beneficial to uh to to us as gardeners um we're not working as hard we're not stressing as much it's just easier so there's a lot of reasons to not crop rotate but again if you do that's okay too so i hope you guys enjoyed i hope you learned something new and as always this is luke from the my gardener channel reminding you to grow big or go home i'll catch you all later see ya bye you
