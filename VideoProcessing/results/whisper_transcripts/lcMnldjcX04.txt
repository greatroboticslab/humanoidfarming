 Harvesting grain involved many steps and resulted in more than one useful product. Farm families worked fast during the grain harvest season to get the best market crop, kernels of grain such as turkey red wheat. They had to cut the crop at the perfect time, after the kernels matured but before the grain heads dried out. Farmers with a well-paced team and a well-oiled reaper cut their grain quickly during the narrow window of opportunity. Farmers tied the bundles of grain into sheaves and stacked sheaves in a stook so the grain heads dried more in the field. Farmers had to cut the grain. Threshing machines reduced the physical strain of removing kernels from the straw. Engineers ran the steam engine while threshing crews made short work of piles of harvested grain. Laborers bagged the clean grain in preparation for market. Farmers used a whole grain plant.
