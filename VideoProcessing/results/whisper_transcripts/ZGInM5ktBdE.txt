 This is Ricardo Costa with MSA Extension and I do know you guys are really excited slash anxious to go ahead and plant corn. I also know that if you take too long to plant corn, let's say after June 1st, you can have yield reduction up to 3 bushels a day. On the other hand, I also know if you want to go ahead right now and plant corn in that situation, you're going to get stuck. The second thing that's going to happen to you, you're going to have soil compaction. That will affect the root development and also the nutrient uptake by the plant. Knowing that, I just can hope that you're going to get a break in the rain and the soil is going to dry out and you're going to be able to go ahead and plant your corn pretty soon. That's all I have for today. Thank you so much.
