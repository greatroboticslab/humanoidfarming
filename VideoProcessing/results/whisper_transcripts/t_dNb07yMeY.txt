 What would I do with a one acre homestead? I can picture it now. I'd start with a 500 square foot garden, plus a thousand square feet for produce to sell, with room to grow. Pun intended. I'd have a permaculture orchard with 10 trees, co-plant it with perennial root vegetables, and I'd put sea kale and other shade tolerant greens under the trees. I'd plant a nitrogen fixing cover crop like alfalfa, and I'd border it all with raspberry, blueberries, blackberries, and grapes. There'd be chickens for eggs and compost, and Angora rabbits for fertilizer and wool. They could eat the alfalfa I grew in the orchard. There'd be goats for milk and cheese, and beehives for honey and pollination. I'd have aquaculture tanks for tilapia and leafy greens. I'd have a rainwater catchment system for irrigation, and a gray water runoff from the house. I'd fill the rest with sunflowers and zinnias to sell, plus some mint and lavender for making essential oils. Can you see it? You don't need a lot of land to homestead. You just need to be able to see the whole picture. deep down in my life. thinks the whole picture is goingWhen I'm blue. Can you see it, where we read the Мне !!
