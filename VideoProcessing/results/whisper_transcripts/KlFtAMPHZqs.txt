 Farm equipment can be a hefty investment, especially when some of it is only used a few days a year. But now there's a new place to rent equipment, allowing producers to share cost and best practices. Farmers are very interested in soil health movement, but there was a challenge of having the right equipment available to manage through the cover cropping years. But for many operations, the cost of the equipment needed is a barrier to trying new soil management practices. Yeah, right. I mean, some of this stuff can definitely, you know, take a lot out of a farmer's pocket. Thanks to a grant in 2015, Outagamie County Land Conservation decided to purchase equipment and offer it for rent. We have two low disturbance manure injectors available. We have an air seeder box available, which can go on multiple different minimum tillage equipment to seed down cover crops in a quick and efficient manner. That air seeder box also goes on to interseeder, a 12-row interseeder. And then we also have a 6-row interseeder that also acts as a no-till drill. And then we also have a no-till corn planter. They just added this roller crimper to the fleet. Basically, when a cover crop gets to a certain stage, which they call enthesis or flowering, a farmer is able to use the crimper to roll down that cover crop. And as it's doing it, it's crimping the stems. And what that does is it stops the flow of water in that stem so it kills it. And then, so they want to be doing that so that you can reduce their herbicide that way. But then also you're maximizing soil cover for the earthworms for food and shelter and just that whole soil life and cycle. Winter rye is the target crop, but some farms are finding other uses for the roller crimper. It's all about innovation without the financial risk. It really helps them able to make sure what they are doing or how they are using this piece of equipment, it's worth their investment in the future. There is a small rental fee to help with maintenance costs, but it is far less expensive than owning it yourself. This equipment is available in the Lower Fox, but it's worth checking with networks and producer-led watershed groups in your area who are building fleets of their own. Have a great weekend.
