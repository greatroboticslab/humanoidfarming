 Muyeve migrated to Karibib from Rundu in search of a better life for himself and his three children. However, after years in Karibib, he found himself still unemployed and struggling to make ends meet. Muyeve and his family live in a location called Uis, one of many informal settlements that has sprung up due to urbanization. A third of the town's residents live in informal settlements with limited access to basic services such as water, electricity and proper ablution facilities. Muyeve is one of the people who thought that the grass was greener on the other side, but to his surprise, it was not. I started gardening in 2018 when I dropped off school because I was the elder in my... how can I say it? I'm the elder. Then my sister and my... they were no depending anywhere, then I started gardening so we can just have meals on the table. That's what I did. So you also saw within that time that this can be also a business opportunity? Yeah, that time I was just doing like to hold it in my house, just to keep food in my house. But later on I see people they are asking like, can we have spinach, can we do it? And that's when I started getting knowledge that, oh, spinach also you can be sold to people in the shop. That's when I started now. With the little background knowledge in agriculture that he gained during his years at school, Muyeve planted spinach, chili, peppers and tomatoes to feed his family. With his newfound skills, not only does the family enjoy nutritious meals, they are also able to earn an income from the surplus. With the high demand of fresh produce at Omaruru, Karibib and Yusakos, Muyeve plans to extend his garden, but there is no room for planting more crops. Yeah, the challenge that I'm facing in the garden is like, I need support for, like, special for land. I need proper land, the one that I can get huge spinach and the thing that I want to grow, so that I can supply to many places, because I can see myself, the way I'm doing my spinach, more people are being loved by spinach, even if you can go and ask where I'm supplying, they will currently let you say, ah, the spinach from what we are getting from the guys, very healthy and clean and nice. So what I need, the challenge that I need, I want the government to look at me just to help me as a youth, so they can upgrade me, so my business can grow bigger. Muyeve's hope is to open an agriculture project school for the urban poor and vulnerable groups, such as women, youth and people with disabilities. so we can expand those jobs and.
