 The variety of tractors and agricultural equipment developed over the years is truly impressive. In today's video, we will explore more of these extraordinary work tools. Alice Chalmers Speed Patrol Road The Alice Chalmers Speed Patrol Road is a road grading and maintenance machine produced by the American company Alice Chalmers during the 1930s to 1950s. It played a significant role in developing road infrastructure in various regions of the United States and worldwide. Alice Chalmers Alice Chalmers was an American company founded in 1901, based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, producing a wide range of agricultural, industrial, and construction equipment. The Speed Patrol Road Grader is an example of this diverse production, being a piece of equipment specifically designed for earth-moving, leveling, and maintaining rural roads and highways. The tractor is powered by a four-cylinder WC engine and has a 10-foot blade underneath, which is manually controlled. Alice Chalmers sold over 3,700 of these units between 1940 and 1950. Enjoy this rare piece of orange power. The blade, the most important part of the equipment, was adjustable in both angle and depth. This allowed for various applications, such as leveling the ground, cutting terrain, and spreading fill material to improve the road surface. The County 1164 The County 1164 is a classic tractor manufactured by County Commercial Cars L'LTT, a British company known for its robust tractors, primarily based on Ford models.

The 4x4 configuration and the use of large wheels help increase traction and prevent getting stuck. Alice Chalmers 200 The Alice Chalmers 200 tractor was a model released by the Alice Chalmers Manufacturing Company in 1972 and produced until 1975. Known for its sturdiness and reliability, it belongs to the brand's 100 series of agricultural tractors and is a significant example from the era when larger and more powerful tractors were becoming essential for large-scale farming. This machine is equipped with a turbocharged six-cylinder 4.9-liter diesel engine from Alice Chalmers with 301 cubic inches capable of generating 93 horsepower at the power takeoff. The tractor features a constant mesh helical gear transmission, offering eight forward gears and two reverse gears. In first gear, it can operate at approximately 3.5 kilometers per hour in the field, while in eighth gear, it reaches a maximum speed of 27 kilometers per hour for road transport. The diesel fuel tank has a capacity of 182 liters. When it left the factory, the tractor weighed about 3,322 kilograms and it can be equipped for field use to reach up to 5,121 kilograms. The initial sale price of an Alice Chalmers 200 tractor was $14,125. Built Ferguson FE 35. The Ferguson FE 35, also known as Gold Belly due to its golden chassis color, was one of the most popular agricultural tractors produced by Ferguson, later Massey Ferguson. The Ferguson Launched in 1956, the FE 35 was designed to be a robust and versatile model for farm work, combining innovative features and ease of operation. The Ferguson's first tractor is a small tractor. Attaching a second tractor to the front axle of the first is an unusual practice, but sometimes employed in agricultural operations requiring greater traction and power. The Ferguson's first tractor is a small tractor. This configuration is known as tandem tractors, and can be used in difficult field conditions, such as compacted or muddy soils, or areas requiring greater traction for large agricultural implements. The main reason for connecting a second tractor to the front axle of a lead tractor is to increase the combined traction force, allowing the pair of tractors to handle larger implements, such as heavy plows or wide seaters. This is especially useful in challenging terrains, where a single tractor does not have enough power or traction.

The recent car areыеishi, foot呼吸收, New Holland T7070 The New Holland T7000 series tractor is part of the T7000 series, a line designed to combine efficiency, power and comfort for a wide range of agricultural operations. Equipped with a New Holland NEFN67 six-cylinder engine, this tractor offers an excellent power-to-weight ratio. This engine is designed to provide reliable power and a quick response, allowing it to handle a variety of agricultural tasks. The maximum power output of the T7070 reaches around 213 horsepower. This allows it to work with heavy implements and tackle challenging tasks, such as plowing, seeding and harvesting. The tractor is working with an Alpigo Mega Craker 9-410, a robust and durable subsoiler, ideal for heavy-duty work in different types of soil. The subsoiler is designed to break compacted layers, and the the maximum power output of the T7070 reaches around 213 horsepower. The subsoiler is designed to break compacted layers, facilitating water infiltration and root aeration. This is crucial for preventing water logging and improving nutrient absorption. Soil compaction is a major agricultural issue that can reduce crop productivity. The Alpigo Mega Craker 9-410 is effective in reducing this compaction, promoting the health and development of plants. Deutzfar DX 6.50 In this video, we see a Deutz working with a Migliavaca 6-meter land leveler. After plowing and harrowing, the soil can become uneven, with higher or lower areas. The land leveler distributes the soil evenly, creating a flat surface that facilitates planting and improves seed germination uniformity. The Deutzfar DX 6.50 is a robust and versatile model that belongs to the DX series from Deutzfar, a German manufacturer known for its tradition and quality in agricultural equipment. The DX line was launched in the 1980s and brought various innovations to the agricultural sector. The DX 6.50 is equipped with a Deutz manufactured engine that features air-cooled technology, ensuring efficiency and durability. The DX in itsuter market quality general plan on the This tractor has a manual transmission with several gear options, typically 18 forward gears and 6 reverse gears, allowing the operator to choose the appropriate speed and power for different types of tasks.
