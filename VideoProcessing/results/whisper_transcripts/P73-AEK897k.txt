 Hi, my name is Sian Mercer. I'm from the YNUS Foundation. I'm working on a project called CASCO. CASCO has a couple of parts to it, one being using citizen scientists that take water samples along the usk and her tributaries. And a second part is working with farmers to look at on-farm interventions that will slow the flow and also improve water quality and infiltration. We're out today and we're doing some tree planting with the help of Stump Up for Trees and their volunteers. You can just see behind me that we've been planting some trees. You can just see the canes there. This is quite a wet area of land so we fenced it off a few months ago and now we're out planting trees. This is alder so that will really enhance the trees that are already here. It will help with the water quality infiltration and also the biodiversity along with slowing the flow of the water as well. So yeah, having a great day. There's about 20 volunteers out and yeah, so just really nice to see that something we're doing today will be here for a lifetime.
