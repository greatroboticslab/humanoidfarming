Farming is Magic with Beneficial Insects

 In nature there are many many different species of plants and insects and they live happily ever after in a perfect balance. In farming we have one crop in one field in one place so there's no surprise really that we have a problem with pests coming in. Here are some of my carrots, one of the crops that I grow. I have to come up with unique and innovative ways to try and control pests as an organic grower so I can't use chemicals, I've got to try and do it in balance with nature and what's available to me. Did you know there are nearly a million different species of insects in the world and actually not many of them affect farmers but those that do are really really hard to deal with. In your house if you had a fly for example flying around you might use this to kill it or you might use this but being organic I definitely can't use that. If I was to go and walk around my 300 football field size of carrot fields and try and swat every pest with this it wouldn't really be very practical so I have to come up with some really innovative techniques to try and do it in a more efficient way. I need to know everything there is to know about the pests that come in and attack my crop. I need to know how they live, how they feed, how they breed, how many times per year are they going to come into my crop, when are they going to come into my crop, at what time of day. I need to know every little detail. So when I have guests or visitors I encourage them to come and help me be pest detectives to look the aphids. Luckily I am not on my own in my battle against the aphids. I have got some cunning allies, some beneficial insects. So rather than show you little tiny insects that they are I thought I would show you like this. So here we have got a parasitic wasp that kills aphids. Here is beneficial insect number two. This is a ladybird and again this will eat the aphids. Beneficial insect number three. This is my favourite. This is the lacewing. The lacewing will hatch and have little eggs and they will become larvae, baby lacewing. The first thing they need to do is eat. So they are fantastic for me because they go and find the aphids and they eat them. I really want to make it as easy as possible for the beneficial insects to get into my crop and really help me. So they already naturally occur in the countryside around the outsides of the fields. But what I have effectively done here is create a corridor for them to come in and live on these beneficial banks of flower mixes. So you get these beautiful coloured flowers that they can come and feed and live on and control the aphids for me. I like to show people the seed of my beneficial insect banks. Look at all the different colours and sizes and types of seed in there. It is absolutely amazing. If you compare that to the carrot seeds which are all planted alongside them, absolutely amazing the difference. Because I grow so many carrots there tend to be more aphids than my beneficial friends can cope with. Therefore I have to buy some in and they come in little containers like this. I love what I do and I love taking every opportunity I can to explain to people using props just like these how I produce fresh vegetables using beneficial insects and other techniques. Farming is magic and I love it.
