Science & Technology
 I bet you didn't know your sushi might be more high-tech than your phone. Fish farming isn't just nets and water anymore, it's a digital playground now. Let's dive in. So, how's tech spicing up fish farms? First, we got underwater drones. They cruise around like little submarine bouncers, checking for sick fish and cleaning up messes. Then there's smart sensors. These bad boys track water quality faster than you can say, clam chowder. And get this. Artificial intelligence is calling the shots, telling farmers when to feed and when to chill. All of this means more fish, less waste and tastier seafood. It's like giving fish farms a brain upgrade. No more guessing games, just science and street smarts. So next time you order salmon, remember, it might have been raised with more tech than your last pizza delivery. That's what I call swimming with the future New York style.
