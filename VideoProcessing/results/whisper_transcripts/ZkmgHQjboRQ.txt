 Urban agriculture is a way of producing food within cities, but the social impact is way more important. My name is Sarah Mzika and I'm the co-founder of Cultivate and Plantation Paris. Plantation Paris is a very big rooftop where we have a greenhouse which is heated by a data center and we produce mainly microgreens and herbs within this environment. We also have a very big garden which has 70 different varieties of vegetables and herbs which sustain a lot of very fine dining restaurants within Paris. We also think that it's very important to give the chance to people to come to this kind of rooftop so we usually build public area. When we are building an urban farm, we know that we won't be able to sustain the whole city. The aim of an urban farm is to address a niche to grow a good quality produce. We focused on herbs and microgreens because usually they come far from Europe. These are the products that lost the most vitamins and nutrients when they travel. That's very interesting to grow these kinds of products within cities because it's harvested the same day as it's delivered. An ideal place to build an urban farm would probably be on very large-scale rooftop. To be able to install greenhouses which usually use sustainable way to heat throughout the year. If you want to have regular customers and business models, you need to produce all years long. When you create an urban farm, you are creating biodiversity at some point. All the bees, all the butterflies. Now we have a lot of worms, which means that the soil is very healthy. We also have like falcons that you usually never see within cities. An urban farm has a very big role to play. People can witness the fact that we are growing food within cities. And they can buy their products the same day as it was harvested. We are using very low-carbon logistics because we are delivering the baskets of vegetables with bicycles within the city. We are trying to have the lowest carbon footprint in all the process for creating a produce.
