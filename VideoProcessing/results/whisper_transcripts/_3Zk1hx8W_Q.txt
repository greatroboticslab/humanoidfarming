 Hey everybody it's Brian. I have this flower bed that's overgrown with weeds. I've been ignoring it for a while but it's time to get this cleaned up. I saw somebody talking about an action hoe in a forum that I'm in. I've never used one so I thought let me go get one and give it a try. Holy smokes I'm frustrated I didn't buy one of these things earlier. I know I'm probably late to the party. Some of you probably use these and have them but they are so good for removing weeds. I cleared out the whole area in less than an hour. It would have been two or three hours if I did it by hand. If you use it properly you can pull all the roots up and everything. Go get you one if you don't have one.
