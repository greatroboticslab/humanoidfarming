 Hello everyone, I'm Sanjita, a student from the Civil Engineering Department at Sichuan University. Today, I'm delighted to have the opportunity to speak with Mr. Afsar Ali, a dedicated vegetable farmer from Bangladesh. Through this interview, we aim to learn about his personal experiences in agriculture, the challenges he faces due to climate change, and how he is adapting his farming practices to ensure a sustainable future. Let's begin. We spoke with Afsar Ali, a vegetable farmer from Ghebanda District in northern Bangladesh. He shared how unpredictable rain and rising soil salinity have been destroying his crops year after year. Let's dive into the location where Afsar Ali and his farm belong. This is Ghebanda. Afsar's farm is in a small village near the Gaghot River. The land here is fertile, but recent floods and dry spells have made farming unpredictable. In Bangladesh, farming is more than just growing crops, it's about feeding families, surviving floods, and facing a future no one can predict. Farmers like Afsar Ali, in Ghebanda, are struggling against climate change, but a successful project in Jessore is showing that change is possible. This agroecology project in Jessore is called Improved Homestead Vegetable Gardening. It was developed by local NGOs and global partners, and it focuses on one idea, give farmers the tools, knowledge, and confidence to grow food sustainably, even in harsh conditions. The project trained mostly women, landless farmers, and smallholders. They were taught to make compost, improve soil fertility naturally, manage pests without chemicals, and make full use of small plots of land. What makes this approach different is that it doesn't depend on external inputs, everything comes from what farmers already have around them. Composting was at the heart of the training. Farmers were shown how to combine banana stems, dry leaves, ash, kitchen waste, and cow dung into rich organic fertilizer. Afsar tried this on his own farm. At first, he doubted it. But after two weeks, he noticed the change, his spinach leaves were larger, greener, and the soil stayed cooler even in the midday sun. Natural pest control was another major focus. Chemical sprays were replaced with neem oil, chili garlic sprays, and clever homemade traps. Farmers used yellow sticky cards to trap white flies, and soapy water to control beetles. Afsar now walks through his plot every morning with a bottle of neem solution, and he says it's been months since he saw major crop damage. One of the simplest but most powerful ideas was crop rotation and mixed planting. Instead of growing just one crop, Afsar started combining spinach, bottle gourd, and amaranth. He also planted marigolds to attract pollinators and drive away pests. His field began to look more like a garden than a farm, but the harvest was healthier and more stable. And the benefits went beyond food. The Jessor case study showed that children and participating families had better diets. Some families even earned extra income from selling surplus vegetables. Afsar is doing the same. He now sells vegetables twice a week at the village hot, earning enough to pay for school supplies for his daughter. What Afsar found most valuable wasn't the techniques themselves, it was the mindset. He said, before, I just followed what people told me. Now, I understand why I'm doing each step. I feel in control again. The case from Jessor proves that when farmers are treated as experts, not just laborers, they build resilience. They don't have to rely on expensive fertilizers or seeds from outside. They can grow food in their own way, in harmony with the land. As the climate becomes more unpredictable, these low-cost, local, and sustainable methods are not just alternatives, they are necessities. For farmers like Afsar, agroecology is not just a practice, it's hope, rooted in soil. Special thanks to Afsar Ali for sharing his story, and to the Agroecology Knowledge Hub for the case study that inspired this solution. Gratitude also to the people behind the Jessor Project who continue helping farmers build resilience.
