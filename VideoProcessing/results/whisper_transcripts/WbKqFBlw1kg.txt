 How do you get to the next acre out on the market? And one story I'd like to share. So my dad passed and then four years later on the other side of the family, they had a 7,000 acre operation and he wanted me to come and farm him. What I watched happen was all these acres went to someone else, but the cash rent all went up a hundred dollars across the board because it just all new meat in the safari that was just getting fought over. That's the scary thing is you got to, if you want to grow, you got to pay that $450 flex lease. And now you got to have John Deere to have all these buttons to have all the shot off. So now John Deere's got to have tier seven and it's just getting so damn expensive that it's just going to turn into the hog model is what's going to happen. We're going to have two roads. You either have a brand or you're going to just farm to sit in the seed and just knock out the acres. So you think the future is custom growers or row cropping? It's going to be just like the hog model, except instead of getting paid for the barn, you're going to get paid for the acre space.
