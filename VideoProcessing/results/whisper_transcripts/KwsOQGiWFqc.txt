 Ahead on NCBA's Cattlemen to Cattlemen. What are the keys to making high quality hay for your cattle? Today we'll share best practices and insights on the latest in hay tools and machinery. And now NCBA's Cattlemen to Cattlemen with host Kevin Ochsner. Hello and welcome to this special edition of NCBA's Cattlemen to Cattlemen. I'm Kevin Ochsner. Thanks for joining us. When it comes to the cattle business, high quality hay is essential. And there's no doubt that having the right tractors, hay tools and technology pays off in a big way. So today we're going to spend our time focused on the keys to success in making high quality hay. And we'll give you some valuable information that will help you make your next hay season even more productive. And here to share their knowledge with us are three experts from New Holland Agriculture, all of whom work in the Hay and Forage Group. Kurt Hoffman is focused on crop packaging. George Rigdon works in the area of supporting hay tools. And Jordan Molesky is the manager for crop preparation. Welcome, gentlemen, to the show. We're sure glad you're here. Thanks. You know, there's been a lot of advances all across the agricultural industry over the last several years in terms of tools and technologies. And I'd just be curious, Jordan, what are some of those advances people need to be aware of from a cattle person perspective? From a technology standpoint, it's really been interesting during our careers. We've gone from calling cards to bag phones to flip phones to now smart phones. And technology has really made its way into every aspect of the producer's life. The hay tool hasn't been left out. Today's round balers and other products that we offer today are very technological. And those things are really there to help make life easier just like your smart phone does for you. Kurt's round baler, for example, has something called IntelliBail on it. Yeah, we're learning to get along with the tractor guys better. So the round baler talks to the tractor and actually takes over the tractor functions and helps it make a better quality bale, consistent size bale. So automation between tractor and round baler has really taken a big leap forward in the last two years. Yeah, you don't think sometimes of haymaking as technologically advanced as planting a corn crop, but it really is. It definitely is, yeah. And so tell us this, as we talk about haymaking, one of the big issues that we face is getting that hay to dry fast enough. And I know New Holland has always been leaders in that area. Tell us a little bit more about that. Well, sure. I mean, when it comes to drying your hay quickly, technology is a piece of it, but only so much as far as the weather forecast goes. When it comes to making your hay and getting it dry very, very quickly, I think the real key goes back to the age-old technologies. The mechanical conditioning systems that New Holland pioneered back in 1964 with the first hay mine have really come a long way. So being able to cut, condition in a single pass, and today to be able to lay that swath out extremely wide behind your mower conditioner or your self-propelled wind rower is going to help keep the stomata open on those plants, help that material to dry down very rapidly, and it has a really big influence on crop quality. So once we have that windrow laid out wide, we're going to have to rely on some tedding and raking to prepare that hay to bale. Is that right, George? Absolutely, Kevin. And I think it's a real situation. A lot of producers have experience firsthand. You turn on the news, you watch the weather, looks like you're going to have maybe five days of a window to get up good quality dry hay. You go out, you mow, you come back in later that evening, look at the weather forecast. That window has now shrunk to maybe three days. So how do you best manage that shorter window? And I think that's where tedders have really been growing in popularity to help you best manage that shorter, weather window to get up good quality dry hay. And we're seeing it, I think, expand to beyond just the grass hay producer. We're seeing expansion into alfalfa producers and trying to manage that shorter window and get up good quality dry hay. You know, quite honestly, too, there's a lot of a transition occurring, too, in terms of bigger tedders. So customers looking to run that tedder optimally at a slower ground speed, cover just as much in terms of the number of swaths, and still realize the maximum benefit of that tedder in their operation. Looking at rakes, we're seeing a pretty wide adoption of, on wheel rakes, a center kicker wheel kit. That center kicker wheel kit will help elevate that crop up off the ground, incorporate the bottom part of that crop mat in the rest of the windrow to help you get more uniformity in your dry down time. And the other thing it does, too, is it helps to allow that baler pickup to more cleanly pick up the windrow as you follow the rake. Outstanding. I want to pick up on one thing you mentioned there, and that's in terms of timing. So what are some considerations we need to keep in mind as we think about the timing of tedding and raking? Sure. Really, a tedder, to realize the full advantage and benefit of that machine, the sooner that you can get out behind the mower or the mower conditioner and start tedding, the more impact, the more positive impact you'll see from the performance of that tedder. So the main principle of the tedder, of course, is to kind of separate the crop and spread an even, uniform crop mat across the back. That allows for more sunlight to get penetrated. That allows for more airflow, more wind movement through the crop to help you really maximize that dry down and reduce that wind in terms of drying. When it comes to raking, there's some different variables to take into account. If you look at alfalfa as an example, certainly you want to be raking when it's not at a bone dry moisture content. The risk you run there is the drier it gets when you're forming that windrow, the more susceptible you are to leaf loss and shatter. And of course, that's where the nutritional value is in that plant. Yeah. We're pretty sensitive to that on that alfalfa crop for sure. Yes, sir. So let's talk about another way to keep leaves in alfalfa is just to bale it wet. And, you know, I've heard a lot about high moisture baling more recently. Kurt, tell us more about that. Yeah, along the lines of what George was saying earlier, you know, if you get lucky and there's a five day window and you can make dry hay, that's awesome. If it shrinks to three days, that's still maybe doable. But what do you do when the weather forecast has got 40 and 50 percent showers in it for five, six days straight? You got to get that hay off. So your options are pretty limited. So one of the best things you can do is make high moisture hay. You wilt it down 10, 15 points and you're good to go. Takes, you know, six, eight hours and you can get it done. You can be in there baling that crop. You harvest more leaves because the plant obviously is wetter. It's ideal to try and make that crop between 45 and 55 percent moisture when you can. Outstanding. So what are some of the strategies we should consider if we want to move from baling dry hay to baling high moisture hay? I mean, one of the strategies is lay it out wide. That doesn't change. We're still trying to get the sunshine to the stomata on the alfalfa plant, get it to wilt down as fast as possible, conserve all the sugars you can, because obviously you're going to need those sugars to ferment that feed to give it good stability when you take the plastic off of the feed and give it a longer stability. I'd like to see, you know, a 4.0 or a 4.5 on the pH. And the more sugar you can keep, the lower you can drive that pH for bunk stability. Basically, you're wanting to rake that crop in 24 hours and get it baled. Wrapping it, you certainly don't want to wait much over 2 or 3 hours after baling to get it started. You want to try and keep the core temperature of the bale down well under 140, 150 if you can. When you test that crop, you'll see what kind of a job you've done, because you can look at the heat damage protein and see how high that core temperature got. So you said we're going to bale at, what did you say, 40 or 45 percent moisture? Ideal is 45 to 55 if you can, but if the weather doesn't let you get it that dry, I mean, you can bale all the way up to 65 percent. You really don't want to bale it any wetter than that, because when you take the plastic off, you're going to find water and sap in the bottom. The bottom part of that bale probably isn't going to be eaten as well by the cattle, because there's more butyric acid in there that stinks, and they just don't consume that crop as well as they should. But hey, if Mother Nature doesn't leave you any other option, it's still better to do that and get decent quality feed out of the 90 percent of the bale, rather than leave it there and get wet. So Kurt, what would you tell our viewers in terms of why they should consider high moisture baling? Higher digestibilities. It doesn't really require as much time to get the job done as far as weather window. You harvest a higher amount of dry matter material per acre because you don't get as much leaf shatter like George and Jordan had said. Stem shatter, you don't have any of that. You're harvesting more on time also because you need a smaller weather window to get the job done. So it all works together to make a better quality product for your cattle. Now I've heard you New Holland folks talk about CropSaver. Tell us a little bit about that and what benefits that offers. Yep, you bet. CropSaver's been around a long time. It's safe for any animal you feed it to, but really what it is, is it's a liquid you spray on the crop. It's a mixture of propionic acid and citric acid. It's there to keep molds, yeast, and fungi from growing and keep that crop cool while it cures out basically. And this product is being used to make dry hay of course. You would use this CropSaver product basically to treat hay that's somewhere around 15 to 16 percent moisture depending on the baler you're using. If you're using a small square baler you could use it at 18 or 19. If you're making a round bale you're going to need to use it sooner. If you're using a big square baler you need to use it even sooner yet, so about 15. But it's good up to about 28 percent for moisture and it opens up a wider weather window so that if things are not drying out as quick as you wanted and Mother Nature changes the forecast on you, you can still get out there and make good quality hay. Outstanding. Thank you so much for those insights. We're sure excited to have our friends from New Holland Agriculture with us to talk about hay and forage today.

Welcome back to this special edition of NCBA's Cattlemen and Cattlemen. We're talking about keys to success in making hay with the experts from New Holland Agriculture. Let's get back to our discussion. Now that we move into the fall months and we're thinking about putting up this final cutting of hay, Jordan, what are some of the considerations we need to keep in mind? Well, first and foremost, it is the later cuttings, the final cuttings of the year. So the stand is obviously going to be the thinnest of the year. So one thing I like to tell producers to do is take a look at the conditioning system, take a look at the conditioning of the knives. Certainly if the crop is thin and light, a sharp knife is really going to be important to help limit blowdown, for example, to get a nice, good quality, clean cut so that you're not leaving hay behind in the field. The conditioner piece specifically, early harvests is very thick. It's very heavy. It's very lush. It takes a lot of intensity to do a good job of conditioning that crop for fast drying. Later season cuts, however, you need to turn that conditioner down a little bit, whether it's a flail tine system or a rubber roll type system, back down that conditioning because you don't need to put that much conditioning into it because it is so light, you don't want to damage that stand and lose leaves which is going to impact your quality. What would you add, George? Well, good point. And I think to Jordan's point, it's late in the year. Tonnage is down compared to what first cutting would be or even prior cuttings. And I think in looking at maximizing your rake, maximize the full working width of it. The tonnage isn't there. Open it up all the way. Produce a nice windrow. Gather as much material as you can. Save yourself some passes through the field with the baler. Save fuel. Save time that way. But really maximize your width of your rake. And from a baling perspective, Kurt, what would you add? I'm more reliant on George raking enough material together for me, making that nice uniform windrow. I think our windrow uniformity suffers a bit in those later cuttings. So we'd like to have a windrow that's the full width of the chamber of the round baler in the case of a round baler. I think that the other thing that we start to do is because of the number of minutes of daylight's going down on us, we're in a hurry. And since we're in a hurry, we probably ought to adjust the pickup a little bit more, make it a little heavier, because we're traveling faster ground speeds because tonnage is down. That way I don't have skips and bounces where I miss crop. Outstanding. Jordan, you mentioned sharp knives. I know that's critically important. What would you have to share with our viewers about knives? Well, it doesn't matter if it's a sickle machine or a disc machine. A sharp knife is really essential to a nice, good quality cut. Our center pivot disc machines and our self-propelled windrows with Durabine heads have a quick change knife feature, which means there's really no excuse to ever have a dull knife again. Some folks talk about sharpening knives. That's something I definitely don't recommend because you can take the temper out of the knife, which certainly isn't going to make it last very long. So changing blades or knives is very important to maintaining a good quality cut. With a sickle machine specifically, you probably should look at some of those adjustments on that sickle bar piece. If your clearance isn't set right on the knife itself, hair can, excuse me, crop can hairpin wrap a little bit on that knife blade. So make sure those adjustments are set up, especially for those thinner later crops. Very good. George, we talk about raking and sometimes people think of it as just some kind of mindless activity, but in reality, it can have a big impact on the quality of bales, right? Oh, absolutely. Huge impact. I mean, it is probably, like I tell a lot of people, the first step to building a good bale is building a good windrow. And that starts with a hay rake. I mean, that's a huge influence on Kurt's round baler, on his square balers. Really, and when you get late in the season compared to early in the season, there's some adjustments you need to make too in terms of volume. Kurt had mentioned windrow uniformity. That's key. Windrow width is another big factor. So, uniformity and shape, making sure that you're level and flat across the top, that's ideal. Width is another big factor, especially when it comes to round baling. If you want to produce consistent, dense, uniform-looking bales across the entire field, it's really key to make sure that your windrow width is set properly for the round baler that's going to be following that rake. As an example, if a customer is baling with a four-foot wide round baler, if you can make a windrow that's four-foot wide from edge to edge and it's uniform across the top, that's ideal. Then the man that's running the round baler can run straight down the windrow, build himself a uniform, well-built bale time and time again. If you can't do that and you get late into the season, you may not be able to make a windrow that's uniform across the top from left to right that's 100% the width of the bale chamber. So if you can make a windrow that's maybe 50% the width of the bale chamber and spend equal time on the left-hand side and right-hand side, you'll produce a nice uniform-looking bale. The worst thing I think that you can get into is if you produce a windrow that's, say, 75% the width of the bale chamber, you're always going to be filling the center of that bale. So no matter how much time you spend on the left and the right-hand side, the rake guy really set up the round baler man to be in a poor spot as far as building a nice high-quality bale that's uniform in shape, consistently across the field. But we'll just blame it on the round baler guy. I was going to say, you made me look mad. We can. But raking is certainly key. So what are some of the adjustments we should be making to our rake? Sure. I think there's a number of different things. Looking at wheel rakes as an example, rake wheel flotation is pretty key. So ensuring that your flotation is uniform from front to back, from left side to right side, across the entire rake beam. If you have too little flotation, so the rake wheels are riding too heavy on the ground, you're going to have premature tine wear. You'll probably bring in dirt clods, rocks, et cetera, into the windrow. It's going to add to your tonnage, but it's not good tonnage. The cattle won't appreciate that. On the contrary, if you have too much flotation, the rake wheels won't completely engage the ground and bring that crop in to the windrow. So flotation is really key. Another important factor is the rake arm angle. The steeper the angle that you have or the wider the angle that you have on a wheel rake, the less raking efficiency you'll see. If you can kind of close up that angle and pull those wheels in more of a straight line, they'll turn more freely. You'll recognize greater raking efficiency as a result of that. Looking at rotary rakes as an example, ground speed and PTO speed are extremely important in terms of forming your windrow. And then the swath curtain adjustment as well to determine what size of a windrow needs to be produced in terms of crop volume and what baler is going to be following that rake. So we've got a perfect windrow now, Kurt. So I'm going to ask you, as we think about that fall crop, what are some of the other considerations we need to keep in mind in terms of our baler? I thought you were going to ask me if we were going to make a perfect bale. We're going to try. We're going to try. I'll set you up. Yeah, exactly. I think some of the big things is like we mentioned before, having the pickup down there nice and tight against the ground. If you're going faster in that lighter crop, let's make sure we put a little more weight on the pickup to keep the pickup gauge wheels against the ground instead of bouncing around. We tend to get in a hurry in the fall and I see a lot of crop that's left behind because it's shorter, it's finer stemmed. It's usually pretty good quality, low ash content hopefully if we've got the rake set right. So you want to get it all and that's one of the things that is not done a lot of times with customers. So any specific adjustments we should be thinking about as we not only put up hay but maybe even corn stalks or beaten stubble or what have you? Yeah, in the case of crop residues because they're coarser materials rather than the fine stem grasses and alfalfas that we've been baling, you want to turn your density up. You'd like to get a bale that's at least eight, nine pounds per cubic foot. That way those bales when they're set outside in the field they're not wicking up water out of the ground because they squatted down and now they have double the contact patch against the ground. By the same token they're not absorbing a lot of water from rains and snows and that kind of thing. And then if we get that density bumped up, we get a good bale shape to it, it might not hurt to put a little more net on it because that also helps repel water. And then where you choose to stack those bales. You know a lot of us are in a hurry so they just go along the fence row, they go along the woods. If you pick a spot that's well drained, especially if you happen to have a gravel area to put them on or better yet even a building. A lot of us don't have buildings. But your choice of where you store things really affects things as well. Boy, I really appreciate this practical advice you give us.

Today, we're talking about some of the keys to success when it comes to making the quality hay your cattle operation demands. Now, of course, the reason for all this effort in making high-quality hay is to provide cattle the feed and forage they need. I guess I would ask you, Kurt, from a baling perspective, producers feed hay in a number of different ways. How should that drive some of the considerations we have when we're making that hay? It depends on the characteristics of the baler. I mean, some balers have cutters, some balers don't. If you have a cutting-equipped baler, a lot of times we'd like to cut crop to densify the crop. We get more crop in the bale, make the density go up, and cut our net wrap costs, cut our production costs, our storage costs, and our handling costs. So tell us about how bale slice and crop cutter really do drive differences in the quality of the hay. Yeah, one of the big things that cutting crop does is it just makes everything fit together nice and tight. It creates a nicer, fat match so that it's better at shedding water. It wicks less water up out of the ground. It's like giving an extended storage life to the bale by doing that. It's nice to be able to wrap with a net when you do that as well. That also helps the crop store better, longer. Then from the cattle perspective, it's really nice when you cut that net off and you go to feed this crop. You know, a cow goes in, locks all fours, and grabs a mouthful, not a mouthful, and a half. Chews off the half, and we know what happens to the half around the ring feeder. It's waste. It's bedding. Exactly. The other thing that happens is, as we observe cattle eating hay, a lot of times when the bell cow comes in, she gets her fill, what happens? Well, the bell cow wanders off, and what happens to the others? Well, the others follow, right? If they weren't able to eat and digest material as quickly as she was, they don't probably have as good a daily gain, or maybe they don't wean as high a weighted calf, that kind of thing. If we can get the playing field level for everybody to intake crop as quick, that's where the cutting really shines and gives you better average daily gains. Fantastic. And actually, you know, putting up hay is the first step, but how we store hay has a huge impact on the value, nutritional quality and value of that hay long term, right? Certainly it does. If we have the luxury of a building, that's ideal. You know, losses are 2, 3, 4 percent. But if we don't have that luxury, what can we do to make our hay last longer? Well, the best thing we can do is pick a well-drained slope or a graveled area where water can get away rapidly. The other thing I see a lot of folks not doing is, you know, when you butt bales end to end to end, you want them nice and tight. Some folks stack bales. There's different theories on how you stack bales based upon whether you're out west or you're out east and how much rain you get. But stacking the crop and making a dense bale so that those bales don't deform and then more prone to wicking up water and things, those are some of the best things you can do to make that hay last longer. And hey, if you have extra hay, we can always sell extra hay, right? Absolutely. And Kurt, you were talking earlier about just the number of operations you've had an opportunity to get on over the years. And I guess I would just ask you, what are some of the biggest mistakes you've seen over time in terms of how producers either put up, store, or actually feed hay? Well, we hit on that a little bit earlier with the Crop Saver question. A lot of hay gets made when it's tough and then it turns into moldy feed. So that's the biggest thing you can do is make sure you're baling hay, bale it at the proper moisture. The second one is density, making sure that density is set up there so that it gives that hay at the best chance at being stored over the longest period of time. And then after that, like we had mentioned before, the storage site is key. And then if you can cut crop, if you happen to purchase a baler with a cutter, it's always best to cut if you can because that's an easy way to add another 15% or up to 15% more material in that same size package. That helps the bale store longer as well. It should be worth a little bit more money if it's cut too. Feed costs are at least 60% of our costs in the cattle business so putting up good quality forage and making sure they get the nutritional quality out of every ounce is critical.

You're watching NCBA's Cattlemen to Cattlemen on RFD-TV. Welcome back to NCBA's Cattlemen to Cattlemen. You know, we've talked a lot about the season itself. Let's talk about what we do after the season. And Jordan, I want to begin with you. What are some things we should do to evaluate that disc mower as we wrap up the year and before we put it into the shed? Well, Kevin, we talked a little bit earlier in the show about tuning up your machine for those later harvests, that thinner crop. I think it's important for producers to remember that the end of the year is very different from early season. And come springtime, it'll be a very different environment to make hay. Crops will be a lot thicker like they always are in first crop. And if you put the machine away, adjusted for later season, it's not ready to go in the spring. So I like to tell folks that, you know, if you're going to put your machine away, set it up to be ready to go. Because when the time comes to make hay, it's going to be amongst your tillage and your seeding application, maybe some spraying. So it's going to be a rush to make that first crop like it always is. And you need to be ready to go with that machine when that time comes. Be prepared. Let's talk about tedders and hay rakes. Is there anything we should be doing with those pieces of equipment before we put them away for the winter? Absolutely. And I think in a producer's operation, the list of equipment ranges from tractors to disc mower conditioners to round balers, sprayers as an example, tillage pieces. The hay rake, the tedder may fall way down in terms of regular scheduled maintenance, but that doesn't mean that they're maintenance free pieces. There's some pretty quick and easy things to assess on them when you bring them in at the end of the year. To Jordan's point, if you're working in more of a late season crop with smaller tonnages going into first cutting that following spring, you're probably not going to be set up ideally for that crop. So just remember that when you go back to the field in the springtime, you're going to need to readjust probably your rake arm angle, your windrow width on a wheel rake. Looking at things as simple as rake tines. Are there any missing? Are there any broken? If so, replace them. If there's enough missing on an individual rake wheel, maybe think about replacing that entire rake wheel assembly. Very quick, very easy to do so. I think another simple thing in terms of wheel rakes is lift the wheels up off the top of the rake. Lift the wheels up off the ground. Go around and spin them by hand. Are they binding? Are they, is there excessive free play or slop in them? If there is, address those bearings and get them replaced so that when you go to the field in the first cutting, to Jordan's point, kind of on a limited time schedule, in a rush, everything's ready to go and perform. So I know we may be using the round baler a little later in the season than these other tools as we think about crop residue and so forth, but ultimately we're going to put that in the shed as well. And so what are some things we need to think about as we wrap up the year, no pun intended, with the round baler? Well, one of the first things you want to do is get the compressor out, blow this thing off. Let's take a look at it. Let's inspect bearings, chains, belts, lacings, that kind of stuff on a round baler. And also don't forget your pickup. Pickup is taking an abuse probably all year long. It's been down in the dirt doing the job for you. Let's take pickup bands off, get in there and take a look at cam follower bearings, cams, that kind of stuff. Make sure that everything's good and tight still. If it's not, now's the time to go ahead and replace that stuff. That way, as we'll find out later, that sets you up either for next spring or sets you up to make a trade maybe. Very good. And as we talk about this year-end kind of activity, I guess I'd be curious, what are your recommendations in terms of how we could engage our dealer in making any of these evaluations about the equipment or about repairs that we may need or what have you? George? We have checklists that we provide dealers with many of our equipment, much beyond Hay Tools certainly, that helps dealers to assess equipment. Those can be made available to customers as quick guides to kind of go down through and kind of check that equipment out, make sure that it's good to go. End of season, a lot of dealers will have parts specials obviously because their parts business might be slowing down at the year-end as well. So it's a really good time to be able to order that long lead time part and have it on hand and be ready to go and really tune up your equipment and get a little bit more dealer support because when you slow down, they slow down too and everybody's a little bit better equipped to work together. Very good. Would you guys add anything? Sure. I mean a lot of dealers also run a winter maintenance program. Oh. So it's an opportunity if the producer decides that doesn't have enough time maybe to go through and perform the inspection like Jordan's talking about. A lot of dealers will work with that producer to bring the machine into their shop. They'll go through an inspection checklist, perform the regular scheduled maintenance. If there's any items that need attention, they'll review that with the customer. At that point in time, then maybe it's a discussion too on do we replace these parts that need attention or is it maybe time to think about trading? Very good. Kurt, anything else? No, I think they did a great job. They covered it. Fantastic. Well, I do have a few more questions for you guys in just a little bit. But I want you to remember if you want more information on any of the topics we've discussed today, make sure you visit the website newholland.com. Still ahead, we'll visit with Baxter Black. And we'll have more on haymaking right after this. Stay with us. You won't notice any untamed acreage here, a retaining wall that needs rebuilding, or an old gnarled tree stump in the middle of a field. Why? Because it's already been taken care of. That's why.

Welcome back to this special edition of NCBA's Cattlemen to Cattlemen. I want to come back to where we left off during the last segment, which was we've evaluated our equipment. How do we make the final decision, Jordan, of whether we tune up or trade in? Thanks, Kevin. For a lot of producers that are like myself and Kurt and George here, we have a tendency to build our own shade tree mechanics and do a lot of the work ourselves. And sometimes, whether it's cost or pride, we don't like to admit that maybe it's time to look for something new. When you bring your equipment in for fall servicing, before you're going to put it away, take good stock of really what it means because your time is valuable to you as a producer as well. It's important to take a look at the conditioning rolls or the tines in the conditioner. The condition of the disc cutter bar, for example, is important, more than just blades and discs. So take a good hard look at those items. Think about the cost and the time to make those repairs during the off-season. And certainly visit your local New Holland dealer, see what that's worth on trade, and maybe you can step into a new machine, a baler, a disc bind, and have a little warranty, which is a good peace of mind for producers today. You bet. Kind of manage your fixed costs and don't have any surprises next spring. So I want to talk about, George, let's say we have a machine that's five years old or older, you know, a disc mower or round baler or what have you. What would your advice be? Sure. Fair question. And I think it varies from producer to producer. The number of cuttings they're running through that machine on an annual basis. Are they bailing some more abrasive crops like corn stalks that will wear components quicker than grass, hay, or alfalfa will? And then kind of look at the bail count, the estimated number of acres that that machine has covered, and what can you afford for downtime? Is your list getting longer as far as maintenance items that need to be addressed at the end of the year on the baler, on the disc mower conditioner, on the rake, on the tedder? Keep in contact with your dealer. A dealer is a great source in terms of monitoring the used value of equipment. So keep in touch with them and see if I run this machine for another year, say for the sixth year or the seventh year, what's that do to my resale value? And that can be a good indicator in terms of is it time to trade after five years? Or maybe it's sooner than five years. Very good. And you know, I mentioned the word five years because I've been watching what you all have done. And Kurt, there's been a lot of advancements in the last two to five years in terms of what you all have done in haymaking. Tell us a little bit about some of those. For sure. And you know, we've looked at the mechanical part of it. Is it time to trade? But you know, maybe last year we updated and we bought our first CVT transmission in a tractor. And now we have an ISOBUS3 tractor. So maybe this year it's the baler's turn because this year maybe we're picking up more acres. I'm going to have to hire a couple more people. Maybe I've got less experience on the average and I need something that's more automated. So now with that new ISOBUS3 tractor, if I made it up with an ISOBUS3 equipped round baler, we can then use the two together basically to make bales in a more automated fashion where I don't need as much experience in the seat of the tractor. Very good. George, I want to ask you a question. You know, Ford and New Holland has a long history and heritage with livestock producers. And I guess I would ask you, what makes you all so uniquely qualified to serve the needs of today's cattlemen? Sure. I think it goes back to our heritage and history as a company. A couple of years ago we celebrated 120 years as a company. We've always been very focused and dedicated to the grassland farmer, to hay production. Very strong heritage. There's some new entrants coming into the marketplace today with a hay tool line. We've been in this space for quite some time. We've got the knowledge. We've got the understanding of the business. We're always in contact with our producers to understand what's important to them. What do they value in their operation? I think another piece of it too is it doesn't matter the size of the cattle producer. If it's a part-time guy, a mid-sized guy, or a large-sized guy. We have a number of solutions available from the mowing part of it, to the tedding, to the raking, to the baling, and even bale handling with a self-propelled bale wagon. So we really have a full range of solutions that are dedicated to helping cattle producers really put up high-quality hay. Yeah, I sure have an appreciation for the fact it's not just the equipment, it's the kind of knowledge you've shared today and the kind of technology you're talking about for tomorrow that really makes a complete solution for cattlemen and women like myself. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association is so pleased to have New Holland as a partner, and there are valuable incentives on New Holland equipment for NCBA members.

Want more profit out of your pasture? Then here's our two cents on using parasite control to make some dollars. In a trial of calves, long range outperformed cydectin and safeguard dewormers combined by as much as an extra 40 pounds. Yeah, that's a lot of extra profit. And that's why it pays to treat cattle with long range. Do not treat within 48 days of slaughter. Not for use in female dairy cattle 20 months of age or older, including dry dairy cows or in veal calves. Post-injection site damage can occur. These reactions have disappeared without treatment. You can't afford another season without long range. If you're allergic to progress, I'll catch you later. How important is it for your vaccine medicine and pour-on to be accurately administered? I mean, does a 376 pounder get the same medicine as a 400 pounder behind him? And how about you pour-on? Cows can easily differ 100 pounds. Tapari has a pistol grip that automatically calculates the specific doses. It's amazing. You betcha. Squeeze chute required. Check it out. Tapari.com. We know you're up before the dawn because the cattle rise before the sun. And you spend long hours in the saddle because the herd isn't always over the next rise. And you care for the land because you know it takes care of your family. And we know you do great work. And it's time to tell that story to the marketplace. I am iGlobal. Here to help you do just that. Springtime. Wildflowers are blooming. Long johns are coming off and it's Brandon time. For years it's become a time for neighbors to get together and help one another. The cows and calves have been gathered the day before. The calves are sorted off from their mamas. Brandon pots are set up. Brands are heating. Vaccine guns are loaded. Ear tags are laid out. And dad's knife is sharp enough to clean a horn fly's fingernails. Ideal right weight. Technology has reared its sleek rancher's helper automated finger mashing clanging banging head. In the form of a tilt table calf shoot. So nowadays when your neighbor invites you to come help him brand these calves you mumble around. You're feeling him out as to whether he's still roping them and dragging them to the fire. Or pushing them through this long narrow alley and catching them in this calf shoot. Sure you appreciate that it's easier on the calves and the help and the horses and that it takes less time and labor. Even less space than the traditional way. But it's so mechanical. So feedlot. So farmerish. It's like work. Branding calves is not supposed to be work. It's supposed to be like Christmas. The fourth of July. Going to the national finals rodeo. Not like getting your army physical or helping your neighbor unload a truckload of salt blocks. You dress up to come to a branding. You wear your shafts and your spurs. Not your coveralls and steel toed work boots. You worry about missing your dally. Not banging your head. Getting run over in the alley. Lacks the excitement of having a calf run under your horse. A deft jab with a hot shot or a professional sub-Q injection does not elicit the same yee-haw as a beautiful over-the-shoulder catch double hock and a snaky cat. It's the difference between shooting a pheasant out of the air and hitting one with your car. Besides, it gives your horse a purpose and you a little glamour. And we can all use that. Now it's in. This is Baxter Black from out there. Thanks, Baxter. We always enjoy your segments.

Welcome back as we wrap up this edition of NCBA's Cattlemen to Cattlemen. We're going to take a couple of minutes to get some final thoughts from our New Holland friends about the keys to success in making high quality hay. Jordan, let's start with you. Well, I guess my closing thought would be it's all about forage quality. If you want the most animal weight gain that you can get, it starts at the point where you cut the crop and you harvest it at the right time. We talked a little bit earlier about cut quality in late season crops and how to get the most out of that lighter stand. Putting the machine away, making sure it's ready to go for the spring, it all comes down to the adjustments of that machine. Make sure that machine is properly adjusted for the conditions it's going to see whether it's early spring harvesting or late season harvesting. It takes just as much effort to make poor quality hay as it does to make top quality hay. That's a great point. George, what would you add? Sure. Well, Kevin, appreciate the opportunity to come here on the show today. It's been a great experience. I would say that in the big picture, it's easy to focus in on the Dismower Conditioner, on the round baler in the operation. When you're looking at making high quality hay and making a uniform bale shape. But don't overlook things like the rake and the tether that play a key, key factor in influencing your bale quality and also your hay quality. Things like minimizing your ash content. Make sure that the rake is set properly so you're not bringing in any kind of impurities into the windrow. Bring in the nice clean hay that the cattle want that's going to be high nutrition for them. And then also, don't forget about setting that rake properly so that when the round baler travels down across the windrow, you build a nice consistent uniform bale. I think the other thing too, when customers are looking at potentially trading a round baler or trading into another mower conditioner, if they're moving up in size, don't forget about the rake or don't forget about the tether. You may have to resize that piece to accommodate the newer mower conditioner or the new round baler. That's a great point. The unsung heroes indeed. That's right. Kurt, what would you add? Well, I think it was very well said. I'm the old guy here, so I'm going to say don't be afraid to try some new stuff. Take a look at some new stuff. Maybe it's not brand new cutting edge stuff that came out today, but maybe you've monitored it for two or three years and you kind of like what you see. Don't be afraid to try that new end cab density. Don't be afraid to try things like IntelliBale. And don't forget, maybe you don't buy it today, but maybe you go out and ask that dealer that we talked about, trade in value for a demo. It doesn't hurt to ever ask for a demo. You can always try it, try a lease, see if it's going to work out for your operation and go for it. Always go for the best quality hay. Like Jordan said, the best quality is always right there when you cut it and it's only going one way after that. So try and conserve everything you can in it. That's great, great advice. Thank you so much for coming to the show and thank you for this very, very practical and tangible advice you've given us about making good quality hay. We appreciate it. Thanks.
