 Did you ever wonder how can you grow fresh coriander within 5 days in your home garden? Here is how. Take some coriander seeds and pound them gently until they split up. Give it a wash for once and then soak them overnight in water. Once they are soaked good enough, take just the seeds, do not drain the soaked water. Clear some area in your garden or a pot and sprinkle the seeds evenly. Cover them up with mud and pat it. Do not press the soil too much. Moist the area with soaked water and some fresh water if needed according to soil fertility. The saplings start growing from day 5 and grows rapidly by 15 days. Water them regularly and use them fresh in your dishes.
