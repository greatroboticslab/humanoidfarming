Education
 Good morning. Thank you for joining this morning. And I'm sorry I could not be live talking to you all on Zoom, but hopefully you will find this recorded presentation just as valuable. Thank you all for this opportunity to listen to me. I'm going to provide some perspectives on commercial strawberry production in the US and really going to talk a lot about my experience in Virginia, as well as some of my experiences in California while I was doing my postdoctoral research over there. I started my position here in Virginia with Virginia Tech in the year 2013. So I'm really excited to share about my experiences about growing strawberries and I hope that you again find this very useful. So the US is a pretty strong producer for strawberries. The economic value range is between 2.3 and 2.8 billion. It fluctuates a little bit depending on year to year. And in the recent 15 or 20 years, there is a lot of interest in growing strawberry for a fresh market use. So there's a strong component of local food system, a very strong component of agri-tourism that ties with strawberry production in the US. And from what I understand by talking with Brill is that a lot of you all in the room are also interested in utilizing strawberry from the agri-tourism standpoint. There's also an increased consumption. We are noticing for strawberries on year to year basis. And if you see how much strawberry that was consumed in 1980 versus what is consumed in 2013, there is a substantial jump in the amount of strawberry that is consumed per person on a per year basis. Just to provide you all an overview of the different strawberry production regions in the US, you can see region one to the left of this slide is California. And a lot of you may be aware that California is the largest producer of strawberry in the world as well as in the United States. And then if you go all the way to the east, region eight, Florida is the second largest producer of strawberry in the US. A lot of the winter production happens in Florida, the winter strawberries that move up on the east coast during the winter season, they come from Florida as well. Virginia, which is where I'm stationed. It falls under region seven. And it is the third most widely grown acreage for strawberry, which encompasses states like Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. And year strawberries are mainly grown for local markets. So growers will allow consumers to come pick berries at their farm, they will use their own labor to harvest the berries and then sell at the farm stand that is called pre-pick retail. And agritourism where consumers come actually is a you pick retail system. And also there are a few wholesale growers, not a whole lot, but a few wholesale growers. And then a lot of the states in the Midwest also grow strawberries for the same reason is to supply off season as well as local strawberry for the residents of those respective states. So region three, region four, and region five would encompass those states where strawberries primarily again grown for local fruit production. In region two, a lot of the strawberries that are grown, they are more acreage. There's more acreage of strawberry grown in region two compared to region seven, but most of the strawberries are used for processing, which means that they are used for making jams, jellies, etc. Let's talk a little bit about the nutritive value of the strawberry. It is America's favorite crop. It is America's favorite crop as well as fruit. A lot of children really enjoy harvesting as well as eating strawberries. So because the children like it, you know, a lot of parents are involved with consumption as well as picking of strawberry. And these are available year round. There's more vitamin C in strawberry than an orange. They are naturally low in sugar. And they are particularly good for, you know, regulating the heart, controlling the risk of heart disease. So minimizing the risk of heart disease as well as regulating blood pressure. Just want to talk a little bit about the plant itself. You can see the crown is listed closer. You know, if you look at the figure on the right, you can see the crown that's listed towards the base of the soil. And that is basically considered the core of the plant, which gives rise to the aerial parts of the plant, including the leaves, the flowering and fruit truss, as well as the runners, which give rise to the new plants, as well as the crown is promoting root growth. So it helps in pushing the roots below the soil level. So what basically a crown is, is a modified stem. And also to talk a little bit about the strawberry fruit itself, you know, we are all, we've all eaten the strawberry fruit, but the reason why it is called small fruit is because if you look at the small seeds that come into your mouth after you bite on the fruit, there are many of them. So it is composed of many different seeds on the plant, on the fruit. And then what we really consume, the fleshy part is actually the swollen receptacle, and not the swollen ovary. And that is really the difference between, you know, a fruit and a small fruit. So strawberry is considered an aggregate, accessory fruit or a small fruit. And then what we're going to do is we're going to do a little bit more about the fruit. And then what we're going to do is we're going to do a little bit more about the fruit. So it does require chill hours. So those are hours between 32 and 45 degree Fahrenheit that are required by the crop itself in order to promote crown development as well as in order to promote flower buds and fruit formation. Typically, a strawberry plant requires chill hours between 200 and 300. And again, these are temperature between the range of 32 degree Fahrenheit and 45 degree Fahrenheit that are required for optimal fruit production. A lot of the components that are involved with strawberry production are now mechanized, and it really starts before the plants get out into the fruit producing field. So the way we grow strawberries mostly now in Virginia is using the annual hill plastic culture production system, which involves constructing raised beds, putting a plastic mulch over it, and then fumigating the beds by injecting a fumigant through the bed. And this is all done using mechanized process. So you can see in this photo, in this photo, we have a tractor that is connected to a bedder, and the tractor is pulling the bedder and laying out the plastic and also laying out the tape. It typically requires about three to four people to make these beds along with the machine. And the cost of this machine is really close to over $100,000, including the tractor itself. And the bedder, so I would say more in the range of $125,000 to $150,000 range for that machinery, for a new machinery. But what a lot of growers do is they might contract out this process in case they are not able to afford buying the whole equipment itself, or they may be able to rent it out. A lot of growers also buy it, looking at it as a long-term investment into their farm production. And it's really important that the beds of strawberry are six to eight-inch high, as you can see in this photo, versus in this particular photo, we are using a smaller height bedder, which is about four inches. And what that can do is, with a smaller bedder, you have a greater chance of promoting temporary flooding, particularly in the coastal plain area where the land is relatively flat, such as in Virginia Beach, where I am stationed. You can see after a heavy rain event, there is water that is accumulating. And that is not really preferable, as that can promote root rot, as well as crown rot, as well as disease incidences, foliar disease incidences on the plant itself. Soil type strawberry really likes sandy to sandy clay loam soils with a pH of 6 to 6.2. Having a little bit of slope is good, because it can avoid water logging, as you saw in the previous photo. And also, now we recommend collecting soil tests before you plant or prepare your land for strawberry production. In the absence of soil tests, you want to put down an application rate of 60 pounds of nitrogen to an acre or 60 kilogram of nitrogen to a hectare, about the same amount for phosphorus and then about 120 kilogram of potassium. So actually, the one out of the 135 kilogram of potassium, you can put about 120, excuse me, you can put about 60 kilogram of potassium pre-plant. And then you could also think about maybe adding 60 kilogram through drip in the spring season. So here, we plant strawberries in late September, early October. And then the fruits come in the month of April, May and June, mostly starting April and May. And then the whole of May, we get a lot of strawberry fruits here. And then in June, depending on how hot the temperatures can get, we are harvesting all the way up into the second or third week of June. So you could split up the potassium. So you could split up the potassium as well for the whole growing season, where you can put about 60 kilogram of potassium pre-plant. But if you are unsure about what source of fertilizer you're going to get in the spring, it may be okay to apply the full potassium amount in the fall, which would be about 135 kilogram of potassium to an hectare. So you could split up the potassium. Previously, our growers used to use methyl bromide, but some of you may be aware that it is a fumigant that is no longer allowed for use as a pre-plant fumigant because it is known to be an ozone layer depleter. And it has been banned and phased out completely starting 2016. The alternative fumigant that growers are using nowadays is 1,3-D chloropropene and chloropicrin, which is picchlor-60. However, in California, which you will notice when you visit California, or some of you may have had the opportunity to do that, is that, you know, there are a lot of farms near urban areas and near residential homes. And because of that reason, there are restrictions on how much fumigant you can use, particularly also near heavily populated sites such as schools, daycare centers, and hospitals. So with increasing regulations, the Environmental Protection Agency is very, very, very cautious about how much fumigant they can allow on a per acre basis. There is considerable research being done now in California, and this is a photo from my postdoctoral days in California, where we looked at soil solarization, which instead of a black tarp or a black plastic mulch, we used a white, or not really a white, but a clear mulch to allow sunlight to get into the beds. And the idea was that instead of fumigant, the light would generate heat, and the water in the beds would allow the heat to get conducted during the daytime, and it would control some of the soil-borne pests through the natural process of soil solarization. We've also looked at some of the natural process of fumigant. We've also looked at some of the other non-chemical alternatives, like mustard seed meal as a biofumigant, looking at steaming, so running, you know, hot steam through the beds in order to disinfest the beds, as well as looking at anaerobic soil disinfestation. Drip irrigation is often used in order to water strawberries in the annual hill plastic culture production system. Drip irrigation is often used in order to water, so that the water is very much more of a water-based soil. Drip irrigation is often used in order to water for the water, and it's often used in order to water. And in the water in the water, we use a 12-inch emitter spacing for sandy loam and clay loam soils, and in very coarse sand, we use closer emitter spacing just because water will drain out very easily from sandy soils. Drip irrigation is often used in order to water, and the water is often used in order to water. Drip irrigation is often used in order to water, so that the water is often used in order to water. And so, you know, the temperatures are a little higher, so more water is needed as the temperatures get warmer and as the plant continues to grow. But on average, we need between 1 to 1.5 inch per acre per week for strawberry production. Drip irrigation is often used in order to water, and often times growers will use sprinkler irrigation or overhead irrigation at the time of establishment. And that allows the plants to develop a stronger root system, and the plants would not get stressed if they are not lacking in water. So that overhead sprinkler irrigation often comes handy in the fall when the temperatures are warmer soon after transplanting the plants in the field. Also, it comes handy for frost protection in order to increase the temperature at the plant canopy level. So strawberries can be started in a number of ways. One is plugs, which basically involves the process of harvesting the runners, and those runner tips are then rooted in a peat-based media. So it is the most expensive way, but also the most uniform way to get started. So all your plants are uniform. You can also start strawberry by using just a smaller plant of strawberries, which in this case we call fresh dogs, where the plants are harvested from the mother field, which is either in California or in Canada. And then they are transferred or shipped over to Virginia and some of the other southern states where they would be set in the fruit producing field. Strawberries can also be started using cut-offs, which is basically similar to fresh dogs. But the vegetative foliage or the leaves on the strawberry are mowed or removed prior to them being transplanted into the fruit producing field. Planting depth, you can see, is very important. If for strawberry, if you see the center photo here, that is the correct depth at planting the strawberry. If you plant too deep, you can see the crown, which is the core of the plant, is below the soil surface, and that is exposed to rotting. If you plant above, if you plant the crown is above the soil level, way above the soil level, you can see the roots are exposed, and that's not good during the winter time. When we have cold temperatures, also it is not good during the time of establishment, as the roots can dry out a lot quicker. So planting depth is very important when it comes to strawberry production. Plant types in strawberry are differentiated based on how they initiate flower buds, mostly dependent on temperature, but also on light. So they are classified as short day or June bearing types, which is what a lot of our varieties are in Virginia. But then also there are day neutral or ever bearing types. So in terms of the short day, these plants require shorter days, which is less than 14 hours daylight in the spring, to initiate or develop flower buds. And really the initiation happens in the fall, but then future bud development continues into spring. And also when the temperatures are below 60 degrees Fahrenheit. The day neutral will produce flower buds throughout the season. However, the initiation of the flower buds can be hindered when the temperatures are very high, which is above 29 degrees centigrade or 85 degree Fahrenheit. Some of the commonly grown varieties in Virginia are listed here. There are more now that are grown, you know, that we have started recommending based on the variety evaluation trials we have done in Virginia. But I won't really go through all of them for the sake of time. And also these might vary for your region when we talk about production in the Philippines. So I won't really bother to go about go over these in detail at this point in time. Many commercial growers also use transplanters and the transplanting period for annual plastic culture in Virginia is September through early October. Usually the locations in the mountains and the upper Piedmont level in Virginia, they start early in September to allow for enough growing degree days on the plant. Whereas those in the coastal plain are okay planting as late as early October. And that's that varies a little bit in Virginia and also for the majority of the Southeast region. The timing of when you plant would vary slightly. Transplanting can also be done by hand in case of a mechanic in case of a lack of mechanical transplant. Transplant and this mechanical transplanter is costing about 50,000 US dollars. And in the absence of that, you know, you can make holes using a planting stick or a bicycle wheel and then just use hand to plant. Winter protection is often done using floating row covers. These are much like blankets, and you can see in this case the grower has covered a lot of their site for winter protection. But then also, once the flowers arrive, then the plan becomes even more sensitive to temperatures. So we have to make sure that we can protect our plant from low temperatures, which in case of flowers, it is about 28 degree Fahrenheit. So if there's a temperature of 28 degree Fahrenheit or lower predicted for the night, then we recommend covering with floating row covers. Plant sanitation after the most severe winter is passed is often done by many growers. Some growers do not have enough labor to do it, but a lot of growers would do it. And some of the growers like typically we recommend planting grass in the furrow space, which is the area between the two beds. And some of the growers will start killing the grass with the herbicide towards the spring and summer. So that way the grass will sort of die off and then provide a brown mulch, which is really useful for the consumers to come pick the berries in a you pick setup. You can see on the left that the grower also has a farm stand here where they also use their own labor to pick the fruits and then sell at the farm stand. Some growers will choose not to kill the cover crop, and in that case, they have to keep up with mowing it, as you can see in the photo. And this is just a hand driven or a hand. Yeah, hand. You can call it more or less a hand held lawn mower that is used to keep the grass down in between the two beds. Strawberries are a self pollinated crop. They will produce fruit 30 to 35 days after the first bloom. The fruits are mostly conic in shape changing from green to greenish red. And then to fully red. And these are non climatic fruit, which means that they need to be picked ready, ready to be eaten when they are ready to be eaten from the plant. So as I was saying, this is how we collect our fruits here. You know, we in an agritourism setup. We have baskets that are either sold by the farmer or some repeating customers to the farm might carry their own baskets, and they usually collect the fruits in the basket. And we are the person here is wearing gloves because this is a photo taken from one of our research trials. But normally most consumers would not really wear gloves while picking the fruit. This is also a photo that I took from one of the growers in Northern Virginia, and you can see the grower has numbered their rows of strawberry. So when they get people coming to their farm, they are able to dedicate people to certain rows and that helps them make sure that the consumers are picking all the ready to eat fruits. And also it avoids over-trafficking in the furrow space, kind of distributes the traffic throughout the farm. And that is really helpful, I think, if the grower is able to do that. You can see some of the growers also have their own farm stands, as you can see with the photo on the right. Strawberry is also threatened by pests, insects, and weeds, just like any other crop. So I'm just listing the major pests that are found here in our region for strawberry anthracnose, fruit rot. You can see the salmon-colored appearance on the fruit in the photo above. That is a distinct symptom of the anthracnose fruit rot. We have the phytophthora crown rot. There's the botrytis fruit rot, which is the photo on the left-hand side on the fruit. You can see gray mold that is referring to botrytis. Ptm root rot. We have insects like the strawberry clipper weevil, spotted winged drosophila, the two spotted spider mites. We have strawberry crop that is threatened by deers in some locations, wolves as well as fox. So those would be the larger mammals. And of course weeds are also problematic for strawberry production, especially when the plants are young. And there's a lot more room for the weeds to compete with the plant in the planting hole. We do see some winter annuals emerging in the fall. And some of the ways that we recommend to keep weeds down is, you know, pay attention to weeds that are flowering or seeding and hand remove them if possible. So you can sanitize the equipment and discard any uprooted crop and weed material off site. We also have some chemical options that are available for controlling, you know, weeds, insects, as well as diseases. And we have IPM integrated pest management manuals that are developed for those purposes. So you can minimize fruit injury while harvesting by carefully picking the fruit. Make sure you are gentle when you snap the fruit off the plant. So you're typically the berries for fresh market get graded into market and non market fruits, the non market fruits and include fruits that are injured, diseased or defective. You don't want to keep the fruits exposed to sun. For a long time, because that can cut down on the post harvest life of the fruit. Ideally, you want to harvest the fruit and take it into an indoor environment. Allow it to sort of pre-cool and then eventually cool it down by taking it into cooler space. If you plan to hold the fruit for a long, long time, that would be considered 24 hours or more than 24 hours. So that's a photo again in California. There is a heavy reliance on immigrant workers who come and harvest the fruit. You can see they're very fast at picking. There are many of them and they really do a good job making sure that all the plants are clean picked from the fruit. A lot of the labor that we have in California comes from Mexico as well as other South American countries. This is one of the larger growers for strawberry that we have in Virginia. And you can see there's strawberries that are put in boxes and then kept in a cold room. And another photo of how strawberries are very popular at farmers markets here. You can see the photo on the left advertises strawberries, but strawberries are missing now. They've probably been all sold in the morning. This was taken about 10 a.m. in the morning. So I'm guessing most of the strawberries had disappeared by then. It's also a good crop for promoting local foods. You know, it makes an attractive image on posters and a lot of food organizations tend to use strawberry as a poster fruit. And in this case, you can see the grower has really decorated their truck for taking it to the farmer market in order to attract consumers. And, you know, it is a pretty attractive looking truck. And I'm sure a lot of people would get attracted towards it to come purchase some fruits and vegetables. And see, there's also some growers who make jams and sauces and jellies out of strawberry, and they are able to get a good value for it at the farmer's market. And that was the end of my talk. And that was the end of my talk. I really again thank you and you all for listening to it, and also would like to thank Brill for giving me the opportunity to make this presentation. So if you have any questions, you can you can either contact Brill, and then, you know, he will convey the questions to me so I can help you guys answer or clarify some of the things that I have talked during this presentation. Thank you and I look forward to seeing you again in the near future.
