 It comes with a half-inch main hose, quarter-inch distribution tubing, and multiple connectors and drip heads. So you can design the perfect layout for your specific garden. The best part? No special tools are required. Installation is simple, and you can adjust the drip tube placement to fit different plants' needs. One of the biggest advantages of this system is its smart water-saving technology. Instead of wasting water through runoff or evaporation, it delivers slow, consistent hydration right at the roots. This is especially useful for dry cleaning.
