 Natural farming focuses on sustainable method that uses natural materials instead of synthetic chemicals. The key components of this approach are indigenous microorganisms, fermented fruit juice, and oriental herbal nutrients. These natural inputs work together to improve soil health, plant growth, and overall farm productivity. Indigenous microorganisms are beneficial microbes collected from local environments. They help increase soil fertility and support microbial activity. Fermented fruit juice is a liquid made by fermenting ripe fruits with sugar. It provides essential nutrients like vitamins and minerals that promote healthy plant growth. Oriental herbal nutrients are made from medicinal plants and supply micronutrients that boost plant defenses against diseases. When used together, IMO, FFJ, and OHN create a balanced and healthy ecosystem for crops. IMO enhance soil life and nutrients availability. FFJ strengthens plants by providing key nutrients and helping them resist pests. OHN improve plants' immunity and support soil biodiversity. These natural inputs lead to better crops' yields, reduce the need for synthetic chemicals, and promote environmental-friendly farming. In this video, we show you how to harvest and use IMO, FFJ, and OHN on plants. To harvest IMO, let the mixture of cooked rice and soil ferment for about 7 days. After fermentations, use a stainer to separate the liquid from solids. Pour the liquid into a clean container using a funnel for storage. For the application, mix 2 tablespoons of harvested IMO with 1 liter of clean water. Spray this mixture on plant, leaves, or soil early in the morning or late afternoon when the microorganisms are most active. Apply every 7 to 10 days for the best results. To harvest FFJ, mix ripe fruits with molasses and let them ferment in an airtight container for about 10 minutes. After fermentations, use a stainer to separate the liquid from the water. After fermentations, use a stainer to separate the liquid from the water. The flavor of the plant is a few days. To harvest FFJ, mix ripe fruits with molasses and let them ferment in an airtight container for about 7 days. After fermentations, use a stainer to separate the solids. After fermentations, use a stainer to separate the liquid from the solids. Pour the liquid into a clean container using a funnel for storage. After fermentations, use a stainer to separate the solids. After fermentations, use a stainer to separate the liquid from the solids. Pour the liquid into a clean container using a clean container for storage. Pour the liquid into a clean container using a stainer to separate the solids. For the applications, mix 2 tablespoons of FFJ with 1 liter of water. Use a spray on leaves or pour it onto the soil. Apply early in the morning or late in the afternoon, similar to IMO, about once a week or as needed. To make OHN, chop medicinal plants like garlic and ginger and soak them in molasses for about 5 days. After that, add an equal amount of coconut vinegar and let it ferment for another 10 days. Once done, use a stainer to separate the solids. Once done, use a stainer to separate the liquid from the solids. And pour the liquid into a clean container using a funnel for storage. For the applications of OHN, mix 2 tablespoons of OHN with 1 liter of water. Spray it on plants or soil early in the morning or late in the afternoon. Apply every 10 to 12 days to boost plant health and protect them from the water. Pest. Pest. Pest. Pest. Pest. Pest. Pest. Pest. Pest. Pest. Pest. Pest. Pest. H réfléchis PEACE PEACE PEST. VOg By following this easy step, you can harvest and use IMO, FFJ, and OHN to help your plants grow healthier and stronger. These natural methods will improve your soil, boost plant growth, and reduce the need for chemicals. Thank you for watching and happy farming! How about industrial historia that can last year?
