 What's up you guys welcome back to my channel my name is Ashley for those who are new here welcome and for all of my returning subscribers welcome back. So today we are going to be talking about container gardening and specifically gardening on a budget. So I have been out and about looking at different ideas and different products that are out there on the market where you can start just a very very small garden for like say a patio or a deck for a really really cheap price. So if you guys want to see some of the things that I put together here definitely make sure that you stay tuned. All right so in front of us here we have some very very essential products that you would need to begin a small container garden. First things first if you are starting your things from seed which I highly recommend because is uh just overall it's cheaper let's just let's just keep it real over here it's the cheapest thing if you want to get a garden going um it's going to cost you about three dollars per transplant like either in a single pack or a three pack that's only three plants that you're getting for three dollars which doesn't feel like a lot but if you consider getting your seed or get your your plants growing yourself you can buy them from seed in this case I have two different options here so if you want to grab things in store these I actually picked up from um the dollar tree and their their packs of seeds are buy four for a dollar so these are literally 20 cent or 25 cent packs so these are unopened and there are a lot of seeds in here so that's a whole lot of turnips and radishes in this case but they have a good variety of things that you could easily grow in like a small container like we have in the back here and then also if you want to get a little fancy maybe you want to grow some varieties that aren't as common one company that I recommend highly is mi gardener. mi gardener sells 99 cent packs of seeds and again you get a decent amount for a dollar in this packet looks like it's 250 seeds of radish and then same for that and then 300 for the rutabaga so again you still get a lot of products and this you don't have to use all in one year I apologize if the wind is like messing up the audio but we outside so you know it is what it is but again you don't have to use these things all in one year because again if you're gardening from a small space or gardening in a small space obviously you're not going to have enough space to use up 300 seeds so you can use these year after year and like in some cases you won't get as good of germination rate as the years go by however it will still be worth it in the end even if you only use you know 50 of these you paid a buck for it so it's not that terrible so seeds are out of the way and of course you're going to need something to actually start your seeds in I picked these up again from the dollar tree these are a dollar for a pack and I want to say it comes with 12 in a pack I want to say this one has already been used so I don't have any more new ones but along with that you would definitely need some seed starting mix again dollar tree dollar tree is the place to be is what I'm basically saying like they have amazing products and if you go in there like right when they get them you're guaranteed to come out with everything that you need because I know some areas they don't always have everything that you need but the key is to try to get there earlier in the season before people are even thinking about it but yeah here is a good seed starting mix I didn't actually use this because I didn't get this until a little bit later but I assume that is probably let's look on the back here the ingredients are peat some vermiculite perlite and a wetting agent so it's just your standard seed starting mix and so this is definitely essential if you want to get a good root system going you're going to need that so there you have that so that's everything to get your seed started which is very important like I said as far as like economically you want to save as much money from the beginning because the main thing that's going to cost the most in most cases are the potting soils and like your fertilizers I don't have a fertilizer in front of me right now because I'm all out but in most cases a good fertilizer will probably cost you around you know eight to ten dollars and usually I get like a very general one to mix in with your potting soil which we can talk about next um I actually picked this up also from um Dollar Tree this is the GardenScape brand and that just seems to be the brand that they go with um the one thing that I will say about this potting soil because I did use this in some of the containers that I'll show you a little bit later um I did not like how heavy it was so I ended up blending it in with another potting soil that I had actually one that I used from last year in one of my pots so I would get something to loosen this up maybe even get the seed starting mix just to make it a little bit more airy and drainable would be really good actually let's bust this open so you can see what I mean so as you can see it's really dark it's rich but it's just it's not enough perlite in it so it's not as like airy as I would like it to be for a container because what's going to happen is all of this soil is going to get really compacted really quickly and you're not going to be able to get really good growth and like a good root system going with your plants and so they won't get as big they won't you know get as lush so that's the one thing that I will say about this and obviously you will need to add your fertilizer in it as well so you can get it on the cheap and like I said maybe blend in some of this just to you know aerate the soil a little bit and I think it'll be fine so as far as containers I actually picked this guy up from the Dollar Tree as well like I guess this is like a whole Dollar Tree video I mean I'm sorry you guys but I picked this up because I thought it was such a cute way to like display your plants and then you can get a lot more plants in one space so let me get you guys a view of what it looks like so there's three sections in here and you can stack these babies up and these are a buck a piece so technically you can put three plants in this one thing but I would even go as far as like certain plants you can probably put multiples in but I think that this is super cute and yeah like this is one option so let me show you guys other options as far as container gardening goes all right so here I have my city picker container garden I have had these now for I want to say close to four years this is actually how I started my gardening journey we're directly out of this as you can see you can put a decent amount of plants in it it's about I want to say three by two feet and for me I have two of them and I just have them sitting up on my deck nothing fancy at all but as you can see I have a good amount of plants in here I have a ton of lettuce lettuces some kale over there I have some more different types of lettuce some spinach as well as I put a makeshift little trellis up just so I can grow like some peas on and I can like you know come out and grab some peas grab some salad greens and make a really good salad so this is another option this is a little bit more expensive which is why I didn't want to really display it in this video because it's not as affordable as the containers that I showed you before these typically run at the time when I purchased them they were only about twenty dollars but recently when I checked them out in Home Depot I want to say they were going for up to like twenty five to twenty nine dollars and they actually have a larger version now they have a larger and a smaller version so even if you need something smaller than this this is like another really good option here is yet another option for a container garden and this is just an aluminum bin I don't know what this would typically be used for but it's like your typical like you know industrial type bin and I use these this one specifically for like my medicinal plants so in here right now I have a bunch of yarrow and eventually I'll have some chamomile and some echinacea coming up but this is another really cool option I like this one because it's really sturdy so I can keep all of like my perennial plants in here and all I have to do is like top it off with like some fertilizer or whatever to keep them nice and healthy and growing but I want to say I paid maybe about fifteen dollars for this so again a little bit more on the high end but this is really really sturdy and it'll last you year after year now that I've shown you the different types of containers that I have used in the past I wanted to just give you guys a quick little tutorial and a visual of how I plan to set up these two different type of stackables which are the ones that are specific from Dollar Tree I had the idea of creating these as a Mother's Day gift to my mom because she has like just a small like pavement patio in the back of her apartment and so I wanted her to be able to have her own herbs and I thought it would be really cute to also have like a salad greens uh container as well so I am going to go on ahead and pop these up and I will show you guys the completed results when I'm all done so I hope that you guys enjoy so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so all right all right so all right so here is the completed results of both planters one more thing that I forgot to mention were these little labels here which I actually also got from the Dollar Tree everything's done on the cheap cheap all right and in the case of this planter here obviously these things won't get humongous humongous so like the little cabbages that I put in here even the Swiss chard that thing is looking real pitiful ain't it but um these things won't get humongous which is fine but it's another thing that you can just kind of add to your salad greens just to have a little bit more of something something and if you wanted to you can almost even sew some extra like little salad greens in the middle there for the top portion but I think these turned out to be super cute so a really cool idea for your apartment dwellers that don't have a whole lot of space even if it's just a simple herb garden like all of these things I started from seed myself the oregano and I want to say the thyme take a little bit more time even the chives look at these chives they look real pitiful right now but chives is one of those things that will come back year after year as well as the oregano the thyme and the sage everything else here is perennial but yeah, it's just a really cute idea for like, you know, a mother's day gift or even a father's day gift you know, some fathers like to cook as well but yeah, here you are a nice cheap little container garden something real cute. It looks really nice I just have them stacked up here On my table on my deck Which I think they look so cute and the other two pots are actually those were also from the dollar tree I got those about three years ago And as you can see these babies are holding up nicely. I actually have some um, this is lemon balm in here that's starting to re-sprout I got some peppermint just for some tea And like I said, i've had those for three years now and they have held up nicely And I just keep those like with my perennial type herbs or whatever But they've been great. So all right So I hope that you guys enjoyed this video today to give you guys some really good Cheap ideas for a small container garden Like I said, all of these things most of what I showed you today was actually from the dollar tree With the exception of any fertilizers that I put in these two pots But again, I hope that you all enjoyed this get the growing because there's no better time than now. It's springtime It's like the perfect time even if you can't start the seeds yourself Just you know grab a few transplants. I prefer to get my transplants from like no local nurseries Just because they tend to be a little bit healthier And the big box stores like you don't know how long they've been sitting in those, you know planters Most local nurseries know when to start the seeds for your region So that is very important. So that's one tip that I will give but again get growing because you know Like I said, there's no better time than now. It's very therapeutic for myself It's how i've been keeping my hands busy during the quarantine and I have been having a really really fun time So I hope that you guys enjoyed this. I think I said that a thousand times already I thank you guys so much for stopping by. I wish you all nothing but health wealth and prosperity and until the next time Peace out
