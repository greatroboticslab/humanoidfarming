 Northern India's rural heartland, bypassed by the country's shiny economic boom. Sushil Pahl's family has tilled these plains in Behera Asa village for generations. It's hard toil, he says, that hardly pays. He didn't vote for Prime Minister Modi in the elections gone by, despite supporting him the previous two times. The Prime Minister's promise to double farm incomes, he says, has remained just that, a promise. My income has gone down as prices for inputs and labour have gone up, but not for the produce. All the money I make goes in paying fees for my sons. One is an engineer but hasn't had a job for two years. Down the road, this furniture factory has seen its exports drop 80% in the last five years. The proprietor says he'd have liked to sell locally, but continuing rural distress means there is no demand. The farm economy is down and the biggest problem in growing local demand is high debt among farmers and also unemployment. They have no money in their pocket and no capacity to buy anything. Such economic pain may have at least partially caused the electoral retreat of Prime Minister Modi's party from this once BJP stronghold. So this really is the India that's been left behind by its galloping GDP. And the biggest challenge now for Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be to address these sharp inequities and bring prosperity to these villages. Pushing manufacturing that can create local jobs and spur wider consumption will be key to bridging these gaps, say experts. If I'm able to make 200 rupee shirts in this country and not let that import demand leak to Bangladesh and Viet Tham, I will boost manufacturing. So manufacture things where people want, give them the jobs where they live, and you will see a revolution. These are people who make up India's large rural majority. A better deal for them is critical for a country aspiring to become the next global superpower. Nikhil Ananda, BBC News, in Muzaffar Nagar, Uttar Pradesh.
