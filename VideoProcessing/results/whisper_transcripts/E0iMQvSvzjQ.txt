 Coll Así Cuando So Thank you. Hello and welcome back to Vintage Farming. Right, we are in a lovely August day, although I am just seeing now that we do have rain in the forecast. So let's look at that before we crack on. Oh, it's not for a long time. Because our primary focus today is to harvest the oat, which is very exciting. We do also have to cultivate in the oilseed radish that will be ready as well. And then we'll be able to drill in our other crops into there. As I said, probably canola. As far as how I'm feeling, I do really appreciate the well wishes and all of that. And it was some kind of bacterial throat infection, which sounds awful. And it is, frankly. It is awful. It's absolutely horrible. Which is why I might be talking a bit quieter than usual. Because I'm not trying to stress that out. But I've got things to take for it. What do you call it? Antibiotics. And they're making me proper knackered, I'll be honest. But the farming needs to be done. So that's why we're here. So if I do seem a bit loopy as well. More so than usual. That's also part of it. Right. That is clean and ready to go. I have also... We should take the... The header trailer as well. I'm going to get that sorted. Not with the harvester. Because that's just asking for trouble. Driving it down the road with the... With it attached. But I do have the New Holland and the trailers ready to go. I'll bring both down. In fact, we could probably put the header trailer on the back of this. But... We'll see. It might be a bit more difficult than we'd like it to be. In fact, yeah. You know what? We'll just... Yeah. We'll take our time with it. Actually, wait. Can we get... I'll go on. Let's give it a try. Because I think this can go all the way through. If we can get it out with this, then we will. At least to get it washed. Washed and sorted. Right. I did also... Download this working speed mod. Hopefully that works. I don't think we'll need it much with this harvester. It's not that bad. I think it was like 8 kph or something like that. Which is really not that bad. However... From what it looks like on the mod page for it... It looks as though you can only do it in the shop. Which... Which... To be honest... Is absolutely ridiculous. If you can't do it on the fly... That is... Pretty rubbish. To be honest. So... You know what? I might actually just try and attach this to the... Oh my word. Oh it's all gone. It's all gone. It's all gone. Stupid... Stupid... Palos in the way. Big bag. Thing. Right. I think we can manage that. Just... Just going to leave this here for now. Because we do need to get this washed as well. Nearly too far away. Anyways yeah. So if I am talking a bit quiet... That's probably why. Or if I stop talking randomly. That's probably why. But uh... But yeah. We are going to get the oat harvested. Ideally also get the... Um... The oilseed radish... Is this even washing? Um... The oilseed radish... Cultivated. Because we have to cultivate it. But what I don't know that I want to do... Is... If I'm going to... Right. Is this not cleaning at all? Hello. Um... I don't know if I want to... Drill in oilseed radish. Or go straight with canola and then fertilize it. Okay. Is this not cleaning? That's annoying. There we are. Actually you know what? I think we can probably just lift this up by hand. We can. I just... That should attach. Should attach. Good. Why won't it clean though? Is my thing... Ah you know what? Bugger it. We'll get it clean later. Um... I'm a bit concerned that the... Let's have a look. Is there a working with thing? So you can't... Yeah. But not working with. Working speed. Let's just go to the shop anyways and see. Because if it's... Hello. Apologies. Absolutely my fault. Should not be operating heavy machinery at the moment. But here we are. Right. Let's see if we can get this brought over to the shop and get the working speed adjusted. Because if we can... Well happy days. That's what... That's the whole point of that mod. Because if we can't do it on the fly. That is... Kind of useless. Um... For a kit that we already have. Because then we have to go and... Basically get it outfitted with a new working speed. Which does seem a bit... Counterintuitive. So does having these trailers on... While we're doing this to be honest. But... It's alright. It's alright. We're taking it all in stride. So... It's nice to be able to actually get the harvest underway here shortly as well. Like I mean... Sure we did the peas. But... It'll be nice to do a proper arable harvest. That's our own. I feel like it's been a long time since I've done one of them. So I'm very keen to do that. Right. So I think what I'm going to do... Is... Nope. Detach that. And I'll just... I'll bring these up... Out of the way. A bit. And then... I think someone had even commented that... That the trailers didn't show up as individual trailers. Which they absolutely do. I don't know what you're on about. Um... But... Yeah. We've got two trailers and they show up as two trailers. So that's all good. This should be a wash, babe. Sorry. I feel like I'm just complaining about everything at the moment. There really should be like a little thing in there. Right. Anyways. Let's get this... Working speed change. Because I think it was very slow. Um... Right. It's eight. We're going to put it at ten. Because I... Yeah. Not going to... Uh... Bath with that. Should be right. What's going on here? There we go. All is well. Nothing is wrong. All is well. Right. Let's get this put back behind the Krona. As close as we can. Yeah. That's all right. We'll sort it out. Actually, like I say. This part is luckily very light. So we can just... Look at that. Easy. Easy peasy, innit? Oh, God. All right. Happy days. Look at that. So yeah. Just to confirm for the confused commenter. We've got the tractor. We've got trailer one, trailer two, and trailer three. So all is well in that regard. Nothing is missing. Except for the harvester now. So we'll just head down to the field. And then we'll go back to the farm, get the harvester. And we can get the harvest underway. All right. Here we are at the field with the harvester. Very excited to get this underway. But first things first, we do need the header attached. So we will do that first. Now that we're all rectified speed-wise at least. Okay. That's not right. Oh, is it a bit offset? It is. There we go. There we go. Brilliant. That's better. Let's get a look at that. Looks grand except for the dirty header. But that's fine as well. Right. Now something I want to ensure that we get done is... Does this thing chop? Because I would much rather to chop. So it says enable or disable. So we want to keep it disabled so that it chops out. Because we don't need straw. We absolutely do not. So let's fire it up. Lower it down. And just see what happens here. Brilliant. So when we get to the end... We won't stop now. But when we get to the end, we'll check to see that the... That it is actually giving us a level of fertilization. A layer of fertilization. Sorry. The words are difficult to come across. So I guess a bit of cheeky tonsillitis and you lose your mind as well. Anyways. I think... I think I'll just go straight on to ensure that we... Get it all clean. I was going to go to the left like... But... That's fine. And it doesn't have to be perfect either. Which it definitely is not. Because we missed a whole bit there. But... Stupid water pump in the way. Well, I don't know about that. Right. Well, whatever. At least we're getting something out of it. I guess having mulch... Mulching it. That's... That's an extra yield. So... Not quite free fertilizer. But... If it gives us a bit of an extra yield. Then that is absolutely okay with me. I'll scratch it on this way. Nice. Okay. Coming along. I think they'll actually shift from the other way to south. The pipe on the outside. Like it really doesn't matter. It's probably ready to plant up. Anyway, it's quite a good slime. We'll have lots of room to do so. But yeah. Now that we're actually harvesting. It doesn't feel like a massive field. I still think that I'm going to put oilseed radish in here. And do it properly. Which means I'll cultivate the oilseed radish in. So... The field at the farm. I will probably cultivate myself. But this one I'll probably get on a helper. Just because it does take quite some time. So as we're... When we're drilling the other field. Is when I will... Yeah. Get a helper down here to do that. Hopefully we've got cash for it. We should do. We just have a loan present. But we are going to be paying off that loan very soon. And bringing some extra cash in. Especially in the wood chips and the lettuce. Especially. And then hopefully now a bit from the arable. And the peas that we have. And some honey. And goat milk. And there's a few things that we'll be able to sell. Or some nice cash. But... I think what we'll focus on now. I think I'm going to go... Let's just finish this row out. There's one thing that I was thinking about with this field. It's like yeah. The way that you go about. I think I'm going to turn round. And instead of doing a headland. Or going up there and going back up and down. I'm going to go this way. Up and down the field. It just feels more appropriate to do that. And then eventually we'll have it all the same. For now let's crack on with the timelines. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. Alright. There we go. We got all of the oats harvested. And just this small one we missed here. I could have got away with the one trailer as well. Which is something I was thinking about. But nevertheless. There we go. I don't think that was a liter in it. I don't think so. Anyways. Let's get that put into the trailer. And then we can take that trailer load. Straight down to... The grain mill. Actually yeah. Actually yeah. We might as well. We might as well just bring it straight down. But what we will do first is... What? Hang on. What? Five. There must have been a bit extra. Am I absolutely losing my mind? We had 2200 litres. Or was it a 6000 litre? Bloody hell. Oh my goodness. Silly monkey. Nope. Definitely needed two trailers. That's absolutely fine. For some reason I was thinking that... Both the harvester and the trailer were 5000. But it's just the trailer that's 5000. And the harvester is 6. Goodness gracious. Well at least that is done. So let's get this put back on here. I think that's how it's meant to go. Just like that. Yes. No. Yes. Good show. Okay. I think we can probably get away with attaching this to the header trailer. So I'm going to do that. Because I want to... As I say I want to take this straight down to the grain mill. And then we can get a good total on everything that we have down there. This field can now be direct drilled. So I think what we're going to do is... And it doesn't take all that long. But I do think that... Hello. There we go. This will leave here for now. This will take down to the grain mill. Because yeah I think... I was thinking of being able to get all this done in one episode. But that's just not the case. Not just because of how I'm feeling at the moment. But also because just there's more to do than I initially anticipated. We do however have... Okay. So let's just... As we drive. We'll lay down all the things we need to do. For this field. We have to... Direct drill oilseed radish. We can... Oh you know what? I should check to see if it needs any liming. No it does not. But it is mulched. Which is good I guess. But it doesn't need lime. So that's really good. We'll come in with the... Drill. We'll get the oilseed radish put in. A part of me is very tempted to... Fertilize it... First. Or maybe it would be best to wait. Yeah. We'll... We'll... We'll directory... Direct... Direct seed... Oilseed radish in first. That's step one. Then after it's grown we'll cultivate it. Fertilize. Actually no. We'll cultivate it. And then when we fertilize we'll put fertilizer in the drill. Because we can do both at once. Silly monkey. Absolute silliness. So that's what we're going to do. And we can probably do that with this other field. Because I think we'll need to as well. Will we not? We will. So that is something I need to set up now. But I do have to cultivate it before any of that. So... First things first I think we need to do is... Go down to the grain mill. Get this dumped off. And then we'll see you back at the farm. Right. So we are getting the oat dumped into the grain silo. I kept saying grain mill I think. I think. Maybe that's... A bit of foreshadowing for the future. I don't know. But anyways. Sorry I didn't even check. We've got a total of... 8,241 litres of oats. 5,037 litres of peas. And 58,778 litres of wood chips. Which is a nice total of things to have. Which we will get sold when we need to sell them. Which is really good as well. One thing I want to do before we end the episode. Before I forget. Because the first thing we'll do in the next one. Is... Is... Well we could... We've got two options. I think we could probably cultivate first. At the farm. But before that. I do want to add the fertiliser into the drill. First thing. Because I don't want to forget to do that. Because that's important to do. So let's put these trailers... Well let's put them up here. Because that's the next place they'll be needed. Is for chipping. So we'll just get them... Yeah. Let's put them down here. And this... Oh. Hello. Nope. Stay with you mate. There we go. I'm going to be a bit cheeky. And just cut through... This way. Which is what I would have liked to have done... When the time comes for us to... To have... You know maybe owned this grass field here. But we'll just take a very... Cautious berth round. There we go. And... We will get attached to the drill. Which could probably also do with a wash. To be honest. Right. So we've got... We've got a fair amount of seed in. We're going to need... Right. We still... Okay. Mustn't forget. We have to cultivate... This field first. Before we can direct drill. So this needs to be cultivated. So we're going to take the drill. Fill it up. Wash it. In preparation of going to the other field. To direct drill oilseed radish. Which we'll do first anyways. I think that's what we'll start with. To be honest. In the next one. So... Let's just get this... Ready to go. Absolutely brilliant. I think that's probably enough. Because I feel like when you direct drill... It uses a lot less fertilizer. I could be absolutely way wrong. But nevertheless, I do want to wash it. I don't know why the header wasn't washing. The header trailer seemed to get washed. But not the header itself. It might have just been a bit too far away. Who knows? Get this done though. Really good. Happy days. Excellent. Excellent. Right. So that is what we will start the next episode with. We're going to... So in this one, we finished the oat harvest. Which is amazing. That was really the primary focus of the episode anyways. Was to get that harvest done. Now we can get into that field. Put in oilseed radish. Put the canola into the field nearest to us here. After we cultivate. So we've got a few things to do. And I'm glad that I've got them slightly offset. Because that way we can... Well, we'll have more to do until the end of this map. Which again, there has been some suggestions dropped for which map to move to. I'm going to be checking them out soon. But if you do have any other suggestions, I'm all ears for where you'd like to see vintage go to next. Until that time. I do really enjoy this map though. Because, yeah, it's just a stunning map. Pallanyi is amazing. Highly recommend to anyone who likes good maps. And very detailed maps. Tons of details everywhere. It's very lovely. Right. Well, if you've enjoyed this episode. Which has been a bit funny. The last few ones have been a bit funny. But that's just me under the weather. So bear with me. I appreciate your support. But, yeah.
