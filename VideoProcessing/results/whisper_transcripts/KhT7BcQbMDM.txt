 I have colleagues that were like, Mary Jo, we want to work with farmers. We got this wealthy rancher. Oh my God, he's making so much money. Really? What's he do? Oh, he's got a construction business on the side. So the cows are a write-off. I'm like, do you guys even know the difference between a cow and a bull? They have no clue. Like none. And he said to me, well, what's their profit margin? What are these farmers' profit margins? I said, they don't have a profit margin. What are you talking about? He goes, you know, a profit margin, Mary Jo. Like if I have a store, there's a profit margin. I said, there is not a profit margin. I said, they could make 100% profit one year and they could lose 100% profit one year. He's like, why do you work with them? Because I love them. But you have to understand how their money comes in and how their money goes out. Like it's not just, oh, well, what's your profit margin? Let me write you a policy. It's not that simple.
