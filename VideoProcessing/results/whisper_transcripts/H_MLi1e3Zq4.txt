Howto & Style
 When you hear that sometimes you don't have to shut your fence off to fix that problem. You can just count that pulse. So I hear it. I know it's popping. I don't want to touch it when it's popping. So if I can get in that rhythm, I can fix that without having to go all the way back up there and turn my fence off. I just listened for that pulse and caught it in between shocks.
