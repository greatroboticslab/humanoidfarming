Howto & Style
 what's going on growers it's james frigione coming to you live from jersey you are being lied to about growing in containers today me and tucker are going to share with you five major advantages to growing in containers rather than in the ground let's go for my first few years of gardening i only planted in the ground i was under the impression that it was way better planting in the ground than in pots then i decided i wanted to try to get more out of my space i thought a good way to do that would be to plant some stuff in pots in containers underneath my fruit trees i thought this would be a good idea because planting in pots would make it so that i wouldn't be disturbing the trees roots when i'm planting stuff and also the plants and pots wouldn't have to compete with the tree to get water and nutrients and stuff now what i do is i plant things like this my tomatoes underneath my peach trees because my peach tree is pruned to an open center this acts really nice and allows me to sort of use the peach tree as a trellis you can see the tomato is growing up the peach tree because it's a vine i allow it to vine up the tree in the same way this would happen in a natural forest where a vining plant would climb up a tree so you can see i'm getting an advantage of growing in pots under this tree another thing i like to do now also is i like to plant my eggplants under some of my trees like my cherry tree you'll see i have a bunch of eggplants in containers growing underneath my cherry tree and i also plant things like peppers in containers underneath my hazelnut tree whether you just want to get more out of the space you are already growing in or if you only have limited space like on a patio or balcony growing in containers gives you the opportunity to grow almost anywhere now that i've been growing in containers for years i just have absolutely fallen in love with it and i've noticed some huge advantages to growing in pots the first major advantage to growing in containers is that you don't even have to deal with soil problems issues like soil borne diseases such as fusarium wilt and verticillium wilt which can devastate your plants especially tomatoes that are susceptible to this kind of disease also you don't have to worry about pest issues in the soil things like the garden simp island which i had some problems with in the spring if you grow in containers you really don't have to deal with that another thing is when you're growing in containers you don't have to deal with terrible soil whether it's like super rocky or all clay i mean that doesn't really matter because you're growing in pots and if you want to try to heal that soil by doing like a sheet mulch and letting the worms do the work that takes a little bit of time so while the worms are working you can grow in containers and still be getting harvests the second major advantage to growing in containers is that they're portable you can move them around as needed so let's say you want your plants to get more sun you can move the pots in locations to be able to track the sun better or if you're like me right now and you're in heat wave you could take some of your plants and put them in an area that gets filtered sun like these peppers here look how well they're growing the strong beating down sun isn't stressing them out too much they're not wilting or anything they look really healthy they're loaded with peppers and that's what i really like to see that's why i like growing them in some of the filtered sun of the hazelnut trees i think it helps a lot another thing is if one of your plants get some disease issues whether that be pest or any kind of issue you can kind of remove that from the other plants and deal with it on its own this way that issue doesn't spread to some of your other plants you can kind of single it out and work on it this guy's walking around having a lot of fun he's hanging out here it's pretty hot out but he's always out here this guy never quits never gives up he's the king of the garden he's also the protector so he needs to make sure that he's watching out for his whole garden another great thing about moving your plants is say you want to overwinter your peppers or something when they're in a pot you could take them inside and let them overwinter and then bring them back outside and grow the same pepper in the spring you can do the same thing with herbs too you can bring those herbs inside and still snack on the herbs later in the season the final great thing about growing containers for the fact that they're movable is if you're someone who can't bend over that great you can take your containers put them up on an area where it's much higher so you don't have to bend over to work in them so there's so many advantages just from the containers and plants being portable let's grab a pepper and see if tuk wants one let's grab an apple sweet pepper this one is a really good one talk what do you think boy what do you think tuk want this boy see if he wants one of these i'm sure he'll like this these ones have a nice crunch to him too i'll have to taste this one after he does break him off a little piece and then i'll have some there you go boy and then i'll taste this one too mm so sweet so good nice crunch to it this guy loves snacking on his fresh peppers in the garden he's always hunting for a snack and he earns them so we got to make sure we keep him well fed so he can keep working in if you guys love seeing tuck in the videos make sure to spam some hearts down low also check out the merch down at jamesprishione.com grab a gardening is life shirt and be part of the team so dang good to eat fresh right from the garden even if it is from a pot anyone can be growing this food right in their backyard on their patio or anywhere the third major advantage to growing in containers rather than in the ground or even in a raised bed is that you're going to use less soil and you have more control over the quality of the soil also the plants don't have to compete for space in the soil or even nutrition or even water because they have their own personal space each container is like the plants own their own personal raised bed which is cool because of that you can tailor the kind of soil you are making to the kind of plant you're growing for instance if you're growing cucumbers you can make a more alkaline soil soil if you're growing tomatoes you can make a more acidic soil so it's almost like you make a personal little home for each kind of plant that you're growing when i make my soil i typically use as a base coco coir it's completely inert so it doesn't have it doesn't have a high or low ph and when i grow things like tomatoes or things that like acidic soil sometimes i'll use peat moss mostly i like using coco coir the best though because it's in my opinion the best for pots but it could be a little more expensive sometimes so in a different video if you want i could go into detail how i make my own personal soil for my containers but today we're just going to try to stick with the advantages i've got some potatoes here you'll notice i'm going to harvest these potatoes and then see what we got in this bed right here this is the strawberry paw potato so you can grow so many different kinds of plants in containers like i love i showed you tomatoes eggplants peppers now let's see how the actual potatoes do i think i should just maybe dump the whole bucket let me just first pull some out pull this out actually no no let's dump the whole bucket and see what we get so i allow the soil to dry out relatively well before i'm harvesting these so the potatoes aren't super dirty let's flip this over you gotta just gotta move this out of the way you can see i used cocoa core for this you can see a lot of my basic mixture and then let's just see we should see some nice potatoes in here you can see this nice color to the potatoes some nice size ones not my biggest harvest ever but not too shabby too i planted these a little late in the season but still doing pretty dang still did pretty dang good keep stacking them up that looks like it's most of them and if i want i could just recompost all this soil here and use it again in the future as long as i use a hot compost and i remove any of the pathogens pathogens and stuff because we don't want to be spreading diseases from one year to the next not too bad though some nice looking potatoes in here the fourth major advantage to growing in containers is probably one of my favorites and it might be for you too when you grow in containers there is little to no weeding and as we know weeding is one of the worst parts about gardening so right here this is about going to be the extent of the weeding you're going to need to do looks like i have a little wood sorrel i think this is popped up in here all i'm gonna do is just pop that out i didn't put mulch around this plant which i should have you can see a lot of my other plants like here i've got mulch around it which will definitely help when growing in containers but this right here i'm growing a moringa tree right in a container i think it looks cool i'll eat it as an edible because you can eat the leaves so i grow it as an edible i meant and you can eat the leaves which is really cool so that's another added advantage to growing in containers you can do like experimental things because uh it's no it's not a big deal if they do bad and you could also grow invasive species like mints and stuff in containers because you don't have to worry about them spreading throughout the whole entire garden so it's so fantastic not have to weed much it makes gardening so much easier so it's just another great advantage to growing in containers the fifth major advantage to growing in containers is that you're going to be using less water and less fertilizer because the area that you're growing in is super concentrated so think about it we only have to put enough water into this one pot here instead of having a bunch of plants in a large raised bed and watering that whole raised bed in you could just water this one plant just by watering the bucket just make sure when you water that there's something underneath to catch the water and you don't want to be over watering or you're going to be washing out a lot of your fertilizer fertilizing is nice too you're going to use less of it because just like the watering is concentrated so also will the fertilizer be concentrated in one location so you end up going through less of it which is a great advantage so another thing that i like about growing things like peppers and eggplants and stuff in containers an added bonus is that like we're going we're getting late into the season so i need to take out a lot of my crops from my raised beds and then put in my fall stuff but the only thing that's bad about that is this is now when the peppers start to really producing heavy so right when the peppers are really producing heavily really well in my raised beds it's almost time to take them out so when we grow them in pots like this when they're getting into their uh into a real high level of production we're fine growing with the pots we could remove the summer stuff from our raised bed and get our fall stuff in we don't have like some peppers and stuff lingering in the bed that kind of makes it so we can't completely shift over to the fall stuff in the raised beds because i like growing things in like polycultures so that's just another added bonus you'll notice right here this is a habanada pepper it looks like a like a hot pepper because it's in the habanero family but it's actually a sweet habanero so it's pretty cool the habanada let me take a bite of it real quick still has that classic habanero like kind of flavor and it feels like it's going to get super hot but then the heat never comes it's unique it's delicious and it's a really cool another thing you can try experiments with in your container garden because it doesn't work that's fine you're not taking up too much space because uh you're just growing in pots right boy when growing in containers it's not all advantages there's some disadvantages as well one of them is that the plants dry out a lot quicker than they would in the ground so when you get a plant that gets large like this in the container it could dry out relatively quickly so you need to stay on top of watering it or within a few days it can cause a lot of damage another thing is growing it in containers initially to get started can be relatively expensive especially if you need to buy pots and things so a good idea is to try to get some recycled pots you could even grow in like a tote that you find like in the garbage or in the house that you aren't using that's what i did earlier in the season and the plants grew great in totes i like to use these five gallon buckets that i got from a big box store they're food safe and they seem to be lasting a number of years because they're relatively thick so i like growing in these it's pretty nice another disadvantage is uh fluctuations in temperature can be a little more stressful on the plants because they don't have like the buffer of the ground to absorb some of that stress but you just got to kind of baby them a little bit more that's why you could the fact that they're portable is nice so you can bring them into like locations that get a little bit of shade and another disadvantage to growing in containers is there seem to be like a little bit harder to cover like you can't like cover them with an insect netting because they get relatively large like all my raised beds that i grow in i have covers on them so i can use an insect netting to cover them to keep the pests out and stuff so when it comes to containers it's kind of harder to separate them from pests because it's i guess a little tougher to make a covering unless maybe in the future i should just build a whole area that that is enclosed with like some kind of insect netting covering to put all my pots in so that's most of the disadvantages that i can kind of think of off the top of my head so i can't say that like growing in containers is going to solve all your problems but in my opinion there's so many advantages to doing it so even if you have a food forest like me you can get so much more out of the space by growing containers so there's so many great things about it and i have to say in the past i was like i was kind of a hater when it came to growing containers i figured i had enough space to just plant in the ground but my whole mind shifted about that you know i feel like i feel like i was almost being lied to that like growing containers is worse than the ground i don't think it is they both have their advantages and growing in containers definitely has a lot of advantages right boy that's today's video growers thanks for watching we hope you enjoyed it we hope you got something out of it so the idea with this video was for me and tuck to shed some light on some of the advantages to growing containers and hopefully encourage you guys to get some stuff in the ground saying you don't have the space because you're on a patio or something in my opinion that's not a good enough excuse everyone should be growing some of their own food even if it's some fresh herbs even if you don't have space for a patio you could still be growing some stuff inside on a windowsill planting some of your own food and getting to taste it no matter how small it is it's just such a great feeling so we want to share that with as many people as possible me and tuck wanted to mention to uh check out
