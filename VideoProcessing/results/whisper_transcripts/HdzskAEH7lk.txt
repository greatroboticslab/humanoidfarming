 Let's see what we can harvest from the garden today. Lots of red jalapenos under here. Grab some of these giant marconi sweet peppers. Look how massive this one is. Murasaki sweet peppers. Just picked all of these tiny little sweet cherry peppers. Definitely pepper season. Gosh, look how cute it is. There are so many ground cherries. A couple of tomatillos fell. Lots of little purple tomatillos. He must be happy to see me. Look at this thing. It's huge. It's like the size of my head. I grew these. I grew all of these. I just had to lay everything out and take pictures to document this harvest. Thanks, garden.
