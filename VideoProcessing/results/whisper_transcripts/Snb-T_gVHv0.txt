 We partnered with Nationwide to help bring awareness to grain bin safety because... it's Grain Bin Safety Week. So let me share with you some grain management techniques can help keep you safe and everybody else safe. I could recommend Morgan yourself a grain vac. Grain vacs have been a big part of our farm for the last several years. This here has transformed the safety. The dust is down, there's no moving parts inside the grain bin, it's just suction. You're just pulling through a tube, it's like a big vacuum cleaner and all you have is just your PTO you have to worry about connecting your tractor which you shouldn't be around anyways. Another method to prevent getting into a situation you shouldn't be, invest in some type of bin management system. Things that can be done are improving the quality of your grain by running your combine as clean as you possibly can, prevent massive chaff buildup or unwanted seeds or material that might cause buildup and bridging inside the grain bin. Or another way is running in a dryer. A lot of grain on some types of crops comes in fairly wet and that can bridge and cause spoilage and that's where a lot of entrapments take place. So go to GrainBinSafetyWeek.com and help get aware. That's what I'm trying to do is bring awareness to the situation.
