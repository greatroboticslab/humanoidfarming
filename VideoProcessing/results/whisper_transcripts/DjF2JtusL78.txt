 Hello and welcome to today's Modern Organic Living. My name is Nuance and I am here with my loving but shy husband Nudge. We are here to talk with you about green sustainable organic living. Ah, this is so good! I can barely stand it! Oh my! Oh my! Okay, I am better now. Do you want to reduce your karmic footprint? Truly green, organic, sustainable, solar and wind powered, but yet compassionate life. You want to be green, but not mean, yes? So green, not mean. Please don't eat bunnies like me and Nudge. It gets him very upset. When you see rabbit on a restaurant menu, it is pet bunny, just like us. Believe me, we would rather be snuggled and kissed and not food on your dish. So have a very green and compassionate day. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You can be green.
