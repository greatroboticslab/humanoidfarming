 I've been gardening for over 15 years now and I have tried just about every type of raised bed garden out there and I have officially found my forever beds. Ones that I'm not going to have to replace all the time. I'm going to be showing you today why these are the ultimate raised bed gardens and what this upgrade took. I've been wanting to get some added functionality and higher quality out of my raised bed garden and I've been looking for quite some time and finally found Hopkins Hidden Homestead. They are a company right here in the U.S. family run just like mine and I decided to give them a try and I am thrilled to say the least. We spent five work days with a whole group of people switching out the old raised bed gardens to the new ones and I think it turned out amazing. So with the old raised bed gardens. A little, not a lot. I didn't love the fact that they had unfinished edges. They're kind of sharp. You definitely can't kneel on them or press on them and I now have a one-year-old who's running around the garden with me. They're pretty hot to the touch and I don't love that this is as sharp as it is. The biggest thing that I'm going to see improvement on though is the soil depth. Now these beds do fall within the 8 to 12 inch bare minimum that I suggest for raised bed gardens. These are 11 inches deep but my new beds are going to be 17 inches deep. You can see here 6 inches doesn't sound like a lot but it makes a huge difference to the plants. So by adding in and having these 17 inch deep beds not only will my plants be able to stay much cooler which obviously is key here in Florida they're also going to have access to more nutrients and water. So the more soil they have access to the more they are able or the better they are able to feed themselves as long as they have quality soil. So not only are these deeper but they are also a little wider. So that additional space is going to help the roots and the plants stay nice and cool in these hot summer months. These were an affordable entry point. They did their job and they held up well. They're still in good condition after a couple of years. But if you think you're going to go for the garden upgrade within a couple of years or if you have children I would highly recommend just going for the good stuff from the get-go or if it's not within your budget doing mounded rows for your raised bed gardens until you are able to get the beds that will get the job done. The original beds always seemed strong doing doing what they needed to do but when we got the new beds delivered my husband came running in the house and was like I didn't know you were getting hurricane shutters. These things are sturdy quite sturdy. They're much heavier and much thicker material. He says we're going to use them as hurricane shutters should we ever need it. I'm not taking my garden apart for that. Hopkins Hidden Homestead has really high quality beds. I can literally support my weight sitting on the side of one of their panels. There is zero chance that would have happened with my old raised beds. The quality and durability of these beds is abundantly clear and they're a small local family operated business just like mine. They're based out of Missouri and the entire manufacturing process start to finish is right here in the U.S. The longevity and the durability from these beds is going to see you through years of gardening and I know that you guys will enjoy these beds. I have a link down in the description below with a code urban harvest that gets you five percent off your entire order. We are going to be putting on the last panel of the beds and then we get to finish the top edges with their wood kit which I'm super excited about for the looks and aesthetics and I think it's really going to complete our garden layout. So they do have an optional wood kit that you can add on to the raised beds which we did decide to go with. I really wanted a finished edge so that I didn't have to worry about my little one running up and grabbing the sharp edge. It also doubles as an awesome seat so it's sturdy enough that we can sit on it to maintain the garden. Plus it looks awesome. You do have to purchase the wood separately. The kit is just the mounting brackets and the finishing edges so we went with cedar. A lot of people might wonder if you can use pine. Pine rots really really quickly and pressure treated wood leaches toxic chemicals into your soil. Cedar however is both rot and pest resistant and it is well worth the cost difference. I highly recommend for any sort of outdoor work in and around your garden bed whether you're doing wood garden beds or whether you're topping them to definitely go with cedar for an organic garden. Obviously upgrading the garden comes at a cost but these beds are well worth it. I just wished I had skipped all of the in-between stuff and gone straight for the good stuff. I highly recommend you do the same if you can or keep these beds in mind for when you are ready to upgrade your garden.
