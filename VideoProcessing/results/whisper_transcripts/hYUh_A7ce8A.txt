 Look at these empty cold drink bottles that we Americans throw in the garbage. The Chinese, on the other hand, use them to cultivate vegetables and earn money. They cut the plastic bottles, put soil in them, and plant saplings. Then they hang the bottles on the walls of their houses, which looks beautiful. And when the vegetables are ready, they pluck them and earn money by selling them in the market.
