Howto & Style
 What if I told you there was an easy way to completely automate feeding your garden and plants? Even better, without having to hand mix any fertilizers. God or the day of wearing safety goggles and gloves just to mix some fertilizer. The EasyFlow Hose Bib unit comes with everything needed except the fertilizer itself. No other outside purchases are necessary when using it on a hose bib. Not only that, but the technology it incorporates ensures it's easy to use. It's almost harder to get one not to work. Let's go get started installing our EasyFlow. You'll see it's just a couple quick and easy steps that anyone can do. It's as easy as threading a garden hose nozzle onto a garden hose. Today, we're going to install it on a drip irrigation system that's used to irrigate potted plants. Believe it or not, I have everything I need here in my hands. I have the tank and injector unit itself with its cap. The hose bib units are available in three sizes, 3 quarter gallon, 1 gallon, and a 2.5 gallon. The size comes down to how often you will need to fill the tank. If your flow rate is real high like if you were going to install it on a very large raised bed drip irrigation system, a small tank could empty out before you can complete one watering cycle. You'll want to check the specifications to see how many gallons to empty each tank has. Prepare to the flow rate of your irrigation system so you can choose the correct size tank. In addition to the tanks, everything else needed is right here. First, our hose bib adapter. We'll just put this on after our pressure regulator. Then, the black tubing is our inlet side tubing. The clear tubing is our outlet side tubing. Though they're both the exact same size, you can use them interchangeably, there's a reason you want to use the clear on the outlet side. That's because you can see the fertilizer being injected into irrigation lines. EasyFlow recommends either using colored fertilizer or a non-toxic plant safe dye so that you can see when the fertilizer runs out. When the tank is empty of fertilizer, you'll see clear water begin running through the line. We'll connect this to the EasyFlow and to the two barbs on our hose by tubing adapter and, finally, the optional coupling valve. This can be used if you want to turn the system off while the irrigation system is going. You don't have to fertilize the entire time. This allows you to turn on or off suction. Alright, we've got everything we need. Let's install the system. Depending on the flow rate of your irrigation system, there might be one more quick step to take, and that's inserting the flow disk. To determine the flow rate of your irrigation system, add up all the emitters that will be operating at once or on one zone. A system using 200 half gallon per hour drippers will have a flow rate of 100 gallons per hour. If your irrigation system drips between 7.5 and 30 gallons per hour, you want to use the red flow disk. If it drips between 30 and 60 gallons per hour, you'll use the black flow disk. If it drips between 60 and 120 gallons per hour, you'll use the white flow disk. If it's over 120 gallons per hour, you won't need a flow disk at all. To use the flow disk, all you have to do is remove the gasket from the female side of the EasyFlow hose bib adapter. Set it aside so you don't lose it. Then, grab the flow disk that you're going to use based on the flow rate of your irrigation system and you're going to want to push it deep into the hose bib adapter where you'll see a very narrow passage. Push the flow disk all the way in until it's secure. Replace the gasket and your hose bib adapter is ready to go back on your head assembly. First, we're going to remove this 1 quarter inch hose by tubing adapter. This is our main line for our potted plant irrigation system. Now, we're going to thread on the EasyFlow hose bib adapter. Finger tighten with maybe another quarter to half turn after. Now, we'll put our hose by tubing adapter back on the EasyFlow adapter. Now, we'll connect our black tubing to the inlet side of the hose bib adapter. You can see this one is marked blue and it has the corresponding blue on the injector itself. Now, just push the tubing on over the barb. Then, connect the black line to the blue inlet side on the EasyFlow tank. You've got your inlet taken care of. The blue and green connector on the EasyFlow tank are push fitting, so we have to push it in gently but firmly until it's secured in place. Now, we're going to do the same thing with our clear line. And remember, it's clear because we'll be able to see our fertilizer traveling through it. When the water in the clear tubing goes clear, you know that your tank is empty and needs more fertilizer. Now, let's insert our clear tubing into the green connector. If you'd like to be able to turn off your EasyFlow without disconnecting it, simply cut into the tubing and insert the barb shutoff valves. Now, we're going to take the cap off the tank and fill it with fertilizer. The fertilizer we're using is called Algo Plus. It's a mineral-based fertilizer and this here is their all-purpose formula. Good for a little bit of everything. Now that we've got the fertilizer in there, we're going to top it off with water. The tank needs to be 100% full of liquid. You want all air to be out of the injector. Now, let's put the cap back on and we're ready to fertilize. To put the cap back on, we're going to remove our tubing. That's actually pretty easy to do. To remove the tubing, all you have to do is pull back on the collet. And the collets are just the green and blue connectors right here. All you have to do is apply a pressure to the collet, that's the cutthread part, while you gently pull on the tubing. Now, you can easily thread on the top without spilling fertilizer or fighting your tubing. After that, go ahead and put your tubing back into the green and blue connectors. The last thing we want to do before we turn it on is check how much fertilizer you're going to be putting in. There's a dial on top of the cap that you can use to adjust the ratios that go in. The flow setting, which is what we're going to use and what the manufacturer generally recommends, is about a thousand to one ratio. It goes all the way up to a fast setting that's about a 100 to one ratio. But keep in mind, if you're using a flow disk, this changes the ratios. And it's that easy. All that's left for us to do is turn on the irrigation system and our plants will get the vital nutrients they need to thrive and survive. Because we're using this with a drip irrigation system that has a timer, this also means that it's all automated. The timer handles all the watering cycles, comes on, delivers water to the plants. Well, now it will also automatically be delivering fertilizer to the plants. And that's how you set up an easy flow. It's easy, it's quick, and it's effective and efficient in delivering nutrients to your plants. If this video helped, give us a like. If you have any questions, comment below.
