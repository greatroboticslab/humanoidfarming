 Music We're here for Modern Gardener at Peterson Family Farms and I have some questions about a CSA. Can you kind of give us an introduction to what a CSA is? CSA, you know, it stands for Community Supported Agriculture and it's all about finding a way to be closer to the farm. The CSA program grew out of an interest by farmers to be able to get more involvement from the community, to kind of create a community. If you want to be a part of a program, then you should think about what your motivation is and then find what fits best for you. I think just get involved, you know, and maybe try different ones out. What if some of the crops don't really turn out the way that you would hope? Sometimes we have a crop that doesn't thrive like we want it to and we just make adjustments within our program for that. It's really hard to make guarantees on a small scale farm. In fact, in agriculture it's pretty much impossible to make a guarantee, but we may have to kind of move things around a little bit to accommodate what's coming on in the field. And that's kind of the fun part about it, you know. Well, and if you wanted to be pushed to try new vegetables, then maybe a CSA would be a really great way to go because you don't get to pick necessarily. You get what's in season. Right, right. And the great thing about it is that the support comes with it. So it's not just dumping something on you that you don't know how to use so that you can actually learn to eat more fresh, more local. Sometimes the simple parts of life actually include some give and take. And that's, you know, that's a lot of times where the real magic happens. We're here in your market, which is about, you know, 50 feet away from your fields where the crops come from. So can you tell me what a typical CSA share is like throughout the year? So we don't even call it CSA anymore. We call it simple share. We like people to have the opportunity to be a part of the farm through every season. In the spring, there's a lot more greens. And then as it moves into the summer, we have a lot more kind of the treats, you know, that come out of the field. You know, there's going to be watermelon and sweet corn and tomatoes. And as we move into the fall, we naturally move into more of the starches. So potatoes and squash, which really naturally our bodies are kind of craving at that time. You know, and then through the winter, we're going to continue on with our greens, preserved products and apples, you know, some of the storage things. And it's kind of a way to learn about what crops actually store through the winter. Most people don't know that we can pick a spaghetti squash in September and still have spaghetti squash all the way into April, May of the year. Being a part of the CSA, you're going to learn what's in season, you know. You're going to meet local people. You're going to understand the farmer. That's why for us, simple share is really neat because we want people to come and be a part of the farm year round. We want them to evolve with us. Thank you so much for letting us come out and explaining CSAs to us. It's a beautiful farm. We love to share the farm. It's our favorite thing to do. There's nothing more flattering than when people love the farm like we do, because it's so deep, you know, in our hearts. Prairie Corneliness
