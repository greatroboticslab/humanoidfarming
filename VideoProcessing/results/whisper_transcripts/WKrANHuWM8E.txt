 There's no way seeds or any plants can actually take root here. We bring it back to life and we bring it back to production so that it can feed people and communities can start thriving again. So these half moons, they are the first step in this rehabilitation process. On this side here we have 7500 half moons, each of which has a four meter diameter. This takes one person to dig one half moon per day. The rain basically comes here and we have put the half moons on contour lines, which means the rain when it falls to the ground it flows into this area here which is a little bit lower. It stays here and it feeds these plants. The half moon technology is actually an endogenous technology to the Sahel and has been forgotten over time. We have rescued it from the past.
