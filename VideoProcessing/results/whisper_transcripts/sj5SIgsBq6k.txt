Howto & Style
 Hey there, welcome back to Peppergeek. In today's video, I'll be discussing grow lights. So there are so many different grow lights out there on the market, from LEDs to HIDs and fluorescents. So today we're going to focus primarily on LEDs because I think they offer the most bang for your buck. So I'll talk about what you should look for in a grow light, how to make a really good decision for your specific needs, and I'll also touch on some of the other lights in case they may be right for your situation. We use exclusively LEDs at this point for our grow, and I think you'll agree by the end of this video that that's the best choice. There's a lot of info in this video, so use the timestamps to skip around to whatever might be useful to you. Now we do have recommendations, but they may change over time, so if you want a recommendation from us, check the description of this video. We'll keep it up to date with our current recommendations for grow lights. We also have an article about the best grow lights for peppers. If you want to read more about the lights that we have used and enjoyed using, I'll leave a link to that in the description below. So the first question to ask yourself is what do you actually need a grow light for? Many people just need them to get their seedlings off to a start, and that just requires about six to eight weeks at the beginning of the spring, and then they move outside under the sunlight. However, if you're like me, you like to experiment over the winter, it's nice to have a light that can do it all, that can grow a plant indoors from seed all the way to harvest, so in that situation it makes sense to step up and spend a little more money for a light that's a little more robust and capable. So depending on your specific growing space, the size of it, the shape of it, you can choose the light based on your configuration. For this, you want to look for coverage area. Most grow lights are square coverage, but some of them are made for rectangular spaces. You might see two by two feet coverage area or three by three feet, but in some cases you'll see two by four feet, which may be good if you're working with a rectangular area. Now these types of lights are quantum boards or panels, but there are also bar LEDs, which have strips of LEDs, and those tend to have a better distribution of the light that can fill up your entire grow area. Another thing to consider is what actual form factor you want. All of our LEDs are meant to be hung from above, and then you use a little ratchet to change the height of the light as needed. But you can see it's a little bit clanky, it takes up a lot of space, and so there are many different form factors to alleviate this problem. One example are flexible arm lights. They sort of have these long arms that are positionable, and you can sort of snake them around your plants and aim them at your leaves. But we have used those, and they tend to not be very reliable. Ours only lasted a single season before it broke. But I don't think the LEDs themselves were to blame. I think it was more the electronics and the power unit that was powering light. Another form factor we've seen is the Edison screw. They screw right into a typical light bulb socket, and you can buy those sockets from your hardware store for very cheap. And the last thing is lensing. These are just raw LEDs, as you can see, so the light just kind of shines straight down onto your plants. But you might also see some lensing like this over here, which will spread out the light and create a larger coverage area. So this relatively small light actually spreads the light out, and it will have a larger coverage area, saving you some space. So let's talk about the benefits of LEDs. The first is that they run silent. Most medium or small size LEDs, like these lights, don't require any additional cooling. They do produce heat. That's a common fallacy. They are not completely heatless, but they're much cooler than, say, an HID bulb, and therefore they're completely silent while they're running. That's a big change over the past, where you used to have these fans that would run constantly when your lights were on. And that was especially a problem if you were growing in a grow tent, where the heat becomes trapped and you need to exhaust it. Another great thing is that they're pretty compact. As you can see, the light is very thin, and all the LEDs are just sitting right on the surface. For more powerful lights, you will have a power unit. This is called a driver, and it typically sits right on the back. It's just mounted on the back. They're somewhat heavy, so you want to make sure if you're hanging them that whatever it's hanging from is strong enough to support the light. But this light probably doesn't weigh much more than five pounds. Another great benefit of LEDs is that the light is directional, which means that all of the light is directed away from the LEDs, and none of it is trying to go the opposite direction, like with a standard light bulb. High pressure sodium bulbs were actually created for outdoor use in lamps. The light is scattered in all directions, so you need to use reflective material to get the light down and onto the plants where it's needed. And that just leads to lower efficiency, which is another benefit of LEDs. They're very efficient, and a lot of that comes from that directional lighting, but it also comes from using specific diodes that only emit the light that your plants actually need to photosynthesize. And this makes them more efficient. We'll talk a little more about statistics and how you can tell the efficiency of LEDs, because they do vary. But generally speaking, LEDs are cheaper to run over time than any other type of light on the market. And LEDs are just very long lasting. The diodes are typically rated for somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 hours of runtime, although they will diminish over time. And typically you'll need to replace them every three to five years if you're using them a lot. But the lifespan is way longer than a fluorescent bulb or an HID bulb. Okay, so now moving on to the drawbacks, or really the drawback of LEDs, and that is the upfront cost is higher. So this light here, which is rated for two and a half by two and a half feet of coverage, is about $100, which for many casual gardeners just doesn't make sense. You don't need to spend $100 just to get your plants off to a good start. But you have to keep in mind that these are designed for growing plants indoors year round. If you want to grow plants from seed to harvest, you need something like this. That south facing window is just not going to cut it. But if you want the best start for your pepper plants, or whatever it is you're growing, it's really important to give them the light that they need. But again, that's only the upfront cost. The long term cost of these lights is very low when compared to other methods of lighting your plants. So if you plan on growing for a really long time, an LED is a no brainer. Okay, so let's move on to some of the important features that you might look for when you're shopping for an LED. Let's start with the simple stuff. And first, I'd like to talk about a dimmer knob. I really like that our grow lights have dimmer knobs on them. You can raise or lower the intensity of the lights without changing the height of the light. And that's just really nice. If you see that your plants are stressed out, you can just lower the intensity by a few percentage points, as opposed to raising and lowering this heavy light. I find it really easy to just dial it in at any stage of growth. And a dimmer knob is great because as you can see, I can increase the intensity all the way up to 100%. But now at 50%, it's much dimmer, and the plants are going to get less energy, or I can actually shut this one off completely. So that's really nice. Not all of them shut off, believe it or not. This one only goes down to 5%, so if you want to shut the light off, you have to unplug it or have it on a timer. Another feature that not every grow light has is a silicone coating. You can see it here. It's sort of a rubberized coating over the LEDs themselves, and that protects the diodes from dust, from water, from moisture, and it gives you peace of mind when you're watering or spritzing your plants in your grow space. Another thing you might want to look into is the manufacturer of the driver unit and the LEDs themselves. That's a really big selling point for a lot of these lights. They like to tout that they use Samsung LEDs and a Meanwell driver. Those are two well-known brands in the industry. But you can always reach out in the community if you see an off-brand that you don't recognize, what other people's experience have been with that unit. Another feature you'll see here, this is called a heat sink. This gets rid of the heat that is generated by the LEDs, and it sort of creates a larger surface area on the back, and this is made of metal. Some panels don't have this. The LEDs are actually mounted directly onto metal, and there's no heat sink. It's just a flat piece of aluminum. But I like seeing a heat sink. It's a really good thing for longevity. The cooler the LEDs are running, the longer they're going to last. Another feature you might want if you're going to have multiple grow lights is the ability to daisy chain, and that basically just means that you can plug this directly into another light instead of plugging it into another power source. Sort of like chaining together a bunch of Christmas lights. You just plug one strand into the other strand. Same situation. Not every light has it, but if you want it, look for that feature. Another really important statistic is power draw. How much power you actually need is going to vary based on what you're growing and whether you expect your plants to produce fruits. If you're just starting seeds indoors and you're moving them outdoors anyway, you don't need much more power than say 50 watts. This is a 60 watt unit. This is a 100 watt unit, and this is a 150 watt unit. But you really need to make sure that you research into the actual power draw of the light itself. The names of these LEDs can be very misleading. You'll see TS1000 thinking it's a thousand watt light, but really it only draws maybe 90 watts of power. Thankfully, there are people out there that do the research and see how much power the light is actually drawing from your outlet. Ideally, the manufacturer actually says in the description of the light what the actual power draw is, but if you can't find it, you can find that out with a little bit of digging. And that'll tell you two things. One being how much money it's going to cost you to run the light. Wattage is directly related to power draw per second, so it's joules per second. If it's a 100 watt light, it's drawing 100 joules every second that it's plugged in and turned on. And it will also give you a rough idea of the intensity of light. But there's a much better statistic that you can use to figure out how much energy this is going to provide for your plants to use. And that is PPFD. PPFD stands for Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density. And what it basically measures is how much photosynthetically active radiation is reaching your plants in a given grow area. So I know that's a mouthful, but let's move back and talk about PAR, P-A-R, which is Photosynthetically Active Radiation. Now light comes in from the sun and there are all sorts of different wavelengths of that light hitting a given surface. In order for plants to photosynthesize, they really only need radiation from a very specific band of wavelengths, roughly from 400 to 700 nanometers. So most of these lights will show a graph that's very colorful and it kind of gives you an idea of where the light's energy is distributed across those wavelengths. And that's just another great thing about LEDs is that they can use different diodes to emit different types of light. So they've really begun to hone in on what the plants actually need, making sure that every ounce of energy that the lights are using can go to use by the plants. So I'm going to turn this on here. And as you can see, there are three different types of lights on here. You can see that there's a bluish toned light, which is much lower down on the spectrum. Then you have these bright whitish greenish lights, which are a little bit higher up. And then you've got a few specks of red light coming from red LEDs, which is great for the fruiting stage of your plants. So like I said, an LED panel like this can kind of do it all. You can start your seedlings out or you can grow through the season and get some fruits. So most of the lights will tell you what that PAR rating is. But to get the best sense of how much of that light is actually going to hit your plants and be usable by your plants, you need to look at PPFD. And to take it one step further, if you want to get an idea of the efficiency of your light, you can take that PPFD and divide it by a unit of energy consumption. So you can do PPFD divided by watts and the higher that number is, the more efficient the light is per unit of power draw. Okay, so one other thing I want to talk about is color temperature. You might see a rating for color temperature, which is measured in Kelvin. So you may see 3000 K or 6500 K is really common. And what color temperature is is basically how warm or cool the light looks. The higher the number, the cooler it's going to look, the more blue it's going to look. And the lower the number, the more warm or red it's going to look. But it actually plays a role in how your plants will grow under those lights. Cooler light or blue light is very good for vegetative growth or leafy growth. Whereas red light is much more important when your plants are producing fruit. And this is important because if you're planning on just getting your seedlings off to a good start, you might want to go with a higher color temperature. But if you want your plants to produce flowers and fruit for you, you're going to want some lower color temperatures down near 3000 or even 2800 if you can find it. So you might need to customize and get different types of bulbs and put them into the same unit so that you have a good distribution of light across the spectrum. Another thing to look into is the coverage area. This will be very clearly labeled on any good light. It'll tell you what the rated coverage area is. This light I believe is a three by three foot coverage area. And they'll also tell you what the recommended hanging height is, which I want to talk about now. So this is one of the most common questions. How close should my lights be to my plants? And the answer really just isn't clean cut. With LEDs, you're typically farther away from the plants because the light can be quite intense or it can be very hot in areas as it's called. Which basically means certain areas underneath the light will have a high par value at a lower height. So if you're just a few inches above your plant and you have this all the way cranked up to 100%, you're going to start to see light burn on your plant's leaves. So my best advice is to look at the manufacturer's recommendations. They'll tell you at a height of 15 inches or a height of 24 inches, the par value will be in this range, you know, 500. And start there. If you have a dimmer knob, start a little bit lower. With younger plants, I typically start a little lower on the percentage. With this light, which is 150 watt LED, I'll start at around 18 inches and 50% intensity. And every week, I'll increase that intensity just a little bit, about 5% a week, until the plants seem to be thriving. And I'll usually stop around 75%. Young plants really don't need that full intensity of this light. So you don't want to hang it too high, where you're like three feet above your plants, and the light is getting scattered where it doesn't need to. But you don't want to hang it too low, where you're going to burn your plants, and the energy is going to be focused in a very small area. Each light is intended to be hung at a certain height, and distribute that light over a certain area. One other note on hanging height, as you increase the distance between the light and your plants, the light's intensity on your plants decreases at the inverse square. So double the height doesn't mean half the intensity, it's actually much less than that. So just keep that in mind if you're going to be raising and lowering your lights to change the intensity. Raising it just by an inch or so can make a pretty big difference. And the last thing you want to look into is a warranty for your lights. I always recommend you want it to be at least a year and a half, because if you buy a light to use this year, and next year you go to turn it on and it's not working, you want to be able to get your money back or to at least get a replacement unit. I've seen warranties anywhere from 12 months all the way to 36 months, three full years of warranty coverage for some of the higher end lights. But typically, if you have a longer warranty, you're going to see that those lights cost more upfront. Now if you're going to be getting a grow light, I highly recommend you get a timer to go along with it. A few lights out there will actually have a built-in timer, but most of them don't. So I recommend just getting a simple timer like this one. This costs about 10 bucks and it turns on and off this outlet based on your specified schedule. So I briefly want to discuss some other types of lights that you might want to consider. The first is fluorescence. You can use either the bar fluorescent lights or the compact fluorescent bulbs. There are some benefits to fluorescence. They're very affordable, they run cool, and they are very efficient. The drawbacks are that they're not as long lasting, and the light is omnidirectional, meaning that it scatters in all directions and it has to be reflected back downward at your plants. They also have to be positioned much closer to your plants in order for that light to not scatter everywhere away from the foliage. I do like that the long fluorescent bulbs are called T5 bulbs. Cover a long and slender area, so you can sort of cover a 4 by 2 foot area. It's a great cheap way to start seedlings if that's all you're going to need them for. Another type of light are high intensity discharge. These are bulbs like high pressure sodium or metal halide. They were originally designed for street light use, so they scatter light in all directions, but they've been adapted to use in grow rooms. And they're typically used for higher output situations where you might need very strong grow lights. They're pretty affordable to buy, but the drawbacks are that they're not as efficient as LEDs and they produce a lot of heat. And lastly are blurple lights. You've probably seen these lights that produce only the type of light that your plants need. They produce this horrible bluish purplish glow, and the purple lights make it really hard to identify if you have issues with your leaves. So I highly recommend a natural light like a full spectrum LED or a fluorescent bulb that produces sunlight-like light. Okay, so that was a lot. I hope this video helps you make an informed decision and get a grow light that will last you many, many years. Again, we'll leave some recommendations in the description below. Thanks so much for watching and I'll see you next time.
