 I'm Sean Koppel. I'm Perry Claffey. And we farm at Wilkie, Saskatchewan and we are Flamin's new rental dealer. We rent speed discs, heavy arrows, rollers, grain backs, grain bag extractors, hay trailers. We've had a good experience with Flamin in the past from rentals to buying equipment. And we're looking forward to doing business with Flamin in the future. Flamin in the future.
