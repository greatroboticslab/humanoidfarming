 Welcome to the Mike Les Farmhand Mike YouTube channel. A farming and outdoor channel I started in February of 2012 with over 1,800 videos now available on my channel. And thanks to you, my channel has now grown to over 200,000 subscribers, has over 113 million total views, and over 13 million hours of watch time. I am filming and uploading new content all the time, so tag along for the ride. In this video, I am in a field just outside of Altus, Oklahoma with Frederick Harvesting, who is out here custom harvesting wheat for a local farmer. Frederick Harvesting is based out of Alden, Kansas, and their crew is split up right now. But in this particular field here, they are running three John Deere S7 700 combines, all with the John Deere HD40F Flex Draper head. Running beside the combines, keeping that grain moving, they are running one of their John Deere 8R 370 tractors, pulling a Brent Model 1398 grain cart. The combines are all running together here, sharing the same GPS line. In this video, I got a good mix of drone, on the ground, and some in-cab shots. Holyمرiconia bunches of drone depends, these are all the way, and that is now and its doing what's happening. Though for the accident, the uncertainty of drone is going on.
