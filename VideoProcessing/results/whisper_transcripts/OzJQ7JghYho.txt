 This is John Kohler with growingyourgreens.com. Today we have another exciting episode for you outside the local Lowe's Home Improvement Store. And we're going to go inside and check out Lowe's and share with you some of the alternatives to using pesticides and fungicides and herbicides in your organic garden. Now while they do carry the toxic chemicals, they also carry some non-toxic alternatives that I'm going to share with you today. So let's head inside Lowe's and check it out. So we're here in the department that has all the pesticides, both organic and non-organic, and also some fertilizers. And what we're going to look at today are some alternatives to using conventional pesticides and fertilizers. So you guys are in luck today. Not only am I going to go over the stuff they have, but I also found many of the products are on clearance right now. So it's going to be an excellent deal for you to actually stock up on some of these natural alternative products to pesticides and fertilizers at your local Lowe's. But remember, YMMV, that stands for your mileage may vary. The Lowe's here has these items on clearance and some other Lowe's in the area also do, but your local Lowe's store may not have these same items on clearance like the store here. Anyway, let's get in today's video. So the first thing we're going to look at is what to do for snails. So most people, if they got some snail problems, they might get something like this. Cori's slug and snail pellets. And look, it even says ideal for vegetable gardens, but my vegetable garden would never be using some Cori's. It has some highly toxic metal aldide ingredients. So what can you use instead of Cori's? Well, you could use this stuff up here. Let's check it out. I guess they put it a little bit far away so you don't know the alternatives. But it's this stuff. It's called Worry-Free Slug and Snail Bait. Can be used around pets and wildlife. Kills slugs and snails for use around flowers and vegetables. Remains effective after rain or sprinkling. So basically this is the same stuff as Slug-O and this one's actually on clearance right now. $3.89 from $12.98. The item number is 16439. So of course, besides using a non-toxic alternative, the best way to deal with slugs and deal with most problems in the garden is manual control. What is manual control? It's using your eyes and your fingers and picking out the slugs, spearing them like a shish kebab on like a barbecue skewer, you know, and other methods. That's always the best way. So lately I've been going out late at night when they like to come out and I'll just pick them off my plants and just do one round, walk through my garden, pick them all off and then I'll get some and then the next night I'll go out and get more. It's a never ending process. Next let's talk about ants. So instead of getting some toxic chemicals that could kill ants such as this one, you could get something more natural such as the Tomcat ant attractant base glue traps right here and these are currently on clearance. $1.39 was $3.97. Item number 333987. And these are pesticide free, non-toxic and lab tested. Of course another thing that I use around my house sometimes is a Turo Ant Killer. This is basically borax and sugar water. So the best thing for your ant problems is just actually to make your own ant bait. It's just super simple. Use some like corn syrup and borax or sugar water and some borax, put it in a jar outside in your garden. All the ants will be attracted to that. They'll take that back to their nest and the borax will basically do them in. Now I don't like ants in my garden because they tend to perpetuate the aphid problem in my garden. So it's really important to keep them under control. So the next thing we're going to talk about is grass and weed killer. So instead of using something like Roundup which isn't so good, you could get this stuff right here. It's called weed and grass killer garden safe. And although this one kills some of my favorite food crops including dandelion, chickweed and things like mallow and lambs quarters. You know if you do still have a lawn, this is probably good to use on your lawn but not in your vegetable garden. It may kill some of your vegetables as well. But currently it's on clearance, 75% off. Down to 249 from 997. Item number is 5904. So better yet for weed control, instead of using a spray, you could actually use vinegar. Vinegar can be used to prevent some weeds. It makes the soil too acidic for many weeds and actually it's really inexpensive. Also you could use manual control, your hands, you could pull out all the weeds one by one. And that's the way I would recommend the most if you have the time to pull your weeds. Or hire a kid down the block to pull your weeds for a couple bucks an hour. The next thing we're going to talk about is fungicides. Instead of using spectricide, all purpose fungicide or dalkineal fungicide. Which is once again toxic chemicals but you know there's pictures of vegetables on there so you can use these on your vegetables. But I don't want to spray pesticides on my vegetables so you could get the worry free copper fungicide for organic gardening. And you know once again it's OMRI certified. So this is a worry free control of fungicide. And right now it's on clearance $2.62. It's marked down from 597. Item number 16823. So that's literally half off. So you can definitely be buying some of this stuff today. So other things that can help prevent fungus is proper care. So the one thing that I see a lot is overhead watering of your plants. So things like cucumbers, your squash plants and zucchinis. If you're overhead watering them they stay too moist. It doesn't dry out. It could cause fungus. So water at their base and at the roots only. Also heard that you could spray some milk, diluted milk on your plants which will also act as a fungicide. So next let's talk about pesticides. So instead of using something like 7 that you know many people may use. Once again toxic chemicals. We don't want to put that on our vegetables because we end up eating it. And then you're eating pesticides which may have some negative effects on your health. You could get something like this. Vegol year round pesticidal oil for organic gardening. Once again this is OMRI listed. And it controls all stages of insects and eggs. It's used to control insects, mites, scale and powdery mildew. And once again I mean pretty much the ingredients are 96% canola oil. And this one's on clearance for $3.24 markdown from $12.97 item number 7176. So instead of using pesticide oils like I just shown and buying it on clearance. Once again you could smush pests with your fingers. Smush the aphids. Although that can be very hard. Be very time consuming unless you have lots of time on your hands. Another thing you can do is make your own pesticide oils. I mean that was pretty much mostly canola oil. You could use your own canola oil or some Dr. Bronner soap. Even dish soap mixed in with some water sprayed on your leaves. And that may also be effective against certain pests. Next let's talk about fertilizers. So here's some spray fertilizer. Of course there's the Miracle-Gro garden fertilizer. You could grow plants twice as big but once again made from chemicals. Or you could use something like this. Alaska Natural Blooms fish fertilizer. Basically this is like a fish emulsion. They take fish, basically blend them up and they process it a little bit. And they make the fish fertilizer. You could spray it on your flowers and plants. It won't burn. Ready to spray. Natural base fish formula. And the good news is that it's on clearance at Lowe's right now. 286 was 1143. This one is 75698 is the item number. So what can you do for free or no cost instead of buying some fish emulsion? Well hey, go down to your local fish market. Ask them for their expired fish that they can't sell because they're going bad. Take them home, blend them up, add some water and pour it on your garden. Now that stuff's going to stink but it's going to be good for your garden. Last thing we're going to talk about today. Instead of using Scott's all purpose flour and vegetable continuous release plant food. Once again made from chemicals. You could use this stuff right here. This stuff is called Zoom Organic Garden Food. And you could see here grow bunches of yummy vegetables and you look on the corner here it just says armory listed. So this fertilizer if we look on the back is mainly comprised or derived from specially composted poultry manure. And right now five pounds is on sale. Two dollars and twenty four cents was 8.97. This is a 569 is the item number. So instead of buying fertilizers in your bags why don't you just keep some chickens or ducks and use their fertilizer. Even rabbits. If you have some rabbits you could use their fertilizer in your garden. It's definitely excellent. Hey, if you don't want to keep any pets you could use human manure which is human manure. Use your manure in your garden. Of course you want to make sure you compost that properly before using it. And besides manures you could also use vegetative garden scraps. Or you know waste from your compost from kitchen scraps or waste from your garden. Compost that to make more fertilizer or more nutrients to add to your vegetable garden. So hopefully you've enjoyed this quick episode showing you number one some alternatives to use in your garden. Instead of toxic chemicals you could use more natural products that you could buy actually currently on clearance. Or even just using some other methods that are free or cheap or low cost.
