 Hi, I'm doing good. How are you? Great, great. So you're down two years ago and you got some nice hay and you want some more just like it. Oh, okay, why? I sell more than one load of hay a year. I don't know what you got. What are you feeding cattle? Roping steers. Okay, yep, yep. So just something to just keep some weight on them, right? But you want it nice. Like two years ago? I don't have the same hay that we had two years ago. I fill my barns up every year and then we sell it all. Yeah. Yeah, no, it's the same fields and everything. It's just every year, every cutting, it's just different. Yeah, yeah, I do have some good, some decent cattle hay, but it's, it's not the exact same as it was two years ago. I honestly, I don't remember what you got two years ago. What? It was leafy.
