 Agriculture has played a vital role in advancing the development of human society as we moved away from being hunters and gatherers to farmers. At PIEX Education, growth of knowledge is possible through understanding how our society was able to cultivate the land to eventually grow our population. Through our Agriculture Technology program, we explore the processes of producing food, fuel and other goods by the systematic raising of plants and animals. We learn about sustainable development of food supply through seed growth, as we experiment minimal growing techniques with water and cotton and how water filtration works through charcoal. We emphasise the importance of knowing where our food comes from and how it is produced. We provide the tools for your child to explore how our society is adapting to changes in our environment by developing sustainable farming techniques such as hydroponics, aquaponics and vertical farming. Spots are limited. Be sure to register your child now at PIEX Education's upcoming program at www.piexeducation.com forward slash enrolment.
