Science & Technology
 We throw away 1.3 billion tons of food every year. And as that trash piles up, entrepreneurs all over the world are inventing ways to use that waste as fuel. Like the man in Argentina, turning waste from a cider mill into what he calls bio logs, used for barbecues. It's not tired, but it's my meat. Or the town in Indonesia using stinky runoff from tofu factories to power gas stoves. And the inventor in Sierra Leone, who turns coconut shells into briquettes. I was like, either it works or it works. It needs to work. We traveled around the globe to find out how people are getting energy from worldwide food waste. At the Bowen Pali Market in Hyderabad, India, 10 tons of food go unsold each day. But instead of going to a landfill, it's turned into electricity that will power streetlights, buildings, and a kitchen that preps meals for 800 people. The first step is to chop up larger vegetables and load them onto a conveyor belt. Some of the vegetables are spoiled. Others are thrown away because it costs farmers too much to transport them back home. They're going to be used for bio gas plants. The conveyor belt carries the material to a shredder, which further breaks down the food into smaller, more uniform particles. In a single day, it handles the same amount of vegetables that 150 Indians eat in a year. A grinder crushes the mixture into pulp, which is pumped through underground tanks and into two digesters. So anaerobic digesters basically have bacteria which operate in the absence of oxygen or anaerobic bacteria. And they actually eat essentially the food waste that we are putting in there and give out methane and carbon dioxide. Any organic materials emit these planet warming gases as they decompose. But the massive amount of food waste makes landfills the third largest source of human-caused methane emissions, just behind fossil fuels and agriculture. Burning biogas to make electricity is a way to harvest those gases before they enter the atmosphere. At Boan Pali, the fuel can be stored locally in four huge balloons until it's ready to use. And it goes all the way to the kitchen, which is about roughly 400, 500 meters away from here. It's enough power to run a canteen kitchen that serves roughly 800 meals per day. Aside from energy, the plant creates another valuable by-product, fertilizer. Farmers who sell their wares at the market buy it back and spread it on the same fields where their vegetables grow. By using this fertilizer, their soils are also getting better, their crop fields are better, and their crops are being sold at higher cost because organic vegetables are not very costly nowadays, you know, organic rice and all these things. Dr. Rao, a scientist on the project, is already building five more plants around the city. And it isn't limited to vegetables. Biogas can be produced from any organic material, including animal and human feces. So if biogas can be locally sourced, cuts down on solid waste, and reduces emissions, why aren't we all doing this? Because in most countries, it's still cheaper to keep burning fossil fuels. In North America, biogas costs nearly five times more than natural gas. Now you can't compete with what you call gas in the United States if it's 20 cents a gallon. This gap is smaller in places like Asia, where the difference in price is less than $2 per unit. A lot of people, a lot of state governments, who were thinking about setting up these projects, have suddenly understood that, yes, it's possible to do it. Yes, there are technologies which are indigenous, which are built in India, that can work for them. The world's biggest biogas plant was recently built in Denmark, and new facilities are being built elsewhere in Europe and Africa. An Israeli company sells a product to make biogas in your backyard. Biogas will never replace natural gas, there's just not enough waste to keep up with the demand for electricity. But it does something that natural gas can't. It helps reduce landfill waste. And it's a huge missed opportunity in the United States, which throws out between 30 and 40% of all food. Even the farmers who lose money when they can't sell their produce, believe biogas is better than just throwing it away. And the engineers on the Bowenpali project are hopeful that its success will inspire others. So these projects have to happen, you know, for us to make life more sustainable, not just for ourselves, but for, let's say, 20 years or 10 years down the line, the scenario needs to be a little better. In Sierra Leone, entrepreneur Al-Hajji Sarraj Baah also hopes to inspire others. To switch from wood-based charcoal to briquettes made from coconut waste. This squishy sludge could hold an answer to a deadly problem. Al-Hajji lost his adoptive family in a mudslide when he was 17. Disasters like these have become more common as deforestation increases. And tree roots, which hold back the soil during increasingly intense storms, begin to disappear. Al-Hajji hopes to save trees by making and selling his own alternative fuel source. Biobriquettes help prevent deforestation because they are produced from biomass waste. They are not produced from wood. Coconuts are one of Freetown's favorite on-the-go snacks. Vendors end the day stuck with heaps of shells that they need to get rid of somehow. And that costs money. This was supposed to be waste. They needed to pay transport to dump this thing. Now I'm going to pick it up for free. Al-Hajji says his company, Roguesal Trading, collects about two metric tons of coconut waste for water. He's aiming for 10 tons by the end of 2022. So this is the backbone of our products. This is well-frored. Workers clean the husks and shells and dry them for about a week. Next, they fire them inside this steel drum. It carbonized for like three, four hours. We put the fire out using water. We have to wait for them to get dried. They pulverize the charred coconuts into a fine powder. And add water, plus a secret ingredient, to bind it all together. The mixing is very challenging. So the whole process depends on the mix. A slight mistake on the formula. You have to start all over again. The extruder pushes out slimy rectangular logs that will need to dry for three to four days. These ones are destined for shisha pipes. In fact, people who smoke hookah are his best customers these days. Roguesal Trading can produce about half a metric ton of briquettes in a day. And they bring in as much as $4,500 on a good month. We are the best selling briquettes. You can find our briquettes in most of the supermarkets in town. They go for 70 cents per kilogram. That's four times more expensive than the common wood-based charcoal. But they burn at least four times as long. Alhaji's next big challenge is to grow his sales to reach people who will use his coconut briquettes for cooking fuel, instead of cutting down trees. It's not easy, but it takes time. It's very tough to build something great. If it was not tough, everybody would have done it. He has 10 full-time employees and up to 40 part-timers, depending on the season. And about a year and a half ago, he expanded his business. Roguesal Trading raises and sells chickens, too. His mother says he's wanted to be an entrepreneur since he was a kid. All the days, he looked at Facebook. He looked at Facebook. He looked at Facebook. The man who got money, passed all the money. He said he watched the money. Only for me. But that all felt very far away, when Alhaji suddenly became the breadwinner for his family at age 12. He left his village, hoping to make money to send home to his mother and sister. I was just this kid who wanted to become somebody, but I was not thinking straight. I thought that it was just, okay, for me to move to freedom. So without thinking about where am I going to stay, who's going to feed me, who's going to take care of me, but I moved. He lived on the streets for four years until he found a steady job and an adoptive family who took him in. Seven to eight months after my adoption, I lost my family that I was living with during the mudslide. Over 1,100 people died and 3,000 more lost their homes. Alhaji was left with just a few dollars to his name. But he was desperate to do something to stop the deadly mudslides. In the decade before the tragedy, mudslides in Africa had already claimed thousands of lives. One of the reasons that caused the mudslide is the vast amount of deforestation, because the roots helps to keep the soil firm. And he began obsessively researching ways to stop deforestation. He found YouTube videos of entrepreneurs from around the world making biomass briquettes to replace wood in charcoal. He started saving money for an expensive mechanical extruder and perfecting his recipe. Our formula is so outstanding that it can burn for like four hours. It emits less smoke. He pitched his business idea at a Harvard competition in 2020 and won awards there and at the United Nations. He recently landed new customers in Germany and the UK. We have a lot of food, and we have a lot of food. We have a lot of food, and we have a lot of food. And we have a lot of food that we have to eat. We have a lot of food that we have to eat. But most people in Freetown still cook with wood. You just can walk up to somebody and be like, hey, this is new, this is different from what you've been using. So it's a bit tough, but we'll get there one day. Alhaji isn't the only one creating charcoal alternatives. In Argentina, Jose Alberto Aramberi and his wife Cristina make bio logs using waste from apple and pear cider. Three rivers run through Alto Valle, creating a patch of fertile ground perfect for growing apples and pears. Each year, the country's apple cider industry alone creates about 75,000 metric tons of leftovers. This fruit waste is called pomace, and it's the heart of Jose's business, biot. It all started with a dried piece he took home to run some tests on. I try to cut it. And it comes to about 2 centimeters. And from there, it starts to grow the chisps. And I say, what is this? He realized that pomace could be used for fires. But the real challenge was figuring out how to turn tons of slushy fruit into solid logs. How do we use it? If it's a soup, how do you come? How do you put the soup to the kitchen, to the fire, to the salamandra? He had lots to experiment with. Since cider makers like Marcelo Garcia are usually happy to have someone take it off their hands. It becomes a bottle of bag, since we don't remove the orujo. It's complicated because we can't continue to do the elaboration. Making this cider starts with fruit that would have otherwise gone to waste. We made the corn with the fruit that has been discarded on the fruit mountains due to different conditions such as damage by granice, damage by the hada, and size. On the way to the grinder, the fruit travels through the factory in channels of water. A belt of buckets lifts the fruit to a mill that crushes it. The orujo has already suffered a process of three times prensado to add the biggest amount of jug, of manzana, or of pera. But the pomace can't get too dry, or it won't move smoothly through the machinery. So the cidery adds water back into the mixture. And finally, it's collected through an elevator, which is called this gusano-sin-fin. It's collected in a bowl. Marcelo says the pomace has lots of uses, like composting, heating, and making vinegar. But it's a waste, not a waste. That's the big difference. The biggest problem is moving the wet-heavy mixture. Jose gets pomace delivered to his property by the truckload. I'm transporting 80% of water that takes the water. I can't sell it. He's considered many ways to get that water out. With heat, with gas, with centrifugation, and, well, generally with ovens. But, well, that would take the cost of the product very, very high. So far, the cheapest option is simply dumping pomace on the ground and waiting a few days. I think this is completely natural, natural and dry with the climate. With the wind, the air, and the sun. Then, a worker uses a bulldozer to move the gunk into a specialized machine. This machine has a history, since it was made and invented by me. There is no fruit wool wool, so there is no way to process it. So you have to invent everything. With the help of a tractor, the machine dispenses a line of pomace onto the ground and slices it into brick shapes. It stays in the field for at least three, four, or five days, in which the pan is lost a lot of humidity and the pan takes a consistency. Jose piles up the dry pieces. He often tries out other systems, like drying smaller batches in a rectangular mold. The mold could help him make thinner bricks that don't need to be flipped. So I have to come to the backyard and check if it's low the humidity or not. I have to experiment with the mold because I can use it in different ways. He's considered making other products, like animal feed, but right now he only sells the so-called biologues. He's been selling periodically. He founded Biot with his wife, Cristina. She helps with the marketing and sales side of the business. Jose says their different skills make them a good match. She sells the logs to some local businesses and to people who use them at home. Traditional Argentine barbecues, or asados, date back to the 16th century. Nowadays, lots of people use charcoal, but some say wood gives meat the best flavor. So it's popular with restaurants. It's the competition with something ancestral like the leña. You can go to several restaurants and restaurants and everyone says, no, I've been buying leña for 20 years ago. Jose says meat grilled with biot doesn't taste any different. Yes, there are some people like this, exquisite, or that have a much finer smell and a finer taste. And they say that they transmit a fruit or an apple smell. But, sincerely, I've never noticed that. I've never noticed that. Oh! I've never noticed that. I've never noticed that. Biot logs provide about the same amount of energy as regular firewood. And burning them has about the same effect on air quality. Jose says it costs the same, too. And the business is profitable because costs are low. Customers have to come to his farm to pick up the product. In 2019, Jose and Cristina supplied the local government with biot, which gave it out to low-income households. But elections brought in a new government that didn't renew the deal, leaving them with almost 100 metric tons of extra inventory. Cristina says their current processes are slow and difficult to scale up. How much can we produce in a season? 1,000 tons, a little more, and not more. Because remember that the sun is dry. But Jose thinks the technology will become more popular. I think it will explode. That you know the technique that I have, and then you can perfection it by the way of a professional. No matter what, he's proud to leave behind a legacy of invention. Biota is synonym of Aramberri, it's my. Even if no one knows, it doesn't matter. There's something I invented. If not, you went through here and you left nothing. You left nothing. Over in Indonesia, one community is powering homes in a different way. Converting stinky tofu wastewater into home cooking fuel. In a country that struggles to provide access to energy, this tofu biogas has become an important alternative. The inside of the Haji Oji tofu factory is hot and steamy. With a sour odor that you can smell from outside. It's one of more than 230 tofu makers in Sumedong, an area of West Java famous for this product. But all that tofu comes at a smelly price. It's a smelly price. It's a smelly place called the The city of the river. The city of the river. The city of the river. Almost every step of making tofu generates wastewater. When that flows into nearby streams, the acidic runoff can kill off fish and crops. And as the organic material dissolved in it decomposes, it produces ammonia gas. Tofu starts with dried beans that are measured out and soaked. This is the one for two hours. This is the one for two hours. If it's the one for two hours, the size of the size is enough. It's clean and clean. Yusuf has been making tofu here for 18 years. He grinds the soaked beans to prepare them for cooking. If it's clean, put it into the machine. So it's like a soy sauce. The bean paste cooks in giant cauldrons. Workers stir the mixture until it's just right. Then they strain the slurry through cheesecloth. Excess water collects in drains. What's left is soy milk and a steaming pile of pulp called dregs. This is the one for two hours. This is the one for two hours. And the one for two hours. And the one for two hours. And the one for two hours. And the one for two hours. Then they strain the slurry through cheesecloth. Excess water collects in drains. What's left is soy milk and a steaming pile of pulp called dregs. Adding vinegar curdles the soy milk. The bean curds go into wooden molds. Heavy weights squeeze out any of the pulp. The bean curds go into wooden molds. Heavy weights squeeze out any of the pulp. The bean curds go into wooden molds. Heavy weights squeeze out any of the remaining liquid. Making just one kilogram of tofu generates 33 liters of liquid waste containing whey and vinegar. ok. Think it's really okay for people and listen to the human Orson, Said Mimba?Now it can be better. Just five years ago the tofu plant discharged everything into the nearby river. But now things are different. But sleep brings us all in the oil and waste Hastbruik. carry wastewater directly from the cluster of tofu factories to a nearby biogas plant. Technician Pepin Sopendi has been producing biogas here since the plant opened in 2017. The facility treats some water to be released back into the river. Another pipeline carries more concentrated waste to collect in a holding pond. The six tall black tanks turn waste into biogas. The wastewater gets pumped into the first reactor from the holding pond. Then, technicians introduce anaerobic bacteria, which don't require oxygen to break down organic material. As the microbes munch on soy proteins, the series of six digesters produces methane, a gas that can be used as fuel. The whole fermentation process takes about 20 days, but technicians feed new biomass into the reactors every day. Leftover solids can be used as fertilizer. Part of it may have第三 a need to produce filter primarily into the plant. characterize fare homemade总iles觀g photographs輪네 fung reticula as well as others across the country. Based on our raw diet, the white person can be perceived directly at the same time. We can incorporate them into artist's downstream powers on our couch. In the last 40 years, Indonesia has built almost 50,000 biogas plants. While the Indonesian government funds some facilities like this, this particular plant is owned collectively by the community. Larger plants in other areas also turn biogas into electricity. The country's huge appetite for tofu means there's a lot of opportunity for growth. In Indonesia, there are a lot of tofu plants. In 500 meters from here, there are 19 tofu plants. They're not used to be cleaned. All are removed. The Sumedong plant supplies 56 households with a direct line of biogas. And it has the capacity to provide even more. One of those homes belongs to Dedah Hidayah and her family. I'm a family-in-law. I cook every day using biogas. It's been around five years. Today, she's cooking tofu with gas made from tofu waste. But this circular model has its limitations. Tofu wastewater needs to be generated, collected, and fermented every day to keep the flow of biogas going. Because of the working hours at the factory, biogas from the plant only runs to homes for a few hours in the mornings and afternoons. If there's still gas, it's still there. If there's still gas, it's still there. It's all there. Some Indonesians do have access to natural gas. But building pipelines across the country's 17,000 islands is a challenge. About 60% of its energy comes from coal. At the G20 summit in November, a combination of wealthy countries and private institutions pledged $20 billion toward helping Indonesia wean itself off the fossil fuel. Small biogas plants like this one could play a key role. And while they can't provide electricity or cooking fuel everywhere, they can help communities make something good out of a stinky situation. But even more communities, no more true. Thank you.
