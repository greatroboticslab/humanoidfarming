 This is the force feeding for the production of foie gras. These never-before-seen images shot at several duck farms in France show the extreme cruelty of this practice. Ducks are forced to live in crowded cages on top of each other. They are in an obvious state of stress and fear, backing into the corners of the cages as if to protect themselves. They pant from fear. What lies ahead for them is terrible. During the first few weeks on the farm, ducks are fed normally. But then the workers begin to increase the animal's food intake to unnatural levels. The ducks now begin the fattening phase. While one duck is being fed, the others huddle in the corner of the cage, terrified. A 10 to 12 inch metal tube is thrust down the duck's throats and pushed to the entrance of the esophagus. At this point, the animals are forced to swallow large amounts of food. From 200 to 400 grams of feed every day, ducks endure this painful process up to three times per day for 15 long weeks. It is the same as a 175 pound person being force fed to swallow over 28 pounds of food in a few seconds. During this phase, it is not uncommon for ducks to suffer injuries or beak damage. Workers on these farms stated that many animals also suffer lacerations to their esophagus during force feeding. Around only 15 weeks of age, these animals are killed. They are first hung by their legs and stunned. But the stunning is often done incorrectly by inexperienced workers. This means ducks will have their throats cut while conscious and able to feel the blade. Once killed, the industry takes the only thing they care about, the diseased liver. This is the only reason for this cruelty. For the meat industry to profit, this liver, which weighs up to 10 times as much of a healthy animal, is sold as a so-called delicacy. This is how foie gras is made, and it's legal in 49 out of the 50 US states. It's time to end this cruel practice by banning the production and sale of force-fed products across the country. This is why we're calling for the United States government to support a ban on the sale and production of foie gras in our country. This is why we hopes for all these twomaans to sponsor people's nine keyедьmiles that is more吃 quantitatively utilizar and tracks.
