Howto & Style
 What I'm going to do today is I'm basically going to be just watering in our new blueberry bushes and also watering in our older blueberry bushes that we've had from last year. And we're going to go into planting these new blueberry beds, but I just wanted to show you the difference between what these look like last year and what they look like this year. Look at these beautiful berries on here. That's what we're doing today. We're planting blueberries. Right here is another Bless Your Heart. And you can see I have several inches of pine bark nuggets on the top. And this here is another Hello Darling. And I'm mixing these in with each other. And you can see again, that's at least three inches of pine bark mini nuggets on top. And this here is a Bless Your Heart. Same thing. Three inches of pine bark nuggets on top. And what we're going to do is go down here and we're going to show you how to put these beds together. Blueberries are unique in their own nature. And it's one of the few plants that you do want to consider a large container for. Now, blueberries like a soil pH between a 4.5 and a 5.5. Now, planting these in the ground, you can add some soil acidifier. And that usually takes maybe a year for that to even have a partial effect on lowering your pH in your soil. So what I like to do is put my blueberries in containers and give them the growing medium that's already acidic in nature. Now, Berrytone is an excellent choice for your blueberries as well as your strawberries. And I always keep some of that on hand. But what I've grown to favor over the short period of me growing blueberries is cottonseed mill. It has an NPK of a 611. Now, cottonseed mill is an excellent fertilizer for acid-loving plants like blueberries and strawberries. And being that we're in the springtime and our blueberry bushes are waking up, we want to give them a nice good perk of that 611 or that cottonseed mill. Now, the first thing we want to do as we start to get our beds in place, we want to make sure that we have the correct distance between all of our beds. And I'm about 36 inches between each. So that lands me right at 36 there. The bed's about 13 inches tall. This one's 16 inches, so I have about 3 inches that I need to drop this down. I just had this in here so I can get a visual of what I wanted to do. All these beds on average are 48 inches. So I need at least 23 to center. So that's pretty close right there. And I think I'm going to go ahead and roll with that. Now what I have here is a little paint marker to go around the inside of the bed. That way I can remove this and I'll know exactly where my line is where I need to start etching out to get my bed to settle in. Now I can go ahead and move this out the way. And go ahead and get started on etching out our beds. And I'm just going to skim the top because I want to keep as much soil in here as I can. You're something beautiful, electric chemical.

with you, don't have to question it True to ocean All my life, I thought that love was just a lie A way to feel an unrealistic high Make it a fix, I never satisfy Give you all of my love, you give it right back I can fly, I can fall, I know you got my back Never thought I would find someone to love like that So basically what I've done is just gotten me a really good acidic mix Now here are the few things that I go to When it comes to my blueberry bushes and my strawberries But here's your berry tone And here you have some soil acidifier And this has become my favorite And that 6 in the 611 Is just enough nitrogen in there for the blueberries to really respond to it Without having an overabundance of growth And lessening the berry production So I'm very happy with the way this cottonseed mill is performing So what we're going to do We're going to put the berry tone aside for right now Because we're not going to use that I'm just going to add a quarter cup Of the soil acidifier And I'll do this every spring Just add one quarter cup of the soil acidifier To each one of the beds Not a whole lot And with the cottonseed mill I'm going to do a half a cup as well And I'll do this twice a year Once in the spring As the blueberries start to wake up And then I'll do it again around September After the blueberries start to taper off somewhat And this stuff will be breaking down for the next few months And we're just mixing that in And by the time the berries finish fruiting That cottonseed mill is going to be there to replenish them After all of that fruit production that they put out through the year So we're going to go ahead and mix that in This here is another Hello Darling And this has become one of my favorites Because this thing blooms on and off all year long And it is a prolific producer And this one was developed by the University of Florida As a southern highbush Where it grows very well down here in the southeast Georgia zone 8-8 We're going to up-pot this And this is how I did all of my blueberry bushes These plants have been baby for the last two years of their lives in the nurseries So nine times out of ten they're root bound Now with the blueberry bushes the roots are very fine And they spread out more so than going deep So what I like to do with my bushes After they've been bottled up for the majority of their lives Look how tight this ball is That's no room for growth in there And what that's going to do it's going to stunt the growth of the plant Because you're going to be waiting for this plant to take off throughout the year And it's going to be steady trying to break out of this little root ball that it has here I'm going to do something that makes even me squeamish Turn this this way And we're going halfway up the root ball and that's giving us about six inches And we're going to just do a little hex at the bottom And then we're just going to massage this All of these over All of these over I'm not telling everybody to do theirs this way I'm just telling you that's how I did mine And every one of them are doing very well And it's going to stress the plant out a little bit But that's what you want because it's going to go into survival mode And it's going to try to replant itself Because it wants to survive All those fine hairs there They're going to take off into this medium And while it's a little abusive right now They're going to love you for it in the end See how the roots are starting to pop loose now This plant's been bottled up for its entire life So all we're doing is just giving it room to breathe All right, so we'll sit down to the side for now And we're just going to Give us a little spot in there All that peat moss in there It's going to love it here Fit it in And with that root ball just above the surface So that water can run off And then what I'm going to do Pack this a little of our mix Right up in here And then we're going to set it back down And then Put it all back in there She is going to love it here And then I'm going to take a little more of my cotton seed meal And we're just going to go around Not going to put it on the root ball But we're going to go right around that root ball Because we want those roots to have a reason to come out So as we water it That stuff's going to soak down And those roots are going to want to travel Each bed after all said and done Is going to get two cubic feet of the mini pine bark nuggets Mulched across the top Now to finish this off We're going to take some of our quarter inch automotive door edging And we're going to finish off the edges of these beds I'll put a link in the description if you want to get these Under course It's so cool I want to get these Organize it I want to get new I want to get them Loving into theaches Get the idea Using the solution To be Europe If you want to venture to come out oh that was just a lie and unrealistic high i'm never satisfied give you all of my love and you gave it right back i can fly i can fall i know you got my back i never thought i would find someone to love like that Something bad
