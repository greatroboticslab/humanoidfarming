Over-seeding and Pasture Establishment: Expert Tips

 Okay, so I want to talk about establishment and overseeding. Remember having a lady in a meeting recently and she said, I try to do establishment and management right. I overseed every spring and I overseed every fall. And I encouraged her that if you do it correctly, you don't need to overseed every spring and every fall. So let me talk about why people would think about overseeding and then maybe even a new establishment. So if this was your pasture right here, there's a great cover here, but the cover consists not only of the grasses, but consists of a number of weeds like ragweed and plantain. And so if you don't want weeds, if you want just mainly grasses, then you're going to have to do something different. So the first thing would be spraying a broadleaf herbicide that would kill those weeds. So that's going to be a benefit, but then that's going to leave bare ground. And if you leave bare ground, then more weeds are going to grow. So you're going to need to do some type of overseeding. Or if the courses have been grazing so closely that you have bare ground created, then you need to overseed into that. So, but, but in very important thing, if this is the amount of height that you've got, it's a good height for a pasture, but not a good height when you want to get seed started. The size of seed that you're establishing, this is tall fescue, and Kentucky bluegrass is even smaller than that. They need to be shallow in the soil. They're also not a real vigorous little plant or seedling, and so they need to not have much competition. So the goal in overseeding is to have bare ground. Now, that would mean very little plant material. Or if you've got a pasture that you have more plant material, it would be a matter of cutting that plant material close. Now, you're not going to be cutting with a knife like this, but you'll be cutting with a mower, or you'll have your horses or your cattle, if you have those, grazing close, so there's not as much competition close to the ground. And then your, most people use a no-till seed drill, and it's going to make slices through the soil like this, and then it will actually drop seed along that slice. And then almost all no seeding equipment has a wheel, and that wheel comes along and it packs the seed in. And you'll notice there that I'm very shallow. A good rule of thumb is maybe not more than a fingernail in depth, so not more than a quarter to half inch deep. So if you were overseeding here, then making sure that you're seeing some bare soil, you're making sure that you're not too deep with your seeder, and then as the grass starts growing back, if it grows way up above your little seedlings, you go back and do a really quick grazing or a mowing to reduce competition. But you don't want to put animals back, really under normal grazing for several months. Now, you might decide in a pasture like this, you might say, I've tried overseeding and I'm not getting much success, or I have a lot of problem weeds that just always seem to come back up. So you may decide, well, I'm going to start over. I'm going to completely reestablish. And a very effective method that we found for reestablishment, if there's weed problems, if there's fescue and you have broodmare so you have that toxicity, is actually spraying out the whole pasture. I mean, you could come in here with a plow and till it up, but that's a whole lot of work that disturbs the soil that leads it to erosion. If you use a broad spectrum herbicide like glyphosate, this time of year, we're in late July right now, and spray out the entire pasture, wait about four weeks, some of the growth will come back, some of the weeds will survive that, spray out again. And then everything is going to be dead. But there's not a lot of bare ground. So the dead material actually can provide kind of a cover, kind of a mulch, kind of like you put hay or straw out after seeding in your yard. And so then you would go and you drill into that dead standing stubble to see that you want to plant. And that may be Kentucky bluegrass and orchard grass. It may be that you add in some of the newer types of fescue that are safe. You could even add in some clover. That would be so we're end of July. You have the two sprayings. Then you can go in and seed in early September. That's a good rule of thumb in Kentucky and in surrounding states. So overseeding, remembering to reduce competition, complete reestablishment, making sure that what you've got there in the first place, whether it's weeds or whether it's grasses you don't want, you kill those out ahead of time. We've got a lot more detailed publications on the UK Forage website. Just Google UK Forages and you'll get that information under the establishment section. So like we'll wrap this up we'll have to accept as part in the next part in the next chapter. Again, I applied forGrindon. Now that we women rev lekker at the high and seaside bgrox.
