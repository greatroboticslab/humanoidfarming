 You're wearing a belt. Is that belt from leather or is that an artificial? Yeah, it's vegan leather. But it's leather? Yeah, it's not someone's skin. So it's actually an artificial product? Yeah, it's vegan. No one was shot in the head for my belt. It is leather? Vegan leather. So it came from an animal? No, it's vegan leather. So it's a synthetic material and no one was shot in the head and it's not someone else's skin. So that bit of synthetic material you've got, that produced as much CO2 as driving my car from here to Darwin. Can I see the scientific resource? The UNIWHO website, that will actually show you that for every 500 grams of synthetic material created, it produces as much CO2 as driving 2,000 kilometres. Animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gases than the world's entire transport system. But we're not here to argue about environment. We're here to argue about the rights of other species.
