 brutally murdered every year, just human consumption. You've never visited my place. How do you know? Because if you had, you'd know. You're talking a load of shit. For a start, we don't... our animals. Yes, you use euphemisms such as artificial insemination, which is great. I don't use artificial insemination. I run my bucks with my herd.
