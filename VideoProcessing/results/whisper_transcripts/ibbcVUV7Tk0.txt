 The Giraffe project official visited the Upper River region on a seed distribution monitoring assessment as farmers received different varieties of maize and rice seeds. The entire process of the seed distribution was digitalized for transparency developing viable data for tracking and future use. A demonstrative session was also conducted as part of the monitoring activities at the Mixed Farming Center in Girabakunda. The Governor of the region and project officials were taken through the process of farmer registration in the data system highlighting beneficiaries. According to the Giraffe project director, Abdoulaye Toure, the distribution scheme will provide quality seed varieties of all serious produce in Gambia for better and sufficient agricultural production. The Giraffe project is to boost self-sufficiency in rice production and other crops produced for consumption, particularly for school feeding and minimizing food in Potaisun. The Governor of the region, Sambaba, held the Giraffe project and the Ministry of Agriculture for providing seed to farmers, which he said will boost agricultural produce in a timely period. What I have seen, it has shown me that the process is transparent and at the same time one can be accountable of whatever you do because it is digitalized. And there are questions that you need to answer before you qualify at least to get this seed. Meaning anybody who gets this seed know that you are now qualified to at least engage into that farming. And then the tendency is you are expected to have what we call high yield. Governor of Bahari affirmed the government's commitment to supporting farmers in the country saying the move will promote commercial agriculture at the end of the harvest period. And I think with this method, if we are able to do it right, then we will be able to supply our markets with the food that we need so that at the end of the day we will be self-sufficient. If you are a farmer, you only depend on, you only grow what you eat, but you don't also put into consideration that you get something that you sell at the end of the day so that you can now bring money back to the family and support them into their other needs. Then it means that still now we will have a problem. And this project is altogether trying to address that problem. In as much as the government is willing to work with partners for them to invest into trying to boost agriculture in this country, it is also the solemn responsibility of the farmers for them to be responsible of whatever they are giving. Beneficiary farmers who receive rice and maize seeds including Maymuna Balle and Usainu Balle of Jirabakunda respectively, thank the government through the giraffe project for providing them with varieties of quality cereals. Mr. Balle confirmed that out of last year's harvest, he was able to buy two cows and significantly boost his household feeding. From the the farmers that number, there must have owned to remove the fresh hotests and for the fresh to形ate crops At the state of South Mar安 dry is hard to grow. He did not use them in the blank structure, it was not for harvest in the garden As a caregiving détruir hear them, he could absorb션�� có programme It lies like last year and we find that it's a good seed and it helps a lot. We get what to eat, we sell it, we get money. There is a lot of things that we have inside it, a lot. We see a lot of improvement in these things, corn. Officials, oil farmers, particularly beneficiaries to capitalize on the opportunity and make the best use of these seeds as the objective is to help food producers to boost farming yields and expand food self-sufficiency efforts in the country.
