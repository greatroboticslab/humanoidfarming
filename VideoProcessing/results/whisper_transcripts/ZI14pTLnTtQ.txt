Howto & Style
 Did you know that a rainstorm is actually really good for your plants, whether they're houseplants or in your garden as well? Not only does it have extra nitrites, but it also just frees up some extra nutrients that are in the soil just using regular rainwater. Rainwater contains nitrites, which is a form of nitrogen that is an essential macronutrient that our plants are going to need. So not only is the rainwater free, they will grow a lot better, a lot more healthier, and a lot faster if you're using rainwater. If you're using water from the pipes from your house, that water can possibly contain, if not a lot of chemicals, such as high calcium and whatever else possibly that is inside of that water. Don't forget to collect your rainwater because I'm telling you when your plants are really thirsty and are in need of an extra plant boost, then you can definitely use rainwater to your advantage.
