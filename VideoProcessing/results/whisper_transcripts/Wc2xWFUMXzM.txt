 There is an easy way you can achieve higher yields while increasing soil health just by adding the leaves and stems from the native shrubs that are already in your field back into the soil. Shrubs improve the soil and crop production in many ways. In this video you will learn the benefits of keeping shrubs in your field to increase crop yield, enjoy an earlier harvest, and keep your soil healthy. How do shrubs do this? Shrubs like Gerasenigalensis and Pileostigma reticulatum are native to the land. They provide leaf and stem litter and roots that improve soil quality and nutrients needed to grow crops. Shrubs also improve the soil's ability to store water for use by crops planted near them. When you remove shrubs you remove the nutrients and water leading to poor soil and decreased crop yields. Shrubs help bring water to your crops because they have much deeper roots than crop plants which cannot access water deep beneath the surface like shrubs can. Once the water is brought up by the shrubs deep roots it not only provides water for the shrub but also provides water to surrounding crop plants. This helps crops to get through dry periods during the growing season keeping yields constant during low rainfall years. Shrubs If you keep shrubs in your field your crops will mature about 15 days earlier than fields without shrubs. This is most helpful in years when the rain stops before the end of the growing season. What should you do with shrubs in your field? First keep shrubs in your field. Second when you prepare your field for planting cut down the shrubs at the soil surface but do not burn this pruned shrub litter. Instead chop them into pieces approximately the length of your thumb and spread the leaves and stems in your field. When preparing your seed bed for planting till the shrub leaves and stems into the soil. The shrub residue will break down feed nutrients to your soil and reduce parasitic nematodes. Keep native shrubs in your field. After pruning the shrubs in the spring do not burn this shrub material but rather chop up and incorporate stems and leaves into the soil. This will increase your crop yield. Keep native shrubs in your field. Provide an earlier harvest and make your soil healthier. Also crops planted near shrubs will receive water during dry periods because of the shrubs deep roots. Remember keep shrubs in your field. Do not burn the shrubs in your field. Do not burn the shrub leaves and stems. Chop stems into small pieces and till them and the leaves into the soil. By not burning pruned shrub material from Gera and Pileo shrubs and incorporating the stems and leaves into your field, you will greatly improve soil health, enable earlier harvesting and increased yields.
