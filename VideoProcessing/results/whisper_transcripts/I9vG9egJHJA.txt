 Amanda Sohlbacher- All right, I think we can go ahead and get started. I'll write with everyone. All right, so hello everyone and thank you for joining us today for some coffee talk on your Friday. My name is Amanda and I work at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society, also known as the IRI, at Columbia University in New York. And I helped to manage a project called Act Today that's aiming to improve climate services for SDG2. Currently though and very appropriately for this event, I am actually joining you from Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee. This is what's in my background. Yeah, and so I'll be your moderator today for this very important conversation as we work our way through understanding the intersection of climate, coffee and human rights together. Right? So what do we have in store for you today? The conversation today is going to touch on quite a few themes and topics, including the impacts of climate on coffee, but also what that means for both coffee consumers, those who enjoy their morning cup of coffee, as well as coffee producers. So the changing precipitation and temperature patterns that are associated with a shift in climate really do have huge implications for coffee. Because as you may or may not know, coffee grows best in a rather narrow range of temperatures and conditions. And these changing conditions will not only affect coffee production or the quantity of coffee that we're able to produce, but it's also going to be affecting quality as well. And perhaps more importantly than even the effects on quality of coffee, these changes and conditions will and even already are affecting the quality of life of more than 100 million farmers around the world today who depend upon coffee for their livelihoods. So coffee is important for more reasons than just, you know, a tasty morning beverage. And by the end of the event, you should have a better understanding as to both why and how. But you don't have to take my word for it. We have an incredible panel with us today of researchers from the IRI, experts from both Fair Trade International and Fair Trade Africa, and even a coffee farmer herself from Kenya and the Kenya Fair Trade Certified Kip Kellyanne Union. So we really have quite a diverse group of perspectives here to share their experiences with you all on how a changing climate has impacted their lives and work, as well as what can be done on a consumer, industry, and even policy level to affect change and address these challenges. So in a nutshell, there's trouble brewing, pun intended, but there's also some really nice and promising solutions out there. All right. So without further ado, we're going to start off the event with some very brief presentations from our panelists. We have four panelists. And the idea behind these presentations is just to give you a sense of, you know, who these panelists are, where they're coming from, and a bit about their organizations. And work before we dive deeper into some of these issues in conversation. So each of these four presentations is going to be just about five minutes long. And then we're going to move into 30 minutes of actual panel discussion, followed by 20 minutes of taking and answering questions from you guys, the audience, before concluding the event. All right. So I guess we'll just get started. Our first presenter and panelist today is Juan Pablo Solis from Fair Trade International. Juan Pablo, who is Fair Trade International's senior climate advisor, is going to give us a bit more background on the vulnerability of coffee to a changing climate and help us to understand that it's really not the only stressor that coffee farmers have to deal with. But it's a big one, and it's an additional one. So he's also going to give us a quick snapshot of some of the solutions that Fair Trade International is promoting to address these challenges. So without further ado, Juan Pablo, you can go ahead and take it away. Hi, Mada. Thank you so much for your kind words. Welcome. I'm going to share my screen now to clarify the conversation. Okay. Hope you can see. Okay. So hi, my name is Juan Pablo Solis. I'm senior advisor for climate and environment here at Fair Trade International. And today we are going to talk about coffee, environment, climate and human rights. Now, GCU is not new. We have experienced it during the last five years, according to the World Meteorological Organization, the six most warmed years on records. Actually, 2020 was one of the warmest ones. We also have seen the severity and frequency of meteorological events. A very recent example that touched on coffee was hurricanes ETA and IOTA in Central America. And we have for years discussing about sustainability in our global agenda. Sustainable development goals have a deadline in 2030. And if we look back, we are only nine harvest away to achieve SDGs. So the clock is ticking. So for coffee, this is not something new. Actually, coffee has been a sector very resilient over time. Although despite historical volatility in the price and the response of the market, the constant trend of market consolidation and the imbalance between global income and value redistribution, coffee has been leading. Despite those things, coffee has been seen as one of the leaders in sustainability in general. Nonetheless, we have received some wake-up calls. 2012 was a year in which we realized that the conventional methods to overcome pests and diseases, especially the coffee rust in Latin America, was probably not able to contain the same methods. And we need some new actions. And most recently, the pandemic has also created some burdens, especially in the operational costs, logistics for shipping and trading coffee, but also have made us realize the importance of farmers and workers and how we should consider them also as essential workers. Now, although our knowledge is something complete, and this is a quote from the Coffee Barometer 2020, we should not stop ourselves. And something that I really like about this publication is, uncertainty about the outcome is not irrational for inertia. And that is why in Fairtrade, we are promoting different approaches to overcome these challenges, starting from developing and implementing climate action plans, what we call fair adaptation. So we work together with SPOs, smallholder producer organizations, to develop these climate action plans. We also stimulate discussions about sustainable farming methods and how to accelerate climate resilience. We are investing in climate change leadership schools. And my colleagues are going to talk more about this in the coming minutes. We are working closely on areas like living income, living wages, a standardized practice, also human rights and environmental rights to diligence and better carbon credits. We do that with three dimensions in mind. The first one is climate information. We have to take decisions based on evidence and increase our capacities to assess, evaluate, and mitigate risks, but also prevent the events before it happens. We also have to bear in mind that context matters. Each context difference, the same solution will not be suitable for all regions. We have to build that capacity based on our traditional knowledge and rooted that in the capacities of workers and producers. And we have to look back, look beyond the farm, sorry, creating incentives and promoting more, better education and training to accelerate the adoption of practices from a people, profit, planet perspective. Thank you. Very short, but looking forward for the conversation. I'm going to stop here, but looking forward to engage later in the conversation. If you want to reach me, this is my email account. And looking forward. Great. Thanks so much, Juan Pablo. We're looking forward to hearing more about the solutions in the discussion part. Thanks for keeping it brief. Okay. So our next presenter and panelist is Juan Nicolas Hernandez Aguilera, also known as Nico. Nico is a colleague of ours at the IRI, and he's working on the Adapting Agriculture to Climate Today for Tomorrow project, also known as ACT Today, that aims to provide decision-relevant climate information to address hunger, food security, nutrition, and sustainable agriculture, also known as SDG2. So, you know, although coffee is not a food crop per se, like wheat or maize, the income from its production really does play a significant role in the food security of many communities, including Ethiopia, where he's been working with myself and also other partners to develop a dynamic advisory tool called My Coffee Farm. So I don't want to steal Nico's thunder, but yeah, this advisory tool helps farmers and those who support them to make climate-informed decisions and understand the impacts of specific climate events on their pockets and profits. So without further ado, go ahead and start, Nico. Thank you, Amanda. I just want to confirm that you are seeing the full screen. Yes, we are. Okay, perfect. Thank you. So, well, thank you for this opportunity to connect and to discuss this relevant topic. One of the things we can ask this question is climate and respond to this question is climate change putting coffee at risk, but I think more importantly also what does it mean for coffee, for a coffee farmer? So, as you know, coffee is producing what we call the coffee belt between the tropics that provide these optimal conditions that are a combination of elevation, temperature, rainfall, distance to the equator, soil conditions, and all of these conditions affect attributes like yields, quality, and exposure to pests. Coffee species do not tolerate large changes in seasonality and do not flourish in very hot conditions. Besides, coffee requires well-distributed rainfall patterns. Elevation is also, as I mentioned, an important factor. For every 100 meters, temperature decrease on average by 0.6 degrees Celsius. And therefore, you can observe that in some regions that have higher elevations in these tropical zones, you have the cool environments that offer those optimal conditions. Now, studies predict, in general, that suitable coffee cultivation area could drop by 50% by 2050. And these models actually assume a specific representative concentration pathways for RCPs. And what are these RCPs? Basically, it's a summarize a greenhouse gas concentration trajectory adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Those RCPs actually also underline specific socioeconomic pathways that reflect human activity and, consequently, specific greenhouse gas concentrations. And RCP 6, in particular, that predicts that 50% of land will disappear for coffee production, assume that this greenhouse gas concentration peak at 2080. And between 2046 and 2065, the temperature increased around 1.3 degrees Celsius. In general, all of these scenarios implies that it is expected an altitudinal migration of suitable cultivation areas to cooler regions, so basically the highlands. There is limited scope for a latitudinal migration because of the inability to tolerate seasonal temperature changes. The coffee is sensible, as we mentioned, to those changes. And arabica and robusta's limited ability to adapt means that body species will be grown in less suitable climate conditions that also affect exposure to diseases. Now, for some specific cases and regions, there are some works that predict that, especially in Ethiopia, suitable land will disappear between 65% to 38%. Well, there are a lot of studies with different predictions. So, I think that, despite these different models and predictions, still, at this point, there is a significant gap. And you only can have these kind of generalizations that, of course, are important and provide the long-term picture. But at this point, some questions remain. So, what scenario should we consider? If I'm a farmer, what is the scenario that I should trust? Regardless of these scenarios, all of those scenarios agree on the same conclusion. Climate change is definitely a threat. But how farmers and producers can use this information? What means for me as a producer that 50% of land is going to disappear? I'm in, I'm out. Is there any coping strategy that I could implement? And these are the kind of questions that probably can be summarized in this general question. How does long-term scenarios and research affect and inform smallholders, farmers today? And this is very aligned with the Columbia World Projects, an initiative that try to mobilize the university research and scholars to tackle today's global challenges. And one of the major Columbia World Projects is Act Today that actually is focused on this coffee belt area. And four of those Act Today countries actually are main coffee players. And coffee constitutes the main or one of the main sources of income for rural areas and even for the whole country in those countries like Ethiopia, Vietnam, Guatemala, and Colombia. So there have been important advances and a first big step. It refers to the generation and improvements in seasonal and sub-seasonal climate models made by climate scientists at the IRI that produce and generate weather and climate forecasts at timescales of weeks or years that provide information that is more, you know, adaptable to the needs of farmers. In particular, next-gen products. oneikatinho kiloj bills to help something andnot to focus on climate and local exchange and population. we are providing a mutual emotional management and investment strategy, all of the custodians and satellite information. relevant climate information at the spatial and temporal resolution which is required. However, if we really want to go beyond and want to adopt an approach that is not only restricted to the generation of climate and forecasts, we need to focus on what is called climate services. And those climate services initiatives include three additional dimensions which refer to translate, transfer, and use that information. But what is this in reality? So generate can be associated to these climate models, right? And they use basically informed decision making. But let's focus in two dimensions, translate and transfer. So a condition for translate it's basically find a common language. And this common language is not only about the metric system, it's how climate information affect production practices and how those practices actually affect the cost of production and the profitability of farmers. That is probably one of the major sustainability threats. And regarding the media, what is the most effective way to reach millions of farmers with this kind of information? So let's start briefly with the media. Digital tools and mobile services represent an enormous opportunity to reach millions of farmers. Among the poorest 20% in low and middle income countries, 70% have access to mobile phones and one in three people has internet access. Although connectivity prevails in urban settings, it has been progressively spread to rural areas where the ratio of farmers to extension workets exceed 1000 to one. So there is a lot of potential with these tools. Actually, the 2021 GSMA Mobile for Development Foundation's report emphasized that tools intended to enable more climate smart farming and help farmers to respond to variable rainfall and temperatures have a high potential. Although investments in these kinds of tools is still low to moderate. However, digital tools implementation and use is not a simple task. And there are many challenges that actually we are sharing now in this link and this document that you can observe. So just focus in the particular case of an example of Ethiopia. According to the Ethiopia state minister, there are 140 digital services provided in Ethiopia, but the use is low. Existence tools tend to generate information that is not decision relevant to the small holders. And many times the design of the tools is without including Ethiopia's substantial agricultural extension networks and farmers. In our team, one of our members of our team, Ryan Copper, has actually made an interesting assessment of the different tools that exist with coffee tool purposes and they cover different areas. They cover climate, chain management and other kind of aspects. But I think that the big warning and message here is that the development of those digital tools is above quicker than its use. Why is behind the low use of these tools? Well, we need to go in more detail on these tools. We also did this analysis of the current tools. And I think that a very interesting example and a very interesting tool is this tool Acclimatar developed by HRNS and SEAD, which use current 30 and 50 year temperature and rainfall location based prediction and use machine learning to provide a degree of adaptation and suggesting practices to enhance resilience among farmers, especially in Central America. Now, Acclimatar is focused on climate change instead of climate variability and lacks a direct relationship with the specific production processes and practices at the farm level that will tailor adaptation strategies. So still, we need to improve the common language of those tools. And this is what basically we are doing with myCoffeeFarm. So AccuDate team is developing an on-farm advisory tool that integrates that historical climate information with economic data. So we are translating those, that climate information and forecasts and predictions to implications on the production process. And climate risk and production cost estimations are based on the characteristics and the production practices at each farm in different agroecological zones. We use as a base for this work, an initial work that we need to assess the sustainability in economic terms, use cost of production. But basically what we have now is that if we have a particular climate event, we can define a specific thresholds criteria that actually are informed by all of these climate models and see what are the implications on specific activities and specific inputs for a particular farmer. And not only that, but how this climate event not only translate to specific practices, but also what are the adaptation strategies and how these adaptation strategies actually respond in a specific way to those climate events. So in conclusion, what are and what are the future steps? Is climate change putting coffee at risk? Yes, it is. All long-term climate models suggest and conclude that. What does it mean for a coffee farmer? Basically uncertainty. Moreover, current global scenarios, forecast and advisory tools per se are insufficient to reduce that uncertainty. Are required, they provide the long-term picture, but are not sufficient. It is essential to have farmers and local organizations at the core of the diagnosis and the design of adaptation strategies. With MyCoffeeFarm, we continue connecting frontier knowledge of climate scientists with farmers' collective intelligence and needs. Thank you, Amanda, and thank you. All the participants are looking forward for your questions. Thank you so much, Nico. Yeah, it's a good point. You can have the absolute best quality climate information out there, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be accessed and used if it's not in the right format or tailored to different decision makers like those in the coffee sector. Yeah, and another problem is, like you mentioned, is these scenarios are longer term, you know, 50 to 100 years, but that's not the horizon that people make decisions on. You know, we need information that's more in the nearer term. So, thanks for giving us that overview. All right, so we've, of course, heard from Fairtrade International from a global perspective, as well as the IRI from a research and application perspective in Ethiopia. And for our next presentation, we're going to hear from Bernard Mjeroge, who is Fairtrade Africa's senior project officer for coffee, on what kind of work Fairtrade is doing in this space, and particularly related to the Climate Academy work in Kenya. All right, Bernard, feel free to start. Thank you, Amanda. Thank you, Pablos and Nicholas for the presentations that you have given. My name is Bernard Mjeroge. I work with Fairtrade Africa, a senior program officer, and I implemented the Climate Academy project. Actually, officially, it's called the Coffee in Dyer Street program. I request, I cannot see my presentation. I request that you share it. I I hope the others are able to see it. I'm not seeing it. All right, I'm trying to share it. Let me give it another go here. Thank you. I can go to the second slide. Yeah, so the Climate Academy project was designed to enhance resilience to coffee farmers, to climate change and its impact. It was implemented to five produce organizations in Kenya, and this reached or targeted 6,452 males and 3,300 women in the five producer organizations. Go to the next slide. So as we have been told by Nicholas, the climate change in the past, usually coffee drives in a very narrow reach of climatic condition. That is the temperature and the rainfall. These are the conditions that usually enhance the flooring and all the other physiological conditions that are needed in coffee. And therefore, farmers, we realized, have been experiencing problems with climate change, which includes to increase temperature. And this affects the flooring. And once the flooring has been affected, of course, it means that the production will be affected. Therefore, production losses were experienced by farmers due to increased temperatures. Pest and diseases was another problem. And these are pest and diseases that occurred because of change in the climatic conditions, changing temperature or maybe changing rainfall. Of course, they affected as well. The flooring and production became less because of the pest and diseases. Reduced rainfall was another issue, which brought farming and production losses. In general, what you're saying is that climate change usually is not only bring loss of livelihood because once the farmers don't get the required production, they don't get the expected income and livelihood. The profit farmers is affected. The next slide. The next slide. Hello. The next slide. The next slide. Okay. So what are some of the impacts of climate change? You have gone far? Okay. Yeah. What are some of the impacts of climate change? Mostly what you would see to the coffee tree are diseases, pests. And as you can see on the extreme left, we have a healthy coffee plant, coffee tree with a very good production. And on the upper half of that quadrant, we have two diseases, the coffee berry disease. And the coffee berry disease usually comes when you experience rain, especially in the afternoon, then followed by low temperatures. The disease that mostly attack the coffee tree is the coffee berry disease. And if it rains maybe in the morning or in mid morning, then followed by warm weather or higher temperatures, then the coffee may have leaf loss. Then if we have a prolonged dry period during the berry growing period, or even without berry, we'll have drips, as you can see on the lower left quadrant. And on the right lower quadrant. If we have persistent droughts, we'll have the entire crop being affected. As you can see, water stressed coffee on the farm. Go to the other side. So the climate academy, go to the other side, the climate academy brought our addressed the challenges by having several interventions. And one of the things that we did is to create awareness to the farmers, and the farmers were able to understand what is climate change. We would have a situation where the farmers, we would have situation where the farmers didn't know what climate change is, they would say that maybe this is the heart of God. They would give any definition that they had, but they, after the training that we did and the awareness, they were able to know what is real climate change, and how do the farmers contribute to climate change, and other industries to climate change, and they were able to know how do the farmers. And they were able to know how do the farmers impact on the arrival. We did risk and opportunity analysis with the farmers to understand the risks that are posed by climate change, and then what opportunities are there that the farmers can employ, so that they reduce the impacts of climate change. The other slide. The other slide. So the interventions that we did mainly were on sustainable agricultural land management practices on energy and economic diversification. So some of the examples of the sustainable agricultural land management practices we did is on having shade trees to the coffee, and therefore we had several nurses to the different pools. The other side of the local farmers produced the organization that we were implementing the project with, and we were able to give to the farmers over 50,000 of seedlings for, to shade coffee. And of course, we have seen the changes that the shading has done, especially to where we implemented the project first. Then we had a demo training. We established demo fields where farmers were able to be trained through the peer running and having field schools. And these demo trainings were on various dematic areas. So that were, that were, that were, that were very important through the risk and opportunity analysis that we did with the farmers. And therefore we had trainings on soil and water management, how to control the diseases, how to manage the coffee to increase the productivity. As you can see in the next slide, the next slide. That this is a coffee that is well mulch. As you can see the production is good because the, the soil is simple to retain water for a longer period of time. And this helps in the, in the growth of the crop. And therefore this was one of the adaptation strategy that we employed among many other strategies under the sustainable agricultural land management practice to see that the increased production that will be realized after employing, uh, this, um, uh, adaptation strategies will help the farmers, uh, increase their productivity and income at the farm reform. Go to the other slide. The other intervention was on sustainable energy solutions. And the one thing that we realized is that, um, at least above 90% of the household used, um, uh, uh, uh, got the, uh, uh, energy, uh, from firewood. And, um, they were using the traditional, uh, three stone energy stoves to cook, which uses a lot of firewood. The other made sense. Of the ground. So they were using some dairy products did in some plants of firewood, um, ofIO. a lot of firewood, and they were using the Master of Distic орг. That uh. A, they were using the other medication t Uhm, they used to, uh, peas. and we have been using modernPs, which are cerca of 16 takes care of 3 percent of a lot of firewood. So, uh, the, uh, our, um, that we witnessed통 the leaves. Yeah. Uh, 300 bucks Angels, uh, at least 20 to quartering. And so, but a lot of firewood and a wire has three matters that for being hybrid. Uh, ah, there is that, uh, um, uh, we are. Out marketability is coming from a 50th Lam. Um, we couldn't stay Shander. the improved cookstove and that's where we had others that we were able to buy from from artisans outside the project that we gave to the farmers and this cookstove were able to reduce the energy need by around 60 percent then uh a four of the produce organization that are in the central lift of the country we realized that they had a lot of um a lot of cattle and therefore in two produce organization we were able to implement the um the biogas uh units to especially to the uh to to to the women households and uh this biogas came and assisted beyond even how the project was designed because it helped the farmers to increase the milk production and therefore it added another income stream to uh to to the household and as well it provided manure from one of the products byproduct of the biogas as you can see this is a a woman who is happily using biogas to do the cooking in her house and therefore um uh she is able to have more time to attend to other economic activities in the farm other than looking for uh firewood which was taking a lot of time the other slide then the other intervention was on income diversification and we had several income diversification uh for example the beekeeping the pottery um women were provided with the tent we were able to uh provide uh to do um uh horticultural activities as income diversification activities so it depended depended on uh every po what they are able to do and what they are able to support within the region so um basically the climate academy looked at the uh the problems uh and the impacts that are brought by climate change and the interventions that were able to be um um uh maybe where would give the knowledge and that knowledge uh could be transferred to other farmers and other producer organizations not only here in kenya even are close um um to other countries that are within the the region and um what the major outcome that we realized is the climate guide which is a document that the farmers can easily lead and implement the activities uh that uh the runnings that we're seeing from the climate academy so thank you very much i am looking forward to um give more details on um what we did through the climate academy the run is that we got um and uh i would take it back to you amanda okay great uh thanks bernard yeah we talk about uh climate research but there's actually a ton of knowledge um out there in the field with coffee farmers themselves so i'm really glad to see uh the peer-to-peer learning that's going on um and these other solutions you mentioned okay so um our last panelist um it's my pleasure to introduce uh zetti rodich who is a coffee producer from kenya's fair trade certified uh kip kelly and union and uh zetti will be speaking about the growing women in coffee project in which she was involved and has now begun spreading to other communities in the region um so zetti you can uh feel free to start betty are you with us um that he might have some problems connecting okay so if zetti can't connect at this moment um we can try to come back to her when she is able to connect um but in the meantime i think we'll we'll try to move into the questions component and and we'll give zetti an opportunity um to share and speak uh if and when um she can join again um so okay let's let's move into some of the the panel discussion um i'm gonna ask the panelists to please turn their cameras on if they are not on already i will also turn on my video okay all right great thanks so much all right so um when people think about the impacts of climate change you know they're often talking about um the future although in fact the impacts of a changing varying climate are actually already being felt today we could see that um in some of bernard's uh slides so every person on this panel is either um either works with coffee farmers or even is a coffee farmer herself um so the question is is this and i see that zetti's connected again so maybe she can answer this first um the question is in your own personal experience research or work how have you seen climate impacting coffee production and coffee producers themselves you know what does that actually look like um on the ground so hi zetti hi hi um so yeah we were hoping you could explain um you know more about the growing women in coffee project you were involved with and then i was just asking a question about you know how have you seen climate impacting coffee yourself you know as a coffee as a coffee producer yes thank you amanda i'm i'm zeddy rotich i'm a coffee farmer from captain twin farmers cooperative society i'm a board member to women in coffee association i'm also the treasurer to the specialties of our coffee roasters limited and i'm a coffee farmer i own 300 coffee bushes that were gifted to me by my husband and these enable me to be a member of kapungetun fcs i have a membership number i also have a coffee account this enabled me to be a member together with other other women who are members of the same association um hello hello we can hear you yes uh through the climate academy we have been taught on the good agricultural practices we can do it ourselves as women we have been trained on how to prune coffee how to make manure and also apply to the coffee we can make a compost manure and apply to the coffee we've also been taught on how to conserve soil and also water by making terraces um you have you have asked me on the impact of climate change this one has impacted and everyone else has felt the impact of climate change climate change especially to the coffee farmer climate change has impacted on coffee so much that we are beginning to realize low uh coffee production uh the flowering which is was supposed initially would take place twice in a year that is between the months of april and also august flowering now is taking place through the year because of the warm temperatures so yeah because of the warm temperatures another impact of climate change on coffee is that currently the the coffee produced is of low quality because the coffee repain immaturally so yeah we can hear you yes yes yes yes hello we can hear you yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes however we have tried to mitigate on this through the climate change academy for example i want to talk as me zeddy uh to the solution of energy uh to the solution of energy i have biogas which i use for cooking at the same time i also use solar for lighting my house and i have also diversified on income because the process from the coffee comes once in a year and it is waited for so long so there is need for diversification and i've done the same uh i have potty i do potty farming i also have some dairy cows where i get the products from chicken like eggs i sell them and i also sell milk from my cows and get some income i also have a kitchen garden that means i have food security and the supplies from my kitchen garden i sell we use organic manure especially i use organic manure on my kitchen garden because i get the bioslurri i get the bioslurri which is a very good manure i apply on my kitchen garden and the vegetables are doing so well it is a very nice organic manure uh now i want to talk shortly about the the impact of climate change though i have talked about it that we have felt the impact of climate change like we have a prolonged dry spell and women feel it most uh than men why i want to explain that uh sometimes there is a very prolonged dry spell so acute that uh even the the rivers and streams uh die up or yeah try they dry and these women more move to very long distances looking for water that is why i'm saying that it is the women who are feeling the impact of climate change more than than the men uh it is also the women who go very far looking for firewood especially those who don't have the biogas units so they go looking for firewood they go into the forest and that one means it is the destruction of forests which are very important as things for carbon dioxide uh we have also experienced some food shortage at some time when the dry spell prolongs so much and uh it may be accurate to such uh next thing that there is famine yeah thank you thank you zetti appreciate that yeah it's it sounds like you know these impacts are certainly being felt and you know you mentioned uh the flowering stage which is one of the most vulnerable stages um for coffee that's being affected by um climate and particularly um temperature changes and thank you as well for describing you know the income diversification that is an adaptation strategy um in addition to you know the water conservation measures you talked about you know sometimes an adaptation strategy is that you diversify your income towards other things because um you know your main source of incomes you know being threatened of course so um thank you for sharing um for sharing that experience and and especially highlighting um that you know these impacts are not just even across the board that they're actually impacting some people of those people are are women so thanks thanks so much zetti thank you amanda yeah thank you um i also wanted to um ask this question uh to nico um you know in your experience and research you know how have you seen or uh you know researched or or you know um seen in the literature you know climate impacting coffee production and coffee producers um i think nico shared a bit of evidence from his his presentation actually yeah well amanda first of all i really enjoy bernard and said his presentation uh and i think that this connect very well and uh with what we are talking about and is that we have good science out there we have improvements amazing improvements in the possibilities to connect with farmers but we need to make that connection stronger and better so that thing that is happening at the research perspective which is the side that i'm working now and that knowledge that is a you know shared by communities and that is reinforced through these initiatives like these a climate academies and all of these knowledge has to connect at some point uh not only to inform general practices but even to provide more customized recommendations according to the economics and the particular conditions and the specific context of each farmer so all of those uh practices that you were mentioning also need to be translated and connected with the forecast modeling and with all the science that that is happening and i think that this is i mean the conditions are there and and and and i was mentioning incredible tools that are outside i think that also on that a path we need to work on what has been done and not replicate things but actually take advantage of a potential partnerships and alliance that take advantage of knowledge and shared knowledge to move on that direction in a more systematic way and to improve the advice and that connection between the global conditions and the farm conditions so i think that yeah eventually research generate pathways even a guide policies and it's important to have both perspectives a link it and connect it okay great yeah i agree and and thank you nico for that um so the next question i'm going to ask and and zeddy actually um did answer part of this uh from the gender lens is you know are the impacts of climate on coffee that we all are just have just been talking about are they being disproportionately felt by some farmers for example women or smallholders or uh areas of the world i'm thinking you know africa developing countries more than others are these impacts being felt evenly are there some people or some areas that are feelings impacts more than others and then you know what are the implications of that for a morning cup of coffee and what are the implications of um that for for social social justice and um i don't know i was thinking maybe bernard um you could perhaps discuss you know this this problem affecting you know african countries or smallholders who are you know smallholders who are you know particularly vulnerable um and what this means this means for their livelihood i don't know if you want to expand on these things okay okay um i think i would say yes i would say uh that's it is yes yes i don't know depending on how you look at it uh number one everybody is feeling the effect the impact of climate change because here at the production level what we need is good production that will assure the farmers a good income and at the consumption level what the consumers need is a cup of coffee and of course a cup of coffee that is made from quality beans and therefore if the uh the coffee is not available and then the cup will be more costly but on the other hand i would say uh from maybe some publication that i have agreed uh that um um the consuming world may be having ability to buy i may not not everyone may be able to understand what the farmers are experiencing and that is one area where uh the disproportionate um impact may come in then um looking at the production systems that we have the small holders will feel the impact of climate change more than the large scale um uh uh holders because the resources are not the same the small holders do not have the resources to adapt and mitigate climate change they don't have the resources to do irrigation they do not have even enough money or if they are not earning from the income realized from their farm uh to maybe educate their children uh the uh the income maybe for good health and therefore the impact to the small holders is more remember most of the small holders at least over 80 percent rely on weather and therefore when there is climate change they are not able to um to have a division uh um uh maybe application of water or maybe interventions because they do not have um uh the resources then zeb has put it uh very well about the gender now uh when there is prolonged drought and especially here in africa in kenya especially the woman um um or the females uh the mothers uh the mothers will feel it more than uh the male counterparts because naturally they are the natures of their family in kenya it's the women um and especially in where we are implementing the project the women are the one who go to look for firewood they look for for water and therefore if the rivers cannot supply the water that is needed at household if the water sources dry up it is the women who will go far too for those resources if there is no firewood within the uh uh or allowed their house it's the women who will go far therefore depending on how you look at it i would say actually it there's a lot of uh disproportionate impact and uh but on the other heart everybody those that are consuming coffee those that are producing coffee those that are in supply chain they feel the impact of chain where you consider the issues of quality and where you consider the issues of quantity thank you okay great um thank you thank you for that that really really detailed answer um from bernard um so yeah we we've seen that you know this is going to affect women um more than men uh this is certainly going to affect small holders um who have you know less resilient capacity and um um yeah i i want to ask nico as well if he has he has anything to add um you know on this question about yeah whether the impacts are going to be felt unevenly yeah sure i want to emphasize bernard point of resources and the investments required and um the relationships are in some way clear but we need to quantify we need to translate these to numbers not only to inform farmers but even to inform ngos and all the industry and stakeholders the coffee stakeholders about what are the concrete steps in order to move forward so that's why we insist in the translation of all of this climate information uh to concrete and specific numbers quantities and and even amounts of money required to to make those investments um and definitely the social uh you know impact of coffee is clear 80 of this product is produced by small holders in countries that are affected by violence that are affected by a hard economic situations and and the dynamics that are happening there are not only and not only have implications for those countries but global consequences so one of these links that of course has a lot of a you know a sides but definitely climate wars the situation could be migration right a lot of farmers that don't have the opportunities and don't see a possibilities there so it is important to once again and i insist and clarify those those connections those links and and those resources that that bernard is talking about to to to effectively a find strategies and not only the theories about the potential impacts of climate change because actually it's happening and it's affecting lives yeah that's certainly right thank you nico yeah and one one note i also want to add um just related to ethiopia because that's where i work is that you know ethiopia is the cradle of genetic diversity for arabica coffee and so you know when we talk about climate impacting coffee in ethiopia it's it's it's very it's very serious um especially in terms of um safeguarding genetic diversity which we haven't mentioned to this point so i i do want to mention uh that point as well so i i want to move on to our next question and and it's related to uh social justice all right so fair trade has just released a report on uh human rights violations in global supply chains including um that is that of coffee we can try to put the link um in the chat but in that report there is a quote by former secretary general uh von ki-moon who has said climate change is intrinsically linked public health food and water security migration peace and security it is an issue of social justice human rights and fundamental ethics okay so i want to ask the you know the fair trade team what exactly are the human rights violations and issues at play in the coffee supply chain right now and how is climate change making these issues uh better uh or worse so i think yeah either one pablo or bernard can try to answer these sure maybe i can start and bernard can jump in um and thank you for the for the question um and realizing this maybe we have to start by putting the elephant in the room and is that the market is not functioning in the way they should or in a fair way and if you look back uh the statistics of coffee you see that the global value of uh of international coffee trade represents between 200 250 billion uh us dollars per year but only 10 of that stays as a value created in producing regions and those producing regions uh you i'm also incorporating the big ones no brazil vietnam big producers and if you go one step further and and look into the statistics how much of that is invest reinvested in sustainability is 0.00 something no it's very minimum the the real contribution of the entire market the entire value uh generated annually now that comes uh back to uh why we are trapped in this each context is different yes i i mentioned that in my presentation the politics uh matters the culture matters the way we uh can create more resilient approaches also matters the governance for instance in support of local governments in promoting better efficient measures matters and as we have said finance finance also matters but what we are seeing is that if the market doesn't respond then this type of uh sectors copy the biggest example uh it's in a way being subsidized by poverty and this is the first uh the the strongest burden that uh smallholder farmers are confronting um so a friend of mine used to say that is kind of a uh if you're poor you're more competitive something like that no and that tends to move in the different contexts of the regions and you can see cases where um children don't go to school but they because they need some sort of labor in the farm and that is a violation of the right of the children to to to to be educated or you can also see cases where forest is being cut off to increase the extension of land because productivity is not enough so you have to increase lands and go into the forest causing deforestation which is another violation you can see you can see these cases of uh forced labor and not dry conditions for workers which is another violation as nico was saying in some cases people is forced to migrate because they cannot see a living uh condition in their in their cities and their communities so so all these aspects needs to be incorporated and also uh that is why if that's where we try to uh move one step beyond to understand those risks risks and come up with uh remediation analysis due to created the diligence that is required to understand and prevent and avoid that this type of human rights violations happens and the other strategy that is very strong in our um areas of work is try to stimulate discussions around what is the living income of a farmer what should be the benchmark uh we do know we do have a minimum federal price for our products and we know that sometimes that's not enough so we have to re-establish uh these negoci these conversations about traders and producers to establish benchmarks that allows a living income and a dignity in livelihood for farmers and if you want to uh add and complement my words yeah i think pablo you have said it very well and um maybe to echo what you have seen i'll base it on um um uh one and something i read from uh ghanian business um uh news uh for march uh this year and um it was written that in 2014 africa exported coffee worth six billion dollars and the same coffee was funded and it was worth 100 billion dollars so you can see there is a social injustice that the producer who is investing a lot including sacrificing himself and herself is earning very little and sometimes um the legal systems that we have um in the source countries for coffee encourage uh that because sometimes they do not encourage the periodation and the consumption of coffee um uh maybe at home but whatever the case whether we have consumption at home or we don't have consumption at home i believe it is a response it is the responsibility of the entire function right from the production to the consumption to make sure that everyone benefits from um um from the coffee from the the entire chain that uh the farmer needs to feel dignified by good income that comes from coffee and it is the responsibility of the um uh the the the the the the the publishing that are above the farmers to see that they eliminate or they give a a a a good payment to uh to to the farmers in most cases and especially here in Kenya the farmers do not decide how much their coffee is going to cost and uh therefore they do not have much say um well the system is changing and i want to uh uh thank what uh the trainings and the decision that are featured is doing to the farmers so that the farmers and light and talk um uh what they need to do so that at least they feel that coffee is a good is giving good value to them but however uh the supply chain needs to be evaluated and checked and if you need to come in and see how will the farmers uh feel that surely coffee is a crop that is able to eliminate them well yes um fair trade premium is one of the tools that is supposed to address that um and i think the markets need to be encouraged that they need to uptake more of fair trade coffee in fair trade terms because in the country for example here in Kenya uh about 20 percent of all the production is the one that is sold at the fair two returns the rest is uh not so that appear to terms and therefore i think that um there is that social injustice because once the farmers are economically hard cut because of what they are doing then they will be demotivated and we have seen it um some of the farmers um there are some farmers who have uprooted the coffee trees because they feel it is not yielding enough now when we have climate change then the problem is even becoming more that the market is not able to address some of uh the farmers needs um and then the climate change as well complicates the problem uh by reducing the production and the quality that the farmer of the coffee that the farmer is putting on the market thank you great thank you very much for that those answers from both of you um for our last question um it's it's about solutions you know we've been talking a lot about the problem we've been talking a little bit about solutions um but this this last question um is about you know what can be done and some people have asked you know in in the q a as well what can be done on an individual policy or industry level to address these issues and what do you see if you had to choose what do you see as the single biggest gap standing in the way of adaptation for coffee farmers is it awareness education tools research policy is it some of these things all of these things some more than the other so it's a question i'd like all of our panelists to answer but um if they can you know try to keep your answer a bit brief because there are you know three or four questions we'd like to answer from the audience as well um i don't know who wants to take it away first what is the single biggest gap or challenge standing in the way of adaptation for coffee farmers in your opinion if i may i can start and maybe my colleagues can can jump in but uh all the environmental leaders agree more or less that there are three main things that you we have to better mind to overcome climate change we need a an institutional reform try to understand different how our institutional norms mobilize more resources uh to invest and pay for the transition because as nico said and also bernard said and and and and said farmers cannot take from all all the burden the financial burden and the third is using nature to uh deal with the climate challenges and the biodiversity challenges you know diversification diversification of income nature-based solutions these are things that we can stimulate but again we need to do that in a new institutional framework and uh mobilizing the resources for doing so um if anyone can uh jump into uh i'll be pleased to be in the discussion yeah i agree with juan paolo i'm sorry bernard go ahead bernard go ahead oh okay okay thank you yeah um i i i i don't want to add uh uh to say um uh to repeat what uh pablo has said um but i think uh among us the produce uh the producers the peer running um uh or the field schools or awareness uh has yielded results and um i would see beyond the producers i think this awareness should as well go to uh along the supply chain to the consumers because the big question is is the consuming world aware of what is happening um maybe uh there's somebody who can afford uh the cup um but uh so that they're able to support in bridging um uh this gap i think awareness should be made across the entire uh supply chain so that that obligation and that responsibility will be there across the supply chain to see that everybody is supported the producers are supported the transporters are all the entire supply chain the uh um uh the the roasters the bledders and even the consumers so that this cup will always be available and the producers will be happy at the end of the day thank you thank you so much yes and and and actually i was planning to mention that aspect as well bernard of the consumers and all the stakeholders in the value change that awareness that is required and also i was a mentioning during my presentation the importance of media that media can be used as well as a way to to improve that a communication channel that transparency between the different stakeholders and also emphasize that those the solutions are context-based so there can be some recommendations as the use of shade ground coffee and so on but the economic and the market conditions has to be a clear in order to facilitate those transitions and yeah that's i think that more the most specific things related with your question great all right so unless anyone else wants to add to that i think we can try to get to some of these questions in the chat there's been a few more in the last few minutes um so we'll start with a question from um francesco from the iri uh the question is what do the panelists think are the most important considerations for consumers or addicts such as himself when making decisions about coffee beans that he or we can buy for home use uh he also asks um zetti if it's possible to buy her beans in the us um you know for those interested in supporting uh women smallholder farmers for example uh can i air trade or nico yeah yeah yeah go ahead so i i think that uh yeah this is a very important question actually we recently published a paper when we were a basically trying to understand how consumers were aware of the of some labels that actually communicate to consumers some a support that farmers can receive for fair trade practices or a conservation practices or even for particular production systems like shade grown coffee that provide habitat for migratory birds and and and and consequently a there is a this label the switzerland and beer friendly are for our surprise a many consumers are not aware of this kind of a of of a you know traditional market instruments to communicate that support to farmers so i think that it's important to improve the knowledge of this but not only traditional ways to do it i think that i want to emphasize as we were mentioning that media and new ways to communicate can also improve that process and and and and also there is a lot of consumers that once they understand all of those connections all those interactions want to definitely support a farmers and and and practices that that contribute to the solution so a i will basically summarizing improve education and awareness at the consumer side as as bernard was mentioning and also use a the use of a new ways and new media and new technologies to improve a trustability and transparency in the whole value chain and great thanks for that thanks for response nico um yes sorry yeah go ahead go ahead yes yeah no just just to make it very simple and also with my heart of coffee addict um just ask yourself where this coffee comes from what is the origin how it was produced how how it's ended up in the cup in front of coffee uh as a consumer asking that is a very first step to to move ahead great yes being conscious of these things is really very important um okay so there's another interesting question in the chat i'm not sure if i don't know the answer yeah there was something that you asked it has not been answered whether uh it is possible to get the coffee uh from the women daddy yeah and women yes yes i maybe i can support them to answer that and i'll say yes um um um we drew fair to africa and uh as well through the society the cooperative that is supporting the women coffee uh you can get that coffee uh it is grown by women and processed by women and therefore it's purely women um um uh women uh women coffee uh therefore it is possible it is we are as well supporting uh the zawadi women to value add the uh uh their coffee and therefore uh very soon uh there will be uh roast that will be available or maybe um uh the ground roast uh that will be available uh for local and export markets thank you all right great thanks so much so there's there's your answer by fair trade um all right so uh one of the questions in the chat which is an interesting one is um is is climate change affecting arabica and robusta equally um i i don't know if nico from a research research perspective knows the answer to this i mean i know they're impacting you know both yes these varieties but both of yeah all these varieties have their own optimal climate conditions but all the scenarios that we were mentioning are predicted to affect both arabica and robusta a robusta is more sensible to a temperatures but in general it is expected that a climate affect a both of those varieties okay great um all right so the next question and then i think we'll be able to get them all uh there's only a couple more is uh you know what is your opinion um on you know that other coffee beans other than arabica and robusta such as forgotten beans which can grow in warmer conditions could help future-proof coffee production against climate change so the question is you know how much potential you know is there in in these other coffee varieties um and i know that you know there's some ancient varieties very old varieties that that might be more suited to a warmer climate can anyone speak to speak to this is there hope with this is it is it a solution uh well i'm not genetist but um maybe to explain the varieties a little bit there's two main families the arabicas and the robustas and but those are the families that we know that has been explored and and produce and to a scale but definitely there's a lot of heirlooms and wild species in bushes especially in ethiopia but we need more science to understand how we can transform those wild species into more domesticated production systems so that i mean what i'm trying to say is that there's significant gaps in how to understand the genetics and the behavior of those crops and yes you can produce with wild species and probably the cup will have amazing taste but uh it will be difficult to scale that out with without the right uh understanding on how it will perform in the future now uh based on the world of arabicas there's so many uh sub varieties that that is where most people have been experimenting try to make hybrids to understand more resistant varieties so to some best diseases and some kind of conditions and this is one of the strategies that people um and organization has been promoted uh as one of the uh other uh climate adaptation practices understand the seeds and understand which seeds are more resistant to the different conditions of your microclimate and also which one will give you uh the three elements no quality in the final cup resistance to best diseases and productivity and i just want to mention amanda that recently some researchers from the uk working with communities in sierra leone rediscovering some varieties that apparently are a climate resistance and also keep some quality properties but even those areas that definitely has to be a you know continue that research on that aspect as well also need to connect with the farmers aspect so this is not about the sustainability of a plant this is about the sustainability of a production system that involves communities so even if you have those amazing discovery discoveries uh that by the way it comes from a tradition and and and and and you know and local knowledge as well um it is important to uh to see how that how it's possible to implement those kind of transitions and what are the concrete mechanisms to facilitate uh and and improve the the the the ways as farmers can do it okay great yeah and i think go ahead yes um i'll say in kenya we have two varieties um uh that have been produced by our research uh coffee research institute and uh the two varieties are resistant to coffee berry disease and uh leaf lust and uh leaf lust and um uh just like nicola said the issue is supporting the uptake of the skills and the knowledge and to make sure that the supply is not interrupted so um we need to give a lot of support to the research institute and as well to the producers so that they um they take the skills they take the uh the new varieties and uh then research to be done what is the impact on quality uh maybe the new varieties uh uh we'll have thank you okay great unless um anyone's anything to add i think we're going to have to stop here we're over time um so i just want to thank um all of our panelists uh for their very insightful answers and also to the audience for posing very good and very thoughtful questions we've definitely covered a lot of ground in the past 60 minutes or so but whether you're a coffee drinker or not i hope you have at least you know some appreciation now for the crop um and its importance for livelihoods and you know especially for women and i hope as well uh that you have a better understanding of how climate is affecting coffee um as well as the human rights that are at play within the sector and what you might do you know as a consumer to mitigate some of those challenges and and support adaptation um on multiple levels so yeah conversations like these are just super important not just for raising awareness of the problem you know like we have um uh problems like climate change that confront coffee production and livelihoods but they're also really important for sharing really good and evidence-based solutions to address these problems and i hope you've um you know learned a bit today about some of those uh from our panelists so if you'd like to continue this conversation and remain in the loop with the developments you know in the coffee climate space you can head over to social media you can follow fair trade and the iri um or you can feel to feel free to drop us an email i know some of our panelists share their emails already i'm happy to share mine in the chat um as well but other than that um everyone has a beautiful day and has a beautiful day and a weekend thank you bye thank you bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
