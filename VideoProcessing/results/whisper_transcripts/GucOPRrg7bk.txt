 Your cannabis plants need more than just water and light to thrive. They need a variety of nutrients. They particularly include nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, the NPK you often see on fertilizer labels. But that's not all. They need trace elements like calcium and magnesium, which are essential for plant health. When feeding your plants, it's important to use a well-balanced fertilizer designed for cannabis. But remember, less is more. It's easier to add more nutrients later than to remove an excess which can harm your plants.
