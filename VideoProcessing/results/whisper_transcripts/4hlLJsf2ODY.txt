 Frightening moments caught on camera in Jefferson, Iowa. An explosion in fire at a grain elevator. Now this happened northwest of Des Moines at Landis Cooperative. Amazingly, no one was injured in the explosion. Landis says smoldering grain in a self-contained bin next to the grain elevator caused it. This video was captured on security cameras at a neighboring business, which tells us the fire is still smoldering.
