 Hi in this video I'm taking a look at fundamentals for soft commodities now soft commodities are going to be grains livestock just think agricultural products so for example if you are interested in trading the wheat markets you would need to know what the outlook is for the wheat crop worldwide but the largest mover without a doubt is going to be the USDA the United States Department of Agriculture and you can see here on the website that I'm on USDA.gov is their official address and here you can pull down quite a bit of information it tells you all about the USDA but for traders they're really going to be interested in certain reports so you click on agency reports tells you the release dates of reports coming up which of course is very important and in this particular case it's the the coming week and I'll tell you what's coming out so for example let's say that you decided that you wanted to trade cattle there is a announcement on Friday and give you an idea of what the cattle markets might do there are obviously plenty of other markets that you can get involved in and there's some pretty obscure reports like sweet potatoes and sugar beets which you're not going to trade but nonetheless it is there you can go to latest releases and some of these are going to affect the market some of them are just going to be the USDA business in general that being said you can look for various releases that may affect the markets that you want to trade and as you can see there is a lot to glean from these websites the most important ones of course are going to be the ones that you go and you look and you see in case you missed it and it gives you the results this gives you the results in a PDF format and of course news stories it also will tell you how much there's a podcast available how much was produced in wheat and corn etc and that is exactly what you're looking for you're looking for things such as you know how much is the wheat market going to be affected by supply is there an oversupply of wheat are the the wheat crops doing well if they're doing well and they're doing very well then an oversupply should drive down price on the other hand if there's been a drought it's possible that we would have issues with supply and that of course brings up the price of such things as wheat corn whatever you know so it is a definitely a website that you need to look at not every week is going to have your particular announcement you could be looking at you know wheat next week or maybe it's three weeks down the road but nonetheless you do need to get an idea of what's going on in the markets as far as supply and demand and that gives you the opportunity to project longer term trades production agriculture you know you can see what the production has been you know what the USDA is doing to help expand that and get results sooner or later you get the ability to get an idea of where price should go if there's a lot of pressure then obviously you want to own that commodity on the other hand if it seems like there's more than enough obviously it might be something you want to short short you
