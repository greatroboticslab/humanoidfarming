Howto & Style
 It's asparagus season. If you don't grow it but have a place in your garden, this is a great perennial to grow because it's super easy. Let's start picking some. Asparagus grows from the root every spring. We cut it off and it starts growing out these beautiful stalks. When asparagus is the size of a lead pencil or bigger, this is a little small, this is perfect, you want to start cutting it. If they are too small like this little guy, that means this root is not ready to be picked from. So you want to leave this asparagus so that root it is coming from gets stronger and stronger and eventually produces bigger pieces of asparagus. Once you have an established patch, it usually takes around three years to start picking once you plant it. It will start having beautiful pieces of asparagus that you can cut all spring long, usually until June or through June. And at that point, they're going to start getting smaller and you want to let the roots go and let it come up and just become a big shrub. That's when it starts getting all its energy, making its roots stronger for the next year so you can start picking asparagus again. It's super healthy. It's delicious. Just roast it, use it however you want, but grow asparagus. It's really fun.
