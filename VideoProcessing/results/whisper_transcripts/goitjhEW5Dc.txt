 You won't believe how Thai farmers grow grapes. They dig long ditches and plant grapevines along the banks. These ditches are always filled with water to keep the roots cool and hydrated, even during the hot summer. Sprinkler machines keep the grapes fresh by spraying water repeatedly. And here's the twist. Farmers pick grapes using boats floating in the ditches. After harvesting, the grapes are pressed into clay cakes, cooked and sold in a totally local old-school style. It's a smart and unique way to farm grapes that you probably haven't seen before.
