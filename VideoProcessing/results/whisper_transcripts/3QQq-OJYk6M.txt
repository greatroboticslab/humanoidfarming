 This is a very nice repair manual for farm machinery. The book is in what appears to be great condition but if you look here it's not exactly straight so you know who knows where it's been sitting over the years it seems to be a little little crooked like it's been sitting in a stack but other than that the book is chock full of pictures, tractors, and whatever else that goes along with the manual. I hope you like this manual and this will give you an idea of what's in the book. I notice nobody likes to do that they don't like you to see what the book's about and because you haven't seen it is why you want to buy it so we here at Sincereoctions have a video format where you can actually get a decent idea you know like I say what you're buying so check out our other videos make us an offer we're ready to sell thank you very much for seeing another since the auction
