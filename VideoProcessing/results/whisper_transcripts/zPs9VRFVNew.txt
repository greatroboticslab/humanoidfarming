 A couple weeks ago you saw me build a raised garden bed so today we are filling it. I'm starting with old scrap cardboard as a base to block weeds from growing up and watering that in with very pathetic water pressure. Then I'm throwing in old logs and watering those in as well. These will break down nicely over time and take up a lot of space to save money on soil. The next layer is pine tree trimmings and there is a debate on if pine needles belong in a garden bed because of their acidity level. But these are going to be so deep in the bed I'm not too worried about it. And it's also the scraps I have on hand so this is what I'm using. Last I'm mixing in a 50-50 blend of topsoil and compost and watering in each layer until the bed is nice and full and ready to be planted in.
