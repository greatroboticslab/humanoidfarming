 what's going on guys welcome back to boat our Kiko's this is Josh what we got going on today is I'm gonna give you some tips on do's and don'ts on building the fence the most probably the initial cost is the most expensive cost when it comes to building a fence you're gonna you're gonna pay up you're gonna pay some money because goats cost to keep in and you want to have a good fence system to keep your goats in and I'm gonna tell you what it's expensive so when I first got goats what I did was I had a this place had some field fence on it on a little bit of it so I thought you know what I can add a little bit and I can section off a place and I can start having goats I can get the goats here and they can kind of clean up my place and make it look nice so the first fence I built was horrible I'm telling you it was horrible and I still have it to this day I'm gonna show you guys and these are some don'ts don't do this when it comes to building fence so I hate to show you guys this but this is the honest to God truth right here this is the first fence I built I'll show you right now some of the fence that was here on this place and then I added this right here so this was my first fence I built and yes these are not these were not concreted in the round treated post that I had somebody give to me and somebody give me the wire and this is what it'll look like if you don't put in a good brace to brace to you're gonna have a lean to it and this fence right here it just rolls it's not tight it's not tight at all it sags and it's just really not a good fence at all and I wanted to get goats here so this was my first fence that I built all right so the first fencing that I went out and bought I went out and bought some it was it was a good brand but it was not made for goats and the reason why I bought that was was to save some money and that was a mistake I bought some bigger as for cows it's kind of like a field fence it was made by stay tough and stay tough is a really good fencing brand and I didn't put the extra money in it and get the goat wire like I should have I bought what would hold a cow in and that was a mistake let me show you the fencing that I bought and kind of goat younger goats can crawl in and out of it and I'll show you some adjustments that I've had to make so they won't get their head stuck so this is the fence right here and you can see that I mean it's several inches wide it's tall and a goat can easily stick their head in there and a baby can crawl through there so what I've had to do is I've had to make some adjustments because I made a mistake when I bought when I did my first fence I had to go in here and add some cattle panels down here to kind of break up the gap not so much and that's kind of help with the goats getting their head stuck in the fence what I did was I cut the corner I tried to save some money and buy a little bit cheaper fence thinking it would work and it was just a mistake it was not good I need to really what I need to do is this whole fence row right here this whole cross fence right here it needs to be taken out and a new one needs to be added because I skimmed on the price and bought the cheaper fence now this right here this it's probably a I'm gonna say it's about three acre pasture and this was the first pasture that I sectioned off for goats so when I did that and I realized the mistakes that I was making I started to buy the better fence so here was the second pasture that opened up and I bought goat wire this time you can see it's a red brand goat wire I mean my fists just barely will fit through there a goat is not going to get its head stuck in there it's really good fencing it cost a little more it's well worth it because you don't have to worry about that goat getting its head stuck when you pay up and buy the better fence you don't have to worry about that so so you can see in this on this cross fence that's got the good wire on it I put up a good H brace these braces are standing up straight they've been in the ground for about four years now five years and I put them in concrete they're about two and a half three foot down in the ground they're treated and they it holds tight they have not moved at all I've got these posts right here these round treated posts I've got them in the ground you can see they're in concrete and they're they're tight they're they're in there and that's what kind of holds this fence up what I do is I'll put a put a top strand barbed wire and then I'll put another barbed wire right here that a way it can prevent predators from coming over on the bottom strand I'll show you right here I will go in and put a barbless wire at the bottom and I'll go ever so often and you'll see right here this ring right here I'll put them rings in there and that'll hold this fence to the ground you are not going to get that fence up a predator ain't going to come underneath it and the goats not going to get underneath it so doing that helps hold that fence secure top wire will help prevent something going over it and then that bottom wire will help keep it stay down you just buy them little hog clamps clamp it to your your goat wire so on this place when we got it it had some field fence on it and I just used that field fence I used what I had I didn't put brand new fencing on the perimeter and here's kind of what it looks like it don't look good but this is what it is here is some old field fence and I've had to come in and use cattle panels to help tighten it up a little bit help secure some spots that goats could get out of so let's show you this so here is an old field fence you can see I mean it's the hole in it plenty big and you can tell on this fence at spots it's not very high off the ground so what I had to do is I had to come in here and I had to add cattle panels to stiffen this fence up I don't want my goats getting out getting in other people's property so you can see in certain areas where this fence is bad I had to come in and make some adjustments and kind of make it where the goats can't get out what I'm anticipating is I think this tree this old tree right here it's going to eventually fall and when that tree falls I intend on putting a brand new fence up so this fence has been here for a long time and I wanted to expand my little three acre when I first started with goats I want to expand my pastures so I knew that the field fence was there it was going to be okay I just added stuff to it to make it more goat friendly I guess you could say it's where it's going to keep the goats in it's going to keep it from going over it don't look the best and it's not perfect but it works here's a spot you can see the fence is up high and good and then you just go right down here and you can tell where the fence is broken it's falling down I've had to make several pieces with panels to kind of fix holes you can see down this whole fence row right here I cut a cattle panel about two and a half foot and stuck it at the top because of how bad this old existing fence was sagging so here's some good things about cattle panels cattle panels are pretty you know they're they're not too overpriced they're about 16 bucks and you can take that panel and you can automatically have your fence you can fix a hole you can put up a pretty quick fence and here's what I did with cattle panels across my pond so I got these cattle panels going across this pond right here and it works out it works out pretty good so on the back side of my place there was just like a five strand barbed wire and I utilized cattle panels to go ahead and put on top of that barbed wire and back here in the back I got about 15 acres and I use some cattle panels and then in other places I use just whatever I could get my hands on field fence uh goat wire if I had an extra piece and let me show you kind of how cattle panels really will help you out and they work so you can see this right here is just an old barbed wire fence and I went in here and I put up cattle panels so I've got the cattle panels on the existing fence when the goats first come on this place it was so growed up you couldn't even walk through here hardly and I'll show you now you can see through here um there's a lot of room you can move around if I had to replace the fence I've got the room now before you couldn't hardly get through it was it was a job just getting these cattle panels up all right so I'm kind of standing down here in this little little creek bottom and up there is where the fence is up there so here it had the barbed wire this is my neighbor's property right over here had the five strand older barbed wire and what I did was I come in here with whatever fencing material I could get a hold of so up here you'll see that there is some goat fence up here this right here is goat wire that little bitty 4x4 so I took a piece and this is a little crossing area right here I don't know if you can see but I took some cattle panels and I cut these cattle panels up and I made it to where the goats couldn't get out of this area right here and you'll see right over here I did the same I'm six foot tall so you can see right here that this fence it's probably eight foot tall as eight foot tall is how high that is and it went straight across but I had to adjust this little valley right here where this water comes down into this little dry creek bed and you can see how I added all these little pieces to keep a goat in so using cattle panels can be very beneficial they can help secure a place where you can't get that fence tight through and and some goalies washouts you can put a cattle panel up all right so I'm out of the low area and me using what I had allowed me to open up more ground for my goats so I knew I had good pastures back here um and I wanted to get the goats on it so me uh putting field fence on top of barbed wire um putting cattle panels up on top of barbed wire that really helped me move along a lot quicker in my fencing process and uh it allowed me to open up more pastures for my goats so right here is the perimeter fencing and it's barbed wire and again I used what I had here to open up more ground so here's some field fence I bought I think it was about a hundred bucks for a 330 foot row I got this and I put it on top of the barbed wire I would roll it out stretch and then tie it roll it out stretch and tie it it's really tight and then right here is a piece of goat fence goat wire that I used um that I had an extra part of a roll so I used that all along here I just wanted to do a little walk around my place and show you some of the things that I've done uh maybe that's something that you could do to yours some things that I would do I would buy goat wire make that investment spend the extra money get the goat wire it's for goats and you don't have to worry about them problems later on down the road when you're building a fence go ahead and uh put that top strand on put that strand at the bottom get them hog clamps clamp your uh wire that tight wire to your field fence it'll make sure it don't roll up or something can't go underneath it and the top wire can can prevent something from coming over it so every new fence on this property it gets goat wire if I build a fence cross fence or if I have to replace a fence I put brand new goat wire on it um and I learned that lesson the hard way I try to save some money on a different type of fencing that I thought would work and it just didn't so I hope that you picked up on something in this video um maybe it'll help you out when it comes to building your fence uh appreciate you guys watching uh if you're not subscribed please subscribe to
