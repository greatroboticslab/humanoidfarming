 Let's learn about the life cycle of a pumpkin. Did you know that the life cycle of a pumpkin has five stages? The seed, the sprout, the flowering vine, the green pumpkin, and then finally, the orange pumpkin, which we all love to pick, cook, and eat. What comes first in the life cycle of a pumpkin? Let's find out. The first stage of the life cycle of a pumpkin is the seed. A seed must be planted in soil to grow a new pumpkin. It takes 10 days for a pumpkin seed to germinate or sprout.

True leaves appear about one week after the sprout breaks through the soil. What comes next? The third stage in a pumpkin's life is the flowering vine. Pumpkin vines can grow up to six inches each day. The flowers appear on the vines about halfway through the growing season. The pumpkin vine is covered with male and female flowers. The male and female flowers pollinate to form fruit. What happens next in the life cycle of a pumpkin? Ooh, it's the green pumpkin! The fourth stage in the life cycle is the green pumpkin. Once pollination occurs, the female blossom or flower closes. A small green fruit will appear on the base of the flowers. This fruit will become a pumpkin. What happens next in the life cycle of a pumpkin? It's the fifth stage and we have a mature pumpkin, which is the final stage of a pumpkin's life. This is the orange pumpkin that we know and love. It takes 45 to 55 days for a pumpkin to mature after pollination. During the last few weeks of the growing season, the pumpkin reaches its final size and turns orange.
