 Do you want to grow potatoes but you don't have the room? Have no fear, a garden tip's here. You can actually grow potatoes in containers. And what's really neat about it, you can grow so many potatoes in such a small amount of space. But here's the trick. When you're planting your potato, do not fill the container up all the way. Add a small layer of garden soil or compost at the very base. And then plant your potatoes. Oh, and make sure they're seed potatoes or they have the little eyes coming out. Once you plant them, just give it a few days and before you know it, you're going to start seeing some growth. And as your potato plant continues to grow, continue adding soil. I continue filling it up until the new growth is all that's left poking out. And as it grows, you just keep adding more and more soil in until you reach the top. Too much moisture in the soil can lead to rotting potatoes. I recommend using a well-draining potting mix and pots that have good drainage as well. What's even more neat about this way of growing is it makes harvesting so easy. When your potatoes are ready to harvest, you just dump the bucket out and find your potatoes.
