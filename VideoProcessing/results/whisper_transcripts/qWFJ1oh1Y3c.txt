 Oh yeah! Next on today's agenda is, well that was a bust. He laid down. Never a dull moment here, is it? Gonna break it. Sure is the world. I don't know how happy this makes my heart right here. Y'all, look what has happened in the last 30 minutes. The sun has come out for the first time in four days and it feels like the air has just been flushed. There's a breeze. It's a little cooler. It's amazing. The storms all went around us. No tornadoes, not even a drop of rain. Well, maybe a drop, but not many drops. So, I'm doing something I haven't been doing and I took the dogs for a walk after supper and the calves just let me know that they also needed supper. I almost forgot. I just happened to think it was so windy out there. That video I took of us putting up the sign. It might not have, it might not have taken very well because of the wind. Okay, baby. They're only getting mud in there. I should have dumped that out. They step in it and they get mud. They love it. They love their food so much. Okay, Claire, you come out. Okay. Come on. Oh, there's not room for everything. Buckets and bellies and dogs. Okay, so the kids are out and about. They're on the mule and the four-wheeler just enjoying the evening. It was an easy night. Pizza night. We have this really good restaurant not too far from us. Like five miles, six miles or something. So, they have this really big everything pizza that comes with a free cheese. I mean, it's funny. It's free, but of course it's not free. But anyway, it's good marketing and it's good pizza and it's a pretty good deal. So, we like to do that every now and then. Okay, we're gonna carry on. These two. Lost Duke. Lost Duke and Dixie. Well, it's trying to dry out a little bit, y'all. It's trying. It's just having a hard time. Uh-oh. It's really gross. Okay. Oh my gosh, y'all. It's the most perfect morning. Sixties. Sun's shining. Humidity's low. Got a little breeze. Oh yeah. It's gonna be a good day. Next on today's agenda is to try to catch a bull. Get him out of the lot. You want me to stay put, right? Yeah, for the time ban. For the time ban. There's Mr. Bull. We'll see how good he comes to feed. He's been hand-fed. This is one we borrowed, um, from our friend Cheryl. Yeah, he's coming. He's coming. So, that is really handy that he is already trying to come to feed like that. I'm not gonna get out because I don't want to spook him. Oh, come on, Mr. Bull. The cows are gonna load up if he doesn't. Come on, buddy. This can go smoothly or this could be a long process. You got him? You got him? No, I ain't got him. Oh. Well, that was a bust. He said he came right to the door. He was right about to load. And a cow bumped him. And he ran off. So, we're gonna have to try again a different way. Try to get him probably up in the corral or something. We're gonna have to try again a little bit. Our campers are loading up, heading out. We got some more coming this afternoon. Gotta unlock the hubs. We're locking them in case it got stuck. So, it wouldn't get stuck. Look at that big, beautiful sign. What do I spy with my little eyes? Two girls on horses. Austin and her bestie, Alex, have been riding. This is Alex's first time riding Western. She's been used to riding English. Smile, you're on YouTube. How'd it go? Did it go okay? Yeah. Well, that doesn't sound very good. What? Was that yeah, like no, or yeah, like oh. He laid down. He laid down? Ben, were you near water? And now he's trying to... I just got over the creek. I went over the hill. Oh no. He started to grow me. What? Okay, of course, your first time. He's never done that. Has he ever done that? Three times. Oh, I didn't know that. You okay? Oh my gosh. Okay, good. I'm going to the RVs. I'm going to the RVs. Never a dull moment here, is it y'all? Oh my gosh. Of course. I feel like every time we have somebody come over and that's riding, something happens. Like Rip never does anything. And when our friend Brantley was over here one time, he ends up like booking up a hill and falls down with her. And then now Ben lays down with Alex and... Oh my gosh. Anyway, all right. I'm heading over. I've got some planting to do. I've got some... I bought some ornamental grasses that I'm going to put towards the front of the road where Lawrence had like cleared... where he had cleared out thinking we were going to put the sign on the other side of the road. And it just looks bad to me. So, I'm hoping these will kind of grow up and fill in. I've seen them on the side of the road other places and I really like them. So, here's hoping. I got 10 of those to put in. But since the ground is so soft, I don't think I'll have a problem. I got a post hole digger. Okay. Um, and our lights... a couple of our lights fell over last night with the really strong wind we have. So, I got to try to put those up and see if we can regroup on the fire pit light situation. Within two hours, we have our next guest coming in and we're going to head over there later. And, um, hopefully, hopefully be able to do something at the fire pit. We were going to do those little pudgy pie dessert type things, I think. But, it's kind of windy. So, I don't really... I don't know. I guess we'll just have to wait and see. So, that's what we're doing. Well, shucks. I'm probably afraid. Okay. I got them back up. But, remains to be seen if they will stay. Lawrence said we could try, like, uh, maybe digging a little hole for them to kind of sit down in. So, we'll see. We'll get it figured out. Lawrence said this morning he's afraid we've pretty much lost our barley crop. Ugh. The bad thing was that it had that rye mixed in it. I can't remember exactly what happened. It was mixed in with the seed or something and wasn't... didn't want it to be. But, I just don't remember the whole details. But, that was the problem because the barley was ready. But, the rye wasn't ready. And then, the longer it sat here, it just blowed over. So, we'll see. He's going to bush hog around the corral so we can get the cows, the whole group of cows and calves and the bull up and separate them and treat them for flies and deworm them and all that stuff. So... Oh my gosh. Okay. I didn't remember post hole diggers being very fun and I remembered correctly. Right? Okay. These things don't look like much. I hope they don't get killed. I hope they don't get sprayed. I hope they don't get... I hope they make it. Proven winners. Uh, prairie winds, desert plains. That's what we're planning. And that's what it's supposed to look like one day. Okay. Okay. This wind is absolutely no joke. I think it's got to be gusting 20 miles or more per hour. It feels good, but it is windy. All right. Got those in the ground. Let's go wash our hands. Um, not that I care about being dirty, but, um, when I do stuff like that, it dries my hands out really, really bad. Something about that. Okay. So, Lawrence was... Did I already tell you? It was so windy. He's going to bush hog around the corral. Perform service. I know. I've got a bunch of filters I gotta replace. I ordered them. It's just a matter of getting it done. Um, he's gonna bush hog around the corral so we can work the cows in the cabs and get the bull loaded. An easier way. And would you know it, it's raining again. Boo hoo hoo! Oh my gosh. I was getting ready to put Wesley on the mower. I'm going to meet our guests. They should be here any minute. They might be waiting on me. Uh, Lawrence might be over there. I don't know. He's probably getting, he's getting rained on because he's in the little open cab. He hasn't called me though to say, come get me. It's just, I think it's just a shower moving through. I don't think it's anything crazy. But it's still more precipitation that we don't necessarily need. Here they are. Oh, they've got an easy one to get in and out. Look at there. Okay. Everybody came to say hey. We got Mary Beth and Terry here from Florida on their way up to Canada. How about that? Um, we're going to come back over later. I'm hoping, I don't know y'all. I'm hoping that the weather is going to cooperate so we can, so we can try these pudgy pies on the campfire, around the campfire. But, um, can't get over the weather. Now that the rain stopped, it's just, it's still amazing. It feels amazing. And they're super happy with it too. They say it feels a lot better than it did in Florida. So, anyway, hopefully I get to introduce you to them in a bit. Austin is getting cooking instructions from Alex. What are you doing? Um, maybe like Africa? Austin's like, no, I don't know. You're not driving here. Not driving. Making cream cheese icing. They made carrot cake cupcakes. Alex makes the best carrot cake cupcakes. It's like a box mix. That's like doctored up with, what are the things mainly? Well, pineapple. Carrots. So you add real carrots to the carrot cake. Oh, I can't talk. It's a problem. Does it need to be faster? You can. You can. It's okay. It's okay. This is good. This is really good for you. I can see you rolling your eyes. Look what these girls are doing. Piping it through a bag because I don't have any tips. I do somewhere, but I can't find them. And these are cabinets, which is kind of futile to even have stuff if you can't find it. And use it. Put your hands underneath there. Yeah, like that. I love this so much that y'all are doing this. Meanwhile, we've got some nachos. They're about done, I believe. They are. They're actually crisping up. And make a circle. Right, right. And then you go around the edge first and then you do the middle. Those are really pretty. You can get them and then you put another piece of bread on top. This is graham crackers and Nutella and marshmallow in case you want like a s'more kind of thing. Oh yeah. Or a apple pie filling and caramel for like caramel apple. Yeah. And cinnamon if you want that. You can always put some M&M's on top of something. And then just cherry. And then we got cream cheese frosting. Oh my gosh. So we're, welcome to YouTube. This is your birthday beer. I like that with me. I like that with me. I like that a little bit. Yeah. Mary Beth here and her husband Terry's over there. And we are, they are introducing us to Pudgy Pies. Pudgy Pies, right? Yeah. They, um, and she's even, look at her. She's even got my t-shirt on the skillet. She's like, that was the perfect, yes, that was the perfect thing to wear. Wow. So it's these little cast iron, I don't know what you would actually call them, but. That one's already greased, so. And then you just put the bread and you kind of make just, she's got all the stuff here. Like a grilled cheese sandwich for the fire. Yeah. And you can obviously do that too. Like she said, you can make sandwiches and stuff. We're just going to do the dessert. So we're, we're double desserting tonight. Because we have these girls yummy cupcakes. That's so sweet. And look, our little table's getting used. I'm so excited. I haven't got it stained yet. That's on the agenda to do this week, but yay. This is good. Hi, Carrie. I already interviewed her. This is cool. Or, well, hot. This is good. Was that bad, Wesley? Wait, he's sitting on the, he's sitting on the arm. He's going to break it. Sure is the world. Before it even gets used. Huh? What do you want? If y'all don't know how happy this makes my heart right here. And we got some, got some folks that are interested in maybe moving in monthly. Look. This just really makes me happy. This is, another thing I want to do y'all. I want to get some more posts, Wesley. I want to, I've been wanting, I want to put up like a, a volleyball net over here. Wouldn't that be good? A little recreation area. If you open it up too soon, then it's, it's not done. It all falls apart. Okay. So you need it to be done before you open it. Yeah. Probably going to flip some of the logs there so the toes are up. Okay. Too hot like that, rather than getting cold like that. Lawrence is not convinced that we're doing this correct. It hasn't been two minutes. If you're in somewhere, then it's a good idea to keep flipping them by every two minutes. Okay. Yeah. But like laying them on there, you think that's good? I don't know. I know. We don't know. I mean, I think it all depends on how hot your fire is too. So it's, I think it's just. We are, we are going to, we're going to know. We're going to know when we're done tonight. We're going to, we're going to be a little bit more versed. That's what they say is nice about having the long handles on. You can just kind of. She does. She rode today for the first time in a long time. They both rode. All right. Will you hold the camera so we can get, get, will you hold, can you do it? Can I do what? Just hold that there. So when I take it out so we can see what it looks like. This is your. Oh, well that's. Oh yeah. That looks so good. I'm really excited about this. All right. What we have here is a little apple pie and some bread. This should go up. I'm going to put it in the middle. Wesley's got a little charred. Now that's weird. You must have. I felt like I was. All the way down in the. Okay. I felt like I was doing about the same thing, but. Yeah. All right. I think the happy, happy medium is up. You know, you can let it rest on the top of the wood, but not. Don't want to keep it down in the very middle. Wesley. Wesley, you can't eat that. Don't scrape enough to get that out. No. From one end to the. No. It's hot, but it's good. It's good, isn't it? It's really good. I made mine like apple pie. Apple pie filling. Cinnamon. What else are we putting? Caramel. Caramel. Caramel sauce. Butter. Real butter. Thank you. You bet. It's really good. What did I got to say? A whole five years. I went for Nelson. It's getting all the stories, y'all. All the stories. It's like lemon claw. Look at this. It's like lemon claw. I said Nelson, you need anybody for Nelson. I guess some people wouldn't really appreciate this, but I just can't imagine. Yeah, he's got two. It's like I got to go to work. This is just really nice. I got to start a little check and become dead. I said I'm jealous because I don't get to see the sunset for my house, but these campers have the best view. We just watched the sun go down. Yeah, let it stop. Oh. What do you think is that?  sensational night. Say hi. Send me. So I just see my little continue. To get to know. But theplace of it is a baby roughness. I think in any sense, it went where you can't rip it.
