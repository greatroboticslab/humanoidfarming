Education
 Agroecology is a science, it's a practice, and it's a movement intending to create more sustainable food systems. The class is focusing specifically on the science part of agroecology. Every week we come out to the farm for a few hours, we're collecting data. In the classroom we're analyzing that data, and we also have time for lectures in the field and in the classroom about the big picture topics that we're studying. So we get a chance to do that in the classroom, learn from the TAs and Professor Ong, but also be out here on the farm picking weeds and counting bees and doing all the fun things. I think that one of the really characteristic parts of Dartmouth, or at least its reputation, is like a school that you can be outdoors and sort of engage yourself in education in a beautiful place. And I think the organic farm is very emblematic of that experience, especially if you're doing a class in sophomore summer. In past environmental studies classes, we talk a lot about policy and we don't really do anything like with our hands. And this class really brought me, immersed me right into the, into the field, quite literally. One of the biggest goals I have is to inspire students to observe things in the world around them and put that into their academic work and see how they're going to be. And see what comes from that, what information, what new knowledge we can build. It's one of my favorite classes that I've taken so far here at Dartmouth. You get really close with your class. You get to know the TAs and Professor Ong really well. You get to be outside for four hours every Thursday. And you learn so much more about agriculture and agroecology. And it gives you a new perspective on environmental studies in general. b m s
