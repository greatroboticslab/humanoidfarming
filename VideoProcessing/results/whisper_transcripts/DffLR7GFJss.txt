 Hello class, can I explain any sustainability concepts? Professor Siegfried, what is sustainable agriculture? Well Jenny, sustainable agriculture is the application of husbandry experience and scientific knowledge of natural processes to create integrated, resource conserving farming systems, based on respect for the people and animals involved, which reduce environmental degradation, and which promote agricultural productivity, and economic viability in both the short and long term. Thanks professor for explaining sustainable agriculture.
