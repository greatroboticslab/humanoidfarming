 The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development has listed the 77 pesticide products withdrawn from the market and introduced stringent new regulatory controls on hundreds more. The move is aimed at safeguarding public health and aligning Kenya's agriculture sector with international safety standards. The decision follows a year-long review by the Pest Control Products Board, which assessed 430 end-use pesticide products using scientific data from manufacturers and regulators in other jurisdictions as well. Jimmy Bogo has been. The government has identified several active ingredients and products that pose unacceptable risks to human health, crops, livestock and the environment, leading to the immediate withdrawal of 77 products. Another 202 products will be restricted only to be used on specific crops, while an additional 151 products are under review and will remain banned from importation and use until a final decision is reached by the end of the year. To further enhance compliance, the Ministry has finalized a draft pest control product bill, which has already been approved by the Cabinet and is set to go before Parliament. The proposed legislation enhances regulatory oversight, bans pest control products outlawed under international environmental agreements and prohibits the use of products not registered in their country of origin. Among the items banned include 45 pesticides, which have seen the withdrawal of eight more from the market. Others include 27 insecticides, six fungicides and six herbicides, with the remainder comprising fumigants, rodenticides and hazardous cofumulans. You can expect those determined to produce the pest size that you don't want to fight back. And they will fight back as severe guerrillas. So let us not, let's not care ourselves. Let's not bury our head into the ground like the proverbial ostriches. Jimmy Mbogo, Citizen TV, Nairobi. .
