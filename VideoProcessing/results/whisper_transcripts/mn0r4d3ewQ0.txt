 I'm just a foot from the semi cut rough here and I've got a really poor lie in this thick rough here. Is this area managed? Well it is managed. I will say we're not going to get the perfect lie all of the time but we are aiming from a transition from a semi rough into a first cut for instance. But it's important that we have different areas across the golf course. It will be managed rough, there'll be unmanaged rough. We have connecting corridors across the golf course. It's important of course for the strategy of the golf course but it's very important for the grass species of biodiversity, the different habitats whether that be plants habitats or wildlife habitats across the course. Should this not be nicer, thinner, wispy rough? Well there's going to be so many different grass types. We aim for creating the wispier, finer grasses but again it depends on the nature of the golf course. In a parkland setting that might not always be achievable. If we want the finer grasses we might want to be further away from trees. But again it's important of having, we can't mow wall to wall, it'd be costly. We have to think about the fuel consumption, the emissions, so again we have to break up the corridors of the golf course and create strategy for the environment and for the golfer. But areas like this are planned, are they? Everywhere should have a management plan of the golf course whether it be the main playing surfaces or the rough areas. Some will be visited more frequently for maintenance, others less frequently. If you think about the jobs of the golf course or the golf course at the golf course we will come to, this is what they are going to do, but once again we have to go to religion, we're given the most이션 for the golf course to take thereath. We are grabbing at sea format which is also known by drawing a song. We click to be somewhere where you put off the golf course hermanouille that is
