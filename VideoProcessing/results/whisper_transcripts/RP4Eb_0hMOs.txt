Howto & Style
 Hi it's Jamie from Gilbert farm if you're watching this video you're probably interested in adding some chickens to your house or your backyard or your homestead or your farm and you probably will have a whole bunch of questions as to how do you get started with chickens I'm gonna go over that in this coming video I'm going to show you everything that we do from the very beginning from ordering chickens all the way up to transitioning them to outside so the first thing you want to ask yourself is why do you want chickens is it for eggs is it for meat is it dual purpose for self-sustainability or is it for pets because depending on what your reason is for getting chickens will determine what kind of breed you want a lot of people ask me what kind of chickens should you should I get if I live in an urban development and if I have a lot of neighbors but I want a couple eggs well in that situation I would say go with the silky if you have little kids and you have an urban home a really small area you want to have really quiet chickens cute little fluffy ones that are laying pretty well I would go with a silky silky is a great bird for that they're really super quiet and they're great for keeping in an enclosed area but if you are say living on a couple acres and you want a free range and you're looking for something for eggs and dual purpose I would go with a much larger bird I would go with something that is better on production for eggs I would go for something maybe like a black ostrilorp or maybe a buff orpington if you're looking for something for strictly egg production you might want to go with something more like a red sex link or a white leghorn they're really high production ones or if you're going for just a meat bird you might want to go with something like a cornish cross where you just order in a whole bunch of birds you raise them through the summer and then you call them all at the end of the year if you're more into say more self-sustainable meat or more heritage breeds you might want to look into something like a jorking which is a very heritage breed with it's more of a slow growing chicken that is going to have better flavor but it's going to take a really long time to breed those out or if you're looking for something more heritage that's quicker to grow out you might want to look into something like a rainbow ranger so there is a bunch of different chickens out there a bunch of different options depending on your needs for us we have a bunch of reasons that we want chickens we started off wanting chickens specifically for eggs and we wanted colored eggs we wanted rainbow eggs so we ordered a bunch of rainbow layers and now that we are kind of going down the self-sustainable path we want to go into something more of a heritage breed with with better quality of taste and we also want to go with something that's dual purpose so we're kind of getting into a chicken that's called the dorking that i just mentioned so we are raising dorkies but we are still continuing to add some of the rainbow light egg layers to our flock because we want to maintain that egg laying capability of all the color layers we do have a market for rainbow eggs but we want to have the self-sustainable dorkings as well now those are going to lay less eggs but they're a dual purpose bird they might lay three eggs a week but they'll have better quality meat so we're kind of offsetting with different breeds here so first thing you want to do is figure out why you want chickens do your research on your breeds and then narrow it down to a handful of breeds that you think you might want to add to your homestead oh hi so the second thing you need to know is where are you going to order your chickens from you can order them from online hatcheries you can go pick them up at a hatchery you can find a local breeder or you can just go to say craigslist and pick them up or even another local homestead that you're aware of that that also breeds chickens now there are benefits and drawbacks to all of those we have only ever ordered from online hatcheries the main hatchery that we order our chickens from it's my pet chicken we've had excellent experience with them any problems that we've ever had they've completely taken care of and we just we just really love working with that company another hatchery that we worked with was mcmurray hatchery mcmurray shipped our ducks and our goose to us and we had excellent experience with those as well now when you're ordering from a hatchery you have the option of vaccinating your chicks we choose not to vaccinate our chicks but just so you know that is something that an online hatchery or even a drive-up hatchery would be willing to do but it's very likely that probably a local breeder would not do something like that maryx is one disease that you can have vaccinated against if you guys think you might want to vaccinate your chicks that's something you're going to want to look into like i said we do not vaccinate our chicks at this time we just don't feel it's necessary we don't feel it's helpful at all or beneficial at all to do that so it's something we don't do you need to do your research on maryx disease and whether or not you want to vaccinate your chicks just as a side note they typically do not vaccinate bantam chickens a bantam chicken is a miniature chicken so a silky would be a bantam chicken it's a smaller chicken and they do not they do not vaccinate those types of chickens another place to order your chickens is through a local breeder you can do some research online for the specific breed that you want now the problem with ordering from a local breeder is that they might only carry one or two or three types of chickens whereas if you order from an online hatchery you usually have a varied choice of chickens to get from to order from but if you go to a local breeder they may only carry two or three or four different types of breeds they might not carry the breed you want so you might end up driving around to a bunch of different breeders trying to collect the different chickens that you want assuming you want more than one breed the benefits of going to a local breeder is that your chickens aren't being shipped through the mail because that can be kind of hard on chickens so you tend to end up getting chickens that are in a little bit better shape when you go to a local breeder also you can establish a relationship with that breeder and potentially you can go back to them for more another place to get chickens is craigslist you can most certainly look up on craigslist and find tons of chickens being given away or sold very very cheaply if you're looking for bargain chickens you can most certainly go on craigslist uh and you can find legit hatcheries on there as well or legit breeders on there as well you just need to do your research on that particular farm that's selling um but you can also have a lot of problems with craigslist usually people who are selling chickens on craigslist are typically either advertising their farm which is a good thing or they're trying to get rid of a problem which is a bad thing also if you do order from craigslist make sure that the place you're getting it from is npip certified that means national poultry improvement program that means they're in a certified program where their chickens typically are disease free if you bring home a chicken from craigslist in particular in particular ones that are not day old chicks ones that are older it's very possible you could be you could be introducing a disease to your location or to your current flock just something to be aware of the last place that you can get chickens from is just maybe a neighbor who's breeding chickens maybe they have a rooster and a bunch of hens you can get some eggs off them and hatch them out if you have an incubator or you can just get some chicks off of them and it's the same thing with craigslist just make sure you know who they are and how they raise their chickens and how they take care of them and if you feel okay with getting them from that person then by all means you can do that again there's a benefit to that you have you have an established relationship with that person but there are drawbacks you just need to make sure that you know what you're getting into you know that person very well so again you're not introducing disease into your land or into your current flock if you have one see this right here this is called an egg tooth little chickens are born with that little tooth on there that helps them break out of their egg and they will lose it after a couple days and she's sweet when you go to order chickens you might notice that you can order either roosters hens or straight run now roosters and hens are sexed chickens that means that they have a specialist that looks inside the vent of the chicken and they can tell whether it's male or female a straight run means they did not sex the chicken and you don't know what you're going to get it's typically 60% rooster 40% hen so the benefits of going to say a hatchery as opposed to a local breeder is that they typically have people on staff that will sex the chickens at a hatchery tip local breeders don't typically do that it's very very rare to find a local breeder that will sex the chicken and also hatcheries tend to guarantee the sex of the chicken when you do order through them some chickens are auto sex chickens that means like they can tell the difference between male or female depending on what color they are if they come out one color it's a male they come out another color it's female dorking chicken which is one that I'm holding here is sort of kind of auto sex like you can sort of kind of tell that which one's male which one's female this one here is likely the female because she has a darker head and I'm going to show you the difference with the male who has a little bit lighter head this one here is likely the male you can see that there's no black stripes on either side of the brown and the females have a more defined stripe there so this one is likely the male but when we order these chickens we did order one male and we ordered three females so we do know that one of them is a male and that's one of the benefits of ordering from a hatchery is that they can guarantee that you're going to get what you order and like I said if you go to a local breeder you're going to end up with a whole bunch of roosters and you need to have a plan for those roosters when they grow out so the next thing you need to know is when do you want your chickens to arrive now you need to consider the fact that your chickens are probably going to be indoors or they should be indoors for at least four weeks before you move them outside and when you move them outside it needs to be somewhere in the range of about 75 degrees so wherever your area is wherever you're located you need to make sure that the temperature is going to be around 75 80 degrees when you move your chickens outside otherwise you're going to have to provide supplemental heat for us we like our chickens to arrive sometime around April a lot of people like them around April because it's Easter time and you get little baby peeps and it's fun for the kids the thing is is if you are ordering a variety of different breeds or if you're ordering a specialty breed in particular heritage breed if you wait until say March to order those April chickens you're going to be sorely disappointed you're going to find that most of them are sold out the time to start thinking about ordering chickens is in November the previous November if you want them for April start thinking about ordering chickens around the holidays for the following year because they do sell out in particular the rarer breeds will sell out so for us we always order our chickens if we're ordering from an online hatchery around November now we'll place our order around November and then we will get a selection of different dates that they can arrive we pick which date is most convenient for us you need to make sure that you're going to be home on that date or that week of that date because you don't know when they're going to actually arrive you know when they're going to ship but they could arrive the next day they could arrive two or three days after that you need to make sure that your schedule is clear that you can go pick those birds up at any time of the day and that you're going to be ready for them so make sure your schedule is clear that week and you're going to pick the right week the day they ship at least when it comes to my pet chicken you will receive an email that says that your chicken shipped and it'll have a tracking number completely ignore the tracking number because it's completely and totally useless all your chickens are going to be shipped via U.S. Postal Service and the tracking numbers are almost never updated on time as a matter of fact it will tell you that these are going to be shipped overnight and very rarely will you ever get them the next day they could arrive the next day they could arrive two days from then they could arrive up to three days chickens are good for about three days maximum in the mail they live off of the yolk that is that they had in their in the egg and they will survive up to three days but it starts to get a little rough after three days and you start increasing the chances of having dead chickens or maimed chickens the longer it takes so the thing that I do the day that my chickens ship I will call the post office or I will stop by my local post office and I will let them know that I have a chickens that are going to arrive in the mail and that I would like them to call me as soon as they arrive and I specifically say that and I prefer to go into the post office and talk to someone face to face and write down my name and my address and that I have chickens and please call me immediately and my phone number otherwise a lot of times they will let those chickens sit back there and if you don't get a mail delivery until five o'clock sometimes they will just put them out on the mail truck and just deliver them at five o'clock to your house those chickens sitting in there at the post office all day and again that increases your chance of having dead chicks you're going to want to go in and pick them up so make sure the post office has your phone number and even if it's on the package and a lot of times the post office will say as long as it's on the package we'll call you you need to specifically say call me as soon as it comes in I don't want my chicks to be delivered I want to come and pick them up and they will do that and our post office is really good about that this has been our fourth delivery so far all right so you have your reasons for getting your chickens you have your breeds picked out and you found yourself a breeder or a hatchery to order from and you have a date picked out when your ship your chickens are about to arrive so the next thing you need to consider is where am I going to house these chickens there are a bunch of different options you could either go with something that you built or something that's manufactured you can repurpose an old shed you can have a barn we're going to show you what we have here which are two mobile coops and two different versions of two mobile coops that we have on our small one acre homestead the first one that we built is made almost entirely out of new materials what it is is it's a coop that will house about about 10 birds 10 adult birds comfortably it is it has a covered run that is covered in half inch hardware cloth and it has five nest boxes in it this is what we used initially for our chickens when we got our very very first batch we moved them out here to this particular coop when they were about four weeks old and then we just moved them around the yard about every day or so to give them fresh grass and then at about eight weeks of age we added this electric premier one netting around the outside and this netting comes with doesn't come with but this netting we ordered a solar charger to go with it and if you guys are interested in knowing more about this particular setup I'll leave a link to it but we added this electric fence around it and we let the chickens run free inside the electric netting now that we are adding on to our flock we built a second coop this coop over here is made almost entirely out of recycled materials it's made out of pallets and the only thing new on it is I believe the roof and the wheels that it costs somewhere around the vicinity of 150 bucks most of that money is tied up in the wheels which are very pricey this is a coop that is designed specifically for laying hens the only thing that these chickens use this for is for sleeping at night and for laying their eggs and they can go underneath to seek shelter from the rain when needed but most of their time is going to be spent in the run so these are two different versions of mobile coops we do use them both right now we have our adult hens out here and we have some six week old pullets that are being grown out in here along with some ducks and a goose named dead we're going to leave some links to those videos too if you're interested in those but you're going to need to consider what kind of coop or how you're going to house your chickens and you need to have that built long before your chickens arrive you don't want to go rushing around trying to figure out shelter for your chickens the day that they get here so that's something that you need to consider do your research on what works for your particular area whether it be a mobile coop whether it be something stationary and whether it's something you're going to build yourself or something that you're going to get say off craigslist or from a neighbor or someone else and how you're going to do that so when talking about predator proofing your your chicken coop you need to know what kind of predators are in your area for us around here we have our biggest predator is actually red-tailed hawks and then it would be foxes owls raccoons and black snakes now for ground predators such as the raccoons and the the foxes we use the electric fence and the electric fence works really really well at keeping out those predators and i can tell you that the foxes are walking right past this coop and that's how well it's working we actually heard one get zapped in the middle of the night we saw one the other night right up by our compost pile and then a week before that same one was by our garden so he's kind of scoping the place out but so far he's not been able to get in with the electric fence very important that you consider ground predators whenever you are building a coop now there are a bunch of different other options for digging ground predators if you have a permanent coop you can dig down into the ground and you can put some sort of mesh down there so predators such as a raccoon or a fox or something can't dig underneath the fence that's another option if you have a permanent structure but for us with a mobile coop the electric fence works really well now with aerial predators such as your owls and your hawks we went with this particular system which is basically just colored mason line that is strung up in a haphazard pattern across our run it's the idea here is to try and keep its space no further than two feet apart now the reason for that is because hawks when they dive down they dive down at around a 45 degree angle and they don't like to dive into an area that they're going to get trapped in so when they see all of that that line up there they don't like to dive into that i can guarantee you this works because we had several hawk attacks we had we did lose a chicken to a hawk and as soon as we put up this mason line we have not had one hawk attack yet they've flown over they've come close but they have not gone into that into that mason line so this does work it's just a little bit of a pain every time you move a coop you got to restring up all that mason line so when you guys are designing your coop make sure you consider aerial predators and ground predators the next thing is roosts now there are a bunch of different options for roosts we found that thicker boards tend to work better with chickens and we found that two by fours actually work fantastic now some people say they need to be rounded edges some people like to use tree branches and that's okay if you want to do that but for us the two by fours work absolutely fine for our chickens they fit comfortably on it and the reason we know that works is because we had thinner ones in there before and we had the two by fours lining the walls and the chickens all went over to the two by four to lay so we know that they prefer that and ever since swapping those old roosts over to the two by fours the chickens lay on those now and they're very comfortable so those work for the adult hens it also works for the babies too because the baby's like sleeping up there as well as far as nest boxes you can use just about anything milk crates you can see that we have ours designed into the coop here and we also have designed into the coop over here as long as it's one foot by one foot by one foot and it's in a dark area because hens really like to be in a dark space and it has to be lined with something you can use either hay or straw or pine shavings they like any of those as long as it's a nice cushy area that's nice and dark that's going to work perfectly for the hens and any box of work so right before your chickens are about to arrive you need to have some sort of brooder we use an old this is 105 quart plastic tub and we'll use this to keep the chickens in it for about a week you're going to need to have some sort of brooder now for us we use this eco glow 20 this supposedly holds up to 20 chickens but i would say it probably holds closer to about what we're using it for 11 right now i think that's pushing it with the size all this is is this is a plate a warming plate that acts just like a mother hen would and they can go in here and get nice and toasty and they can come out whenever they want to cool off and this you can raise up three different notches to cool it down so chickens are going to want about 90 95 degrees the first week and then you're going to want to reduce the heat about five degrees every week thereafter so by raising it up it'll reduce the heat this works really really well so another option instead of using something like the eco glow plate is to have one of these heat lamps this is what you more commonly see when people are raising chickens what you can do is you can buy a bulb to go in here we buy one we bought one that has a red color to it that prevents pecking but what's even better than the red bulb is to get an amphibian light that screws in here an amphibian heat lamp and what it is is it just puts out heat it doesn't put out any light and the reason that that's better than having the red is because the amphibian light um because it doesn't have any light it allows the chickens to get some rest and sleep at night can you imagine trying to sleep with a light on all the time we haven't used this yet we tried using it and the chickens actually prefer the heat plate a lot better so i would recommend if you can afford it and if you think you're going to be getting into chickens invest in the eco glow or something similar to that there's a couple different brands out there we think this is a much better product than something like this but this is also good in an emergency one other thing that can be that i should point out with these lamps is these clamps are not very stable and they've been known to fall down and crack and catch fire so just something to keep in mind make sure that these are very well secured now if you are using something like this whereas with the with the eco glow you raise it up into the different notches to cool it down with one of these lamps you want to put it on some sort of chain where you can raise it or lower it to make it either warmer or colder and you can tell if the chicks are comfortable if they're all huddled under the lamp in a ball and they don't come out then they're cold you're going to want to lower the lamp a little bit and if you find that they're you know far away from the lamp and and huddled in a quarter somewhere trying to get away from the light then they're too they're too hot so you're going to want to raise it and if you find they're just kind of scattered about like ours are here then they're comfortable they go under when they're cold they come out to cool off and then they're comfortable that's what you want the other thing that you want to get probably about a week before your now you want to make sure it's chick starter because it has a higher protein content than say a grower feed or a layer feed it's very and plus it has different minerals in it than than a layer feed or a grower feed now there are many different brands of chick starter but there are two different types one is medicated and one is non-medicated the medicated is to help prevent coccidiosis and there is medication in it to help to help prevent that which is a common condition with chicks whenever they're exposed to the outdoors and your soil and then there's the non-medicated which is more of a natural approach you're going to want to have to determine what is best for your situation for us we go with the non-medicated we don't like to medicate unless absolutely necessary that's just our personal philosophy when it comes to ourselves and our animals but we are okay with medicating when necessary but for us we do go with a non-medicated organic starter feed no particular reason for organic other than it's all natural we like a brand that's called new country organics works great for us and when we go to switch over to the grower feed and then over to the layer feed we go to a local feed mill and they make a non-gmo feed that we use but for the starter we go with a new country organic starter so while you're gathering your chicken feed and supplies another thing you're going to want to pick up is some sort of electrolytes for your baby chicks now what these are going to do or these are going to this is going to give your chicks a little bit of boost of energy it's basically like gatorade for chicks these guys have been in particular if they're coming through the mail have been in a box for anywhere between one and three days they tend to be dehydrated this will help them perk up it helps give them a good start now there are a couple different recipes for how to make this yourself these usually come in about a three pack for about two bucks honestly you're not saving much money by making it yourself and this is already formulated specifically for chicks so personally i would just go for this it's just so much easier to keep these these are also really good for chickens that are dehydrated in the summer so i do keep a couple of these on hand again it's like pediolite or gatorade for your chickens one of these little packets will make a gallon of water what i typically do is i get one of these quart jars and i'll put about a quarter of a packet in it the day that i know my chicks are about to arrive i'll put about a quarter of a packet in it and then i'll fill the jar up with room temperature water you do not want to use hot water and you do not want to use cold water because you don't want to burn your chicks and you don't want to chill them off remember they want to stay warm so i will have this ready to go whenever my chicks arrive another thing that you're going to want to have on hand is apple cider vinegar i personally put a splash of this in all of my animals feed this provides some potassium and some energy for the chicks it's also good for antiviral antifungal it helps prevent parasites i put just a little splash in this jar and then through the rest of their lives i will continue to put apple cider vinegar in their water and i do believe that it works and it really does help the chicks so for me i use the braggs organic brand i'm not 100 for organic on everything it just so happens to be the brand that i get just as long as it's raw apple cider apple cider vinegar it should be okay okay so you get the email that your chicks have shipped now is the time to set up your brooder get your brooder box and again we use just use this plastic crate that's about 105 quarts you want something small enough that they're not going to get lost in it and you want it to be easy to clean out that's why we use the plastic tub put your brooder in it we put a board in it to set our water on we don't fill up the water yet and we put two little containers in it for their food and all we're using here is a little lid just something small don't put your food in it yet we put about one inch of pine shavings in the bottom now some people use newspaper some people use paper towels i don't like to use those because in particular with the newspaper the birds are going to be pooping a lot and poop is slippery and what can happen is is they can their little legs can slip and if they if they slip and kind of do a split they can get something called splaylay basically their legs kind of pop out a joint and they can actually become deformed if it's not corrected immediately because we don't want them to have any leg problems we use the pine shavings the only downside to pine shavings some people say that sometimes the birds can get confused with what is their food and what the pine shavings are but as you can tell our birds have no problem figuring out what the food is because i'll just go over and show them that this is the food and then they come over and they'll peck at it see they know what food is okay now assuming your chickens are coming in the mail you're going to get a phone call that your chickens have arrived or maybe your your breeder calls you and says hey your chickens are ready come pick them up today now the very first thing that i do is i'm going to plug in my brooder whether it be an eco glow or whether it be a lamp you're going to want to get that nice and warm for the chicks when they arrive i fill up their water container with the electrolyte solution and the splash of vinegar and i put their feed in the little lids now depending on how many chicks you have you might want to have just one of these if you only have like say a handful of chicks or we have 11 in here so we put two little lids in here you'll know if they're fighting over the food or not how many you need i get this all set up before they arrive now if you're ordering your chicks via the mail um chicks will last up to three days in the mail um hopefully depending on how well they're taken care of usually we've had very good luck um out of the four times that we've ordered um at chickens through the mail we've only ever had one issue and that chicken um unfortunately had to be called but the company took care of the issue they refunded us actually they replaced it with another chicken and everything was good my pet chicken took very good care of us with that particular incident but chickens can generally last up to three days in the mail as soon as you get them home you're going to want to unpack them one at a time examine them make sure that they're okay that their legs are okay their wings are okay and you're going to want to take them and you're going to want to dip their bills in water and i'll show you how to do this so when you take them out of the box you're going to want to hold them very gently they're very fragile and you're going to want to take their beaks and dip it in the water and see you're drinking you want to make sure that they take that first drink and if you want you can show them where the food is and generally if one picks it up with the food they all will but you definitely want to dip all their bills in the water and make sure that they all get that first drink that's very very important that they get that first drink once they start eating they need to continue to eat so don't feed them in the car on your way if you have like an hour drive home don't feed them in the car and then not give them anything until they get home make sure you wait till you get home give them some water give them the food and then make sure they have access to water and food at all times after that after that initial watering and feeding okay so after your chickens arrive you're going to want to make sure your chickens are okay make sure their wings are okay make sure they're eating and drinking all the time they're sleeping okay and they're nice and warm and not too hot not too cold and and if there's any problems at all you're going to want to reach out to your breeder and tell them what the problem is one thing just to be aware of is it's because in particular if you're ordering through the mail it's very possible that when you open that box up that you could potentially have dead chickens that's something to just prepare yourself for you need to know what to do in that case and worse than that i would say is if you happen to open up a box and you find a chicken that is deformed or one that is has been damaged so badly that it needs to be called if you're interested in knowing a little bit more about that we're going to have a video when things go wrong with chickens we'll link to that up above and in that particular case something happened to us i know the company took care of us as far as refunded or as far as replacing the chicken but we still had to deal with the aftermath of having a deformed chicken and we explained what happened in that particular case that's something you're going to want to prepare yourself for when ordering chickens whether it be through a breeder or through the mail something like that can happen and you need to know how to deal with that in that particular situation so after your chickens are home assuming everything's okay one thing that you need to be aware of and keep an eye out for is something called pasty butt pasty butt occurs whenever your chicks whenever the poop gets stuck to the little fuzz around their vent and what can happen is is that can act as kind of like a cork or a plug and it can block them from excreting and if that happens they will die so one thing that you need to do and monitor over the next week in particular that's probably the most crucial or critical time is you need to pick pick each one of those chicks up oops oops i'm not trying to you want to pick each one of those chicks up and you want to check its vent and make sure there's no poop stuck there if that happens you're going to need to clean it off and the one thing you don't want to do is take that and pick it off because you could actually remove the skin when you do that so you want to take a q-tip and maybe a warm washcloth and you want to sweat it and slowly dab at it don't pull don't tear and you want to try and remove that excrement from their fur very very gently until it's all gone and the chick's not going to be very happy about it but you want to try and get that removed and what some people like to do is they want to they put vaseline not in the vent but around on the fur and that helps prevent um future excrement from sticking to the fur if you can do that as an option the other thing you're going to want to make sure you take care of at all times is making sure they have clean water you can see that the birds have already pooped in this water and it hasn't been very long so we're going to go take this outside and dump it and we're going to refresh their water that's something else that you want to make sure you do at all times and just any time also that you see that they scrape pine shavings in their food make sure you pick that out we want to try and make sure they eat the least amount of those as possible all right so these little guys are four days old and as you can see they're really active i replaced their uh the little lids that i had in here with their food in it uh with the bigger container because they were they figured out what their food was and they were starting to scratch it all out so this kind of helps prevent them from scratching it out and it's about this time that i start introducing them to some treats now i don't give them treats before day three i want them to know what their food is first and on around day three or day four that's when i start introducing treats now the treat that i introduce is scrambled eggs some of you may think this is weird but actually chickens live off of eggs when they're inside of the egg they live off the yolk and actually this is actually really good for big chickens as well it provides a lot of protein and if you have an abundance of eggs it's okay to feed it to your big chickens i do i usually mix it with some basil and some garlic and uh and it actually helps prevent worms as well as a as a worm preventative so around this time is when i start introducing treats such as the eggs and also around this time i start training my birds to my voice i use a call where i use the noise chook chook and i'm going to train these guys to call come to my voice when i while my big chickens are outside in particular if we're moving the fence and they're roaming around the yard if i call them with chook chook chook they come running and that's what you want you want your birds to be able to come running in case uh you need them in you know to come near you for whatever reason maybe they're starting to cross the road or wandering off or something but when i do that voice they know treat and they all come running at that so i'm going to start training these birds with chook chook now it's going to take them a little while to understand it you have to do this repeatedly time after time and every time you do it you want to give them a treat and then they'll pick up on it also these guys have not had scrambled eggs before so it's going to take a little bit until someone pecks at it and figures out what it is but once they understand what it is these guys are going to go crazy for scrambled eggs so i'll show you what i do i put a little bit in my hand now you want to make sure that these are room temperature or cold not not hot i'm going to break these up into little pieces and i'll show you what i do they're curious there we go there we go see them wiping their face you'll see birds do that a lot they're wiping their beak off so When I have a treat, when one gets it, they usually squeal and run around and then others chase them just like that. They figured out that that's a treat. So you'll start to see if they do that. They figured out what scrambled eggs are. This is their first time with scrambled eggs. Now I'm going to do this again tonight. I'll probably do it twice a day and I'll do the chook chook every time I do it. I'll always put it on my hand so that they get used to my hand as well. And soon before you know it, they're going to start picking up the chook chook means treat. And then we'll start treating it out with different treats and they're going to be all confused because they're going to expect scrambled eggs and then they're going to get something like cucumbers and be like, what the heck? And it'll be the same thing. Someone will come up and taste it a little bit. They'll figure out that, hey, this is good stuff. And then they'll all come in and then they'll start realizing that. That's how I train my birds. It usually starts on day three or four. And I don't always give them treats twice a day, but for the first couple of days I will just to get them used to the chook chook. So probably for the next, probably three days, I'll do it twice a day and then I'll probably just do it maybe once a day and then maybe once every other day. These little guys are starting to run out of room. And as you can see, they're starting to get bigger and I think it's time to...I think one of them just pooped in the water dish. Yep. It is time to move them to a bigger home. I think it should be very young, young to be plugged into the space. I can do it again. Alright guys, so as you can tell our chickens are outgrowing their baby brooder, we keep them in the small brooder upstairs just to keep an eye on them for the first couple days and we want to keep them in a small area so that they get used to where their food is and where their water is. They are already starting to feather out. This is now day five and we think that they need more room. So we are moving them down here to our basement. Now let me show you our brooder setup. You just watched me put this together. What I have is a tarp here on the floor and the reason for that is because there's holes in the bottom of this box. And when I go to move this whole mess outside, when the chickens are ready to be moved outside permanently and I go to clean up this mess, I don't want to have to shovel pine shavings off the floor. So I put down a tarp first. And then you can see I use a watermelon box as their brooder. I got this for free at a local Whole Foods. I just called them up and said, hey, can you save me a box? And they did. I have to thank Eric over at Life and Farmland for this idea because he's the one that suggested using Gaylord boxes, that's what they're called, for the brooder and I think it's a brilliant idea. So we got this for free from a local Whole Foods. And then I assembled it and filled it with pine shavings. And then I want to show you this little setup here. So this is two plastic bins that are put together with hardware cloth grate on top. Now we discovered this with our ducks because our ducks are extremely messy. They're flinging food and water everywhere. They're making a huge mess and they were soaking the pine shavings. And so we started using this for the ducks and we're going to continue using this for any of our babies as well. This should help prevent pine shavings from getting into their water. And I'll show you how it's set up. So we have basically a plastic bin. You can see there's two of them here inside of another plastic bin. And the reason for that is if the chickens or if you're raising ducks spill any water in here, it's very easy to just pull that top bin out, rinse it out and put it back without all the pine shavings caving in. Now this here, Jeremy made. And this is just some pallet wood with a piece of hardware cloth over it. And you can see we put some duct tape on it just to help prevent the chickens from getting cut. And this just lays over top. It's just a frame. Just like that. And we're going to put their food and water on top of here. And that'll prevent them from kicking pine shavings into their food and water. And then we just put a little ramp over here. The birds should have no issues jumping up on top. But just in case, we put this little ramp. And there's just a little block underneath it to help support it. And we just pushed all the pine shavings up. Now I'm going to bring the Brinzia brooder down here and plug it in here. And we're going to raise it one notch because we are entering into week two and we want to decrease the heat by five degrees. So we want it to be somewhere around the 85 degree range. We're going to decrease it five degrees every week for four weeks until we're down to about 65, 70 degrees. And then we'll move the birds outside. So I'm going to go upstairs. I'm going to grab our babies and we're going to introduce them to their new brooder. Alright, so you can see that I've raised the Brinzia up one notch so it'll be a little bit cooler for them. And as I put each one in, I checked them for pasty butt. And they're all really good right now. And you notice that I just kind of got this texture out of the box. Alright, so you can see that I've raised the brinzi up one notch so it'll be a little bit cooler for them. And as I put each one in, I checked them for pasty butt. And they're all really good right now. And you notice that I just kind of put them around in different areas, put some on top, put some on the bottom so that they kind of know that they can go up here. And they'll train each other on how to do that. One thing that I forgot to mention is about this time I start introducing grit. Anytime that you give your chicks food, you should start giving them grit. Now eggs are pretty easily digestible. I sometimes give grit with scrambled eggs. I haven't given it yet to them. This is their first introduction to grit. And I'm going to probably start giving them a few other things as well, like maybe some chia seeds or something like that. But one thing to know is anytime you start giving food, you want to always give grit. And I put a little dish in here. Don't be surprised if when you introduce something like this, they eat the entire container. They're not going to die from it. It's okay if they overeat it. It's just going to pass right through them. And it's the same thing whenever we go to introduce dirt in the next couple weeks. They'll probably eat the whole thing and you'll be freaked out that they're eating it, but that's okay. So we're going to let these guys adjust. And they seem to be doing well so far. And they're probably going to enjoy their new little space. They're already running all around. I may have to plug these holes up though. These are kind of big for them and I don't want them coming out. So I'll probably put some sort of tape over these holes so that they don't go through it. Let's go do that now. Hello there. Oh hello. Oh hello. No there's no eggs in there. They're looking for eggs. That's funny. Peek. Alright I'll go give you scrambly eggs. Peek Pink. Peek Pink. Peek Pink. Peek Pink. Peek Pink. Peek Pink. Peek Pink. Alright, so it's the start of week three. You can see that these guys are getting used to my call when I bring them a little treat. I just wanted to go over some quick things about treats. You want to make sure you don't give them too many treats. You can see that I just give them a small amount and a little lid. Each bird gets a very small percentage of food compared to what they get as far as regular chicken feed. And then as far as what I give them, you know I start off with some scrambled eggs and then I switch over to things like cooked quinoa. I have some sprouts in here. This is the first time they've tried some tomatoes from the garden. Sometimes when you give them something new they'll peck at it for a little bit and they might not look like they like it at first but you know, just like a little kid who's trying something for the first time, sometimes it takes them a few times before they learn to enjoy something. We just want to really make sure that you don't give them anything like dry seeds or dried beans or anything like that. That dried rice is really bad. Anything that's going to expand when wet. You want to make sure that it's already cooked when you give it to them or like as far as beans or rice or anything like that. Make sure that it's already cooked because it can obviously expand to them and that will kill them if they can do something like that. You also want to make sure that you don't give them anything like plain old rice or plain white bread because there's really no nutrition in that. You want to make sure that they're giving them some good nutrition, good healthy foods when you do give them foods. Just make sure whatever you give them is no more than 5 to 10% of their diet. I guess they like tomatoes. Hey, he's fast. He's got the football. Oh, cute, cycle. With figuring out tomatoes, you can see very quickly they figure out what's good food. So over the life, these birds have been doing fairly well but I started to notice that one of our birds, our faviconov, was kind of hanging back, looking a little listless and I also started noticing a lot of bloody diarrhea. Now what this looks like is it looks like kind of ground hamburger in like a pool of water or foam and that was a little concerning to me. Now something to note is that chickens in general will shed the lining of their intestine. It's very natural and it shows up as like a little chunk of red sometimes in their stool. You'll see it with big chickens and baby chickens alike. But when you start seeing a whole bunch of this ground hamburger looking stuff within some diarrhea especially if it's like foamy or clear diarrhea, that could be an indicator of coccidiosis. And after watching it for a couple days and noting that one of my birds was acting a little listless, I decided to treat the birds. Now coccidiosis is an intestinal parasite that occurs naturally in the soil and in the ground water and all birds are going to be exposed to it one way or another. Now typically birds build up an immunity to coccidiosis but sometimes their immune systems get overrun. And if that happens then you need to treat it. And what I use, this is the second time that I've had coccidiosis occur in my baby birds. And what I use to treat it is something called Cory. This is the brand name for something called Amprolium. Now what Amprolium does is that it prevents the uptake of B1 in the chickens. And it prevents the uptake of the B1 vitamin in chickens so that the coccidiosis doesn't have access to B1. So what you're going to do is add one teaspoon per gallon of water and you're going to treat the birds for a total of five days. So what I did was, I have a one gallon jug here that I put one teaspoon of the Amprolium in. It's just a powder. And then I added water to it, make sure that it was well dissolved. And I'm going to use that to fill their feeder for the next five days. Today is day one that I'm treating them. You can already see that our little Travacana is perked up a little bit. She's doing pretty well. And that she's eating a little bit. So that's a good sign. So when you have coccidiosis or suspect coccidiosis in your flock, you need to treat the whole flock because, well one, it's very hard to pick out which one has the coccidiosis. And two, it's more difficult to treat this one. And three, if one has it, it's more than likely all of them have it. So you should generally treat the whole flock. So I don't mean treat all the birds that I have on the property. I'm just going to treat the ones that are in this area. Generally birds will develop an immunity or antibodies to coccidiosis. It generally takes time. Sometime around week three, I start introducing some soil to their brooder box. And that generally builds up, just a little bit of soil at a time, that generally builds up an immunity to some of the coccidiosis, but it looks like these guys were exposed to it a little early, quite possibly from just a bunch of us handling the birds, going out to the bigger birds coming in, handling soil and groundwater, and then coming in here and handling the birds. They probably got exposed to it early. And it just overran their system. That can happen. You just want to be aware of the situation and know kind of, sort of, what it looks like. And just make sure you have some cord on hand to treat it if necessary. Also, since we're starting week three, we need to raise up the brooder one notch. So I'm going to do that. Remember you're going to reduce the heat for five degrees every week. This is probably my biggest pet peeve with this particular, with this particular brooder. And that's really challenging to get these, get these little clips off. Alright, so brooders raised. And these little guys, if you've noticed, are starting to grow wings. They're getting their feathers in and they are getting kind of crazy. I don't know if you noticed, but they're jumping up on top of the food dish, they're jumping on top of the water dish, and it is not too long before they're going to be jumping up on the side of this box. So I'll show you what we do. We have built this cover that's going to go on top. It's basically just two 2x4s that are, and a half inch hard bar cloth that's stapled to the boards. And we're just going to lay it on top and prevent these guys from flying the coop. They're freaking out a little bit. Alright. So there you go. This is going to keep these guys from flying the coop, and I'll show you what happens in the next couple days. And we'll also keep an eye on the little favicana and anyone else to make sure that there's no more bloody diarrhea and everyone's doing well. Alright, so these little guys are done with their 5 days of treatment for the corid. Most of their poop looks pretty good. I haven't seen any of the bloody poop. And today I started them on some B1 supplements. Now remember that the corid prevents the uptake of B1. And so now that we've removed that from their systems, we want to replace that. So what I do is I give them a little bit of Nutri-Drench in their water. And I'm going to do this for one or two containers full of water, and then that's it. Because this stuff contains molasses, and molasses tends to give the birds diarrhea. And so, you know, just be careful on how much you use this. I just use about a dropper full and a half in about a gallon of water, and then I'll only fill that container up twice. And that's it. Then they're done. Whether or not your birds end up with coccidiosis or not, you want to, around this time, around week 3, week 4, start introducing them to the native soil. So what I like to do is I like to put a little bit of soil in there and just kind of get their bodies and their systems used to the native soil. So what I have here is some cabbage plants that didn't grow in the garden. They're stunted. You can see there's a little bit of garden dirt on there. So I'm just going to put these in there and I wouldn't be surprised if there's nothing but a stem left after a little bit of time. Here you go birds. Chuk, chuk, chuk, chuk, chuk! You can see they're very well strained on chuk, chuk, but they're a little confused as to what it is. Chuk, chuk, chuk! We'll start packing at it. Go get used to it. There they go. You can also see that these guys are starting to dig holes. What they're trying to do is dust bathe. Now before I introduce a box of dirt, which I'm going to do in the next couple days, I want to make sure that they're okay with the soil. So I'm going to do this slowly. I'm going to let them digest this and then we'll introduce a little box of soil for them to dust bathe in after I know that they're okay. Oh! Oh, I see! Oh, I see! That's fine! That's fine! You're just fine! I just want to take a look at it. I'm going to let them digest this and then we'll introduce a little box of soil for them to dust bathe in after I know that they're okay. Oh, I'm alive! See? She's naughty. Alright, these little guys are three and a half weeks old. You can see how naughty they are. They're starting to get pretty fast. I'm going to let them know that they're okay. I'm going to let them know that they're okay. Oh, I'm alive! See? She's naughty. Alright, these little guys are three and a half weeks old. They're starting to get pretty flappy. This one in particular is... This is our Olivegger. Who's ready to get out of here. So, I think they probably only have another... They're three and a half weeks old. They only have another, I would say, maybe four or five days before we move them out to a secure coop. Because they're ready to go. But right now, we're going to put in a dust bathing box. Now, you guys know that I already mentioned that we've been introducing them a little bit to the soil. Now we're ready to go on and put in a full dirt box so that they can dust bathe in it. Alright, for a dust bathing box, I'm just going to use a cardboard box and we're just going to cut it. Now this is not going to be big enough to fit all the birds. Probably they're all going to try and fit in there at once. But I'm limited on space so we're just going to put a little box of dirt in there. So I'm just going to cut it. I'm going to cut a little box just like this. And I'm going to go put some native soil in. Now again, it's really important to use native soil to make sure that these birds are getting accustomed to the coccidiosis that's naturally occurring in the soil. I might also put a little bit of wood ash in there because wood ash does help them with their dust bathing. That is the way that they stay clean. So I'm going to go get that and I'm going to be right back and we're going to see how these guys like it. Oh, you're naughty. Oh, you're naughty. Alright, so I just came back inside with a little box of dirt that I shoveled up from the yard. And I put some wood ash on top. We're just going to mix this together. There's probably some worms and bugs in here. Now again, this is how chickens take their backs. This is for dust bathing. It helps keep off mites. It's really important that chickens dust bathe. Don't be surprised if they eat a lot of this dirt. They're probably going to be scared of it at first. And then they'll get the hang of it real quick. Alright. Let's see how they like it. Alright guys. I'm going to move this over. And put this in. So check out the Ugg boots on this little cochin. Aren't those awesome? Aren't those awesome? Mm-hmm. All right. And now we're going to go through this one. Let's go through this one. Let's go through this one. Let's go through this one. So check out the Ugg boots on this little cochin. Aren't those awesome? Alright, so we're coming up on week four here in like another two or three days. And these birds have got to come out of my basement. If you could smell through the camera exactly what I'm smelling in that basement, you would turn off the channel. It smells atrocious. And when it gets to that point and when the birds are flying around inside their brooder, you know it's time for them to go outside. I specifically picked this week to put the birds outside because even though it's June, we're having a cool week. And by cool, I mean 85, 84, those kinds of temperatures. And at night it's going to be above 60 degrees. So it's a perfect time to put the birds outside and get them acclimated to the weather out here. Now, if your temperatures are going to be below 60 degrees, you will have to put an external heat source outside for those birds. But because our temperatures are perfect, it's not too hot, not too cold. It's a good temperature to bring them outside. So right now I'm going to get our outdoor mobile coop ready for these little babies. I'm going to put in some pine shavings. I'm going to sprinkle down some Sweet PDZ. Sweet PDZ is a deodorizer. It helps soak up the ammonia smell. And then we're going to move them out and see how they do. Now, the plan here is to lock them up inside their coop here. And if you come over here, this is our coop. So it's a coop and a run. And we're going to lock them up inside of here for the first two days. This ideally should get them used to this being their home. And it should make it easier for them that when we do open the door and release them into the grass area, when it comes to being nighttime, that they'll know to go back up here for bedtime. If not, we have to pick each individual bird up and put them up here. So hopefully this will train them to come up here at night. We're going to see how it goes. Right now, we're going to put some pine shavings in our coop. Now, these flat boards here are just going to be used to hold their food and water. Once they get used to going outside, we're going to put their food and water down there. But because I'm locking them up in here, I want more of a stable place for their food and water. So that's why we have the boards. Now I'm going to sprinkle on some sweet PDZ. This is kind of like kitty litter. It'll help absorb the odors and it's all natural. So if they eat it, it's okay. All right. So we have a little cardboard box that we're going to use to transport them in. I'm probably only going to get a couple in here before they start flapping around. So we'll probably have to take them out in batches. You guys ready? So this is why they need to go outside. See? They're ready. All right. Oh yeah. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. How about you? Yeah, I figured you were going to do that. I figured you were going to do that too. I'm going to have a little meeper. Yeah, I can have a little meeper. Oh, come here. You go in here. Until we're ready for it. Alright. Now I'm not ready. I'm going down. Until everything will go far. Alright guys. Come on. They're going to have to be dumped. Come on. They're going to have to be dumped. Come on. They're going to have to be dumped. Come on. Come on. They're going to have to be dumped. They're going to have to be dumped. Come on. Come on out. There we go. They look all confused. We need to take these up so they get better. Okay. Ventilation. Alright. Let's go see what the other ones are up to. We walk on in here. I'm going to have to be dumped. I'm just going to have to be dumped. I'm not a few of them. In here. Alright, I'm not a couple of them They look all confused. We need to take these up so they get better. Alright. Let's go see what the other ones are up to. Hey. We saw a couple of them. We saw a couple of them. We saw a couple of them. Oh, wow. Last one. Come here, dorking. You don't want to be left in here by yourself. Alright. Come on, dorking. There you go. Come on out. There they are. Now we need to get them food and water. Alright, so we have our water with apple cider vinegar in it. And then I transferred their food over to a rubber bowl. This will help prevent them from spilling it out. The only thing is, is they might poop in the bowl, so I don't give them too much. And I just have to keep an eye on it. And also in there is grit. So we're going to put this in there and we're just going to keep an eye on it. Make sure it doesn't run out. Alright. There you go. There's your water. It's not sitting too good. And here's your food. They're making themselves comfortable by pooping. Alright, so these little guys are all set. We're going to keep an eye on their food and water. Again, we're going to keep them locked up up here. As long as the temperatures stay right and they're not too hot and not too cold. We're going to keep them locked up here for the next two days. Then we'll open up the sliding door and let them down into the run and we'll move their food and water down into the run. After quite a few weeks, I would say probably when they're eight, nine weeks old, that's when we'll probably start considering whether or not it's a good time to integrate them with the larger flock. And we'll take you along as we attempt to do that. So we'll see you in a couple days when we let them out into the run. Alright, so our little chickadees have been in here for two nights now. We're going to keep them locked up here for the next two days. And then we'll open up the sliding door and let them down into the run and we'll move their food and water down into the run. After quite a few weeks, I would say probably when they're eight, nine weeks old, that's when we'll probably start considering whether or not it's a good time to integrate them with the larger flock and we'll take you along as we attempt to do that. So we'll see you in a couple days when we let them out into the run. Alright, so our little chickadees have been in here for two nights now. We kept a really close eye on them, made sure that everyone was comfortable, no one got too cold. They've been doing really well, but let me show you what they've been up to. These guys are ready to get out of here. They have been digging the place up. Scratching and scratching and they are ready to go out. They are falling from the rafters. Alright, so we are at the start of week four. Actually, tomorrow is the start of week four. And these guys have been on starter feed the whole time. Starting tomorrow, we are going to start integrating in some grower feed. Now what I do is I have a little bit of the starter feed left. I am just going to start mixing in some grower feed to transition them over. And then once all the starter feed is gone, they will be only on grower feed. It is around week four to week six that you can really start transitioning them over to the grower feed. What you can do is you can look at the manufacturer label on your starter feed. And it usually will tell you when to start switching them over. So for us, it is about four weeks. And what we use for a grower feed is a local feed mill that puts out a non-GMO grower feed. So that is what we are going to start feeding them. Alright, so what we are going to do now is we are going to lift up the door. And we are going to let these guys explore the grass and bugs. And I think what I am going to do is I am going to keep their food up in the top. So that they still associate the coop part with their home. Because I honestly don't want to have to pick each one of these guys up and put them to bed at night. So I am hoping that they go up there at night time. But we are going to keep an eye on that and see if they go up at night. If they do not go up at night, we are going to have to pick each one up and put them up there. So we will see how that goes. But right now, this is going to be their first day out on the grass. And we will see if they like it. Release the Krakens! I am going to try it now. Hello? Okay. Hello. Hey babies. I am going to try enough air. Can you tell your mind where your dog has going? Plus the dog can just take water. AM I going to get you excited, Matt? Hold up. We will see it on McT耶. Alright. So we are going to leave their food up located just now. And just get them on the lookout through the water. And then I have pierced on the shelf. They're going to leave their food up there so that they think of that as their home. Once they get used to going up in there for bedtime, then I'll move their food down here and every morning when I wake up, I'll just lift up the door and then every night before I go to bed, when it gets dark, I'm going to close this door and make sure that they're locked up safe. But this is where they're going to stay for the next at least four weeks. We're not going to even consider integrating them with the larger birds over there until they're at least eight weeks old and then what we will do is we will take this entire coop and put it inside the electric fence with the other guys and then just have them integrate with each other through the mesh and then after a period of time, we have a little door here that we will open up. It's a little creep feeder door that Jeremy built. We're going to open that door up and we'll let the birds explore at their own will if they wanted to go out with the bigger birds and then they'd be able to come back in whenever they wanted to without the big birds following them. So we'll get back to you guys in a couple weeks and we'll see how these little guys are doing. Alright, we're at about week five. Five and a half actually. And our little birds are doing really, really well. You can see that they are in their own separate pen separate from the bigger chickens. These guys are kind of getting introduced to each other through the fence so it's a safe way of introducing the big chickens and little chickens. And these guys have been going to bed on their own because by keeping the food up there for the first three days of food and water, they knew that that was home. I just opened up the gate. I didn't bring them down and let them come down on their own. And they walked down the ramp and they would explore down here. And then when bedtime came, as soon as it got dark, they went right back up themselves. That's definitely the way to do it. After about three or four days, I put their food down here and they still know to go to bed at night. So that's what we're doing. These guys are doing really well and that would be probably the best way of transitioning your chickens outdoors. So when these guys are probably about eight weeks old, that's when we're going to open up this gate here. This creep feeder door. And that will allow just the baby chickens to go in and out and keep the bigger chickens from going in and bothering them. And then we'll just kind of see how that interaction goes and that's it. So those are the basics for starting your chicken flock. So I'm not an expert when it comes to raising chickens.

Look inside their hole? What is it? A vent? Yeah, their vent. Look inside their bum hole. I kind of lost track what I was saying. Where was I going with this? Was that it? Pine shavings and... Hello. What was I saying? I can't help it. I just totally get lost. Oh, that was diarrhea. Did you hear that? I wonder if the camera picks that up. Is it for... Well, this is going to be one of those. If you're more into meat, there's a freaking knot in my face. Hap. Half half of these kids really sitsen on top of this. combine the stem and magnetic shape up one of those films. Nothing.
