 The world as we know it is undergoing great changes. Technology and science are rapidly transforming our lives and the pace is often disorientating. Innovations used wisely can open the door to a new era of extraordinary opportunity. This revolution has been fueling the creativity of men and women around the globe. These visionaries are inventing and implementing new solutions. So open your eyes and get ready for an amazing journey to 2050 to dream the future. The world is a new world. The world is a new world. The world is a new world. The world is a new world. The world is a new world. The world is a new world. To grow the plants we have domesticated, we have annexed more and more space, again and again redrawing the surface of our planet. Today, global agriculture is at a crucial turning point. Our food production system is a fragile ecosystem that has reached its limits. As the world population is constantly growing, by 2050 we'll need to produce around 70% more food. One heck of a challenge. The basic question really facing all of us is how can we secure the food supply for an increasing population with less fertilizer on the same amount of land in the light of climate change. We need to find new sustainable agricultural practices and preserve biodiversity while ensuring our food security in order to avoid worst case scenarios. When the food ran out, most of the people in the world died, but not the people in this place. Where seeds were stored underground, kept safe for a better day. There are going to be many ways of approaching farming in the future. I think you're going to get a lot more capabilities available for people to be able to grow their own food, and that's going to be important especially in developing countries. While at the same time you're going to get very large scale automated farming, you know, where you probably will never see anyone on the farm at all. I'm positive that urban agriculture vertical farming will play a huge role in feeding the world in the future. One of the things I believe that's unique about our robots is that we're really taking agriculture down from the scale of a whole field down to a single plant. Most of the solutions to the problems we're facing today can be found out there in nature. It's just finding a way to bring that into commercial reality. It's not enough now just to leave seeds out or plants out in their natural environment. There are so many threats coming. Reinventing traditions, finding new ways of farming for better production. Today, tomorrow, as yesterday, it's the whole history of agriculture. Around 10,000 years BC, our distant ancestors began growing plants and rearing animals. In the Middle East first, where, over 4,000 years BC, the swing plough appeared, a four taste of the plough and a great invention which changed the lives of the first farmers. This also happened in northern China, Papua New Guinea, Peru and even Mexico. In search of even larger cultivable areas, we began to seriously modify our environment. We irrigated, colonized new spaces. We constantly improved our techniques. And in this matter, the Gauls were precursors with their plough shares and their harvesters. In the Middle Ages, a whole series of inventions came along. Scythes, carts, harrows and rollers, as well as a shelter for cattle and the use of natural fertilizers that it supplied, which revolutionized agricultural production in Europe. The needs of the growing world population increased steadily. From the 16th century to the 19th century, practices were optimized. Crops were rotated. The rhythm of the harvests was accelerated. The result was more forage, more herds, more fertilizer, greater yields. The system was working and they continued to fine tune. In 1804, Swiss chemist Nicolas de Saussure demonstrated that plants draw nitrogen and mineral salts from the soil. The fertilizer industry had taken root. Then in 1884, seed breeder Henri de Villemorin had the idea of crossing two varieties of wheat to unite their best characteristics in one. At the same time, mechanization came as a relief to farmers. The mechanical reaper designed by American Cyrus McCormack took farm equipment into a new dimension. In the developed countries, motorization transformed 20th century agriculture, ushering in the era of mass production alongside the rapid development of mechanical and chemical industrialization. It was also the era of genetic selection to maximize yields. Throughout the century, productivity was the watchword, reflecting the need to feed more and more people. Both economy and ecology are derived from the same word oikos, which is the Greek word for home. So understanding the earth on which we are, of which we are apart, that science is the science of ecology. Ecological agriculture is the only way to not just mitigate the impact on the climate, but also to adapt to it. This return to the land begins in the city, where in 2050, three quarters of the population will live. With billions of mouths to feed, agriculture will have to come closer to the people. The farm of the future is in the city. Architects like Jacques Ferrier or Wardle and Bousscouti have picked up the gauntlet and are dreaming up green cities where nature is once again predominant. But beyond these visions, to produce our food, we will need to optimize our cultivable areas and so everywhere in our cities. You don't have to look at the Midwest of America as the bread basket. Every rooftop, every terrace, every city park, every school yard, every church yard becomes a potential supplier of food. The scale of caring can be the tiniest small scale. And when we bring that in, there is no place where we can't grow food. To each, his project to occupy the urban space, to support the urban farm of the future and follow the major locavore trend. Local production for local consumption, taking back control of the vegetables we eat and how we grow them. A phenomenon at work in all major western cities. When we think about the development of this urban farming trend, we can see that it's often bottom-up initiatives. We can see small-scale community gardens in the neighbourhoods with mainly social purposes. And on the other hand of the spectrum, we also find technically sophisticated solutions like rooftop greenhouses. And already just by comparing these two examples, you can see that there's a big difference. But for urban farms to meet our needs, outdoors won't be enough. We need to gain even more space. Imagine if, in the future, our vegetables could grow inside without ever seeing the sun. Or is that just science fiction? Global capital of urban culture, Berlin, over the years has become a centre of creativity, attracting young talent from all over the world. This is where the founders of start-up InFarm decide to plant their seeds to change the world. We see ourselves as the new farmers and the city is our farm. My name is Osnat Michaele. I believe we are entering an era of the next big agricultural revolution. People do want to know where their food is coming from. Who grew it? How was it grown? What does it contain? I think that people are seeking for a personal contact with their food suppliers, with the growers. Our mission is to have cities become self-sufficient in the food production. Back when we started, we were three people in our living room, experimenting with hydroponics, watching YouTube's tutorials to let us know what we are doing. We just did it for ourselves, right? It wasn't like an idea to change the world yet. And it just worked out. Suddenly we had a jungle in our living room. My name is Eras Galonska. My name is Eras Galonska. And I believe technology is just a tool in the hand of evolution. Then we started to look into this magic of growing and what it gave to us. And we thought it would be a good idea to open a company that bring this magic to everyone. The advantage that we had back then is being outside of this profession and being able to think outside of the box and bring solutions that people that are coming from the academy could not see. Yes. Our office is basically a research hub. We like to look at nature and we like to kind of search inside of this huge world. What is the perfect condition that different kind of plants want? And then we take this piece of nature and we start to program it. And this led us to actually research a lot about different kind of light spectrums and different kind of nutrient solutions, different kind of environments that may be changed during the day. Within one big farm we can create many, many different microclimates and grow thousands of different varieties. The food that we produce from these systems needs to be highly nutritious and we measure this by taste. So it's a kind of, I would say, a parameter for saying this plant yes, this plant no. It's a lot about the taste of it because in the end you're going to eat it. This one is actually very interesting because it's crystallized. So when you picture it from really close, you can see the crystal above it. Wow. We're introducing new varieties that doesn't exist in the market and we're trying to figure out what to do with these new varieties, new tastes, new taste, new taste. And maybe new way of plating. And we're working very closely with chefs that are trying with us to bring those new varieties into our plates. Very good. You want a taste? Thanks. Thanks. In 2015 we had this crazy idea that if we grow inside the city, why not growing in the city? We're trying to make new varieties, new varieties, new taste, new texture, and maybe new way of plating. And we're working very closely with chefs that are trying with us to bring those new varieties into our plates. Very good. You want a taste? You want a taste? You want a taste? You want a taste? You want a taste? You want a taste? Yes. In 2015 we had this crazy idea that if we grow inside the city, why not growing inside of a supermarket where actually people are coming to buy their food? If we can bring production directly where people live and actually consume food, we are saving more than 99% of energy on transportation, refrigeration, logistics, and eliminating the huge waste that now the current food system is suffering. Now the question is how you can scale it, right? How you can bring it to each and every supermarket, to all the hotels, to all the restaurants, to all the offices, to everywhere, potentially also to your home. We launched the first city farm network. All our farms are managed through a central farming platform that is constantly optimizing operations, coordinating output, and forecasting the market's demand. So actually we are doing large-scale farming in a distributed way. You can say we are decentralizing agriculture. If we introduce more tools for the new farmers to come, they will come because people want to farm. People want to do this. This is like running in our DNA. In 2050, at the heart of our cities become farms, the line between city dweller and farmer is blurred, helped by ultra-connected tools. With our smartphones for spades, we will grow year-round fresh, healthy vegetables at home to feed our families. But can these domestic micro-farms service all the food needs of a city's inhabitants? With a population of 5 million cooped up in 715 square kilometers, the island state of Singapore has almost no space for agriculture. 92% of its food is imported. In Singapore, they are developing upwards. In its quest for self-sufficiency, the island in recent years has become a true nursery of large-scale vertical urban farms. This venture attracts people from every background, including electronics giants, just like Panasonic.

Everything here is controlled with extreme precision. Sensors take real-time measurements of the luminosity, humidity and air quality. A real aseptic laboratory where all plant growth parameters are perfect. All our plants inside, actually, they don't have to worry about weather conditions and basically they just need to focus on growing themselves. My name is Alfred Tam. I'm 40 years old. And I believe that indoor farm is the future for agriculture. We actually grow the crops itself in a shorter lit time as compared to the traditional open farm. Because for those traditional farms, they only get the sunlight around maybe 7 to 8 hours. But by utilizing the LEDs, we can actually control the duration of the lighting. That's why we actually have an upper hand in terms of the cultivation and shortening of the lead times of the growing cycle. During the germination, basically the plants only require white lights for growth. But after the germination processes itself, when the plant is at its third week, we only need blue and red light for the photosynthesis process. With natural light, the energy efficiency of photosynthesis rarely exceeds 9%. Thanks to the red and blue light spectrum of the LEDs adapted to each plant, it's possible to push this rate up to 15%. This control of plant growth by light can deliver two harvests per month all year round. Currently in this facility, we grow more than 40 oval types of crops. Our throughput per year is around 81 tonnes. For traditional farming, usually the yield rate is around 60 to 70%. However, for indoor farming, we are able to achieve a success rate of around 95%. Taking advantage of all technological advances, indoor vertical agriculture frees you from the climate's unpredictability. Tomorrow, we'll be able to avoid transporting products over great distances by growing vegetables everywhere, including in areas with little sunshine or hostile zones like deserts or polar regions. But infrastructures remain expensive, too energy-hungry and surface-intensive. To reduce costs and offer vegetables at affordable prices, other Singaporeans have developed an ingenious system, much more simple, which makes full use of the third dimension. The infrastructure costs have to be low. If you make it very sophisticated, then the infrastructure costs are very high. I am Dr. Niam Tong Tao, and I believe that our farming system will help to feed the world in the future. In this system, we use very little energy, very little water. So we call it a low carbon footprint system. It is 9 metres high, with 16 levels of planter boxes, and the amount of vegetables that we can grow per square metre is 10 times more than if you grew it on the soil. Our planter boxes rotates up and down. One revolution in 16 hours. When they go up, they get more sunlight. When they come down, they will get the water. So everything is automated. And the excess water is collected back into our water tanks and recycled. So... It's a hydraulic system, right? And the energy that we use to drive this whole section is only a pump using about 60 watts of energy. And our energy use per kilogram of vegetables produced is only 5 Singapore cents. If you look at the people farming within factory farms, where the energy use is very high, the energy may be up to $6 per kilogram. So they can only grow high-priced vegetables. We try to make our system produce as much vegetables at affordable price for the Singaporeans. And we have achieved it. We have demonstrated within these 3.5 hectares of land that we can produce 3,000 tons of vegetables a year. Singapore needs 100,000 tons of mass-market greens. It means that actually if we just allocate 100 hectares of land in Singapore, using our system, we can produce all the greens that we need in Singapore. And we will be more or less quite self-sufficient. I actually don't think urban farming alone can feed the urban population in the future. There are too many restrictions to really scale it that much up so that it would be able to produce that amount of yields. and the other point is if you think about animal stock, it's even harder to bring this into the cities. Livestock represents 40% of global agriculture. It is responsible for close to 15% of greenhouse gas emissions, more even than transportation. One-third of all arable lands is used exclusively to intensively produce millions of tons of food that is swallowed up by the animals we rear. Three-quarters of all soya beans are sent to industrial farms. With its intensive use of fertilizers, livestock breeding contributes to land degradation, pollution of the atmosphere and the water. It also generates massive deforestation that harms biodiversity. We must give up these intensive practices and find more ecological approaches. We need now expertise of caring, knowledge of ecosystems, knowledge of agroecosystems, knowledge of bio-sever diversity, knowledge of how the soil food web works, knowledge of how insects work together in harmony. Those are the sophisticated knowledges we need and a century has been lost. What if we could combine livestock farming and cultivation while respecting soil fertility? Aquaponi is a virtuous organic circle where fish breeding meets plant cultivation. The droppings of the former nourish the latter, which in turn purify the water. Can Aquaponi be considered on a commercial basis with no pesticides or fertilizers? Close to consumers? This ideal model of the farm of the future is already up and running in Australia. In the suburbs of Sydney, Green Camel Farm has developed its own aquaponic farm concept. Fish and most agricultural plants didn't evolve together. You're never floating down a river fishing and casting lure under a tomato plant floating past you. They didn't evolve that way. My name's Levi Naponin. I'm 35 years old. We're here because we believe in nurturing nature with technology. We've said, well, let's not try and make the fish system so dirty and nutrient-filled that the fish are at their detriment just to produce plants. Or let's not have to supplement the fish water with traditional agriculture fertilizers to get that productivity gain. We've gone out there and made sure that our fish system is as productive as anything in the industry. The fastest growth rates, the best food conversion ratios we can achieve. We then take 100% of that water coming out of our system into a bioreactor phase. And that bioreactor converts all the organic elements in the fish waste into plant-available nutrients at the right ratios and the right biochemistry to ensure that the plant growth is not sacrificed. This is a linear system that enables all the production entities to operate at their optimal parameters without compromising on each other. A true heart of the farm, the bioreactor, thanks to the addition of a cocktail of bacteria and microorganisms, enriches all the liquid and solid waste generated by fish farming. A secret technological recipe in which several million dollars have been invested. It means that every drop of water that is used to grow the fish is then used to grow plants and conversely, every drop of water that's been used to grow plants was once used to grow fish. This increases productivity and efficiency in water use, land use, and it takes away the dependency on fossil-based fertilisers and agrochemicals that are used in traditional industrial agriculture. It's a way of producing organic food at or above the same rate of production as conventional agriculture and without any quality losses whatsoever. The Australian high-tech farm produces 15 tonnes of fish and over 130 tonnes of organic vegetables a year. Green Camel has adopted zero waste production. Absolutely everything is recycled. Fish are an important part of this system, but I think they're an important part of what's going on in the world today. It's not just lettuce that's going to feed the population. It's not just carrots. It's a combination of everything. And protein is one of those major sources of food that the world's going to need. And there's not enough fish in the world and the oceans naturally and there's not enough animals in the world naturally. You know, arable land is disappearing quickly. We've got to think about how do we do this in a way that it's higher output per square metre. That's what it's about. Luxury fish like bluefin tuna, they might be requiring 15 kilograms of oceanic fish to get one kilogram of consumer-ready product. And with the production system we've got here with the barramundi, very, very efficient growth rates, very good food conversion rates, we're able to achieve about a 0.6 to 1, meaning, you know, 600 grams of fish is required to produce one kilogram for the consumer, which means it's a net gain of fish protein. Is it perfect? No, but it's a step in the right direction and we're always investigating new technologies to further reduce that gap and our dream is one day to have zero oceanic fish coming into our system here to reduce this barramundi. We are able now to help many other growers with what they do to convert some of their production into organic and you'll slowly see a growth in that organic. It's already happening around the world because people really are concerned about what they're feeding their children and that's one of the reasons I got into it. I've got children and I want to see them make better products so that's why we're doing what we do. What we will definitely see is a better understanding of the biological interactions occurring in agriculture. We'll see waste streams from livestock production, be it dairy, poultry, piggery or aquaculture, being converted, you know, real time into fertiliser, you know, food safe, plant available nutrients for production. And as soon as we start doing this, we're going to take away the dependency on, you know, finite resources coming from the earth. We're going to build that circular economy and the only way we'll exist will be to live a cleaner, greener life. Consumers want the perfect crop and that puts a lot of constraint on the farmer because they need to grow the perfect crop with the other part of the consumer desire which is reduce the herbicide, reduce the amount of chemicals that I'm using. So a farmer now has to worry about changes in climate, changes in the business economics, making sure that they get the perfect looking apple or the perfect looking lettuce or the perfect looking tomato with no chemical use whatsoever. And that's a very, very difficult problem space to be in. To be competitive while respecting man and the planet, agriculture must be transformed into something more specific to respond to this challenge. Is that it? Yeah, standard agricultural model 7799 pest controller. Farming has always followed technological progress to successfully reinvent itself. today, another idea of agricultural mechanization is emerging. Before long, tractors will turn into robots. Robotics and digital are taking to the fields to revolutionize farmers' day-to-day lives. Completely autonomous, bristling with smart sensors, the robots optimize farming tasks thanks to better knowledge of the needs of the soil and plants. The possibilities for a more precise, competitive, manageable, environmentally friendly agriculture are immense. In 20 years' time, it won't be difficult for you to buy an off-the-shelf robot that has the capability of growing the best lettuce, the best carrots, the best tomatoes in your soil. And it will be low cost and you'll have one acre of land in your backyard and you will want to grow crops maybe just for yourself, maybe for your neighbours, maybe for the village, but this robot will be able to do it for you and you won't need the level of knowledge in the agronomy or in the farming practices for you to worry about something like that. It will just happen. At the University of Sydney, the Australian Centre for Field Robotics is one of the world's most renowned laboratories in its discipline. It has been developing agricultural robots for more than 20 years. I do believe that we have to be more efficient with our land usage. We have to be more efficient by not wasting as much product as we produce. My name is Asher Bender and I think agricultural robotics is going to be a game changer that helps farms be more productive. What we aim a lot of our research towards is helping farmers get better utilisation of their lands through removing tasks that are difficult to indulge them and also providing them with data that helps them identify problematic areas which helps them be productive. when you talk about field robots, the sort of robots we design in this lab, they have to deal with unpredictable scenarios, terrain that they haven't seen before, free environments where people can come and go and they have to operate safely with the operators and people in the environment. What this means is you have to design your software to cope with uncertainty in the environment and that's one of the main challenges in developing robots to operate in the field. A lot of our time is spent developing the brains of these robots to think in a way that's more intelligent and capture some of the knowledge that farmers might utilise on the field when they're walking through their crop and identifying problems that might occur. It's quite a fun task to develop the algorithms that help robots identify things. It's very easy for a human to identify an apple, reach out for the apple, pick the apple, put it into a basket safely. Converting all that knowledge into a robot is actually a fairly difficult task. So there's a lot of research in what's known in robotics as perception. You've got these high-resolution data feeds, hyperspectral cameras, thermal cameras, normal red, green, blue cameras. How do you take all that information and say, aha, this is an apple, that's a branch, that's a leaf? Once you can do that, then you can start working on actuation. I know where the apple is in my field of view, but still, it's again quite challenging to find optimal paths from where the robot's arm currently is to grasping the apple. We can now pinpoint a weed exactly and apply herbicide to it directly. Not only does this have the benefit of reducing the amount of herbicide we apply on the field, so it's a saving for the farmer, it's also a great saving for the environment by minimizing the amount of chemicals we apply to the plants. We're really taking agriculture down from the scale of a whole field down to a single plant. With the robots we've been developing, their sensors are high resolution enough to image each individual plant, and perhaps in the future even a particular leaf or portion of a plant. Looking forward, I mean, I can imagine seeing a lot of machines on the farm. They can work 24-hour days. They're very precise. They don't get tired. They don't forget. So as they're out in the field, I think they'll be able to take note of what's going on with the crop in a very precise way. We're going to collect so much data that's unprecedented in agriculture across the scale. We know a lot of data when it comes to, say, corn, for example, or wheat. But if you told me lettuce, spinach, baby leaf, beetroot, carrots, we don't have a lot of data in agriculture. And what fascinates me the most is that robotics is now going to change that. It's going to change our awareness of how plants grow. It's going to change our awareness of the right time to do certain activities on a farm. In the sky, too, drones will play their part in the digital revolution. Created for the U.S. firm, Winfield, this animation gives us a vision of this ultra-technological agriculture 3.0. The flight to a more reasoned, reasonable agriculture has begun. Already hundreds of drones are crisscrossing the skies. Their sensors and infrared cameras can precisely map the vegetation of a plot in different wavelengths. Once processed, these images provide farmers with information on the health of their plants and enable them to determine their nutrient requirements to the nearest square meter. Thanks to drones, farmers can now treat their fields zone by zone and reduce their consumption of water, fertilizer, and other inputs. All these new technologies combined will enable farmers to respect soil quality, optimize production, and resource use. They may also be a way to attract younger generations back to the rural regions they abandoned by making the farming profession attractive again. All of a sudden now with robots, we're going 24 hours, seven days a week, collecting very, very large spectral data. So in a few years, we're going to have a clash between the data scientists and the ag scientists because we're going to know that probably the models are going to clash with each other and so which model is right? And not only that, the models that we built in agricultural science have been built at a very generic level. This is how lettuce grows. What we can do now is we can say this is how lettuce grows on this soil in this region, but the lettuce in this soil in this region grows very differently. So now you can have very specific agronomy happening at each individual paddock, at each individual farm level. in the future decades, global warming will destabilize farmers' practices. Irregular seasons, excessive heat and water shortages will deeply disturb crop cycles. The basis for our food security relies on very few plants. If something happens, imagine a catastrophe, a major pest arriving and wiping out the rice or the wheat or the banana. We lose a very important building block for our future food security. It is always a little bit of a competition between the crop and the pest. How do we adapt our plants to the whims of the climate and attacks by parasites while still improving yields? Agroecological techniques propose to integrate nature's resources and mechanisms in order to produce better. The idea is to boost yields while easing the pressure on nature and preserving its capacities of renewal. To achieve this, we must understand how plants respond to their environment and thus observe many varieties throughout their life to identify the most robust. French scientists from the National Institute of Agronomic Research have developed a high-throughput phenotyping platform, a computerized plant growth study facility unique in Europe. We know that the climate change is evident. You can see what happens in the climate change. I want to change and I think agroecology is a solution to change. I'm Christophe Salon. I have 56 years. What I most fascine in plants is their ability to adapt to environments that are contraindic. The agroecology is a good product to produce better in quantity and in quality in avoid to degrade the environment and putting the nutrients like herbicides and pesticides which are not for the biodiversity but are also not for us because in the end we will always eat the products that we collect. Since 10,000 years, we have selected the plants that correspond the best to its needs. These needs could be an increase of crops, more seeds, for the flowers more beautiful, for the fruits more gros or with a better taste. And at present we have methods that allow to go much faster in the selection and understand how the plants respond to the environment and to select the ones who are best to adapt the future to this climate to adapt the future to this climate. What can we do is to put in different environments with a variety of water and a lot of water and we will see the ones who are in condition of a manque of water survive and make good quality and in great quantity. Subjected to various growing scenarios, thousands of plants are unwittingly taking part in a gigantic audition. They are photographed daily. Those whose genetic heritage is the most interesting will become the big stars of tomorrow's agriculture. We have a system of robots and a system of cameras that allow to, during time, the growth of the plant, to take these images and automatically extract the phenotypic traits, the characteristics that interest us. It can be a form of a tree, a height of a plant, a number of ramifications, a size of a root. You will extract automatically without the plant and throughout its life. therefore the plant roots This platform boasts another unique feature. It allows plant roots to be observed. With a very high resolution imager, researchers can access the tiniest possible details of the root systems. Their study sheds light on the relationships between plants and soil microorganisms and helps us better understand complex characteristics such as resistance to drought and nitrogen uptake. We know the pressure that agriculture has to feed millions of people who are there in 2050. If we can optimize which plants in which environment, and increase the growth and its quality, by having more resistant plants, we should be able to achieve it. Having spotted the champions of adaptation, we can rely on the future progress of genetics to easily isolate the genes of these hardy plants and thus better adapt our agriculture and our seeds to climate change. But the solutions of this adaptation are also based on preserving the genetic diversity of today's seeds. After thousands of years of selection and crossbreeding, our seeds have become uniform and impoverished. Conversely, the wild cousins of our domesticated plants have kept all their genetic heritage intact. A formidable legacy that is vanishing before our eyes at an alarming rate, just when we're showing an interest in it. How far will it go? When the food ran out, most of the people in the world died. But not the people in this place. Where seeds were stored underground, kept safe for a better day. For a better day. For a better day. For a better day. Well... climate change and species extinction, add it all together, there's only one place from where we can begin to solve it, by returning to the earth. In the heart of the English countryside, the largest seed bank in the world is dedicated to preserving plant biodiversity for the entire planet. We know that 20% of plants are threatened in the wild. So if we don't preserve those building blocks now, we're not going to have the potential in the future to use them. I'm Ruth Eastwood. I really believe that seeds are important to unlocking the potential plants have for us in the future. About 80% of the calories that we eat come from just 12 crops. So if we're thinking about diversity and resilience, that in itself is quite an astonishing fact, given that over 30,000 species of plant are actually edible. Looking towards the future, we might need to diversify the kind of crops we're eating. But even if we're thinking about just those 12, so things that include potato, wheat, maize, rice, the amount of genetic diversity left in each one of those crops is very small. So if you compare that with its wild relatives, there's very little potential left in that crop to improve it on its own. That's why we need to look back to those wild relatives who have been in the natural habitats, evolving over time to a huge range of selection pressures. The diversity in the crop wild relatives gives us a lot of potential that we can improve the crops and improve their genetic diversity. Ultimately, that means we hopefully can eat potatoes for much longer than we might otherwise do. The Millennium Seed Bank is the centre of a network of more than 80 countries and receives wild seeds from the world's most diverse environments. Part of the samples collected remains in the country of origin, and the rest are sent to the UK. When we receive a collection at the Millennium Seed Bank, it's a collection of seeds, often in a cloth bag. It's a dried plant specimen, and it's a data. It's always lovely to see parts of the whole plant as well as the seed, especially if you're seeing fruits or you're seeing a plant you might never have seen before. And you can see the detail of the pods and the leaves and start to kind of associate with that plant and its habitat and why that plant's important. When they arrive, the seeds follow a strict protocol. They are carefully indexed, cleaned and sorted manually. They are X-rayed to check their viability, and then, and only then, dried and packaged before storage. Once we've got the clean seeds, and we're confident that we've got them down to the right levels, we'll put the seeds into containers, and then we're ready to put them into the bank at minus 20. The idea behind freezing the seeds is that they are sort of natural time capsules. Lots of experiments have showed for many seeds, we think we can keep them for up to hundreds of years. Maybe one of the seeds that we've got sleeping today might be a solution to feeding that number of people in the future. But the story doesn't stop when we put them into the bank. We want to have those seeds available for people to use in the future. So we want to do viability tests every ten years. The germination tests are really important for us not only to assess viability of the collection, how well they're doing over time, but to know that we can get plants back from seeds. It's no good to us if we don't know how to grow them. So we spend a lot of time actively working on the best germination protocols. And often those are mimicking what happens in the natural environment. Seeds are fascinating. They come in all shapes and sizes, and they're so clever that they... clever is not the right word, but they've been selected over time, all these different strategies, how they respond to the environment. Each time you see something kind of new or exciting that you haven't seen before, you're just like, wow, they do that? You know, it's really, yeah, fascinating. We've got about 36,000 species. We arguably can say it's the most biodiverse spot in the world because we're bringing plants from all different hotspots together. We've got about two billion seeds now. We're aiming at the moment to collect 25% of the world's bankable seeds by 2020. Well, each of us is a seed. When you look at a little seed, it looks so insignificant. You put it in the soil, you let it grow, you realize how much it can create, how much potential it has. Each of us has the potential for transformation. Each of us can create a future that is both better for all people around us, better for ourselves and better for the planet. And the three are not conflicting competitive objectives. than the controversies that are now on earth. So imagine the future a Знаld is staying at ground, and everyหมar levels appear to come back on the first planet. That time yeah, and the next generation between 001thuk, the energy, health care, etc. The two are having never soon. They can one chance. Thank you. Thank you.
