Howto & Style
 Did you know if you grab a date, gently rip it apart, inside of it you'll find a stone. Don't throw it out. Instead, soak it in a bowl of water for 12 hours. This will rehydrate the seed and trigger it to become alive again. The next thing you want to do is wet a paper towel, place it on the counter, put the stone on top, and then fold it a few times. Ziploc bag it, and then place it somewhere warm and dark above your oven. After a few weeks, check up on it and you'll see... Boom! This stone has sprouted. Grab a pot with soil. Make sure it's nice and fluffy, don't pack it down. Take a hole in the middle and gently plant a date seed. Then give it a nice watering. Water until it starts to drip from the bottom. Put a bottle over it for humidity. And before you know it, it's going to grow into a seedling. When it's at least 6 inches long, transplant it into a bigger pot. It's going to grow bigger and start looking more like a date pot. As it grows bigger, keep transplanting it into bigger pots. So don't throw out date stones, do this instead.
