 We really like running the stripper heads. We're just taking the grain off and we're leaving the whole plant left there on the ground. And then we will no-till our soybeans into this wheat stubble. And this straw matting will be there. And then when we harvest the soybeans this fall, it will be a beautiful thick carpet of mulch on the ground. And preventing the erosion and keeping that soil covered up when we come in next spring and no-till our corn crop. It will allow for a much healthier corn crop. We have more residue breakdown. So that entails giving us more residual nitrogen that has been metabolized and reproduced by the wheat plant and the soybean plant. And it makes it easier for the corn plant to metabolize and take that nutrient up. And we don't have to buy as much commercial fertilizer and put out there.
