Howto & Style
 In this video, I'm going to show you exactly how to get this off just a few cucumber plants. For those of you who don't know me, my name is Justin Lane, and I've been managing my family's garden center business for the last 10 years, and I make these videos to dispel the myth of a green thumb and prove that anyone can be a successful gardener. With that said, let's rock and roll. First off, whether you're growing cucumbers in the ground, containers, or raised beds like I got here, you need to train them up vertically and get the vines off of the ground. This will really extend the life of your plant by preventing diseases like powdery mildew. Cucumbers left growing on their own accord are just going to grow along the ground and receive poor air circulation. Training your cucumber vines up vertically will also help with visibility and help you to spot ripe cucumbers to pick. Walk around here and let me show you. Check out these vines right now. They are absolutely hanging full of cucumbers. And this leads me to my next point, which is that you have to keep these cucumbers picked off or else they're going to go to seed and it'll signal to the plants to stop producing. It's counterintuitive, but simply put, picking your cucumbers off the vine will lead to more cucumber production because it rejuvenates the plants. I'm going to go ahead and practice what I preach here because I can already see I've let some of these get too large. When you're picking cucumbers, you don't want to just pull them off the vine. I use my index finger and just kind of pinch off the top of the stem. And that way you're not doing any damage to your vine. When you're picking cucumbers, you don't want to just pull them off the vine. I use my index finger and just kind of pinch off the top of the stem. And that way you're not doing any damage to your vine. Now just out of this little section, I picked a whole bushel of cucumbers just now. Next, let's talk about water. Cucumbers are 95% water. And if you ever pick a cucumber that's a little bit irregular, then it's very light. Well, that's very good. And I've noticed that you can see that this is a little bit of a little bit of a cut off the vine. I picked a whole bushel of cucumbers just now next let's talk about water cucumbers are 95% water and if you ever pick a cucumber That's a little bit irregular shaped Maybe a little deformed. This is an indicator that your vines are not receiving enough water try to keep your soul Consistently moist But never soggy you don't want to cause root rot, but at the same time you never want to let your soul dry out either So it's a fine balance for me. This means daily deep watering I planted my cucumber vines in rich compost that drains really fast and on these hot and dry days Root rot is definitely not a problem for me Especially with these mature vines Cucumber plants need at least six to eight hours of Sun never plant them in shade My raised beds here are in a pretty great spot because they receive Sun all throughout the day But they get shielded by these pine trees from that late harsh afternoon Sun. There are two types of cucumbers They're slicing cucumbers and pickling cucumbers what I have with me right here and just harvested was the pickling type This is just a white variety, but these are heavy heavy producers. That's why I love growing them You can eat them raw and they're also great for pickling hence their name Finally, let's talk about pollination cucumbers kind of like squash have separate male and female flowers and they rely on insects such as bees to pollinate them if you're finding that There's no bees or insects pollinating your flowers. I highly suggest planting some perennials like bee balm Lantana or echinacea a good indicator that you're not getting Pollination is if your cucumbers grow out to about this size and then the flowers on the end of them Which is the female flower just shrivels up and falls off and then the cucumber itself shrivels up and falls off as well The male flowers on a cucumber vine outweigh the female flowers ten to one grab a q-tip or a paintbrush and swab around in a male flower This would be the flowers that are coming off the vine and then stick it to a female flower again That's the flowers that's coming off the actual cucumber and you just swab around in the female flower Now it's late in the afternoon and the female flowers are all closed up and I can't show you But if you want to see that in another video, let me know down in the comment section I have had so much fun making these videos It really gets me pumped up to see you guys in the comment section talking about the success of your gardens Hey, we want you to join this community and the first step in doing so is hitting that subscribe button and notification bell That way you'll get updated every time we release a new video until next time Become a plant person You
