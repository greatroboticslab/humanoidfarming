 Farmers who use center pivot irrigation and are short on water often choose to leave a part of their field unirrigated by leaving out a wedge of their circle. But there might be a better way. Instead of leaving it as a pie, can you make it circular so that we can increase multiple ecosystem services? Researchers at the Agricultural Science Center in Clovis, New Mexico, are experimenting with a method where irrigated cash crops are planted in concentric rings around the well, alternating with unirrigated buffers of native grasses and perennials. Research is ongoing, but they're finding that this comes with all kinds of benefits. The buffer plants protect the cash crop seedlings from wind erosion, prevent water runoff and heavy rains, hold moisture in the soil, keep out pests, attract pollinators, and it even makes moving around equipment a little easier. So do you think that this method will work for your farm?
