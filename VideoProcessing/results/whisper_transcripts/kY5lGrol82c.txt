 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I'm with the called the Indian Thank you. I spent about 30-35 years back writing my book here in Icriset when Jim Ryan used to be the Director General. So those long walks I refreshed today with the help of Kuldeep in the morning. It has been an absolute pleasure working here. And it's a very productive place in line with nature and perhaps the supreme God. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My name is Angela Lucigi and I'm the Resident Representative for the United Nations Development Program in India. I've been here for just under a year. So I finally feel that I'm coming home because I'm an agricultural economist by training. And over the last 25 years, I've worked for EFAD, FAO, UNEP, and UNDP. And I think I'm most at home when I'm trying to see how policies actually lead to action and how data drives decision-making to change lives and livelihoods. So I think I'm in the right place today. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, all of you. Yeah, that's right. You are good. So those who have joined online, may I request you to please briefly introduce yourself. I can see Dr. Mathur. Dr. Nand, okay. Dr. Nand, would you like to introduce yourself? Yeah, I'm Dr. Nand, working as a visiting professor at Greer right now. I have worked for almost 39, 40 years for fertilizer sector in Fertiliter Association of India, retired as a Digital Director General. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah, okay. So let him join back. So with this brief introduction, yeah, maybe. Okay. Dr. Mathur, may I request you to please briefly introduce yourself? Hello. Can you hear me, sir? Yeah, yeah. Please go ahead. Okay. Good morning, everyone here. First of all, my apology not to be present in person here due to some family commitments and my health issue here. But I'm very happy to join this important meeting today in ECRSET. Being I have a long association with ECRSET and visiting ECRSET is always a pleasure for me. Because when I was working with NEPGR for almost 10 years, we have a lot of joint program between NEPGR gene bank and ECRSET gene bank here. And I was coordinating the whole program. But after leaving NEPGR in 2095, when I joined Biowal City International, my apartment was through ECRSET and hosted by ECRSET for a few years. So it's good memories with ECRSET and I'm sorry missing joining this group today here. Basically, after leaving ECRSET for almost 18 years of service, working with IGFR, I'm sorry. I joined the Alliance of Biowal City International in 1995 and worked there for almost 21 years. On various positions, starting with South Asia Associate Coordinator, South Asia Coordinator, then Regional Directorate for Asia Pacific Oceana, and finally retired in 2016 as a regional director for South and Central Asia here. But after my retirement, I still continue working as a consultant with the Alliance of Biowal City International. Also have my consultant in contact with UNDP, Dr. Ruth Sikhanth here. And also working with the trust, what we know as Caracol Trust, which is founded by Professor Edwin Chodhan. And there I am coordinating a program on stress, tolerance, orphan-like improvs. I am working both with the ICR, NVPGR and African Partners here. So very happy to join you all and I will be there in the meeting full time here. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much. And Dr. Mathur, I think we can also see one more person there. May I request you to please introduce. Okay, I think in the process they may join. Okay, thank you very much for your brief introduction. And it was really a kind of music for me to hear your connection, many of your connection to ICRICET. Some of you worked very briefly for 40 years and writing books here with all nature and everything. And of course, before arriving to this hall, we have already agreed for two more big programs. Not signed, but it is almost signed. And Dr. Gulati is the person for that. Let me also announce one is for photovoltaic. So we are going to establish research, come demonstration, come energy and all kinds of things kind of center over here. And Dr. Gulati is going to work very closely and guide us on this particular aspect. And the second one is what Madam Pant suggested that we would like to have some area for biodiversity conservation and agrobiodiversity conservation, something like that. Already, Government of India is finalizing all those kinds of things. And once those guidelines are finalized, probably we are going to meet very soon so that we shall also work together. And of course, these are very, very informal. And in return of these two, I have already committed to Dr. Gulati that we are going to give him office space to write another book here. Yeah. Okay. So these are some of the things. Thank you very much and welcome each and everyone. I think now we can start, Madam, the formal program. Yeah. Okay. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Since we've already had a welcome by Dr. Parthak and a round of introductions, to formally inaugurate today's proceedings, I have the pleasure of inviting Dr. Stanford Blade, Deputy Director General Research and Innovation, ICRISAT, to give the welcome address. Well, thank you very much. And again, it's so good to have everyone here. Just to acknowledge the esteemed members on the dais, it's so good to have everyone here. I worked for several years in West Africa and there is a beautiful phrase, all protocols observed. So as opposed to acknowledging all of our superb colleagues here, I will just take that particular format in tow. Of course, to welcome all of you here that you've already heard from the introductions. I have a very good sense that we are all amongst friends. Whether we are new friends or old friends, we look forward to the fact of getting to know one another and to exchange ideas and activities. As our Director General has acknowledged, ICRISAT is part of the CG system. And our ethos is around transforming dry land agriculture. We do that, of course, in Asia, but also in Africa with a number of the activities that we are very involved with. And as Deputy Director General of Research and Innovation, I have the great privilege of overlooking the research enterprise of ICRISAT. We do that within three particular areas around accelerated crop improvement with respect to resilient farming systems. And then around all things around enabling systems transformation, which very much includes much of the policy discussion that we have today. I would just remind all of you, you know ICRISAT so well, but really we connect agriculture to food, to nutrition, to human health. But we do that on a foundation of work in economics, in biodiversity, in soils, in water to make sure that we can fulfill that vision very much of transforming dry land agriculture. When I think about the topic today, I am trained as a plant breeder. But of course, as I think Dr. Janilla has already reminded us, agriculture and biodiversity have really been connected right from the very genesis, the very start of agriculture, as we've taken advantage of this. I would have to say also to thank Dr. Kuldeep Singh and others for his work. And when I think even here in ICRISAT of 130,000 plus accessions, that remarkable jewel of a gene bank where all of those characteristics, all of those traits that we've needed up until now, but that we will need into the next 10, 50, 100 years reside within that gene bank. So no doubt biodiversity becomes a key element. But I think we here will have a discussion about some of the policy initiatives. We know how policy and support around agriculture and food occurs, certainly within India. I, along with Dr. Gulati, would say I'm a lifelong learner. When I saw the PRACI talking about the fact that program support within India reaches almost 2% of the GDP, it gives you a sense of the investment that's being made. And of course, we know why that is around support to farmers, to making sure around livelihood, support for input, all of those things that you know better than I. But it also gives us a new lens. And I'm sure this is what we will discuss today about how that investment can help to support biodiversity, how it can make new opportunities for investing in research and development, in capital infrastructure and other kinds of activities. So I'm very much looking forward to this day. Again, you're very welcome to the campus here in Patancheru and to enjoy the time that you spend with us. And we're certainly looking forward to the new activities that will be occurring as well. So thank you again. I'm very much looking forward to the deliberations of the day. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Blade. Now I am honored to invite Dr. Ashok Gulati, distinguished professor Iqriar, to deliver the introductory remarks. Thank you very much, Pulvi. All protocols done. I'm supposed to introduce the topic and the topic's title is Repurposing Public Policies and Programs in Agriculture for Protecting Biodiversity. Before I come to policies and programs and what this study is about, I want to spend a minute on the backdrop. Why we are concerned with biodiversity today. Our tribe of Homo sapiens, the human mankind, it took us almost 300,000 years. 300,000 years all coming from Africa. In 1804 we were 1 billion, we multiplied to 1 billion. 300,000 years, 1 billion. Next billion on this planet was added in 123 years. By 1927 we became 2 billion. That is 1927. 2025 we are more than 8 billion people on this planet. Planet cannot feed this much population on its own natural strength. I remember Norman Borloo saying once that this planet has a capacity to feed maximum 4 billion people on its natural base. Who are the other 4 billion people who would like to volunteer to starve to death? No, but I think it's better if we join from the conference room now. But it's actually not. Why do we do that? I don't know what to do in this planet. Colleagues, people online, if you wouldn't mind muting your microphones, you're coming through into the conference room. Thank you very much. It can be muted right here. So, if humanity had to survive, it had to produce more to feed the stomach. And that's where agriculture from hunter to cultivation and then to industrial cultivation in a way started off. When we started doing that, we started in a way, you know, the forests were cleared. Then from the same land, we won three times, four times. Even in India, when we got independence, we were 35 crores. Today, we are 144 crores, four times more. And the planet and the boundary is the same. So, you had to produce more. That was the first condition because we had to survive. So, when you do that, and in the race to produce more, which was a necessity, and I want to give one little example. If you do not do that, in China, between 1958 to 61, the Great Leap Forward, 30 million people died of starvation. 30 million, three crores lost their lives because of starvation. India did not have that type of a situation, although we were very close to it in mid-60s, when we had two years of successive drought. And that's how the green revolution was brought in. Not the green revolution of this council, the green revolution, but the original green revolution. And within four or five years from a hugely deficit country in food, we were more or less coming to self-sufficiency. And today, except pulses and oil seeds. But we are a net exporter of agriculture today. Very few countries. China is the biggest net importer of food today. Even US, which people say is the largest exporter of agriculture, actually is a net importer of agriculture. The imports of agriculture are more than the exports of agriculture. India is the only big, large country which is still a net exporter of agriculture. So there is something good we have done. But in that entire process of producing more and feeding our largest population, we have neglected some of the things. Soil became a victim. Soil became a victim. Groundwater became a victim. Even the air became a victim. Even the biodiversity. So what we call SWAB. Soil, water, air and biodiversity. So that had to be. Now that India has emerged as the largest exporter of rice in the world. Of 61 million tons of global export of rice, 20 million is by India alone. So quite a bit going to Africa. So having done that reasonable self-sufficiency and some surpluses, I think it's time to give back to nature what we took away from nature. Improving soils, improving our groundwater, our air quality and biodiversity. Now this particular project and thanks to UNDP, is looking into public policies which impact biodiversity. To the best of my knowledge, this would be the first ever study which is looking into the public policy and public expenditures. Because policies in government is not by one line item. It can be just 50 crores program. But there could be another 150,000 crores program. So we have looked at 46 schemes of the government. Central government basically. And then when we went to three states, of course those, some of the important policies of the states have to be added. 46 schemes, 87 sub-components of that and 25 years of data. From 2000 onwards we have looked at what is happening. And then across eight ministries because the policies that impact agriculture and biodiversity is not only in agriculture ministry. The budget of, for example, fertilizer subsidy which is resting in another ministry is bigger than the entire budget of agriculture ministry. So how is that impacting? So we had to look at that. Another one that food subsidy than two lakh crores is the biggest thing that is resting in another ministry. Then Manrega is resting in another. So we have looked at eight ministries which impact the agriculture and also the biodiversity concerns. And how much is the expenditure and over the last 25 years how that has been changing and impacting. So we have made an impact whether these policies have negative impact. What we call the detrimental impact on biodiversity. There are mixed impacts. Certain policies have something good and something bad also. We have looked at which we feel are positive impacting policies. And then there are certain policies which are neutral. I don't want to steal the thunder of Reena. She will be presenting the details of this study. But just to give you this flavor and I'll take only one little example. Because as I said fertilizer subsidy is greater than the agriculture ministry's budget. So if you don't look at fertilizer thing and you are talking about agriculture and biodiversity. You are missing the big elephant on the way. Fertilizer it's very interesting. Fertilizer along with hiding variety seeds and water gave us the food security. But then what is happening on the fertilizer scene today. The public policy. Our urea is almost 85% subsidized. 85%. P and K somewhat less. And then most of the micronutrients almost negligible. So the farmer is tuned to putting too much of urea. Fertilizer means more urea more urea. And especially in Punjab and a belt overuse of urea. We came to know that it is impacting the soils. It is impacting the crop health. And ultimately it is impacting the human health. I never knew earlier before this study. That excess nitrogen use is leading to diabetes and thyroid problems. I had been taking thyroid tablets for quite some time. And never knew that the wheat that I am consuming is causing this. So you have zinc deficiency in the soils. And zinc deficiency is leading to deficiency of zinc in wheat and rice. Which is leading to stunting amongst children. The wheat of today they say is 33% less zinc than what it was in 1960s. So this whole imbalance that has taken place. The plant is not consuming more than 35 to 40% of nitrogen that is being applied. And rest is going in the environment. Nitrous oxide. 273 times the carbon dioxide. If it is leaching into the water. Nitrate content is increasing. And causing cancer. And in Punjab there is a cancer train that goes from Punjab to Rajasthan. So all these ill effects. Of today's policies. How these policies have evolved. And there is need to correct them today. Okay. We cannot blame these policies totally. Because these are the policies that gave us food security at some stage. But we need to repurpose. One important thing that I will say here. We are not advocating abolish all these subsidies. Politically it is impossible. But repurpose that in a manner. That they should not be directly detrimental to biodiversity concerns. And how to do that. That is an art of economics. Okay. Other countries have done it. So we are not the first ones. You go to China. They don't give fertilizer subsidy directly by hugely subsidizing fertilizer prices. But they give to the farmer. What is called the aggregate input subsidy support. On per hectare basis. Per mu basis. Their unit is mu. Can we do that? Can we do direct benefit transfer to the farmers. And then deregulate this sector. And let the market decide what the prices would be. The market will give that signal. How much of N should be consumed. How much of P and K. And how much of zinc. And of course we have to do some education. Extension work of the farmers. So what are the benefits. But once you deregulate the sector. The fertilizer sector and the industry will do innovations and products. And compete in improving the practices. Within the same money. I can bet. You can get double the mileage. You will improve your nutrient use efficiency from 35-40% to easily 55-60%. And if you use drip it can be even 90%. And all those experiments and that revolution will be unleashed. This will be a reform like the 91 reforms. For the rest of the economy. Agriculture needs deregulation. This is a huge investment in fertilizers. Similar thing is in food subsidy. Which is more than 2 lakh crores. And you are giving free wheat and rice. To more than 800 million people. And then you ask the people to consume millets. Who is going to consume millets when they are getting free wheat and rice? So the 2 things don't gel well. Why don't you give them food coupons. Of that value. And ask them these 20 commodities. Pulses, oil seeds, milk, anda. Whatever you want to take. Eggs. You can take that. Food which is more nutritious. So this is what the meaning of repurposing is. That instead of hooking only wheat and rice. Which is much less nutritious than pulses. Or milk. Or eggs. Why don't you give them that option. The moment you give that option. There will be diversified. Diversification in the demand. And which will lead to diversification in the production basket. Because at present. Since you are excessively giving rice and wheat. To the people. Farmers are producing rice and wheat. We have mountains of rice. In the country. And that has caused imbalance in the production basket. So. Our study basically looks at different possibilities of repurposing. Again I emphasize. We are not recommending abolish these. No. We are saying reorient. Realign. Repurpose. Repurpose. Them. To make it from detrimental. To biodiversity. To at least neutral. If not positive. If you can make something positive. Because you will save lot of things. There are a lot of leakages in food and fertilizer subsidy. And if you can save something out of that. And put it directly. On the policies which are biodiversity positive. Then it will be a win-win game. Productivity will remain same. Diversification will take place on its own. Because the demand has diversified. And the soil. The swab. The soil. Air. Water. And biodiversity. Will not be as adversely impacted. As it is impacting right now. The policies that were right. In 60s and 70s. Have outlived their. Usefulness. As they say. If the Ganga. Stops flowing. It will start stinking. The backdrop has changed. The policies must change. We are not in huge scarcity of basic staples. We are in surplus. And therefore new policies. What is that repurposing. That I will leave to. Reena. Once again. Thank you. Himanshuji. For agreeing to host us. And maybe we can. At some stage. Release that. Report. Yeah. Over to you. Thank you. Thank you. Dr. Gulati for setting the stage. For today's discussion. Now to address. To deliver the special remarks. I. Welcome. Dr. Angela. To. UNDP resident representative. In India. To. Give her. Remarks. Thank you so much. Good morning everyone again. And namaste. I'm going to add one more. Standing on the protocol. Allow me to stand on the protocol. So it's such a pleasure to be here today. And I want to join. In thanking. If you said for hosting us. In this beautiful campus. And I definitely will be back. And this is a really timely conversation. And we've. You've heard all the passion already. All the reasons why. We're here today. But I want to give you the arguments. That are going to touch policy makers. You know, sometimes we come with the facts. It doesn't move. So. I'm going to go through a few of the things. That really are the story. That is behind the work that we've done. Here today. So. We're here to talk about a challenge. Right. How do you produce more food? More food. More food. How do you produce more food? More food. More food. More food. More food. More food. would ensure economic security, and still protect the ecosystems that make both possible. Right? And the study that we'll hear about later today, that was commissioned by UNDP under the BioFin initiative in partnership with ICRIA, is really about public spending can either drive ecosystem degradation and collapse, or it could become a force for regeneration. So nature's diversity is what sustains life as we know it, and it also supports our economies, it supports our health, it supports our food systems, and most importantly, our shared future. It makes economic sense to conserve biological diversity. We will hear examples of bees that pollinate our crops, forests that purify our water, and store carbon wetlands that prevent floods. And we know that nature provides ecosystem services that are valued at about 140 trillion per year. So that already is something worth preserving. So if biodiversity collapses, so will jobs, so will food systems, and so will our economies. And we know that India is one of the world's most biologically diverse countries. And the fact that the government has recently updated its national biodiversity strategy action plan in 2024, congratulations to the team, is a strong signal that India is already working towards a nature positive future. So we're not, the train is already moving, and here we are trying to support and accelerate that pace. At the same time, as it was so eloquently mentioned, in many parts of the country, we are seeing the impacts of the overuse of chemicals and sustainable water use, so that's already apparent. And it's an unintended consequence of the farm subsidies and the price support, because these incentives have encouraged farmers to grow wheat and rice, and also discourage other nutritious crops. And just as an example, from 1960 to 2023, the area under wheat and rice expanded from 47 million hectares to more than 84 million today, while the land used for millets, pulses, and other traditional crops has dropped. As a result, it affects not only nature, but also, as has been mentioned, nutrition, soil health, and climate resilience. And we know that globally, governments spend 2.6 trillion a year on environmentally harmful subsidies. And this is why, and India is not, is no exception, as we've heard, but this is why the Kunming-Montreal global diversity framework to reduce harmful subsidies and promote those that help nature is so important. And India is at the forefront of implementing this, and I think you'll have seen the biodiversity targets here. So, while India's investments in improving food security and reducing poverty through subsidies have been very productive, now is the time to mitigate the negative impacts by transforming biodiversity negative incentives into biodiversity positive investments. So, that's why the study that we're discussing here is so important, because it offers real practical ways forward to transition from biodiversity negative policies and programs, along those with mixed impacts, to biodiversity neutral and biodiversity positive incentives. It shows, as was mentioned, how to repurpose the existing fertilizer subsidies and reorient agricultural priorities from just growing more grains to diverse food grains, while also offering premium support for low-carbon crops. At no point in time do we want to see our farmers going without, how good their livelihoods are affected. But we are trying to change the way the incentives work so that we can maintain those incomes and even increase them, because if you're spending less on fertilizers and producing more, then everybody wins, right? So, it will protect nature, keep income stable, and reduce the use of chemical fertilizers, so that we look at climate smart farming, because we're also looking to the future, right? We don't want to make choices today that reduce the options for the generations to come. We want to support farmers to grow wider ranges of crops that have core benefits for human health, economic health, and also environmental health. So, the good news is that India is already moving in the right direction. They're promoting greener policies like the PM-PRANAM scheme, the National Mission on Natural Farming. So, there are already programs and systems in place that are moving. So, what we need to do now is to accelerate this change through collaboration and teamwork. The Ministry of Agriculture can't do it alone. We have to have the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Finance, Rural Development, all working together, and also working with farmers, businesses, researchers, and civil society for this to succeed. So, I'd like to close by saying that conserving biodiversity is the only pathway to safeguarding our economies, our food, and our future. We now know what needs to happen. The study will tell us how, but the question is what next? And this is where UNDP comes in. We're proud to support the government of India and partners in moving from these policies and recommendations to concrete actions. We're committed to working with all of you to make this happen because we believe with smarter policies and more efficient and effective use of public funds, we can protect biodiversity while also supporting strong and secure livelihoods for the next generation. Thank you and I look forward to hearing the discussion today. Thank you, Dr. Lusigi, for your remarks. It is now my pleasure to invite Dr. Himanshu Patak to share his special address. Thank you. Thank you very much. Of course, Dr. Gulati, Angela, Reddy, Stern, and all very distinguished participants for this very important meeting. Just taking it forward. So first of all, thank you very much, Dr. Gulati, for giving the broad objective of what we are trying to do. Absolutely no question that repurposing has to be done because the purpose has been different. So when the purpose itself has changed, then with the same policy and same work plan and same activities, you cannot reach to other point when the whole objective has got changed. And at that point of time, when the policy was formulated, as you very rightly said, there was a need for that. But now the things are different. Things are different nationally. Things are different internationally. Things are different in food front. Things are different in nature front and all others. So everything is almost different what it used to be, say around 40, 50 or 60 years back, when all these policies, Green Revolution, everything started. So there is absolutely no doubt in our mind that there is a need to revisit, to repurpose the whole dimensions and paradigm of this policy. Again, there is absolutely no doubt that nature cannot be disturbed or compromised. You know, for my younger friends, not to our senior people here, the very first law of agriculture, which was formulated sometimes in 1830s or so, that law is called as law of restitution. Law of restitution means whatever you are taking from nature has to be given back. If you would like to continue with the kind of production or the kind of services, including ecosystem services, whatever you are harvesting from nature. And that was the first law, law of restitution. Then, of course, all other rules and science and new things, all those come. So that is absolutely important. What we say in Hindi, and I shall translate it in English also, Pragati and Prakriti should go hand in hand. Pragati is progress, all this development. Prakriti is nature. So nature and development should go hand in hand. This should not be going in two different directions. And then if you go in two different directions, at one point or the other, you are going to collapse. Because these are so intricately related. One is fully dependent on the other. And nowadays we talk about one health. Many of us might also be working on one health. We talk of soil health, we talk of water health, crop health and so on. If you disturb one, the other is going to be affected. If the soil is no good, then whatever you do, the crop is not going to be good. If soil is unhealthy, the crop is going to be unhealthy. If the crop is unhealthy, the animals or human beings who are consuming, those again, they are going to be unhealthy. And again in Hindi, I tell it to our farmers also, and you can note it. We say Jal, Jamin, Jalbayo, Jangal, Januar, Jivan, Janta. These are all so closely related. Water, soil, climate, forest, animal, human, and all their relations are so closely related. If you disturb one, the other is going to be affected. And you cannot escape. There is no science in this world so far invented which will escape you from this circle, from this one health. So from that particular point of view also, we have to take care of, and when you talk of swab, suddenly biodiversity is one of the very important aspects. Now let me put before you some of the things which we are doing at national level and also at international level. And this will be giving you some broader ideas of what kind of repurposing or what kind of policies we should be formulated. Now this biodiversity and its importance, it is not known earlier. It has been known for, you know, from when we have started exploiting the biodiversity. Almost all the varieties, which you call them Hyalding or Biopertibate or Climate Resilient, somewhere or the other we have developed all these varieties from some source, somewhere, from some germplasm collected from somewhere. And then we have put new science, new technology, and now we have got Hyalding varieties, which are climate resilient, which are biopertibate and so on. So the base has always been that. And biodiversity conservation, not only first, exploration, collection, conservation, utilization, and of course sharing or multiplication has been a part of not only national agriculture, but also international agriculture. And CGIR, conservative group of international agriculture research, has really played a very important role for collection, conservation, and also sharing of all these germplasm. And if I give you some of the numbers, you'll be really feeling very happy that currently around 6 million excess, excess ends, are conserved in over 850 national gene banks in 116 countries, 4 regional and 13 international gene banks, which are registered. Besides, there are certain other gene banks also which are not registered, but then they are also working on that. In 11 CGIR gene banks, out of all these 15 CGNs, 11 has got their gene banks, which is housed around 80 or 0.8 million excesses of over 30 crops and their wild relatives. And if you come to Ikrisad alone, in Ikrisad we have got 132,000 excesses, 132,000 excesses of 8 millets and 3 legumes. And we distribute annually around 80,000 to 100,000 junk persons all over the world, sharing with the researchers, with the students, and many other organizations. And since the inception of this organization in 1972, we have distributed 1.72 million seed samples to around 150 countries all over the world. And if you come to national system, Indian Council of Agriculture Research, we have got national bureaus for almost every commodity on which we are working. For plant, we have got NBPGR, National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, and there we have got a collection of 4.75 lakhs, excesses of different crops. For example, for rice itself, we have got around 1 lakh. Besides this plant, we have got bureaus for animal genetic resources, we have got bureaus for fish genetic resources, we have got bureaus for insect. Yeah, insect resources also. We have got a bureau for important microbes, which we could find to be important for agriculture, and also bureau for soil, and so on. So whatever, I mean, any commodity we can think of, we have tried to have some kind of bureau collect the germplasm or other materials, preserve them, multiply them, and share with all others. And these are in the national system with the government participation. But besides this, if you go to informal sectors, go to the farmers. Yesterday only I was in a tribal district of West Bengal, Bakura Court, and there is one NGO which is preserving at least 12 to 13,000 of junk. So they have collected from various tribal villages and locations, and they do not have, of course, these kinds of, you know, cold storage, 4 degree or minus 20 degree, or something like that. But they have got, developed their own system of collection, preservation with, you know, urban ports and those kinds of things, certain kinds of space where the temperature is a little bit moderated, not, of course, fully controlled. But then they are doing these kinds of activities for the last many, many years or so. And this is not one example. There are n number of examples, not only in this country, if you need to go to Africa or any other country. Again, in Africa, of course, we are all familiar with, they've got a very unique kind of system of collection, preservation, also sharing the germplasm and other materials with their neighbors, with the fellow farmers, and so on. So these kinds of activities are going on. But then, in spite of all these efforts, still the problem of biodiversity decline or erosion, whatever term you can use, is really, really not. Again, there are lots of data on this. People say more than 35% of some of the biodiversity we have almost lost. And as the climate change, as the pollution level are increasing almost day by day, climate change is making almost record in every year or every month or so. Pollution level is also increasing in most parts of the world. And because of this, this erosion of biodiversity is going to be even faster and faster. So when you keep all of these things in mind, certainly, we really need to revisit and repurpose the overall policy of government and to sensitize people how important these are and what kind of policy we should be promoting. And I must congratulate Dr. Gulati and, of course, your whole team for taking up this issue, working on it, assessing and then going through all kinds of data and literature, and then coming out with some kind of policy which you feel. Of course, we are going to release that particular publication now. So first of all, let me congratulate you. And thank you, you and your team for taking up these very important activities. But before I conclude, one or two suggestions I would like to give for our discussion and for our, you know, collaboration later. Number one is, whenever we talk of preservation, collection, exploration, or whatever activities we do with the germplasma biodiversity, science can really play very importantly in all of these areas. So whenever we are going to advocate for any policy, we really need to capture the role of science, which it has already played, or which it is going to play in time to come. You know, a whole lot of new science, new tools have emerged. In today's world, this genome editing, AI, and all these kinds of things can really change the whole way of the things of working, the way we used to work, say, around even five years back. Today, we are working in a totally different kind of era. AI and genome editing, these are going to change almost the entire kinds of things. So how science and technology will be again, a central part of the whole policy, and how we are going to harness the benefit of these new science and new tools should be a part of this one. Second, again, with little bit caution, Dr. Gulati, whenever we say something against the development of new science, great revolution, and some people have got a tendency to exaggerate it. So, but we should be totally, our decision should be based on information, collection, analysis, and so on. Just for example, this cancer train. Just a few days back, I was, we are really going to write an article on that. This cancer train is not only because of agriculture. Let me give one of two examples, why it is not because of that. There are places where number of cancer patients are more, but they are not applying any pesticide in the tribal areas. So you cannot directly link it to pesticides. Again, all those patients who are coming, they are not full from the rural areas who are directly in connection with this. And there are other examples also to show. So it is not always right to paint something which we cannot explain and then say it is because of this technology. So that might not be the case. Say pollution of groundwater with nitrogen, nitrogen, nitrate they say. Again, the data shows, and not for one year data, or many years data, that application of urea is not the real culprit for increased nitrate concentration. It is worth it. Rather, nitrate concentration is more in the city areas. From where that is coming? From all those organic waste material, sewage and so on. If nitrogen is there in organic sources, that will take more time to decompose and will reach to the groundwater. If it is urea, urea, of course it has got several negative aspects also. I am not saying that urea is the perfect material. But then urea has one of two good qualities because of which it has become so popular. One is within 72 years, the whole urea will be hydrolyzed to ammonium. And then in another two or three days it will be converted to nitrate. If that nitrate is not taken up by the crop, it will be denitrified. For example, in rice kind of condition where there is some margins of water and converted back into nitrogen which will go to the atmosphere. And even if that nitrate reaches, after some time it will be denitrified. So many samples of groundwater nitrate concentrations we have found in the rural areas where the fertilizer application is very high, there you will not find that the nitrate concentration is very high there. Nitrate concentration sometimes or more often is more in the areas where fertilizer application is quite less. So my suggestion is that as we are talking of a broader policy of how all these things would be addressed, we have to really go into the depth of the reason, the cause, why it is happening. If we do not go into that much depth, then probably we will be advocating something which is not based on science. And that will be, again, a kind of dangerous proposition in times to come. So friends, with these few remarks, once again, let me welcome each and every one of you. This is extremely, extremely important. As I said in the beginning, and Dr. Gulati and also you talked about, that we really have to rethink, we have to revisit and repurpose the whole thing. Because the way biodiversity is declining, we cannot sustain it for so long. And once biodiversity is gone, we are going to lose several of the things. No new thing is going to come. And as they say that nature is our only refuge. If we ignore nature, then probably nature also will start ignoring us. And then we will not be in a position to manage that condition of nature. So I really appreciate this effort. And with this discussion, a very fruitful one. And of course, the policy proposition, which you are going to make, should be accepted. And all of us will be working together. And in the whole process, you are going to be able to do a very important thing. And I think that the policy is going to be in terms of partnership, in doing science, in conservation, taking it forward, demonstration, whatever way you feel, ICRISET will be very, very happy to be a part of this very noble initiative. Thank you very much once again, and welcome each and every one. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Pathak. We now invite Dr. C. Achlander Reddy to share his keynote address. Dr. C. Achlander Reddy to share his keynote speaker in the chat. Dr. C. Achlander Reddy, Dr. C. Achlander Reddy, Dr. C. Achlander Reddy, Dr. C. Achlander Reddy, distinguished experts, policymakers, researchers, farmers. it's a great privilege for me to be here with all of you to participate on a a historical round table i should say because this type of round table was not held on such a topic earlier i stand to be corrected if i am wrong so every long journey starts with a small step and the topic the team the report which is going to be released prepared are you know steered under the able leadership of dr ashore gulati and his colleagues of acre and of course in collaboration with the undp is really a game-changing effort to what extent we achieve success hereafter time will tell so friends the already learned my co-speakers have given a very deep insights the background and the purpose for which we have assembled here i had a autonomous and autonomous and statutory body so my language will be more or less more of a regulatory nature which is generally not liked by scientists citizens intellectuals so it will be having a tinge of that regulatory flavor here and there but anyhow i would like to adapt to the new environment and to be to to share my random thoughts with the august gathering here friends first i would like to say that there is a science you may be soil science genetics breeding whatever you may call it but the biological diversity act is an act it's a legal instrument when the act governs science there are bound to be problems the science is exact it's evidence-based law is interpretative and it changes as the society evolves so these are the issues uh in managing the what i would say genetic resources and biological resources because i am giving this background because here the the theme or the subject which we are dealing today as of now it is a new concept there is no law no regulation to say that you have to do like this you have to put this much fertilizer or this much for virus is nothing like that it is all voluntarily yeah this has come out evidence-based uh report has been prepared thanks to a clear and the unDP numbers so just to say that what is biodowsky because biodiversities are diffused subjective when compared to climate change climate change has make a made a huge strides huge progress but conventions both the conventions were adopted in 1992 to rio but the biodiversity convention is lagging behind which i think that rangelia would agree with me in this respect because we have seen i attended almost four cops by god's grace or whatever you may say luck uh a person at the right moment if he's there is pushed into the stream so in the same way by i attended four and i was sbi chair also subsidy body and implementation so i got i could see the at a very close range what is happening what happened and what is going to happen that means in the center of this so i will not uh i will go now d i mean directly into the in today's this subject biodiversity uh as we know is the basic foundation for the progress in the agriculture i need not explain you're all experts you understand what what does it mean so when i say random thoughts you can see that only three crops rice wheat and maize contribute to more than 51 percent of the plant-based calorie to the humankind now this was not so in the past if you go industrial level before in the cell revolution or at least 100 years back if you go this was not like this you know what's going to be a problem and i should say that uh i also of course this is a much can be said i mean you can differ with me but as far as my knowledge goes at least before in the still be advent of britishers or before the advent of the industrial revolution india was not deficient in food grains it may be due to colonization or many other regions or some whatever it may be i can cite one example of this where we are sitting here this was called hyderabad state in the past a part of maharashtra part of karnataka the present it was a completely dry land complete nowadays we got the irrigation but during this day also it started from 11th 12th century kakati has have constructed series of lakes thereafter kulikudu and others have come the nisam has become the richest person in the world how raja having no irrigation nothing having a dry land because the farmers were having they lived along with the nature the example of moksha innovation our three lakes which supplied water to the hyderabad and it has become pearl city of the world because of the gravity flow that means what i mean to say is that nature they have utilized for the progress of the economy or the welfare of the people i mean to say that they are more or less lived how to live with the nature and use it without spoiling the nature or without causing the damage to the nature so now as dr glott has mentioned we have come to a full circle that now we are realizing that soil health 20 years back i never heard about soil health or 30 years back human health we heard from this but soil health nobody at all this terminology has not come into the day to say that international level or national level so soil health means water soil biota nothing but soil and soil biodiversity so keeping this point of uh in view the repurposing of the incentives is detrimental to biodiversity in the sense that now we realize that soil biota is required for a marathon run sustainable production short-term production okay 10 years 20 years 30 years you can see is apply fertilizers in a big way as rightly mentioned by our dj christette the regulated or self-imposed discipline in application of fertilizers will definitely will take care of the soil but it rarely happens in the field people apply you know in such a way that more than required especially the the soils have become sterile and we all know that organic carbon has decreased a lot in the indian soils it may be a 0.1.2 something somewhere like that it was a once upon a time two percent so this has a completely you know under nourishment of the soil whatever may be the reason reason reasons are known and unknown so what i what the purpose of this today's this thing is that now we have to sensitize about these losses and articulation is required before the political exhibit and the policy makers baba this is happening and let us change the course of our journey from here now let me quote some examples from the industrial sector we all know nokia was a very prominent mobile but they didn't realize that smartphones are going to come and they vanished they did not change at the right time gone case america was boasting about the big cars japan has entered with small cars finished it so before something happened to us in the graph while probably everything is where is good we should think from where the problem would crop up so when we achieved a self-sufficiency and uh we are exporting 20 million tons of rice to other countries we should think that something may happen suddenly and this happened in the health this happened in the health sector the covet has given a right shock to all of us so because of the disturbance of the biodiversity these things have happened and it's going they're going to happen and we are seeing now nowadays also that the the every microorganism everything they also like human beings they also develop they also evolve they also develop resistance anti this antibiotic resistance is very common now so the point i am trying to impress upon is that as already mentioned by scholars here the soil health is related to human health and one health policy is being you know nowadays the government is pushed by government of india very very seriously now just for some uh statistics this thing the coming one shall uh adopted uh you know for december 2022 madam angela has already uh mentioned the overall targets we see 23 now let us focus the focus of this per study is a target 18 but 23 targets we collectively see offers a road map to reverse the trend which we are moving forward in a very controlled way in the sense that controlled aggression as dr gulat has mentioned two extremes are bad too much application of further and suddenly stopping out that will lead to big problems in the country of 1.4 billion population so what the target 18 mentioned 500 billion uh the estimated of incentives which are harmful to biodiversity have to be reduced in the sense that harmful subsidies have to be pulled back 200 okay positive we have to invest so total they identified 700 billion uh you know to the extent of that one we have to contribute to the biodiversity conservation both the negatives we have to bring down contribute positives so to that extent value valuation now friends we i i take little you know this opportunity to share with you that india is one of the 46 countries which has released national biodiversity strategy and action plan out of 196 parties for a country like ours with all the difficulties we could somehow make it with in collaboration with the un dp the national better state that and with all the 23 ministries contributing their knowledge and their statistics their information we are released it now the target 18 when it was uh articulated the coming motor global fire disorder 2025 has been given to identify and all the things negatives and 2030 we have to take action but to be frank with you having realized that i mean our own country's problems because these targets are never imposed i mean they never say that you have to follow you follow as per your national circumstances and capabilities so we mentioned what we did we they gave freedom so we framed our own national biodiversity targets capturing the spirit of the coming motor global but we never mentioned any years and dates in our national where does she targets so because our capabilities our national circumstances are different from the rest of the 195 parties we are 196 parties so this is a what i mean to say is that we have already taken care in the international when we i attended the i i was a part of delegation so we came back and we said that we cannot in toto copy and paste the target 18 as mentioned in the coming model global where it's and there was a freedom given liberty given to frame your own national where the each country has so we framed like that that is what i wanted to highlight here before the sagas gallery now coming to another point i would like to you maybe and you you must be knowing it but i would like to repeat it when people said that oh no this has to come down this has spoiling the health and that's so what i would like to highlight is that we have only 2.4 percent of the land area supporting about 17 percent of the human population almost 16 percent of the cattle population of the world and still we are considered as 17 mega one of the 17 mega bioders countries thanks to the people of india they are they are undergoing a lot of problems by keeping this as a mega birders country you may ask me why how why you see the man animal conflict is going on in our country daily one person is being killed either by a bear or by tiger or by leopard the sacrifices which we are making this country to remain one of the 17 megabytes is huge if i may i may be permitted to say entire europe has no primary forest it is all artificial forest we have still huge chunk of primary funds with this amount i mean quite published so biodoste angle that because when we discuss with the media intellectuals policy makers especially political exhibit these are the things because we are all here to uh push the idea of repurposing then for that some background has to be given that is what i am trying to share with you not that uh you do not know about it now two things out of all the subsidies which are very distinct chemical fertilizers irrigation power which are given free almost freely of course to some extent and this has resulted in huge rice and you know wheat cultivation and this trend has to be we need to articulate and present before the powers that be that baba kindly think about your your own grandsons and future this thing if you want your lineage to survive in this world better everything then they will understand this thing now i would like to make one provocative suggestion which you may not may i like it the forest conservation act after having come it has greatly reduced the diversion of forest land to the non-forest purposes i see all over the i mean whenever i go from hazard about to warangal or any other banglore this thing all beautiful very fertile agricultural lands are being converted to real estate so that is a huge loss of biodiversity that that soil we cannot this oil scientists are here or scientists i mean dgs have may agree with me that in order to form a spoil it takes hundreds of years one centimeter of soil we are not realizing it i'm not saying that a real estate should not be there building i also need a house and this thing but the way the free leave without any regulation the fertile agriculture lands we have a lambda land capability classification soil scientists know about it so we can identify some certain lands cannot be so like forest conservation act agriculture land conservation act also has to come into play then only this mad diversion of very fertile agriculture lands can be cuttle but this is a very sensitive subject and the political executives may not like in the industry but in but those who are interested really in the society they agree at least in morally they will not speak out externally as in the under present circumstances so this is one of the major steps india has to take because you cannot survive with this 1.4 billion people and converting all i'm not saying that other agriculture lands you have a land capability class which they everything so the highly fertile size cannot be diverted it's a crime in that is my personal view i'm not saying that all of you should agree with that so this trend has to come out to conserve the bad it is a policy issue these are we are also dealing with the policy issues as of now now i would like to give what is the soil and soil health and such a practical example which is which is going to become uh once it is implemented and once it is taken to logical conclusion it is going to create sensation in our country what is that i'll share with us being a chairman of national biodiversity authority we have completed almost the process but final stages may have you know there is a dapur village in nasik district in maharashtra one company called ms advanced enzyme technologies limited have collected from 2002 to 2003 2004 soil samples from dapur village which are randomly small village about 250 households now by 2022 access benefit sharing mechanism so they identified two microorganisms i would like to also share bacillus coagulans and saccharomyces bolandi with that they prepared lot of probiotics and now that village is going to get 200 households or 250 71 lakh rupees he had they misused and what abused the soil these two microorganisms would not have survived they would not have got a simple style they have not used any other bioresources for bioresources are available within the soil so this we are going to shortly transfer this amount from national biodiversity fund account and we have come and constitute a committee because suddenly if you give so many lakhs to so they are under shock now actually how come this so we there is a system we trace by all these things are there we are implementing nba and state better schools are meant for that purpose so one example of soil how a wealth from the soil how because the science has evolved so much microorganisms microorganisms are going to rule the in future they are going to play a role in every you know from antibiotics to pharmaceuticals to cosmetics to xyz so the soil health and soil and soil biota and the repurposing of the these harmful subsidies how they are causing and if they are retained this is one example sir undisturbed soils and unfertilized or unspoiled this this has given so this is a point i would like to highlight with a practical example so friends uh two more examples one more example i would like to give sensitizing the political executive by what is by a general thing when you speak you know when we go for a music there it will be a small alapana and small introduction and all the things you know it's small starts with that so sir where does the end up it's a monthly day so two examples i convinced one or two politicians by myself orissa has given an order that six lakh palmeratrix have to be grown now and bhar is considering that is ban on failing of palmeratrix which are plenty in telangana our fellows i am from left and right we are failing it left and right almost now extinct of the pulmonary will not be seen in palm for various reasons i'll not go into time is a constant now what is that now science has come into play that if you carbon dioxide increase in the ppm i don't know the chemical reaction or whatever it is the lightning will come very drastically during the rains and thunderstorms and it has killing thousands and thousands of people who are grazing were on the roads and these things but the scientists and this research is going on already the we have come come to a conclusion that more number of polymer at risk retention is better so that then we can minimize the risk from dying i mean the lightning affecting the human beings so this is going on you can see in the google all news are spreading like anything so to start with that how biodust is important why to conserve and protect by repurposing these things these are the things because communication science is there and every i mean all these things which can ameliorate the social country but communication is the art and science it is not that easy even if something is good to say that it is good it needs a lot of strategy though nobody will even a highly intellectual person also will not accept because he's already having a fixed ideas so learning and lee learning is is the process so for that to take to push the from paradigm shift from one direction of thinking taking a u-turn or side turn or small term you need convincing uh you know capability of articulation of the whole subject matter in a presentable way in a convincing manner i mean to say so these are the uh issues and uh one last thing i would like to mention that telangana being the first state which has come out with a state bird as the action plan in the country thanks to un dp again uh madam angela and your this organization has done wonderful uh this thing and uh uh coordinated with dr wally monica has not come she represented center for in ah okay she has played a major role from this thing and scientific and uh bringing out all the technical people together now they are going for the little bit of you know state biofin this why i'm telling state where to section post co adoption of the coming motor global virus framework this has come so in this definitely our today's subject matter the point is being well laid out and it is needed needs to be implemented we have already we are having statewide a strategic action plan and this document of the career will go hand in hand and it will we definitely uh play a major role especially the state planning board of the telangana they will they are all you know the politician also is an intellectual there so we can easily convince first him then we can move forward so this is what i would like to share and thank you for your kind attention and thanks to everyone for facilitating my presence here thank you very much thank you thank you to all the uh technicaries on stage for your remarks uh we can now move on to the next session uh thing of releasing the publication so it's our uh the joint report by icreer undp and biofin titled uh repurposing agri food policies for biodiversity uh co-authored by dr reena singh myself dr ruchy pant and dr ashop gulati if you could all stand up and unbox the report you s you you uh you you you Thank you. All the participants and the guests now to move to the right hand side of the room for the group photo. And after that we can take a short tea break and then reconvene for the technical session. Tea will be just... Yeah. So first we go out for the group photo on the right side and then the tea break on the left side of the room. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And the Thank you. Thank you. but with respect to the markets and the area why is it just a few crops which dominated just a V tries seven crop species they console 73% and if we just talk about just wheat and rice it just 51% of the overall production area it takes so we have categorized on that basis the incentives which have the mixed impacts which have the positive impacts which have the neutral impacts like that for T2024 which is the total agri-foods fear the total the budget and this amount is 7,076 billion and out of that 2,673 billion it's basically have the mixed impacts on the biodiversity which is primarily comprising of the food and the irrigation subsidy because both of them they are contributing towards the you know the food security targets and then the biodiversity detrimental it's primarily with respect to the fertilizer subsidy but when we come to the state level then even the power subsidy we have categorized as the detrimental then we have this biodiversity positive which is 1483 which is majorly the developmental schemes and then we have the income support activities which are coming under the biodiversity neutral so as a percentage it's the 36 percent mixed 28 percent biodiversity detrimental 22 percent biodiversity positive and 13 percent neutral and we have to definitely think of repurposing this biodiversity detrimental incentives to shift to the at least to the biodiversity neutral if not to the positive so this is just a comparative scenario of the three states and we can see that with respect to the incentives Punjab it's the the incentives they are more towards the negative incentives it's basically the fertilizer and the power with their the fertilizer because they are highly or you know they are giving a lot of fertilizers so the fertilizer subsidy is also being devoted there so that is one thing and then the state government is giving the free power so power subsidy is coming there so it's 52 percent with respect to the mixed impacts is 27 then biodiversity positive 17 and six it's only six percent neutral in madhya pradesh we can see okay 35 percent is the mixed range because of that more of the food subsidy and it has more biodiversity positive initiatives and incentives and 20 percent is the detrimental and then 14 percent is a neutral and telangana it's the highest you know 40 40 percent it's the highest it's the highest and it's the highest the highest it's coming to be in the range of the positive than 26 percent mixed in 17 percent neutral and 17 percent is the negative so what we have seen during our study that as we are building like the incentives they are mostly skewed towards paddy and we definitely propose that they need to be repurposed to other crops so as to encourage diversification so we have on the basis of the consumption of the inputs like how much is the you know the inputs is going to that particular crops with respect to water power and then fertilizer and everything so paddy is definitely receiving more and then with respect to other crops and they are also the paddy is also having the high profitability so that is the reason they are receiving higher incentives and they are paying higher having higher incentives and the profitability is also as well average baby см Robby and L so healthy data silky people continue to invest and they get complicit the pace of leadership hierarchy and then the export material tio days is a he's dribb term 1975 when there are the funds that areatas orач are probably differentiwated So that's the reason they are receiving higher incentives and the profitability is also high. So the farmers, they are going towards paddy. So this is what our proposal is. Whatever saving we are doing with respect to diversification from paddy to other crops, so that should be given to other crops. This is what has been proposed under one of the policy briefs for Punjab and Aranya. In Telangana also we have tried to look at the cropping pattern range, and we found that even in Telangana it is now moving into the footsteps of Punjab. Like in 2014-15 the rice area was 1.4 million hectare, but now it has moved to 4.9 million hectare. So that's a very huge jump, and it's not, with respect to the environment and biodiversity, definitely it's not a good trend. And because the government of India has also started procuring rice from Telangana, so that is also one of the reasons, and we have tried to look at the crop diversification index. So India as a whole is kind of, you know, it's a mixed, it's diverse. And it is, and Punjab, Madhya Pradesh is also in lines with India, but Punjab and Telangana, they are towards the monocropping trends. Telangana has, is the first state which has brought out their strategy, biodiversity strategy and action plan, which is aligning with the global biodiversity framework. And they also have those biodiversity management committees, and they have those asset benefit mechanisms very much well developed. And we definitely would like to propose Telangana, they should take the lead in demonstrating how to, you know, become a model state for this reduction in the fertilizer consumption, because they are also doing a lot of fertilizer consumption. And if they can successfully implement PM Pranam, and then other states can take that, you know, learn from them. So this is the overall synthesis of our recommendation, that what we are proposing is that the fertilizer subsidy threshold, it, we could work out the threshold of the fertilizer subsidy. It's not like, you know, it's everybody, they're free to just take whatever number of bags they would like to take. So as per the soil health cards and the common days of fertilizer and the savings in fertilizer to be repurposed through PM Pranam, that is one thing. Another thing is that we, it is in the agriculture policies from more food grains towards the diverse food grains, where Dr. Gulati has mentioned regarding the food coupons, like it's not only for wheat and rice, we should try to give for others. And then we should move away from the baddie skewed incentives to crop neutral incentives, where, for example, paddy is getting the higher incentives. So that incentives, they should be given to other crops. In Madhya Pradesh and in Telangano also, these crops are being promoted by giving the procurement bonus and other structures like 4,000, 6,000 to 7,000 per hectare. And then, if we are growing pulses and oil seeds, definitely these are the net importer. If these crops are grown, it will definitely help India to become at least self-sufficient in legumes. And then, if pulses and oil seeds, they have to be promoted, then, we are proposing at least for five years, like, whatever procurement they are doing under wheat and rice, so that could be diverted for their procurement. It's just the repurposing of that particular amount. And with this, if the rice is getting grown, if it is getting displaced, then definitely there will be GHG emissions reductions. So, in the form of the carbon credits, the farmer, they can be getting that particular carbon credit to the farmer. So, that way, the farmer's income can also be, you know, ensured. Thank you. Thank you, Rina. Can you put on the, that slide of three states, positive, negative? Yeah, this one. Before I get into the panel discussion, I would urge everyone to look at this carefully, because these are the three states we had a bit deep dive. Punjab had incentive structures that are, in a way, more detrimental to biodiversity. We can get into the details of that. Madhya Pradesh is somewhere in between. And, right now, Telangana, where we are, shows that 40% of the incentives are positive to biodiversity. Only 17% are detrimental. But, I would add a word of caution here. And, that is, in the last 10 years or so, in Telangana, the rice area has gone up, from 1.4 million hectares, to 4.9 million hectares. It's 3.5 times in 10 years. This is explosive growth, of rice cultivation, because of lot of water being available, and that is free. Maybe it is the Kalashram project, or some other things that are going on. And, they are, groundwater, and they are on their way, to becoming a Punjab. So, don't get into that, that 17% today, may become 42% of 52% tomorrow, after 5, 10 years. So, be careful on that. So, that's one thing that they, now, we have a very distinguished panel. Reena, you can sit down. And, can we have the panelists, those who are joining online? We have a distinguished panel. Dr. Guru Harminder Singh, Principal Scientific Officer, Punjab Biodiversity Board. Dr. Gurminder Singh, you are there? Yes, sir. I'm there, sir. Thank you. Okay, wonderful. Thank you very much. Let me introduce the, discussants first, and then I'll get back to, you with the questions. And, the first question will be to Punjab, because Punjab is, literally in an ecological crisis. Dr. Prem Mathur is there, Senior Consultant, Alliance of Biodiversity International, and SEAT, is joining us, online. Dr. P. Krishnan, Director, Bay of Bengal Program, Intergovernmental Organization. Dr. Krishnan, you are there? Okay. Yeah. And then, we have, right here, Dr. Wally Manikam, Professor and Director, Center for Innovation and Public Systems. Right? Is he here? No? She, she, she, she's not here. Okay. And then, we have Dr. Rita Pandey, former professor at National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, and Dr. Gina T. Srinivasan, professor at Center for Economic and Social Studies. So, let me start with, Dr. Guru Harminder Singh Ji. In Punjab, as you saw in the graphics, major policy incentives, in terms of free power, or huge subsidization of fertilizer and paddy, consuming a lot of fertilizers, and then assured procurement of paddy and others, it seems that it is leading to a major drive against biodiversity. I mean, over a period of time, Punjab, which used to be reasonably diverse cropping pattern, has led to a concentration of paddy and wheat, paddy and wheat cycle. What is the way out? Is there a way out that we can find that farmer gets his due? They get the same income or even higher income, but the water can be saved, the soil can be saved, and biodiversity can be saved in Punjab. Over to you, sir. Thank you. Thank you very much, and very good afternoon to everyone. Up front, thank you, ICRIER, UNDP, Biofin, for inviting Punjab in this very important roundtable. Our apologies, we couldn't make it, but in the second phase, we'll definitely be there. and we congratulate the ICRIER for selecting PINAB as one of the model states, and I joined the conception workshop, and I have also gone through very minutely to the report, which is uploaded, the complete report, and I also put up that to my chairman, PBB. Sir, I mean, you are the best person to understand the historical perspective of this issue, and after the independence, and especially the Green Revolution, Punjab has given a lot of incentive under the various planning commissions, and then happened the Green Revolution. So, we have a great history of, you know, kind of meeting the food security, but, you know, after the 90s, you know, the reverse action, you know, came to the fore, and it's well documented, well debated, in the state. I know these are very ominous figures, which came out, and as a state, you know, the matter has been seized, and there are certain political considerations, which are, you know, leading to certain kind of incentives, but if you ask me, as a biodiversity board, sir, or a representative, somebody from the state Department of Science and Technology, there are two key things, which we need to look into, that is, one is the MSP, which is, of course, driven by the central government, and other one is the power, and the third one is the fertilizer subsidy, which is, again, the central incentive. So, if we take this into account, this is really changing the whole data, dynamics of our, you know, the way we produce our foods, and the ecological backlash, which we are facing, not only ecological backlash, also the economic backlash, because we are meeting with the farmer, and we know, you know, the yield is stagnated, but I like, we understand that, this very detailed report, I have gone through it, but through this salient point, you know, again, the power subsidy by state, it started way back in 2009, then state government took a very bold decision to stop it, but due to certain political compulsion, it's still going on, and now presently, besides the agriculture subsidy, we also have the domestic power subsidy, so that is the one reason, but coming back to agriculture, of course, this is one of the biggest incentives to the farmer, to go for pedi, and if you take Punjab into consideration, the root cause is pedi, and as far as the state is concerned, and thanks to the judicial activism of the NGT, Supreme Court, CAQM at the Delhi level, things are really changing, sir, the state is being held accountable, and I can't tell you that how much effort, at the state level is being put up, to get rid of the area under the pedi, and manage this double, and do whatever under the, you know, under the sky, which is possible to reduce the area under the pedi, and if I, if I just, just mentioned to you, you know, we now, our state has banned the, the Pusa, which is a, which is a long Pusa variety, which is a long duration variety, and the farmer are still opting to it, state has banned it, but still there are sources, they are procuring seeds, and they are taking, you know, they're still cultivating that, this time around, there was a report yesterday, in the, in the paper, that again, almost 30 to 40 percent, is under the Pusa, and there is no administrative, way of controlling that, you know, the, the rice shell has, has been, you know, directed to not to procure, but this, this is the one thing, which is still, still there, but as far as state is concerned, our state is, taking a lot of remedial measure, if I, if I share with you, we are promoting the DSR, very effectively, one other thing, because in Rina Man, presented, one of the major points, is the methane emissions, sir, and, one of the major points, of methane emission, so state has, recently, you know, you know, took a, you know, undertaking a project, where we really want to, you know, you know, you know, work out, work this challenge, into an opportunity, and we are looking, at the carbon credits, for that, we have, we, we are in touch, with the ADB, we are in touch, with the World Bank, we held a lot of discussion, with the British High Commission, where we want to do, a pilot project, this is not done anywhere, and if it is done anywhere, we'll be very grateful, that some information, on the same issue, we want to go for the, sustainable agricultural practices, whatever being done, in the state, whether the DSR, and AWD, for the carbon credit, end to end cycle projects, so we intend to do it, on a 10,000 hectare area, especially in the, Sanguru district, which is one of the districts, which has the highest, area under agriculture, and the highest yield, and the, most of the, red category blocks, as far as the groundwater, is concerned, so what, what we plan is that, we need to, trigger some kind of a, action, which people will actually follow, and as per our planning, we'll be able to, beside the 1500 rupees, incentive, which we are presently going, through DVD to the farmer, who are going for the DSR, as per our understanding, they will be able to, incentivize them to, around 6200 extra money, per hectare, if they go for the, DSR or AWD, through the carbon credit mechanism, so that's the one thing, which we are really relying upon, beside other, banning of the, you know, push of variety, and a lot of focus, it being on, put on the diversification, but as I said, and number of, publication, in the public domain, wherein, wherein this is, this is specifically, you know, you know, mentioned that MSP, unless, unless there is a MSP, or, you know, short procurement, of the other crops, farmers are not willing, that's why we are now, again, you know, you know, giving, going to the carbon credit rules, so, so these are the few things, but now, one more thing, which, which recently, come to our notice, is the, I know, it may be, out of the domain, of this discussion, but when we realized, that area under paddy, or area under agriculture, somehow, started decreasing, because, a lot of big cities, Ludhiana, Amarsar, Patiala, Jalander, Pitinda, due to a lot of urbanization, happening, across the highway, southern, so suddenly, we are, we are, we are coming, into a situation, that we might have, one issue of the food security, because there's so much, of urban spot, spalling, and again, this, this related to the, environment, other issues, but there's a new issue, state is grappling, because we don't have, much of the area, to do, remedial action, as far as the, biodefic conservation, concerned, or, you know, some, some, any activity, as far as the, flora is concerned, so that is the, one of the biggest, biggest constraints, sir, and there's trouble burning, good news for the state, is from the 60,000, stubble burning incidents, you know, last three years, we have this time, with all the efforts, it has come to 10,000, even though we were hoping, that we will reduce it to zero, but that didn't happen, but we are very positive, that next season, probably Punjab, will show the way, that we will be able, to bring it to near about zero, or near about thousand, so, as far as the, that's my opening remarks, and we will get into detail, that is, that is the, the key area, where state, you know, struggling, but there are a lot of, bright spot, which I can discuss, separately with the Rina man, the state is working, to get rid of this issue, sir, thank you, okay, thanks a lot, for your initial remarks, I have a follow-up question, because your state, is the real state, that has the biggest challenge, right now, as far as, you know, let me first, really recognize, the great contribution, Punjab made, to food security, of India, India, so, hats off, to those farmers, and to the Punjab, state as a whole, but today, Punjab itself, it's nature, the, you know, nature's resource, endowment, is in deep crisis, and we have to come out, of that, the paddy area, which was, 0.3 million hectares, roughly in, 66, when Punjab, was carved out, today is, 3.2 million hectares, more than 10 times, and the Punjab, water table, cannot support, that type of a thing, now, your DSR, incentive, of 1500 rupees, per hectare, is a step, in the right direction, but it's a very, baby step, it will take, years and decades, what we need, is shift away, from paddy, now, the question, that I have, is, in your neighboring state, Haryana, has offered, that anybody, shifting from, paddy, to pulses, or oil seeds, or millets, will get, 17,500 rupees, per hectare, right, yes sir, we have been, pleading with the center, you double it up, that 50% state gives, 17,500, and 17,500, the center gives, because, the profitability, gap between, paddy and pulses, is a large one, so whether you give, MSPA, or whatever you want to give, that will not, compensate for the, high profitability, of paddy, okay, so the only way out, is whether you call it, carbon credits, whether you call it, biodiversity saving credit, or water saving credit, our calculation, is at least, 35,000 rupees, per hectare, has to be given, to the farmer, for switching, away from paddy, to pulses, oil seeds, millets, because, and this will not, be an extra money, going out of, the pocket, of the state government, or the central government, because they will, save on fertilizer, subsidy, and the state government, will save on power subsidy, so it's only a matter, of chicken and egg, who starts first, the problem is, Haryana gives, only for one year, now next year, if his profitability, is 35,000 rupees, less than paddy, he again switches, back to paddy, whereas the saving, to the state government, and the central government, is forever, literally, so I think, if we announce a policy, that at least for five years, the state government, and the central government, come together, to give 35,000 rupees, to those, who are switching, away from paddy, to pulses, and oil seeds, is there, a feasibility, of that type, of a policy, it is repurposing, remember, there is no extra expenditure, either by the state government, or by the central government, because it's a saving, in their power subsidy, and saving, in their fertilizer, subsidy, only a question, of coming together, putting things together, in a nice manner, and winning over the farmers, then there is a chance, of farmers, moving away, from paddy, and saving the biodiversity, in agriculture, yes sir, certainly, I mean, this is a great point, I must, you know, compliment that sir, and, as far as, state in concern sir, of course, we are studying, very minutely, what our neighboring states, are doing, particularly Haryana, as far as, you know, disincentivize, the paddy cultivation, traditional, paddy cultivation, and, state has taken, one small step, sir, in the right direction, if you, you maybe wear that, for the moon sir, we are, cultivation, we are again, giving the, 1500 rupees, to the farmer, extra, and, but still sir, the, the old habit diehards, you know, ground reality, is that farmers, somehow, it is somehow, you know, you know, dues into them, that, they, they are still, you know, you know, hanging on with the paddy, and, maybe, the spirit, which have they shown, the, nearly green revolution, somehow, that is, marginalized, over the year, but, still state is somehow, you know, whatever way state is possible, state is, you know, kind of, motivating farmer, through a lot of, lot of campaigns, and, wherever, you know, state's financial allows it to, to provide incentives, and, you, you understand sir, sales, fiscal health, very well sir, there is no, kind of secret about that, but, state still, is trying its best, but still sir, we are learning, we are studying, and, the, the finding of this, report, if it's a, if it, if it, I request you that, once it's finalized, the phase one, if it is referred to the, chief secretary, Punjab, with a copy to the, finance secretary, and the, secretary environment, and secretary agriculture sir, then we probably, really can, you know, think it over, otherwise sir, still, this issue, somehow, come into discussion, and then suddenly, suddenly as that, it reaches to cabinet, it fizzled away sir, it gets fizzled away, certain political, compulsions, so, it's a negative, effect on the state, you know, we understand, the financial situation, of the state, which is, very precarious, at present, and, but for this type, of an effort, there could be, a big loan, component, from multilateral agencies, whether world bank, or not, in the name of, green funds, or, you are trying to save, biodiversity, you are trying to save, environment, and so on, and so forth, and a five year, 10 year, 15 year loan, can be, easily, sought, from these multilateral agencies, at very soft terms, less than 1% per annum, so, I think, since this, entire discussion, is about, biodiversity, and finance, I think, we need to, think out of the box, to look at, where the financial incentives, can be put, which, do not, let the farmer profits, go down, in fact, they will go up, but at the same time, we can save, nature's, resource endowment, that is the challenge, and I am sure, there are, if the state government, doesn't have the money, something can be sought, from the central government, if the central government, doesn't agree on that, we can go to, the international agencies, to get that type of, finance, but thank you very much, for your, intervention on this, let me move on, to Dr. Prem Mathur, who is working, with the alliance, of biodiversity, international, sir, could I, ask, are there any, best practices, internationally, where the financial, incentives, and biodiversity, can be dovetailed, with a positive outcome, is there anything, on those lines, that you could, give us the benefit of, the benefit of, thank you Dr. Gulati, first of all, I am not a really, a person, dealing with all the, policies issues, so I am a, mis-fetch, mis-presence in this group, with highly qualified, person talking about, the different policies, and the different schemes, which are negative, and positive, to the conservation, and use of agro biodiversity, here, but if you allow me, I would like to, suggest some of the ideas, which can go beyond, the different policies, like you mentioned, about the subsidy, on the fertilizer, and also on this food subsidy, here, based on the scientific evidence, we generated, in alliance of biodiversity, in Russia, for the last, 50, 50, 60 years, what are the other solutions, other approaches, other system, which can really lead, to the conservation, and use of agro biodiversity, and protobiodiversity, besides, what we are talking about, so with that background, basically, if you allow me, I have a few points, and a small presentation, and can I share my slide here, presentation, I don't know, whether we will have the time, because we are already, running half an hour late, but you, get your points, that would be well taken, and we can note that, and we can share your presentation, later with anybody, who is interested in it, okay fine, then maybe just a minute, you can just speak, the major points, no, I will not share, stop sharing here, so basically, actually, I want to mention here, that there are some of the, approaches, which can lead to, the conservation, and use of agro biodiversity, it's based on your report, which is excellent, output of the synthesis, of all the reports here, what I think, is that promoting, the agroforestry, and syriviculture system, is one of the, best approach, to conserve agro biodiversity, which can also lead, to the household, food security, and not only food, but also nutrition security, and provide, additional income, to farmers here, so this is the, one of the approaches, the government, should promote, which government, is already promoting here, lot of work, has been done, on the Wadi system here, and the Lakpati Kisan, approach here, so where, this is, very well suited, for the small, and marginal farmer, for a small piece of land, of one or two hectare, here, where the farmer, can grow, kind of a, trees species, fruit species, here, vegetables here, and the small crops, marginal crops, like, millets, vegetables, all those things here, so this is the, kind of a one approach, which should be promoted, at the national level, here, to conserve, the agrobiodiversity, and this will also, help us basically, for availability of, a local, consumed food, at the local market, easy affordability, and accessibility, to local communities, here, from the produced, locally grown, there, here, as we already, talk about, the enhanced, soil biodiversity, is very important, and I will not, go to the more, detail about, the importance of, soil biodiversity, as Dr. Reddy, has mentioned, some very good examples, this morning, about the, protein, the soil organism, soil microorganism, in the, in this farming system, here, how that can help, in conservative diversity, and enhance, the productivity, of our system, here, the next fight, is basically, support crop diversification, and varietal mixture, here, as we already, talk about, that, we are basically, confined to three crops, for food security, rice, wheat, and meat, here, so there is a need, for crop diversification, to promote, this year, and government policy, as you already mentioned, the MSP, is mostly, for these three crops, here, but recently, the government thought, has changed, here, and now, the government, is also providing, MSP to other crops, like the pulses, say, millards, here, oil seed crop, also here, so that, that is a, other issue, here, that, as you also mentioned, that the support, for cultivating, the legumes, and oil seed, should be, given more subsidy, for here, so this is the, one of the approach, here, I fully agree, that we should, support those, kind of intensification, for more crop diversification, and also, more number of varieties, I mean, just, these three crops, are being grown, but only few varieties, are being cultivated, which are really, in the system, here, but growing up, the different, variety diversity, and with different crops, will definitely help, in conserving, the agro biodiversity, in the farming system, here, of course, we talk about, this leverage, digital precision agriculture, system, here, use of remote sensing, AI, and species, and farming tools, can definitely, optimize the input, use here, like water, and fertilizer, here, so this is, one of the things, here, that the government, should have more incentive, more support, for these, kind of initiative, here, that can also, reduce the ecological, footprints, while maintaining, the age here, and these technology, driven approaches, support biodiversity, by minimizing, overuse of resources, also, yeah, great, any other point, yeah, there are two more, point here, then, maybe I will just, come here, since time is short, here, some of my thoughts, here, about this year, about the policy, here, the first one, I want to support, is biodiversity, link direct benefit, transfer, that's what, we also talk about, here, the introduction, introduce of, additional cash, transfer to farmers, who adopt biodiversity, in enhancing practices, like, intercoping, agroforestry, maintaining, pollinator habitat, those farmers, should be given, more subsidy, to continue, those kind of farming, system here, there is a need, for national genetic, forms act, here, the establishment, legal framework, to protect, and promote, indigenous crop, and livestock, genetic resources, if, required, this will empower, community seed banks, support, participatory breeding, and ensure, benefit sharing, with local, study, as well, here, ecological, intelligence interface, is also very, important here, and, then, we need to have, a kind of, agroecological, innovation zones, to be identified here, so, designated regions, and living labs, where farmers, scientists, and start up, who develop, and test, agroecological solution, and these zones, would receive, regularly, flexibility, funding, and visibility, and of course, pollinator protection, protocol, is also very, important, the government, should mandate, pollinator friendly, farming zones, with restriction, on pesticide use, incentives, for flooring, cover crops, and habitat corridors, this would, directly support, food security, and ecosystem health, two more points, here, agroecology, in public procurement, as we discussed, already here, that is required, government food, program, like midday meal scheme, and PDS, to source, a percentage of food, from certified, agroecological farms, here, and landscape, level governance, concept, so there is a need, to establish, multi-stay quarter, console, at the watershed, or agroecological zones, level, to coordinate, land use, biodiversity corridors, and ecosystem services, across farms, forest, and commerce, here, so this is what, I thought about, that these are the, other approaches, which can, definitely help, in conserving, and protecting, agrobiodiversity, besides, what we talk about, the subsidies, shifting to, other props, and other, these areas. No, definitely, thanks a lot, for these suggestions, there are many ways, to promote, biodiversity, there is no doubt, about that, but, this particular, study, and this particular, session, is more on, the financial incentives, how they can, this is the target, 18, that's where, our focus is, but, definitely, there are many, other ways, in which it can be, and we can't, cover everything, under the sun, so thank you, very much for that, is Dr. P. Krishnan, there, online? Yes, sir, sir, over to you, any good ideas, that you can quickly, give us, you have so many, country flags, in your background, is any of those, countries doing, better than India, on biodiversity, and finances? Yeah, actually, certainly, India plays a major, lead role here, and obviously, this will be something, that we will be able, to give to the other countries, and, I'm not an expert, in this agricultural domain, I have been a follower, of your work, and then, I would like to just, simply to mention, in two minutes, thanks for the very, inspirational study, and then the beautiful, presentation, I wish like, to take up a study, maybe, collaboratively with you, and then, a guidance for the, fishery sector, particularly the, marine fishery sector, like, and have a similar, three-step process, I would like to pilot, and then I will, come up to your guidance, and earlier, I have taken up a study, jointly with UNDP, and then, NBA, Ministry of Environment, on mainstreaming, biodiversity for, public finance, taking agriculture, as a, case, and which I already, have presented, in the last meeting, I will share the report, in the chat, rather, now I am, here as a student, and I think like, there is a huge scope, for replicating, this study, for fishery sector, particularly, in the context of, the, in, by 2026, the WTO agreement, on fish subsidies, will be in force, and, that has a huge, impact, it is likely to have, on the, current existing, kind of subsidies, in the, in the region, not only in India, like, so, possibly, we will take the study, in fisheries, thank you. Sure, thanks a lot, you seem to be a fish man, we will, yeah, to collaborate, with you, please visit, Icrier's website, we have released, a policy brief, very recently, called the blue revolution, I saw that, a detailed report, of about 100 pages, will be coming, in the next fortnight, on the blue revolution, sure, minuses, and just for, the audience, and interesting fact, nowadays, because there is, a lot of trade, tensions going on, with the president, Trump, on US India trade, our biggest, agriculture exports, to US, are shrimps, all going from, Andhra Pradesh, but now, shrimps are coming up, in a district, in Sirsai, in Haryana, and in Churu, in Rajasthan, where saline water is, inland saline water, going all the way, to Haryana, and then, they are multiplying, there in the, saline water ponds, and sending it back, to Andhra, it's a revolution, going on, very fascinating, we would love, to have you, in our team, and, with the fisheries, in those ponds, thank you so much, thank you so much, it will be honored, sir. Dr. Rita Pandey, she has been working, in National, Institute of Public Finance, and Policy, so I'm sure, public finance, all the studies, during the days, of D.K. Srivastava, and onwards, there has been, a lot of study, now, how do we repurpose, all these incentives, which are harming, the nature, biodiversity, in particular, is there any study, any thinking, in NIPFP, and you in particular, on those, can you speak, into the mic, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah, NIPFP, has been, doing a lot of work, mm-hmm, for many, many years, in the area, of subsidies, right from, you know, measuring, subsidies, to what is the concept, of subsidy, to reform, of subsidies, and also, in the agriculture sector, and lately, on, environmental, beneficial subsidies, environmental, detrimental subsidies, et cetera, so, given my training, at NIPFP, I have a few comments, on the report, but, before my remarks, let me, take this opportunity, to congratulate, the team, and the institutions, for this, because this, fills, the gap, in the literature, because, we haven't, for the agriculture subsidy, deliberated, or research, in detail, that this report, has done, and, also, ICRISAT, and other agencies, for inviting me here. Now, let me start, my comments, just, brief comments, in the order, in which the report, was presented. So, one was, concept of subsidy, and measurement of subsidy. well, the report says, the three, major subsidies, I am talking about, only detrimental subsidies, here, positives, are positives, we are not worried, about them, except that, they need to increase, costs, but, as a concept of subsidy, the concept has been used, unrecovered cost, and you, being economists, you know very well, that it masks, several things, producer inefficiency, inefficiencies in the system, so, well, this number is big, 2% plus of GDP, so, we, when we talk about, these numbers, we have to be kinky, the question is, is India giving, that much subsidy, to agriculture sector, so you know, you have to, this trade, and various other, issues, that India has to deal with, so these numbers, mask, lot of inefficiencies, so these are, kind of you know, as they are, in the budget, so these are not, necessarily, are all impacting, the, biodiversity, negatively, as it is, the second point, on this is, that, well, these are, total subsidies, some amount of fertilizer, is necessary, you mentioned, in your morning, interjection, to kind of, for food security, some amount of water, irrigation, etc, is, it becomes, problematic, when we, exceed, you know, we encourage, to the extent, that, you know, we encourage, overuse, or inefficient use, so, you know, that component, is really, you know, what it is, so we have to, find some way, of, you know, getting there, soil, high health card, data, and various other things, you know, the scientists, also say, that this amount, of fertilizer, for this crop, for this soil, in this region, in this geography, etc, etc, so, little nuanced, approach, to when we, present the number, for the audience, so that's, on, the subsidy, and, there are, various concepts, subsidies, available, but when you are, using budgetary data, of course, this is the simplest, you know, you can just, pull the data out, and start your work, okay, so that's, one point, the second point, is, categorization, of subsidies, for, black and white, positive, mixed, detrimental, etc, when fertilizer, subsidy, is detrimental, how is, water subsidies, mixed, because some amount, of fertilizer, is also necessary, some amount, of water, is necessary, when it becomes, kind of, you know, inefficient use, or overuse, then it's a, it's an issue, so, it's just, I'm trying to understand, why fertilizer is, under detrimental, and why water is, under, under mixed, because that, also signals, and, give, the basis for policy, later, so that's my, second point, and, here also, we can do, a nuanced study, some, expenditure mapping, study that we've done, as part of, biofin, we've, looked at schemes, component wise, and we say, this component, is positive, this component, is negative, on that basis, we've worked out, the expenditure, that's actually, positively, or negatively, impacting, the biodiversity, so some, such exercise, you know, diving deep, into the, data, we've, done it for, 117 schemes, and, 69 ministries, or something, 47, or something, okay, so that's my, second, point, on the measurement, and concept, and, categorization, of subsidies, on, the way forward, the suggestions, given the report, by and large, agree with, every word of it, except, that, well, there are, marginal farmers, there are small farmers, tenant farmers, who do not have, you know, access to, all this, what we're talking about, how do we talk to them, you know, when we say, this is going to happen, so, it's like, you know, this, this is a group of people, whether, owners, or working in that area, so we have to be, very sympathetic, to them, soil health card data, already says, that we are deficient, in nitrogen, and P, and S, and 56%, et cetera, et cetera, so we have to, have a very, disaggregated, kind of a thing, you have three pilots, in terms of states, but within the state, what's happening, it could be, very, very skewed, so some people, need to be helped, some people need to be, you know, hand, you have to handle them, to convince them, that, well, this can be done, in a different way, so policy, prescriptions, will, will change, and will be more nuanced, so the state governments, or central governments, can actually, be receptive to, given what happened, with, just two years ago, and you were the, architect of, the laws, that, I'm, talking about, the, so, yeah, the pilot studies, to learn more, about, you know, how to operationalize, these, concepts, and suggestions, and then, since we are talking, about, detrimental, subsidies, so, I thought, you know, it would be, interesting, and very useful, to also, look at, the wasted side of it, I'm not, talking about, food that's wasted, from the table, I'm talking about, between harvesting, and, the table, so, that may be, a very interesting area, to, include, in this concept, because, too much pressure, on production, production, production, may, kind of, you know, it's useful, but, may not be, the only cause, you know, to start with, so, the, wasted side, side of it, could also, be included, in this, because, that needs, positive incentives, or, lot of investment, by whoever, can, make that investment. Well, great, thanks a lot, to, think of, some of the nuances, within the, definitional concept, of subsidy, how do we treat, in different, four categories, properties, I would say, this is a very, initial step, it's a very, crude step, open for refinements, I can go, a little further, you talked about, inefficiency, of the production, system itself, whether, we call it a subsidy, fertilizer, inefficiency, I will say, we worked it out, that 22%, of the fertilizers, being produced, in the country, don't go to agriculture, at all, they are diverted, away to, others, so whether, we should treat, this as subsidy, or not, so those refinements, can be, same thing, we did for food subsidy, food subsidy, again 22%, by 22, 23 consumption data, if you look, at the center, what center says, we have given, and what people say, we have received, from PDS, is a 22% gap, and if you add, states, food subsidy, on top of it, the gap comes, to 28%, so whether, these are the subsidies, going, to the beneficiaries, or somewhere else, disappearing, in thin air, so all those refinements, can be done, but this is, the start of the story, and why, fertilizer is negative, and why, irrigation is mixed, we had, lot of discussions, on these things, I can have, another sitting with you, you being an economist, but I want to spend, half a minute on, the subsidy definition, itself, the WTA, is already dead, and buried, after Trump's, tantrums on tariffs, there is, another organization, OECD, which has a methodology, called producer, support estimates, and they measure, that for 54 countries, on annual basis, the PSCs, of OECD countries, is about 14%, of the gross, value of farm output, China, which used to be, almost 1%, 2% is also, at 14% today, India, is minus 14%, minus 14%, that means, there are input subsidies, that are being given, but there is, suppression of the output prices, through export controls, private sector, cannot hold stocks, and all that, so India, on the PSC measure, is negatively subsidized, that means, it is implicitly, taxed, Indian agriculture, and that is, to favor the consumer, so there is a huge, consumer bias, in the system, so, I mean, there are different, concepts of subsidies, and so on, and so forth, but, I think, we can always revisit, and refine, many of these things, because, even within, fertilizer subsidy, part is, positive, contributing to, as you rightly said, to food security, in the right quantity, if you use, but are we using it, in right, and PK balance, so if that is, totally out of gear, then we say, okay, broadly, it is negative, you know, that's how we have defined, but, we, in each of these, 46 schemes, there would be, some positive elements, some negative elements, so you have to, further refine, and that may be, the way forward, as we go, yeah, on that, so this was, first time, putting all the finances, and the biodiversity signals, on the same plate, and see, whether they, create a good meal, or not, ah, Dr. Srinivasan, you are sitting, in Telangana, right, and Telangana, you saw, and I gave you the picture, what is happening, on rice, anything you can suggest, to the Telangana state, the, yeah, basically, being the last, panelist, is a huge risk, because most of, the previous ones, would have covered, a lot of points, and, you know, being a non-agriculture, specialist, I'm not a, an agriculture specialist, not a, final, public finance, or a biodiversity, so I have additional risk, while I speak, actually, so having said that, it's, let me congratulate, the entire team, for the excellent work, and, it gives a very, solid idea, about the macro level, what is happening, with the subsidies, and how its impact, on biodiversity, et cetera, so, I don't have much, to add on that, grounds actually, I want to add, a few points, since you said, that like, it's a kind of, a second phase, is also coming, and the larger goal, is about the repurposing, this thing, so I'm, my study is like, a kind of, giving few more, points, or a kind of extension, about these things, so when you show, the classification, of subsidies, in fact, you have classified, into positive, negative, and neutral, kind of subsidies, so I'm a bit worried, about the neutral thing, actually, positive and negative, it's a clear case, neutral subsidies, why I say so is, with the time, and scale, maybe these neutral subsidies, can also turn detrimental, to the system, so that is, something which, we'll have to figure in, like when you, classify the subsidy, and the repurposing, to give an example, so the whole effort, of micro irrigation, you know, more crop, per crop kind of thing, you know, sprinkler irrigation, or repurrigation, kind of thing, so that might be, an efficient way, at the farm level, but at the basin level, it may not be, because the efficiency, can, the efficiency, can offset, it can lead, to larger consumption, of water, at the basin level, and can have negative impact, so what started, as a neutral impact, can over a period, of time become, very negative, in terms of biodiversity, so similar example, can also be thought, about the solar, irrigation pumps, so beginning, in the beginning, it might be a neutral, but over a period, of time, it can, so I was like, thinking about, like in again, refining the, classification, instead of, in terms of positive, negative, can we really have, a kind of scaling, because you also, covered other targets, four, seven, and all that, for grouping this, biodiversity thing, so if you can have, a kind of scaling, or impact scaling, like for example, it starts from, minus two plus two, so what are the most, severe impact, on biodiversity, and the policy makers, can also identify, where to target first, and most importantly, like where the funds, should be allocated, that's one thing, the other thing is like, is at the macro level, it is very well done, study so, but when you are, talking about repurposing, I think you know, the next phase, or next step, should also have, some micro level studies, where you know, for me it seems like, the relationship, is assumed to be static, and linear, linear relationships, so whereas, if you adopt, a kind of sociological, perspective, you can also, incorporate the, interdependency, between the human system, and the agricultural system, and also like, the farmers behavior, are not necessarily, always determined, by the economic incentives, there are also, other informational, institutional factors, so, but this decision making, how the farmers, make a decision, regarding their crop cultivation, and crop choices, and input use, will have an impact, on the outcome, of the subsidy, so how you figure, this farmer's behavior, into this, so some kind, of micro level studies, maybe a kind, of panel studies, or discrete choice methods, will be helpful, in this, okay, the other, one is, so, yeah, then if you are, scaling this biodiversity, then from the policy, point of view, you can also, think of having, a kind of category, where, which has, high transformation potential, like where the, intervention, you can, start first, and those kind, of subsidies, say, high transformation, for example, for in terms, of biodiversity conservation, a fertilizer subsidy, can have a high impact, rather than, on biodiversity, rather than, you know, some other kinds, of subsidies, given to the consumer, so where, you know, which kind of subsidies, to target, and all can be, made, more, so what I would like, to say is that, like public, biodiversity is also, then has to be understood, as a public, so no rational farmers, would be interested, to invest more, unless it is supported, some kind of financial, support is given, so that justifies, the continuation, of subsidies, for producing, positive ecological outcomes, so instead of, you know, when you talk about, repurposing subsidies, you can, instead of, you know, considering it, just as this, income support, or you know, input support, or welfare tool, it has to be, reoriented in such a way, that it leads to the, ecological restoration, and resilience, so that will take care, of the other things, so how the farmers, who are adopting this, can be rewarded, using the same, kind of fiscal tools, that we have, so some of these things, can be thought through, in the next phase, let's see. Okay, thank you. One, that instead of having, four watertight jackets, it should be a continuous process, from one end of red, to another end of green, and in between, different shades, of gray, maybe. Now that's, all these, finer refinements, I'm just, trying to think about, one, you're talking, positive incentives, which are linked to, promotion of, say, particular objective, biodiversity. But there is, already the biggest subsidy, called food subsidy, which is, basically, wheat and rice. How do we make it, biodiversity positive? That's the biggest elephant, in the room, two lakh crores plus. And that is existing, for the last ten years. Right? So, how do we, move, away from it? How do we, reorient it? How do we, maybe some good ideas, you can think over. Hmm. No, no, that's, right, but this subsidy, is already there. Yeah. Right now. Yeah. So, question is, should we forget about this? Because, this is having an implication, on biodiversity, since it is food, and, so, see, you know, wheat and rice, wheat and rice. So, they produce wheat and rice, wheat and rice. And that's driving all other crops. No, that's the case, like, you know, we have to think, in terms of outcome based. I'm thinking, I'm not an expert in this. See, what are the, see, if you have a kind of biodiversity indicators, at the farm level, you know, how the farmers, farming practices, are enhancing the biodiversity. But then, the condition is that, you have to have a good data, about the biodiversity itself. And again, biodiversity also has to be understood, in very specific terms, because farm diversity is one thing, and the associated biodiversity, like pollinators, and all that, nobody will be cultivating that. But that's an outcome, of the certain practices. Sure. So, you know, one is having a policy, for the farmer, to promote that. But, the biggest subsidy, in agri-food space, is food. What do we do with it? Can I share, a curiosity, in me, about this, conducted a small survey, in a community, where I live. So, 750 families. Each family has, at least one, house help. Okay. These people, mainly come from, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, these areas. Now, this is a, this is a high-end, condo, condo union. So, people are moving, the owners are moving, to millets. Okay. So, we're talking about organic, we're talking about, this millet, that millet, cereal, etc. Arianda, millets is going down still. Yeah. Still. Spitey, Chris X, we are flagging, but, you know, to, to move. So, that's on the consumption side. But, I conducted a survey, because my household health, will last 10 years. They don't eat, what, the millets that we eat. Why? Because, you know, they think, they think that they are moving, in the right direction. They get wheat, and rice. Because they have seen you, they want to copy you. Yes. Rice to eat. You are right. We are moving away. So, we are talking about masses, for which the PDA system is. It's not for us, not for you. So, we have to be very careful, of these choices, that they make. This is one of the symbol, you know, they are moving away, from poverty. They are, kind of, you know, what do you call it? So, consuming wheat, and rice, is getting away, from poverty. This is symbol. Yes. You know, we are recommending, in repurposing, food coupons, of the equivalent value, to them, and give them option, for 20 commodities. So that, if they want to, take milk, in that money, or they want eggs, or they want millets, or they want pulses, they are more nutritious, than just wheat and rice. So they can distribute. So that is what, the repurposing is. Amount is the same. Yeah. So that's the way, we are trying to move. Okay. I think, I have been given a notice, served a notice, yes, that, she has to leave, and, Ruchi is looking at me, what is the time, you are not, but, we started off, one hour late. No. No. Okay. So you are giving me, up to 130. No. Angela has to go. Okay. Open for, yes. Ikri Set's, veteran, and this is, Parthasarthi Rao, he has been holding, the largest, data set, of Ikri Set, at the district level, for so many years. Veteran of Ikri Set. Yes, please. Can you speak, in the mic please? Oh yeah. Sorry. It's regarding, that you know, that moving up the ladder, just by eating, rice and wheat, you are absolutely correct, on that, from millage, to rice and wheat. But just the opposite, is happening, in recent times, in the last, say one decade or so, particularly in urban areas, that people have become, more health conscious, in the process, many people are, many, families, I mean middle class, even rich families, are moving towards, millets, by paying, you know, double the price, of rice also, rice and wheat. Double? Triple? Yeah, minor millets, you know, minor millets, double the price. That, that percentage, of people moving away, is very little, compared to people, moving away, from millets. That's the problem. That's the mass bottom. That has just started, mainly on health grounds, and also, you know, for other reasons. It's a new trend, and I am saying that, this trend will, only increase over time. It's not that, it's going to, stagnate itself. Secondly, even processing, even the processing industry, is taking up, millets, in their processing, in a big way, by mixing millet, with other flours, and so on, so for wheat flour, and all that. But really, many multinational companies, and nowadays, come up with, several minute products, which are, you know, Raggi biscuits, Raggi biscuits, by ITC. So, these things are now, catching up, and now, it's no longer, a poor man's food. It's more like, a rich man's food. So, the question is, you know, when the masses, cannot afford it, that's where the problem is. So, yeah. All right. Any other questions? Yes, please. You had, and then, there was, yeah. Yeah. The thing is, regarding this study, I think the study is, well designed, everything, but as far as, biodiversity is concerned, it's only, focused on one particular, area of biodiversity, that is, repurposing the fertilizer, subsidy towards, other crops. So, which is, as far as the study goes, it's okay, you can't study, everything in one study. But, I would just say, that one important aspect, is the role of crop, livestock integration. which should also be brought in, or should be looked into, in terms of, for the, to look at, address biodiversity. The cover page of this, has some livestock. So, that is one aspect, I was, just thinking, another question, I have a doubt, you talked about, the skewed, fertilizer subsidy, towards, urea. Yeah. So, the question is, if this skewed, nature of the subsidy, somehow changed, I don't know, how it will change, change without any, financial implication, to the government, change from nitrogen, to the other, crops also equally, will it make, any difference, to the, biodiversity aspect, that is, will fertilizers, become, little less negative, than what they are, right now. So, that is, that is something, I don't know, I am just asking, as a question. And of course, the, last point, I think I have is, yeah, there are several, development programs, which also address, biodiversity. And I think, these are mentioned here, but I think, a slightly more detailed, analysis of those, development programs, and how they contribute, towards, biodiversity, should also be, addressed, and integrated, into your study. Sure. Yes please, let's collect the questions, first then I can respond, or the authors can. Thank you very much sir. Sir, my humble, close. She, she had her hand first. Divya, go ahead. Yeah. A couple of points, I will make them quick. One is, maybe a, methodological one. Firstly, actually kudos on this study, really insightful, very much looking forward, to reading it all. For phase two, I hope, a couple of things, to be considered, particularly on schemes, just picking up, on what Gina has said, on schemes that have been, categorized as neutral, and I'm thinking, about the credit scheme, and the insurance one. On the face of it, they might look neutral, but unfortunately, in the way that, oh, the way they're implemented, particularly the, credit, and the insurance schemes, because they're tied to crops, and then tied to the scale of finance, which means that, the government estimate, on what the cost of cultivation is, is what actually determines, how much money a farmer gets, for the loan. So, very clearly, it incentivizes, say in Telangana, for sugar cane, you'll get up to, 80,000 rupees per acre, whereas for growing pulses, you'll get 20,000 rupees per acre. So, it's a clear, disincentive, incentive to a farmer, to actually cultivate, pulses, or millets here. And the same is tied, to the insurance scheme actually. So, the cost of insurance, that the state government here, had to pay, was the reason, why the Telangana government, under the previous government, actually moved away, from PMFBY. And that also, is kind of, reflected in the millet area, when farmers are not, incentivized to grow them, but they also don't declare it, even if they do grow it. They actually report, something else. So, they're not actually neutral, as they play out, into farmers considerations, on the ground. It's one of the points, I just wanted to kind of flag. It's not a criticism, I just hope it will be considered. Second point was, on the PMPrinam, broadly agree, on the recommendations, just a thought, is, currently the scheme, is tied to, state level incentives, which is the state government, will actually, make efforts, to reduce fertilizer use. But one of the things, we've observed, in Karnataka, you've already pointed out, has seen the largest, savings in fertilizer, decreased in the past year, is their programs, actually targeted districts, that had high fertilizer use, versus a lot of other programs, like PKVY, NMNF, which are targeting districts, that already have low use. And so, moving that incentive, to a district, or even a block level, could go a huge way, towards incentivizing districts, to actually come up, with programs, that can reduce use, potentially. So there was a second point, I wanted to add on, to the recommendations. Third one, my last point, which is, I think like, always the elephant in the room, when I think about, direct cash transfers, and direct incentives, to farmers, is who actually, ends up getting this money, and this also again, picks up from, what Jina has already pointed out, and what that money, is used for. Sitting in Telangana, working with thousands, of women farmers, as I can tell you, very often, what happens is, we already have, right to one room, PM Kisan, our women farmers, don't actually, see a penny of that, or a vice of that, excuse my American piece, but, because very often, the money goes, into the bank account, of the husband, doesn't actually, come on to the farm level. Second issue is, civil society estimates, say about 30% of farmers, in Telangana, are tenant farmers. Even NSSO estimates, will tell you, somewhere around 10-12%. In Andhra, in certain districts, our estimates again show, up to 70% Krishna Godavari, belts, tenant farmers. So, without, identification of farmers, effectively, these become, universal basic income, for landowners, rather than, agri input, or support systems. That, and I would really love to, hear, perhaps a room full of economists, really reflect on that, actually, on what can be done, for that identification. Even within, say, Rice, yesterday, one of my colleagues, might have presented, our experiments on, alternate wet and dry, where we've seen, significant savings, in emissions, water use, but to actually, provide, incentives for ecosystem services, without identification, of farmers, how do you, effectively implement that? I don't have a solution, but when we, consider, reorienting these programs, this elephant, in the room, I think, does need to be addressed, and I'd like, to hear more, of your thoughts on that. Okay, this point was raised, yesterday, by, gentleman there also, you want to repeat that, again, or? No, no, no, I have a question, and also, an idea, I had a question, in your study, if you have identified, the forces, against, or, basically, barriers, to repurposing, or, something, kind of, a SWOT analysis, have you done that? That's a question, and the idea is, I think, like, yesterday, we had discussion, and, what Dr. Srinivasan raised, my idea is, maybe, if you can give, a weighted average, to, different, subsidies, and, purposes, maybe, then, categorization, becomes more, you know, what do you say, more integral, in terms of, or the force, for repurposing, becomes more, clearer, so, maybe, that's a method, you can, think of. Good suggestion, we have been discussing, already, on those lines, let me respond, to one of the, critical, points, that you raised, about, tenants, first, the biggest subsidy, is food subsidy, there is no issue, of tenants there, can we give them, food coupons, with 20 commodities, that they can buy, so, there is a, diversified demand, which will, ultimately, give signals, for more diversified, production basket, is there a problem, in that, tell me, tell me, what is the problem, give it in the name, of the women, I don't, I don't have, major disagreements, on that, yeah, yeah, sure, no, no, we are, working, on those lines, there is a, political, economic question, that, gentlemen, asked there, we were close to getting that through I don't want to get into the because the first high-powered committee that was set up by Mr. Modi in 2014 when he joined as Prime Minister was on restructuring of the food management system and basically this was we were very close to getting it through where the opposition came from fair price shops 5,50,000 fair price shops are there and at that time it was oh if you give cash to them there were two oppositions one what will happen to fair price shops what will they do they will become jobless second there was another school of thought who said oh this will go into the men's account and they will drink liquor and nothing will come as food so these two extreme schools of thought UNDP had done a study actually on this when you give it in cash or DBT how much is the leakage in terms of misuse of that money into liquor rather than food 4% when that study was it was done under the chairmanship of Mr. Shanta Kumar who was the food minister during Bajkai time and we had worked it out in that committee I was a part of that committee 46% was the leakage in the public distribution system and that report is on the website of FCI you can see that so when we gave a presentation to the prime minister he said this must change this 46% leakage cannot be accepted but then they said fair price shops things come in some liquor and women and all those things will come in what was the final solution that you introduce POS machines in every fair price shop today 95% of fair price shops have POS machines so that point of sale with their fingerprinting centralized system still there is a leakage the 22-23 NSS data what it says 22% doesn't reach those intended beneficiaries right so from 46% leakage we have come down to 22% can we plug it and we feel we can plug it 22% leakage means 40,000 crores plus 40,000 crores plus is not reaching the intended beneficiaries this is the biggest scam annual scam how do we do that so there is lot of data being available today and that's where the tenant issue comes in we are already looking at seven different data sets you know in economics there is a simple principle if you are giving a thing highly subsidized almost free there has to be a rationing in terms of quantity that you want free wheat and rice five kg not unlimited but when you are giving urea it is costing you 100 rupees you are giving at 15 rupees and then unlimited amount you want to give this is a disaster that's what leads to leakages so either you say on the basis of your soil health cards or your cropping pattern in a particular state you will get this fixed quantity after that if you want to buy you will have to buy at market price that's like gas cylinder so there are sectors in which you can do if you do not put quantity controls then this price subsidization does not work it will lead to disaster and then you have to go via the income support route right not that income support route is totally foolproof there would be some issue there would be this china has already done it madam okay and i ask them what do you do of the tenants we tell and advertise that this person has got this much money either you adjust in his rental or you transfer him there so if the political parties at the top give a priority to this prime minister modi says he has been able to get many people from the gas cylinders out of that subsidy it was through communication making it but this is for these people not for you people right otherwise everybody will queue up i will also queue up 500 rupiah cylinder so it has to be put on a political priority what we are looking at to solve this tenancy it's well recognized problem and today we have a data set soil health cards kisan credit cards prop insurance there are six seven data cards fertilizer sales data has been collected for so many year so there are six seven data sets that we are trying to triangulate and open a portal that if you are not captured within this pm kisan which is the landowner one all these things you know from kalia this was the criticism sorry this your right to bhandu that was the criticism and then kalia included even the tenants and others there was misuse there also because everybody wants to become a tenant so no policy is going to be totally foolproof but if we can improve the situation from this one and right now we are working pretty hard on those data sets with the government agency which is supposed to do these innovations using ai ml and all these things hopefully we will find a better answer than the chinese have done chinese don't subsidize fertilizers don't subsidize power but they give to each farmer this is one new basis last year they gave about 25 billion dollars as subsidy so you have to innovate find out you can try it in the small scale before taking it but these new innovations in policies are must to do the repurposing because the current set of policies are damaging to environment and biodiversity but if we keep on saying oh no this can't be done this can't be done this can't be done then what you are doing is disaster keep on doing that disaster and get down into it we are not as food insecure as we were in 60s and 70s therefore policies need to change we have deregulated the diesel sector we have deregulated the petrol sector why can't we deregulate the fertilizer sector you want to help the farmer give them directly deregulate the sector things all these npk imbalance this that diversion everything will disappear so anyway those are at least our views uh we welcome all views and we are ready to consider those views from those who are online or here and this is not the end of the story this is just the beginning of the story of rethinking on some of those existing policy frameworks anyone else yes please yeah yeah sure please speak into the mic no no it is necessary it is being recorded so you have to be there uh yeah i'm working for the last 30 years i told almost majority of the villages as and when the new method of practice okay okay in the patient telangana sure i told you three years of implementation system of right identification a zero budget natural farming other medicine practices dsr method or whatever it is yeah sir i came to know that no i brought to your humble submission uh see demand management models cannot be effective as long as policy and movement and suppressing see water is their efficiency mechanism is a myth unless promoting demand management initiatives another thing is that no converting of paddy parts for example earlier most of the land is under rain fed or they're cultivating plain areas they are converting they are depending on rainfall or irrigating through bumping with borewells or whatever it is once they move from converting of paddy land into converting of paddy lands they it is not possible for moving towards id crops because of more rainfall comes snow crop failure due due to more brain more micro so it is in a cautious that uh so that water uh meaning moving towards paddy to non-paddy it is difficult so uh so possibility crop rotation paddy followed by paddy and mage is going on some krishna water delta r godavar delta r wherever it is it should irrigated areas see that no that is also should be taking care of that uh shifting one method of agriculture method to another agriculture method but in between see i do all the uh zero budget natural farming or community based natural every community based natural farm i have interacted the district project managers what they're telling you see three years how it is possible to bring into the normal conditions see they incur losses they they got low production so in between these uh moving one method to another method they incur losses see who will compensate this matter the so low production but they are not with any chemical fertilizer and fish sites at least to give provide remedial places as you prices they didn't know is a sensitive subject sir you know what they are what they are telling that it is a punishment job no uh in uh everywhere in every village aga they have formed centers there is a convention say npk center is there uh right to borosak and ras and the conventional farming centers natural farming centers where you know nobody is going for the uh uh the uh the no uh natural farming centers so in that nobody is going nobody showing interest only six percent of uh farmers area under natural farming what about the remaining how to scale up this issue to see these type of things another thing is npk already discussed that no difficult for example more rainfall you see more rainfall directly related to must and should use nitrogen fertilizer without using nitrogen fertilizer crop cannot sustain see these things know all these things are taken to consider moving towards one method to another method one uh best practices supposed to provide some incentive mechanism and also the converting one seed paddy converted to plane area to paddy ranch not possible so for for example some some projects are coming some new areas supposed to be cautious supposed to be aware supposed to be promoted through civil society organization okay thank you thank you madam thank you sir for for giving me the opportunity to give my inputs the fertilizer industry is aligned to the key objective of biodiversity conservation and it suggests the following policy changes and programs for balanced use of fertilizers and for protecting biodiversity future fertilizer related policies by government should be framed not only for the food security but also national nutritional security and food safety keeping in view the environmental and climate change aspects policies those encourage balanced plant nutrition including secondary and micronutrients for increased crop production farmers income and reduced emission of greenhouse gases the policy of nbs is aimed to reduce the use of fertilizer nutrients and to encourage the balanced use of npnk therefore urea must be brought under nbs policy framing should encourage the use of innovative and special specialty fertilizers like water soluble fertilizers liquid fertilizers bio-fertilization with bio-fertilization with bio-fertilization bio-fertilizers bio-fertilizers bio-fertilizers organic manures pdm bio-stimulants organic carbon enhancers from cbg plants thereby supporting the common objective of diverse biodiversity conservation soil health card scheme launched by government of india aimed at using fertilizer nutrients as per the soil tests and achieve achieving balanced application of fertilizers balanced balanced application of fertilizers however inadequate capacity to handle and analyze such large number of soils and inability of most the farmers most of the farmers to interpret the fertilizer accommodation does not allow the soil health card scheme to achieve the objectives effectively hence government should provide training and assistance for the same another important policy introduced by government of india in 2015 was coating of all urea produced in the country or imported with neem oil so in this regard government is promoting and supporting the planting of neem trees in the premises of fertilizer plants to source neem oil for producing 100 percent neem coated urea planting of neem trees also help in improving the soil fertility and water holding capacity acts as a natural pesticides help in reducing the air pollution controlling soil erosion and increasing the sequestration of carbon the practice should be encouraged policy-backed specially designed pilot projects based on soil health cards should include the introduction of use of technology awareness about mismanagement of fertilizers use of micronutrients and a robust supply supply chain infrastructure these are few points thank you madam you had the last comment thank you sir for giving me this opportunity a very well prepared uh document of course uh sir i have a few uh observations because uh paddy was of course identified as one of the crops which produces highest ghg emissions uh but i don't know how it was compared the highest producers of paddy is west bengal and up where the fertilizer consumption is less than half if you compare with punjab haryana it's one of the lowest most of it is rain fed so the subsidy on power is of no consequence so when we compare we have to compare in totality a major area a major area which grows paddy uh 17 percent in this bengal and i think just about 14 percent in uttar pradesh where the fertilizer consumption is low power for irrigation is very little it is mostly rain fed how are we comparing that with punjab haryana which is a bow that is one thing uh secondly uh the food coupon idea is very good but at the same time food is uh food preferences are very much regional region specific even within a state these are very much region specific so if we go for that kind of a policy that policy should be uh uh not a one straight jacketed policy that we try c a woe you can identify that cereals pulses oil seeds eggs must be included and heal and how much diversified it is in terms of when we talk of rice or wheat or any other crop we also have to think about the varietal biodiversity which we are losing now the farmers they produce certain varieties certain quantities of those varieties for their own consumption because there is no market but if we open the market in terms of giving a coupon and one can go and buy as per one's requirement or one's preference maybe we can support this kind of biodiversity also which must be kept in mind thank you thank you uh i think uh in the program there is some 10 minutes uh summary and way forward uh ruchi you like to go first uh yeah so first of all let me thank everyone i think we've got some wonderful inputs uh for our next phase and um and i'm also suggesting if there are some people who haven't really because it's the the report has just been made available i don't think everyone had access to the report so if now that the report is there and if you have any further uh inputs for the next phase please let us know if you can send it to us by right in writing also i'm sure their email id is etc in the back somewhere for it clear and so that is one um and um i think we got some inputs on uh the micro meso is something which you have been talking about dr golatti and i think and micro also we got good inputs on micro level and more nuanced work which as you also mentioned that in the next phase where we are actually planning to prepare a road map i think these inputs are very very useful and we'll definitely integrate this and if need be we can also have another smaller consultation to once we are really ready with the methodology for the road map this is my suggestion and nothing more to add i think we've had some very good uh inputs today and thanking uh increase that from my side from undp's life for hosting us here and that's all i think over to dr golatti uh well uh i think there is very good suggestion already on the table starting with uh our chief best and chief host and then the keynote address that we had from all of you we have noted down all the comments and we are going to mull over those we are looking at best practices uh internationally domestically in a particular state or at a very local micro scale uh how to reorient this entire thing but we are also going to refine uh this in terms of methodology in terms of classification into those four categories uh but you can imagine when you are collecting the data from eight ministries 46 schemes 25 year data and making sense out of that and sometimes uh data uh you know there are different sources and different uh nuances within the data and you rightly said uh you know one particular policy uh two lakh crores it has positive negative how much is negative how much is positive these are not easy answers and therefore we welcome any comments how best to refine that if they have worked on those issues that will help so we are very much open to those suggestions and comments observations but one thought that we also shared yesterday that is coming up interacting with the ngos ngos are working at the ground level and it's a very micro small it can be large in terms of number but very dispersed and scale is very small small small small so on can we have some standardized methodology for capturing the impact of those practices products that they are using on the biodiversity issue but remember this particular study is primarily focusing on target 18 that is incentives disincentives for biodiversity and when we talk incentives disincentives primarily it is the public policy and how much finance is flowing those through so other targets we listed which could be relevant in this but what weight should be given to this versus that versus that we have been looking at international literature has any country done that type of an exercise where they have found a common index by weighting those uh seven eight ten you know not 23 but even a 10 and on what is the basis of that yeah we haven't found one but if you know anything about it that would help us to look into we are going to apply our mind we are committed to this issue and hopefully we will come up with a product that we can defend and the un dp can feel happy about this showcasing this as a product for many other countries to replicate maybe yeah so that's our roadmap to this uh story has just started one thing more that i feel uh which the biodiversity group and biofine biofin group has to do you know in the last 10 to 15 years everybody is talking about climate change and there's massive amount of money to have resilience against climate change from ipcc report to so it has become a global phenomenon today you can't talk of agriculture without climate change but that story biodiversity is losing has been losing same thing was global warming is happening not today but for the last 30 years suddenly that catapulted to the top of the concern of everyone how did it happen but on biodiversity still the game is not elevated to that level and therefore there is no biodiversity fund of the magnitude that world bank is talking for climate change or others that requires good advocacy and you have to publish those results not only in academic journals but also in public media print media electronic media and elevate the game and that's the job you know i'm coming from agriculture side i'm not a hardcore biodiversity person this is one thing that is being added because all these years we are trained to look at how to raise productivity that was the concern of the country efficiency competitiveness exports this that biodiversity now we are hearing something but it needs to be so there has to be in the road map forward and this is for un dp they have to invest if they want this to be taken up at a higher level at a multilateral level then there's a lot of advocacy based on research findings and based on good work it cannot be just opinions of the people it has to be based on this and the impact data driven research evidence based so that's what my road map for future at a macro global level macro level meso level can we pick up telangana as a state model state can we arrest that fall on the paddy front or within the state can we make one district or one block as a sample block where we can show this has three times different biodiversity than any other and therefore the benefits and the income levels of the farmers and the sustainability issues are all taken care of if we can create that type of a prototype success story then i think we have done a part of the justice to our planet to our farmers and to the national concerns these are a few ideas from my side that we are open if those who have not been able to get a hard copy of this there is a link that reena can share with anyone or rahul can share or kurvi can share and they can download this entire report from the website of icreer and maybe you and dp also will be putting on their website so this is in public domain it is open access and this is a first attempt on this target 18 and hopefully it will continue may i request now dr shondra pandy sir i won't take more than two minutes sir thank you for your time first of all
