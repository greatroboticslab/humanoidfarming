 I am going to show you what my day looked like today. I wake up, Nurse Laura Jo, then we get the kids fed and ready for school, which is in a little schoolhouse we have here on the farm. We have a school teacher come in and it's a one-room schoolroom with the older kids. We love our teacher, it works really well. We do our morning chores, try to get some protein in. I decided to make some soup and we just documented gathering food, making the food. And after the kids go to bed is when I typically edit. After that, we packed everything up for our kids' practices. So Daniel took the girls, I took the boys, we got everyone loaded up and in the truck. As soon as we made it there, of course, the girls were starving. We nursed, we ate Cheerios, we drank milk, and enjoyed the most beautiful sunset I've seen in a long time. And watched the kiddos play.
