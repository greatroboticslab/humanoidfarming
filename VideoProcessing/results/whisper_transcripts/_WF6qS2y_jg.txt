 Hi, I'm Mary Heiss and I'm a faculty member at the Richard Ivey School of Business and for the last 10 years I've been part of the Syngenta Ivey Growers' U program. One of my favorite things to do during the year is to talk to this group of farmers about accounting, which is funny because it's probably the least favorite things that a group of farmers would want to talk about. And my message to them is accounting is not just for your accountants at the end of your year, it's actually for you. And if you want to understand the financial performance of your farm and the financial health of your farm, that's what accounting is all about. And it's just another way of telling a story about what has happened in the past on your farm and where your farm has the potential to grow in the future. For example, lots of farmers like to make a decision around how do I buy a new piece of equipment based on whether or not they really want it or maybe even with a joke around whether or not their neighbor has the new piece of equipment. Accounting and working with your numbers can actually help you build a true business case for why a banker should support you in buying that new piece of equipment. Accounting is actually fun and a great way to tell a story to the banker that really displays for you not only do you know how to really run your business well, but you understand the financial workings of your business as well. And a happy banker is really good for everybody. Thank you.
