Science & Technology
 Look in India. Farmers traditionally pick cotton by hand, which takes a lot of time and effort. However, in other countries, cotton harvesting is done using special machines. It can pick and store up to 20 quintals of cotton at once. They also bundle and pack the harvested cotton automatically. Such machines are allowing farmers to complete a month's work in just a few hours.
