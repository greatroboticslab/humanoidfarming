 Hello farmers, my name is Chris. Today we want to address some business challenges that normally face our briefcase to farmers. So number one, most people seem to not know when to sell their animals. So if you are keeping an animal, you have to know objectively why should I keep this animal. Is it a good breeding bull? If it's a male, is it a good breeding bull? Should I keep it for a bull? If it's not good for that, probably am I going to take it to the abattoirs for me to probably as a steer? If so, then there's no point of keeping an animal that's not as good as a breeding bull for more than five years or so. Because the more the animal grows, the more it passes three years, it starts losing value. So if you keep an animal, a male animal that's not as good as a breeding bull, you should sell it at a point where you get more money. At a point where if it's taken for penfetony, it gets you to super mid-grade. So now we've seen farmers keep an animal that's not a good breeding bull, it's a male, and you keep it for six years. All it does is simply start losing value for four years. And by the time you sell it, you get little money, you'll have lost value of the animal already. So you have to be objective about why you are keeping a specific animal in your head. If it's not destined to be a breeding bull, by the time it's two years, 2.5 years, you should consider selling it as a feeder steer. At that point you make more money.
