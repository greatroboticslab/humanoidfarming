 So black tarps, you know a lot of growers have been using tarps for all these years now and they're fantastic. There's just the best way ever to destroy what was growing underneath. It's the absence of light that will do that and then that creates the perfect environment for earthworms for all the microorganisms to really thrive under the tarps and to digest the organic matter that's decomposing there and then after a few weeks you'll remove the tarps and boom it's like it's ready to go. So it's a real it's a real passive solar approach to bed prep and it's also in line with a lot of our ecological aspirations. Some really nice salads, again insect nets, so important. So all these salads they're about worth you know at least two dollars and and that's where market gardening becomes interesting. It's like it's it's on the gardening scale somehow it's like a huge garden but it's farming because you know we're deploying a lot of energy it's very intensive but when you count the the number of dollars that you can really make growing these salads it's it's interesting it's interesting to look at it like that because there's a lot of value on a bed and we measure bed value that's how we determine what to grow. So we have like all the field tomatoes that are under a caterpillar tunnel these are going to be ripe in August they're going to be a bountiful harvest all the peppers that are in the ground it's just there's a lot of peppers here that's a lot of peppers and it's not that big of a space. So this is the nightshade block you know we have a rotation on the farm you've probably you know again you've probably read that in the market gardener but you know I think it's it's pretty cool to show it and that showing also again coming back to my point is that this kind of farming is also sustainable with regards to yield it's been sustainable for us with regards to health and adventures like we've had a lot of spin-off of this kept us interested in this kind of work. Maudelaine has been steady as a rock she's committed to the customers that we have and you know we've known them for 20 years they've they've seen our kids grow. Now my boy he's 19 he left the house and so he was raised here this is his playground and it's just a I don't know it's a it's a really cool lifestyle also. And I also like the fact that you know this is a that we've been a lot inspired by permaculture and design and how to landscape the farm so that it's very natural there's a lot of things growing everywhere there's a lot of flowers you know this was bare land there was this old rabbit coop that was it and it was all about putting energy putting love into it the pond the greenhouse and you know perhaps except for the greenhouse that was a big the glass house that that's now a part of our house like a lot of this wasn't putting money it was about putting our time it was about doing it ourselves it was about you know having an excavator come and do some of the work but me doing a lot of the shoveling modeling planting a lot of these plants also and just doing iteration after iterations so flowers it's really nice so sailing boat this is what our 2020 goal was to do some sailing on the weekends there's Lake Champlain not too far You stay here today? Are you coming with me or stay here? I come this afternoon Okay, great You see we also have this this plot here it's really nice again we have this electric fence because of the deer but man these are like four beds of carrots there's a lot of carrots in here and they're fenced their fence and there's also insect nets because there's there's too many deers right now I don't know why but the pressure this year has been so high so we're really double protecting it but let's go inside Chris don't get shocked but and just I just want to also say that you know me me showing the farm is not to brag about what we do like I don't care about that and and Mo Lin doesn't care about that I can assure you but you know I'm inspired to just show that it's possible I'm inspired to show that when it's well done how we can look like There's no easy shortcut we've worked really hard we still work really hard we're still committed to what we're doing We're still learning how to grow some stuff look at these mushrooms here popping up because of the ramule woodchip Isn't that fantastic? Isn't that fantastic? So the ramule woodchip that we put on the aisles it creates a lot of the the the fungi connection with the bacterial connection that's that's how we utilize our alleyways the pathways we we put ramule woodchip which is you know I've talked about this a lot in other videos you can check that out but it's bridging the gap by having a lot of the food elements a lot of the forest elements the the hardwood fibers coming into the soil and feeding the fungi network my my mycelium that's there and you see have mushrooms you know it's it's just amazing nature nature just wants to do it nature is there nature is there so beautiful you know we're lucky we have four seasons here in Quebec and spring and summer it's just fantastic Yeah you see this is a patch of herbs so we have all the herbs cut into sections so it's one bed of different herbs but that's pretty much all we need for our 100 family CSA and bringing some extra to the market I'll show you the greenhouses so these are pole beans growing this was winter greens this winter and we have these these what? fennel that will be picked probably this week clear the bed but pole beans man that's that's a money maker for sure yeah and I said we just did a video a few weeks ago about how learning proper greenhouse techniques in the market garden has been a big game changer for us and this is the this is the tomato house we grow tomato year after year after year we've been doing this for sure 15 years now but the amount of tomatoes that we get from that greenhouse is just amazing and it's a big part of our income at the farm again learning these strategies took investment it took some of our time we've had a few fails but you know over the years we've really figured out how to do it well see it's like a tomato forest and everything here is systemized you know from how we do this so how we get optimal yield lowering the plants fertilizing irrigating controlling temperatures like we've created you know this is an ideal environment to get optimal yield and that's what we want because we seem to never get enough of tomatoes especially early on before field tomatoes pop into market and then we're kind of competing with other growers field tomatoes man they're nice but if you can get early early greenhouse tomatoes people want them like as soon as may they're excited about them they're excited about them so we have a different we have some different fruit trees growing on the farm fruit trees are not my expertise i wouldn't have a lot of good advice to say about that we had a late frost and we lost all of our our our fruits or blossoms they frost asparagus is a asparagus been growing nice but it's been a lot of asparagus asparagus been growing nice blueberries it's a tiny patch if you go in the greenhouse here you have you know these treyus cucumbers we just did a youtube episode how to set up that oh man this is this is a lot of production and there's a lot of there's a lot of income in these you know these six beds producing here it's a lot of income it's a lot of income and you know again it boils down to kind of doing it the right way learning how to do this and yeah we're kind of slowly walking back to where we started or crops and you know i don't know how many more years i'll be kind of sharing this and being passionate about it as much as i'm still because i feel that i've been telling this story for a long time but always i get some super nice feedback from people mostly young people really that are discovering this kind of universe and then they're excited about it and and i'm excited about so reconnecting with other season growers and you know we've built community over the years local community with other farmers online communities with the master class and the market garden and i just like where this is going like i feel that in our day and age where we're faced with climate change which is really really serious and the globalized economy kind of now that we better understand all the the drawbacks and the setbacks of being rigged like that like localized food system is really really what the future in my opinion is and having the multiplication of all these small ecological farms would be how you know community could be built everywhere and and that's going on and we're part of that and this garden has inspired a lot of people and it's still inspiring ourselves and i'm just happy to share it you
