 Yo, what's up, everybody? So, we have a brand new update in Javan Empire. So, we have four new pickup trucks. Very, very nice. So, we have the Ford F-150 Raptor R. We have the 2017 Nissan Titan Warrior Concept. Interesting. We have the 2024 Chevrolet Cerato 1500 DR2. And then, finally, we have the 2022 Nissan Frontier D41. Okay, interesting. And then, we have Builder Truck Event Pickup Trucks have arrived. Four new pickup trucks, performance customization pitches, and limited resale. Interesting. Okay, so, they're reselling the Zenvo again. Okay, very interesting. All right, so, let's go ahead and see. So, we have the Builder Truck, which is for the Chevrolet Cerato. Okay, so, we're going to get into that in just a little bit. First, let's go ahead and buy the trucks that we can currently buy. And then, I'm going to show you guys all the locations for the actual, you know, the Chevrolet Cerato, which would actually be pretty cool. All right, so, here we have the Nissan Frontier. Ooh, this is pretty nice. Look at this. Let's go ahead and purchase it for $60,000. Look at this. Nice interior. Nothing too crazy, but I do actually like this a lot. Let me go ahead and favorite this, actually. Then, we have the Nissan Titan Warrior Concept. Yo, I've never seen this truck before, actually. I actually like the interior. Look at that. That's actually kind of sick. I'm not going to lie. That's actually kind of cool. I might put some, like, off-road tires on this. And then, finally, we have the Ford F-150 Raptor R. There we go. Yo, look at this. And the Chevrolet Cerato. How does this sound? That's actually not a bad startup. That's not bad. All right, so, let me go ahead and show you guys how you can actually unlock this. All the locations for this. All right, so, it's going to be kind of, like, in a random order, because I'm trying to, like, find them myself, like, kind of at the same time. But here is the very first one. I forgot which one this is. I really don't know. Okay, these are the mirrors. All right, there we go. I think I'm actually going to use the UFO, because that'd actually be smarter. I think the next one is somewhere around here. It's in another dumpster. There's one that's in another dumpster. So, hold on. Let me go ahead and see. It's somewhere around here. Oh, there's one. We just found one randomly. There we go. So, here is one. I'm literally just exploring. I'm trying to figure it out myself. I kind of, like, know where they are. There we go. Now, we got one of our four doors. All right, let's keep exploring. And I think there's one actually near, like, my more dumpster. So, let's go ahead and see. All right, so, here we are in Chinatown. I think one of them. Yep, there we go. There it is. So, there is the gas station. What is this? Tires. Okay, so, these are tires. Here we go. Wheels. One out of four wheels. Dang, you actually need to collect a lot of stuff, bro. I'm not gonna lie. All right, so, let's get to the next one. So, you know, we're right here in Chinatown. If you have, you know, any flying vehicle, you're gonna want to go over to the parking garage right here. And boom, at the very top is where you're gonna find your next item. And what are these? These are tires. Okay, more tires. All right, perfect. So, we should have two out of four now. There we go. We have two out of four wheels. Let's keep moving. Then, I think the next one is actually near the housing dealership. Is this the housing? No, this is not the housing dealership. I think the housing dealership is more, like, over here. So, the next wheel should be around here, if I'm not mistaken. Okay, that's definitely... Oh, there you go. The housing dealership is right there. Okay, so, it should be right around here. All right, here it is, right here in this alley. So, if you guys want to, you can literally just go over here to dealerships and just teleport the houses. So, that's pretty easy. And then, boom, go ahead and grab that one. And then, for the last wheels, let's go ahead and see where they are. All right, for some reason, I really can't find the last wheel. But I'm just gonna show you guys the other ones. It's kind of random. I know this is kind of, like, all over the place. But I'm trying to figure this out. They low-key made this a little bit harder than usual. I'm not gonna lie. They usually make it pretty easy. But, you know, that's actually not too bad. Because, you know, you actually have to work for it. All right, so, I think there's one over by the lighthouse, if I'm not mistaken. So, all right. So, here we are at lighthouse. And here is one of the doors. Perfect. So, that is one out of four, I believe. Or do I already have... Oh, two out of four. There we go. Perfect. All right. All right. So, now what we want to do is go ahead and go over to the dealership. And I believe it should be by the end of the highway race. Or by the end of the drag race, actually. So, let's go over here in the UFO. Just gonna travel right over here. Go right here. It should be around the end of the drag race, where you could see the last part. Hold on. I think it's somewhere around... Here. It should be... There it is. There it is. Right in between right there in the drag race. So, you probably just want to drop down. Boom. And there we go. We have three out of four doors. Now, we just need the last one. There we go. We're actually making good progress. All right. So, I think the final one is at a bridge. That's kind of hard to explain. Hold on. I kind of need to find it. I think the last one is at a bridge that's near the pinkies, if I'm not mistaken. So, it's kind of here where it cuts off. So, let me see. I think it's somewhere around here. I need to find the exact highway because it's kind of like a little cutoff. It's like an intersection, if that makes sense to you guys. I think it's right around here, if we keep going. We're just going to keep going down this highway. I think it's somewhere around here. Is it here? Wait. No, it's not here. It's not the ramp. Wait. Where could it be? Oh, there it is. I found it. There you go. Okay. There it is. This is a little bit complicated. I'm not going to lie. But here it is. So, it is right here. And I think that's the final door, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah. That should be the final door. Where is this? Oh, it's actually the bumper. Okay. So, we got 101 bumper. There we go. Final door, I think, is nearby the beach under the actual area of what should we call it? I think it's called... I literally forgot what it's called. I'm not going to lie. But I think the final one is actually nearby the beach because it shows it's actually in the sand. So, let me go ahead and see. I think it's right under Ridgeline Pier. That's what I was actually trying to think of. Yeah. Ridgeline Pier, I think, is where it actually is. Right under that area is where you find the last part. Yo, they actually did a great job with this, bro. They're actually hiding these well. I think it's right... Is it right here? I think it should be. Yup. There it is. There it is. And that's how you find the final door. All right. So, what else do we need to find? Now, we need to find... So, we have the doors. Go ahead and claim that. Claim that. All right. So, what we need to do is find the tailgate. I think the mirrors and the grill, the four wheels. All of these are actually just races. So, all you have to do is literally races for these. So, let's go ahead and try to, you know, keep finding them. All right. So, I believe one of the next parts which we actually need is near the drag race, actually. I don't know how I passed it, but I think I actually might have seen it. But I think it's right around right here. Yeah. I don't know how I literally passed this. I literally went past this, I guess. But here it is. And what is this? This is the mirrors. There we go. So, we're now actually done with the mirrors. So, what else do we need? We need the tailgate and the grill. I think that's the only thing that we need. Yeah. All of these are actually just races. So, that should literally be it. We just need the grill and the tailgate. So, I think the grill is actually over by the barn grill, if I'm not mistaken. Let me go ahead and check. But I do think it's by the barn grill. So, this should be pretty easy. All right. So, barn grill is just like right here near the cross-country area. There should be something here. Yep. There it is. And I think it's actually the bumper or the grill. Yeah. There it is. There we have the grill. And what else do we need? Finally, we just need the tailgate. All right. And that should be the last part that we actually need. The rest, you just got to kind of grind, you know, do some races. Fender. Yep. Tail lights. Tailgates. There we go. So, we just need the tailgate now. All right. That's basically all we need to find. And also, the final wheels, which we need to find. All right. Not too bad. All right. So, for the final wheels, what you actually need to do is go ahead and go over the dealership. Teleport over to the boat dealership. And then, what you actually want to go ahead and do is just want to go by over here. Let me actually get a car. Let me get, like, the Hennessy. And it is right here. So, right there from the boat dealership, you just go right here. And boom. We have the final wheels. And I think we pretty much have everything. Wheels. What else do we need? Oh, we need the tailgate. All right. So, we need to find the tailgate. All right. So, the tailgate is going to be by the barn. So, we might as well just go ahead and go over to the dealership real quick. And we're just going to go ahead and let me go. Roblox UFO. All right. There we go. And then, all we're going to do is we're just going to go to the very, very end of the highway, basically. So, right here. End of the highway. Get your fastest, you know, helicopter. UFO. Wait. They just made this slow. Yo, this UFO used to be, like, crazy fast. I just realized. And our last part is right here, which I believe is the tailgate. And let's go ahead and claim it. Bro, I'm, like, so far from it. And, yeah. Here we have it. Here is the tailgate. And now, we have basically everything. After you're done completing, you know, your other challenges and stuff like that, you're going to have everything. Click to build. And the build is completed. And I think we're going to get, like, a little animation right now of what it looks like. Yup. There we go. And you have finally unlocked it. Let's actually go ahead and see what it does for customization and stuff. So, Chevrolet Silverado. Interesting. Here we go. Dang, yo. This thing is crazy, though. Look at this. This is actually a huge truck. This is massive, bro. All right. So, let's go ahead and see what you can do for customization and stuff. Okay. So, nothing too crazy. Really, nothing too crazy. It's just kind of, you know, about having it. You know, that's kind of like the flats or the luxury. But, yeah. That is pretty much it. That is how you find all the locations. I know this was, like, a little bit all over the place. But I was, you know, trying to find it myself, actually. But, yeah. Hopefully, this video helped you guys. That is the Chevrolet Silverado. And that's how you get it. All the locations. And, yeah. That's pretty much it for today's video. Have a good one, everybody. And bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
