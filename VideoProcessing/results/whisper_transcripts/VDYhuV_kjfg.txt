 I think heirloom seeds are important for me personally because they really tell the story of not only my ancestors and what they grew, I remember things they grew, but also you can learn about different cultures, you can learn about your culture of course, but also other cultures. It's the best way I know to tell the story in a living way, it's actually not some painting that's in a museum, but it's actually something you can grow, a work of art you can put on your own table and enjoy and pass on to your kids and your grandkids and your neighbors and friends and along the way they develop more and more stories and these stories keep getting passed along with the seeds, plus the whole importance of keeping our seed freedom alive, you know, being able to save our seed and pass it down and not what's from a commercial supplier. We found when we test different seeds from different companies on corn that up to about 50% of the varieties out there on the market right now, the varieties that are supposed to be open pollinated heirloom varieties, are actually have sometimes traces of contamination and other times large amounts of contamination from gene altered crops, which is a big issue with us. It's not only very sad to see these older varieties getting contaminated and potentially lost, but also it's an issue of who owns the seed then. There's a lot people can do in America to make sure we have a better food supply. Number one is grow some yourself if you can and the number two, and it's almost number one, is make sure you're buying from local farmers, make sure you're buying from farmers you know, farmers you can trust. In America right now we're seeing a vast increase in the number of new gardeners, you know, it's like doubling every couple years, which is exciting. People want something that tastes like food again. They're tired of tomatoes that taste like styrofoam or you know, corn that's all sweet, but it doesn't really have a corn flavor. You know, squash that tastes, you know, really bland, there's no flavor left, watermelons that aren't sweet anymore and they don't have seeds. What if something happens, you know, how would I be able to keep growing this watermelon if it doesn't have seeds or if it's a hybrid? So all these concerns are causing people to want something that tastes better and also people are worried about what's, you know, is it really great for my kids?
