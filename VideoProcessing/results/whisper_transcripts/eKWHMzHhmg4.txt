Howto & Style
 today i'm at a garden i've been looking forward to visiting for years and i don't think it's an exaggeration to say that this is one of the most highly regarded vegetable gardens in the world and it's all down to the humble yet famous gardener who's created it over the past decade charles dowding charles hello oh hi for those who don't know him charles is the absolute granddaddy of no dig or no-till gardening which is the very simplest yet most effective way to grow vegetables that more and more gardeners are adopting this guy has a wealth of knowledge and experience built over years of experimentation so i think we're going to learn a few things today i can recognize this straight away this is the dig and no dig bed which is kind of the hub of proving your point that you don't need to dig the soil why no dig for those who might not appreciate that well it's partly why i've got this experiment here it's for me to learn more about soil and about digging actually because i don't do it much this is the only dig bed in the whole place and it's teaching me a lot about why i do no dig which is that we get earlier more abundant crops as you can see yes no dig here dig bed there we get better drainage in wet weather we get fewer slugs and also i had to replace quite a few lettuce on the the dug bed because the slugs have been much more damaging there right so do you think by digging the soil you're creating more sort of crevices and cracks for the sort of slugs to hide in is that i think it's more to do with biology that uh you're damaging things like the ground beetles which eat slug eggs and i've only learned that myself in the last few years you know i've kind of done this without necessarily knowing all the details why but i've discovered more and more of the reasons and soil analysis showing how you get a better crumb structure so that's why rain flows through better but why it also holds moisture better and roots can get in there more easily and i guess adding all the organic master on top not digging it you're getting a lovely kind of rich spongy kind of uh texture aren't you that sort of uh yeah drains better i guess in wet weather but also retains the moisture better yeah it's fantastic for clay soils you know people often ask oh does no big work on clay but actually that's the best soil for yeah because it makes life so much easier for you and actually clay soil is really good it's just difficult to work charles i can really see the difference here with these luscious kind of fulsome onions here and these guys which will catch up i'm sure but you uh reckon that's obviously because you've not dug this bed and the organic matter is just added on top in what sort of the autumn or winter for these beds here what's the december december okay yeah it's kind of copying nature you know how you've got a leaf or plants dying and but it never gets dug in it's the same amount of compost in both beds so that one has the compost dug in two wheelbarrows for this much and that one has it on top and but i had a phd researcher here recently and he was looking at the carbon content of these two beds and guess what that one has a lot it has 14 14 14. wow compared to um farmland would be about two percent wow that's incredible yeah maybe pasture land might be five to six percent uh so 14 there but this one has 18 18 that's crazy that's the same amount being added every so what's happened to the four percent difference just could have gone back into the it's lost in oxidation through the digging process yeah so i suppose like carbon is the biggest uh visual sign of that uh of how well this is working because it's it's staying in there that carbon staying in the soil and that's obviously helping with all the soil life and and so on yeah exactly carbon is the building block of plant growth of everything in the soil it's the fuel yeah for soil organisms so the more we can have in the soil as i understand it anyway yeah better makes sense these beds here pretty much sum up the entire case for no dig or no-till gardening charles you're telling me that this row here is forked and disturbed to help aerate it the traditional kind of folklore if you like and then the rest is no dig what's the difference here between yields oh well this is in the first 10 years of doing this we've received harvested eight percent less from where we fork the soil just putting in a fork once a year to loosen or aerate isn't that funny because you feel like your gut's telling you that's the right thing to do you're introducing air you're loosening it up that has to work surely probably breaking the mycelial network yes it's shattering a lot of fungal threads that we now know are really important you say that vegetables like growing in in little groups together don't they like companionship yeah they're like friends and for me that's companion planting if you like you know it's a companionship of being close to another absolutely yeah you're a bit of a the vegetable growing world because you like to sort of blow up myths and and all sorts and one of those is crop rotation which is a little bit controversial these potatoes here they've been grown in the same piece of ground for how many seasons this is year 10. yeah 10 that's insane i grew up on a conventional dairy farm and i have to almost fight myself a bit every spring i'm planting the potato in the same place and yet over nine years of doing that the health of the plants has not deteriorated it's all been great harvests the harvest haven't gone down and i even keep my own potato seed from the harvest to replant a bit concerned about allium leaf miner which has only just arrived here yeah and i don't quite know what do we get a new pest you know how does one yeah in fact the lettuce beyond there that's yeah that's the eighth year in a row of lettuce in the same place right yeah super healthy plants they look so healthy 62 kilos from that amount of plants 62 kilos yeah that's like i mean that's the weight of a weight of an adult isn't it this is the uh hub of the garden obviously and look at this thermometer it's at 65 celsius what's that in fahrenheit well it's very hot that's what it is one of the questions i want to ask this is so got so much organic matter on it and you add what sort of an inch or three centimeters every year do you produce all of it yourself because obviously a lot of the food's being eaten and going off site with with people how much of it is um created here and imported by volume it looks to be about two thirds i reckon that okay making of the of that i'm actually importing some wood chip to make it as well so the materials it might be about half the materials coming from here okay which is not coming only from the vegetable garden but hedgerows that we cut right and also ben i'm totally happy to put weeds on the compost heap like docks marigolds buttercups yeah i guess when it's getting up to that sort of temperature you know that helps but actually i've done bindweed in a cold compost heap and it's not invincible you know it will if you keep putting new stuff on top even if your heap's not hot yeah eventually it runs out i guess so yeah yeah but that's pretty good though like half the material isn't it yeah i'm happy and i'm selling a lot and you know my customers don't return their their poo what i find with these heaps here because i this is quite a big operation for uh bigger than most people might want in their gardens and this these get a bit too hot and a bit anaerobic in the middle oh right and that's why i got this pipe here because i see some air in there yeah particularly once we've finished adding which will be fairly soon yeah i don't know if you can see look at that yeah yeah cook your porridge in there i'm sure we use the same principle on turning them once uh we turn only once but that makes helps to get a bit more air in yeah yeah yeah but i've got the pallet bays up there oh yes yes we line the sides with cardboard that helps to keep the warmth and moisture in it's beautifully low tech isn't it because these you can pick up pretty cheaply pretty widely available just about still yeah cardboard obviously plenty of amazon deliveries and then you've got your stuff yeah so the only difference um well it's smaller but also the hasn't got a roof over while we're making i really value the roof to keep the rain out i see so once you've filled it then the roof goes on here yeah bits of course just take so how old is this stuff in here then this is uh six or seven months yeah right wow look at that yeah oh it's so it is it weird to say it just smells like so beautiful look at that it's it's nicely erasing yeah yeah yeah and some you know worms in there yeah they're turning it to work properly alive yeah so that's what we turned into here from there about two months ago and this one was the heap that was being made while that was happening and i see now been maturing for about six weeks since we finished yeah we'll turn that from here brilliant middle what's under here charles it feels like we're unwrapping a beautiful presence it's my wormery oh yeah wow anaerobic gosh come on you yeah yeah so i'm giving them anything really that's stuff which is half decomposed results the result i want is uh the worm cast yeah because i've noticed with potting compost it really improves if you can get i see so this is super super concentrated compost this is like the yeah yeah and full of enzymes and and you know when you're making potting compost you you need it you need it concentrated because you're not using much and it's yeah one little cell is growing amazing plants yeah so the worm costs are brilliant for that but only about 10 but yeah if you i just keep it in balance yeah yeah as far as possible and actually here in this bin we've got some of this compost as well as some of the our other homemade compost oh wow and apart from being a bit wet it's looking pretty nice that's gorgeous wow i see you've obviously have to put up the armory like everyone else against pests and you've got this here for what carrot fly obviously also rabbits actually oh rabbits yeah i've got rabbits here and this is definitely one of their favorite foods yeah yeah so it's standard environment and uh before that i lost the first showing here to slugs oh really wow it's reassuring to know that the sort of that you lose uh crops to pests like that as well because it's very few but i do find carrots are the most difficult on this yeah it's so tiny sometimes you have to re-sew a few times to pick that window of when finally they'll yeah absolutely yeah and as you can see it's mostly successful this time yeah one of my big problems is leaf miner my chard and beetroot every year it's more cosmetic but yeah it's just relentless yeah i don't have an answer for that no i do find here maybe because it's a bit bigger garden it's kind of the they dilute this dilutes the pests do you think a bit of more airflow as well helps yeah absolutely and same with carrot root fly even actually i think you know more wind blowing through can be good so yeah small garden it's more yeah mine's very sheltered so i think that's the problem charles i see we've got some rust here on the garlic do you think these will come good they're pretty healthy plants otherwise aren't they they've grown very well yeah they went in the ground 30th september actually and i sowed mustard at the same time which has grew up really fast it's a kind of like residues of it here can't you yeah that's it and then you've also got seleriac in there as well it's really working cramming so much in this is amazing pack it in but the rust i i was stripping a bit off here horrible isn't it yeah yeah yeah but it's just depressing the final harvest because it means there's less green leaves on the plant but because they've had a long time to grow and they've got quite fat stones so i'll get a harvest okay yeah but i've got some in the polytunnel where i do deliberately because it doesn't get so much rust in there and they're definitely bigger and stronger and just the sheer moist the moistness of the air out here it's something like light actually yeah exactly it's yeah constant rain in the springs yeah at least we'll be getting a good crop from them nevertheless charles this is such a beautiful area but you're telling me this was um past just what three or four months ago yeah late january now it's uh 20th may so basically what we do is uh actually mow it a bit first up just to make the ground easier to level out the compost yeah it's more level yeah i've got a two ton lorry drop two tons of green waste compost in the middle there so actually that made it quite quick to spread maybe just over an inch or so okay and then another lorry came along with two cubic meters of mushroom compost okay okay which also is spread on top which one's superior in your opinion and well i prefer the mushroom compost it's got a bit more nutrition but the green most compost varies so much and actually the guy who brings mine it's pretty good very little plastic yeah it's saved to 10 mil so okay quite fine yeah yeah then we put the plastic on top but because even in february when warm february the weeds were going through that much compost which is about three inches maybe yeah yeah and so already you could see they would just re-establish because yeah you know we're going from a really weedy yeah yeah strong plants to this and so the plastic is just making sure the weeds die earlier this week i had to have i have help here i've got a full-time guy and another helper someday so they roll back the plastic and what did we find just like tons of slugs and snails oh no so there was a big harvest of those yeah yeah get it all you're literally walking through just hand picking them to kind of clear it a bit yeah yeah yeah this is old plastic this is four years old and it's got the planting holes from the previous years already yeah so we we've got another sheet on top which is to cover the holes in the plastic yeah that's it and it was between the two plastics there were tons of these slugs i see anyway they sorted that out and put the single sheet back and we've used the same holes put in these plants five days ago so these these plants are only three and a half weeks old actually the squash and the corn which is for dry corn in fact is it all right like so dent corn yeah yeah yeah so um what squash variety is it your this is crown prince this and curry oh yeah that ends so earlier harvest there and later harvest here that's great and that i mean i'm no good fan of using plastic more than i need to but this you know being like a four-year-old sheet yeah yeah i mean you can see it's got plenty of life left in it yet so probably it's uv treated so it doesn't do great for us okay that's important yeah and what will you be doing with the dried corn you're going to grind it up yeah make your own yeah wow amazing it's painted mountain so it's quite oh it's the pretty kind of glass gem one isn't it the colorful one yeah yeah i mean normally i start no dig with cardboard on weeds and compost because that's so accessible to everyone everyone's got cardboard so yeah and the cardboard decomposes within about two months so here just for example four months ago i this was just for a demo this got this little pack and i put cardboard on and only two inch five centimeter compost we had did need to remove two or three dandelions that because they're so vigorous here and they were going through using a trial get out most of the root but not all of it and the other thing i'm noticing charles is down here that's an incredibly attractive edge you've got here how do you keep these all so clean like that those edges okay well it firstly it does help to keep the grass short so mowing once a week reduces the vigor of the plant roots trying to come in but we still yeah they're always moving aren't they so either long handle shears yeah every two weeks say and then maybe every month using the half moon oh okay so it's just a question of getting the half moon out and just being meticulous you can go along almost at walking speed you know just it's not a deep cut yeah it's just a sliver wow charles i've seen this some from so many of your own videos this is really the nub of it all and you've got you got so much in here i look oh wow well i deliberately i'm really aware of the importance of space management and propagation and how i think many module trays and cells are too big actually big because look at this this is french beans probably sown about two weeks ago there's 60 yeah cells in that plug tray many people think that's way too small for a bean seed but yeah obviously not it's really working yeah these are pretty much ready to go in yeah they've got great root system haven't they yeah just about two weeks old lovely stuff and they pop out easily because this this feature of the trays i designed you know what i want this to be just totally practical i never wash or clean them between uses use them many times in a year see that astonishes me i've heard you say this before i never clean it and there's the people there with the cleaning fluid the jays fluid or something washing them out and making sure there's no disease left on but you're breaking another rule aren't you yeah it's all microbes are good they all interrelate and everything like that yeah and um big big seeds so peas we do and we do multi-same beetroot multi-same onions in these as well and i overfill them yeah see that it's really overflowing you don't brush it off no it was so funny i was teaching a group last summer and one of them was doing one of the trainings in horticulture the qualification and she said oh i'd be failed for filling a trailer really i want to get more compost in there yeah it makes sense doesn't it really yeah yeah what are these here these uh what's here spring well leaks actually leaks yeah very similar multi-same leaks this is another great example of multi-same you got sort of up to sort of what six seedlings there yeah actually i'll thin them out yeah i want four i want four so it's about at this stage i'll take a few out like that and get down to four but on anything between two and four okay good but that means in there say on average three you've got 800 180 leaks wow yeah yeah size of an a4 amazing isn't it when you put it like that and yeah so how many individual plants must we have here do a bit of maths quickly at least what 2000 maybe approach yeah at least 1500 at only one time almost everything else you see in here goes straight from these module cells straight in the ground yeah and that makes it really quick because yeah absolutely yeah i've also designed uh a long this is the famous dimmer yeah i love this yeah so that makes it really quick to yeah just absolutely make a little hole yeah i see you've got some vintage uh plug trays here as well these guys can you show us like some of your oldest ones they must be like old friends that kind of yeah come out year after year these ones this one dates back to the 1980s what you're kidding me yeah look at that that's because in the 80s it was pretty standard yeah yeah and it was a 40 cell and it's lost bits over yeah yeah you can see but actually still use it look at that and yeah it's amazing it's as old as me almost fundamental design i think of these that's so good of these is the size of the whole yeah so easy to get them out on there yeah yeah yeah and but good drainage good drainage and people who've never done this they think how come the potting mix doesn't all fall out of the bottom but you once you've done it you realize it all sticks together yeah yeah 1985 guys wow you are continually trialing things you never get bored of it and i love that and you're doing a little comparison here of uh potting mixes or composts yeah one's clearly doing better than the other isn't it what's going on here charles this is from the same makers and this is their normal quite cheaper what i would call chemical compost so it's got chemical fertilizers in oh okay right that's standard practice so this is the one that's most widely available this one is there from the same company but it's organic yeah look at the difference in those roots as well it's so even and kind of yeah and you see that one's it's clearly struggling for some nutrients already exactly well i think it's a bit the issue with the peat-free thing and you know i think there's a limit to how far we should go with this because we definitely want to go in that direction but for many people it's tying one hand behind the back and if you've done all your sowings and plantings this year using this compost yeah you would have lost a month yeah you you might have even compromised some harvest and not got them all together i guess if you're a new garden you think oh this is a bit rubbish isn't it it could be really put off yeah what sort of temperature does this get to i suppose it gets really hot you have to let it cool down and then you put your seedlings on or do you kind of push you luck yeah maybe the first few days it does off gas a bit okay of ammonia gases yeah that's in 20th of february we fill it and that's fresh horse manure it's got this rack on top so actually that stops the seedlings getting too hot i guess so and i guess you could always raise them up a bit if it was too hot so do you dig it all out at the end of the season and completely refill yeah well in about two weeks uh yeah so early june it's done its job actually yeah so it goes out to a pallet heap out there okay finishes fermenting we'll use it next year in the polytunnel for tomatoes and things oh great yeah yeah and uh there's a bit of talk of um like herbicides that the horses ingest and that killing off things you just have to know the the owners of the horses very well yeah absolutely i quiz them as much as possible yeah but you still can't be sure yeah yeah and so what we do out there is actually grow some tomatoes in it you know um do like a test run just to check that's a good idea isn't it so i'm sure before i spread it in yeah it makes sense in here the tomatoes growing in here they've got some of that horsemure from last year you're really cramming things in here charles you've got garlic and then what cucumbers here yeah all kind of like interplanted and the garlic went in in october and it just grew slowly between winter salads which is really my main crop here because they they're more profitable actually than some summer cucumbers and tomatoes but we picked the wind salads all all winter long and then they come rise to flower during april roughly and then we have got a bit of time to put on the compost okay that's when it goes on yeah yeah here we put it on in early may as compared to november december outside and then plant everything you see here now including the marigolds which have been eaten quite a bit by wood lice i reckon yeah yeah bit of basil celery that was a sort of bit of a catch crop so celery like needs really really moist soil but you've got it undercover here so is that kind of watered you have to water that especially water that a lot yeah yeah of all the vegetables i grow it's the one i water the most by far yeah yeah if you want to get good celery that's sort of basically a bog plant isn't it that's the thing yeah exactly yeah yeah and then uh just a few french beans for early harvest which this year i think might really pay off and what are these these welsh onions or yeah no that's um it's onions that i'd selected my best ones uh put them in the ground that's for seed oh okay yeah yeah so that temporary shelving there to for the leak plants but that will come then yeah beautiful uh they are stunning i do love onion flowers yeah yeah yeah and and because it's undercover i've got some outside as well but the thing about raising your own seed is often they're seeding quite late in the summer yeah it's quite wet yeah and you can easily lose the quality of the season that's why they're under here yeah yeah and you're not just like just growing one or two plants so you've got like about 10 there yeah 10 hours minimum really to get the genetic the cross-pollination a strong gene pool gotcha i think you know what i mean and home say save seed like you're saying lasts a bit longer because it's you know you know obviously you know when it's been harvested and it's fresh you can yeah you know it's fresh yeah because when seed is sold to you and you think it's fresh seed but it's packeted year ending that's what they put on the label so you don't sneaky chard is always like the poster boy of the vegetable world isn't it these beautiful stems and all of this is because essentially you're feeding the soil rather than the junk food if you like of sort of artificial fertilizers is that kind of a fair statement i think that's a spot on comparison actually yeah and i think plants like us they're healthier for being fed naturally not with synthetic yeah i think yeah and like behind me here that's the what i would call the annual dose yeah of fertility we're putting on and it's it's sometimes called feeding soil it's better called feeding soil life yeah yeah yeah and so there's some nutrients in the compost but also there's a lot of organic matter and microbes that are feeding all the organisms and really this is all your vegetables are getting is this annual top up and nothing else yeah that i don't give any feeds or fertilizer yeah i do use a bit of seaweed though and i think that has a place because trace elements maybe we don't know i never know for sure mostly we're spreading it here in november december and then the rain is washing through like this year we've had so much rain yeah so all the compost we put on before the winter has been thoroughly washed yeah and for me that's one of the big differences between fertilizer and compost that fertilizer will lead you away mostly but compost it doesn't it clearly doesn't yeah yeah and we don't put any more on in the summer either because you know we're doing the second cropping so this child already has some we put it between the plants and then in two weeks time i'll twist it out because it's it's finishing it's going to fly and i've got the new child ready to come on but we'll put a second planting here might be french beans or something no new compost i am really keen to encourage anyone if there's anyone watching this video who's never grown a plant in their life have a go and you might have some failures but don't let that put you off it's a bit of a cliche but it is so true every failure is genuinely a lesson isn't it we're growing on a third of an acre here about 35 000 pounds worth of food in a year so you know that that's a nice number so yes but i i did used to get a lot of questions like people would say well why bother growing your own i can just go down the supermarket and buy it so cheaply there's a lot of research from nutritionists isn't there coming out about yeah the supermarket food doesn't have the biome yeah the microbes that we need it's not only about what it looks like yeah yeah and sometimes it looks better in the supermarket but your own food that might have a few imperfections yeah you know i was giving a talk to a group of primary school children once and um i said so actually one of the best things you can do is eat a bit of soil and it's like wow the teachers were saying i love it charles i feel like we've all learned so much today i you're very generous with your knowledge and time i have to say so thank you so much it's my pleasure thank you
