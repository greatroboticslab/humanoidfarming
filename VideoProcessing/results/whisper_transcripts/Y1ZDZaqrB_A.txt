 Todd Kimbrell in Texas, Extreme Mag, here with Garrett Gunnels of Sessico. We're out here planting sesame today into our wheat stubble. Going through some challenges trying to get the seed set. This stuff is really tiny. Look how small the seed is. Trying to get the vacuum set, our rate right. Tell them what we're doing for population. For population, I think we're putting out around two pounds an acre, 350,000 seeds per acre. Pretty high population. We're also running in-furrow water on this stuff. It's a little bitty tiny seed. We're running 10 gallons of water in-furrow. And that really helps us make it fly out of the ground. We can usually get out of the ground in about three days with the water. So that's something we're doing here that's helping us out a ton. Yeah, who would ever thought that in-furrow water would speed up germination on this stuff? I mean, this stuff's so tiny and it's so oily. And we've had to fight with our vacuum, getting our vacuum set. And in two days, I've found some in two days, we've had like, we've got a one inch sprout on some. So this stuff's really going to blow out of the ground. I think we can get it figured out. Like I said, it's a little bit of a challenge keeping the stuff in the planter with the vacuum. He's had to put seals around the belts and the, it's just a whole different animal, but we're looking for a good stand. I think we're set up for success here. Yeah, I agree. And when will this stuff harvest? We'll harvest in about 130 days from today. I think we're, that's looking around the end of September from now. Okay. Should be picking it up. We'll probably run a desiccate application over it about middle of August and we'll let it dry down.
