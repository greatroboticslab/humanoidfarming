 Topping is a simple technique that can significantly boost your cannabis yields. By cutting off the main stem just above a node, you encourage the plant to grow two new colas instead of just one. This not only increases the number of buds, but also creates a more even canopy, allowing more light to reach lower branches. Timing is crucial. Top your plants after they've developed four to six nodes for the best results. Topping is a high-impact, low-effort way to maximize your harvest. Give it a try and watch your plants thrive.
