 Hey there my awesome friends! Welcome back to the Blaze Farm Channel. Today we've got a super fun mission ahead, loading up and moving cows, sheep, horses, bulls, goats, and even tractors. To get the job done we're rolling out with some mighty man trucks and trusty animal trailers. We'll be loading the animals with the incredible case tractors, followed by the tiny but mighty Linder mini tractors. Once everything's all packed up, we'll hit the road with our epic man trucks. But wait, there's more. In the second part of the video, we've set up a mega showdown between tractors hauling excavators and water tanks. Hope you have a blast watching today's epic adventure. I'm Blaze and I'm wishing you an awesome day ahead. Ozzy이 잘 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
