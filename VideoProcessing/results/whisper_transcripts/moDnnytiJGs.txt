 10 benefits of livestock farming that most people would never tell you especially the livestock farmers they wouldn't share that with you no no no no because they want to be the only people that may want to enjoy that number one is money yes livestock farmers earn a lot of money from their farming business and that is what they do not want you to know a lot of people think that it's just they buy them small when they take care of them that they grow then they sell it at a higher bid that is how livestock farmers make money well that could be one of the ways but that is not even the major way that they make money the major way that livestock farmers make money is through reproduction increasing the numbers so livestock people who want to make money in livestock farming do not go by males males males males no they go buying fertile females females that could reproduce so they do not think about today they think about tomorrow so if you want to go into livestock farming and you want to eat you want to make a lot of money you can have males a few males but your your focus and everything might go on the female because those ones will be those two that will give you birth to children for you for you to keep making money somebody can start livestock with 50 females or hundred females and within the next two years he can have time straight over if he goes into goat farming then that's crazy if he goes into sheep farming we give birth twice a year that is crazy if he goes into calm or cattle farming that is also crazy so the livestock farmers it's not like they make money they buy and sell at a higher bid that is the way they make their fortune no they make their fortune through increasing the numbers through reproduction through given birth though in the short run they may want to make some money to be able to take care of their farming and tents and this is an idea I'm giving you if you are going into livestock farming your profit is not today so if you don't divide or know how to budget yourself you may go and buy all the animals and you can it will get something that you can't even buy medication for the animals you can't even feed yourself and your family so you need to know how much you put in the livestock farm and how much you keep so that you'll be able to help yourself and one of the money is that the money that you'll be keeping to take care of your family you could also buy livestock with it and sell it at a shorter time so you can buy goat cow or sheep today you buy the meal and then you take you you buy them you take care of them few months then you sell that is how you can make short-term benefit for yourself while you wait for the long-term benefits do you understand so the major reason or the major benefits of livestock farming is larger when we come to the large scale or the macro level ghana for example had made over 4.4 billion ghana cities as at the year 2020 so if you want to go into livestock farming and you want to be part of the story that your country will be telling then you should want to go into livestock farming that could rip your huge amount of money you know why i waited i've spent a lot of time on this point because the most important reason why people go into farming ah can i stress how can i do less on this point i have to talk much about it now number two is employment livestock farming has given employment to a lot of youth it is only a disappointment that our educational system is always encouraging us to go for white colored job so when someone is going to school he's thinking about working in an office his family thinks about him working in an office but that is with the africans but the european world or the western world or the developed world they don't think like the way we think if the person is going to learn accounting the person is going to learn about agriculture or whatever relating to farming or relating to other certain he's always thinking of how to implement it in his farm and that is how they are better than us so you can find an university person today he finishes and you tell him to go and look for to go and start a livestock business buy poultry buy cow or sheep or goat and start rearing and also start reselling he'll tell you no he doesn't need that he'll be applying going around applying for jobs but some are wise some have realized that no waiting for that white colored job is not the solution they have put down their certificate they have put down their suit and they are on the bushes hustling with cattle hustling with goats hustling with this and at the end of the day they make huge fortune i know a lot of youth that have that are making a lot of money from livestock farming and if you want to talk to me or you want me to even come and interview on this just let me know so the idea is that livestock farming has given a lot of jobs to people see the laborers people who be helping you the veterinary services they're telling even the owners livestock farming has given them a means of livelihood and that is not to be underrated number three while livestock farming helps you make a lot of money it also helps you save a lot of money if you are into livestock farming one way or the other or one day you yourself will need the livestock you yourself will need the meat some you yourself you need to use one of the stock for your personal use or for your family use and imagine you have them and you are going to take no that will be a drawings from your business but it will be at a lesser cost imagine you are taking money out to go and buy things that you already have you'll be spending a lot than when you own it so you might need a goat or a sheep or a cattle for a naming ceremony maybe your wife has given birth especially the Muslims or you will need a cow for you know your aid and other or your eat celebration when that time a lot of people are stressing their pockets to spend huge amount of money on it no you will just remove one of the sheep you just remove one of the cow and then you use it for your watch for whatever you want to do so if you have livestock livestock farmers that people who are into portrait farming they don't have a lot of eggs so where you go they need a chop better eggs people who are into goat farming they chop good meats you understand i'm not saying they do it every single time but they do it whenever it is needful and that saves them a lot of money instead of spending the money buying outside they could easily just remove it you know when you are spending at a cost price it's better than spending it at a selling price do you get it now thank you number four is the byproduct the byproduct of livestock farming could also be a good business for you one for example if you are into sheep farming you could use a skin or the wool of the sheep for clothing so companies need the wool or the skin of a sheep for clothing and for the western world they have a type of sheep that they wear to give them enough wool not the african types those african types could be used but if you are into livestock farming and you want to really go into that aspect then you need to know the breed that you'll be going for so companies need wool so most of the skins of livestock or your sheep could be used as clothing uh-huh those clothing is in the big big and expensive they are made from animal wool you understand uh-huh so that is one way you can make money from the byproduct another thing is that in the 1920s they were using insulin people who were suffering from diabetes they were using animal insulin like from beef to hill diabetes and till date probably they still use it so if you are doing it and you're able to get in connection with the pharmaceutical companies and they have expressed interest in it you could be making a lot of money from that too and in africa here we use the skin of livestock from as mats so you still go to typical African traditional places they don't use the mats that we know they use the skin of livestock that is stand on it especially for the muslim they pray for and for other non-muslims they use it for clothing you still go to some place and then they use the horn of a cow to serve drink you still go to some places i hope you understand so the byproduct of livestock could be a big business and it could also give you a lot of money like the fats of your livestock could also be used for medication and so it's manure if you're into livestock farming the poo poo or your animal you understand could be a source of manure or a source of fertilizer for crop farmers and so for if you're at a place where it is highly in high is a high demand and then there is low supply you could use it as a business but if you're also into crop farming you don't need to go and buy fertilizer outside that your animals you know disposals could be a source of manure for you not everybody that go into livestock farming is going into it because of the business aspect some go into livestock farming to have them have a feeling of mercy they drive their pleasure from taking care of other creatures so some especially the rich people they usually keep it closer to their homes so that at the end of every morning they go check it out evening they go check it out and that is for them that is satisfying to them it's because they are they involve themselves in the feeding of the livestock they involve themselves in the treatment of the livestock it makes them have a sense of responsibility and a sense of mercy to a creation to them that is what is high interest to them and a lot of livestock farmers whether you are rich or you are poor you would definitely have this because if you have sheep and you don't take care of it you yourself how do you feel so a lot of livestock farmers when you go close to them they really have mercy for their livestock they really have mercy for their animals they can't sit down if their animals are not feeling well they can't sit down if their animals are hungry and that is the sense of satisfaction that some of the livestock farmers enjoy that they do not share with you it's companionship you see people think that it is when you call an animal your pets that is when their sense of companionship no a lot of livestock farmers are very attached to their livestock they are very attached to their animals to the level that some of the livestock farmers they will not agree to sell some of their sheep they will not agree to sell some of their cows they will not agree to sell some of their goods why because they have built a bond of attachments that if they even want to you know slaughter it to eat they can't if they want to sell it they can't so to some to some extent that some if they want to sell it they don't and you are and they sold it to you and you are coming to pick it from their house they don't want to be there they will leave home and tell you go home my wife or my family will take it and give it to you why because they don't want to see it going away most of the livestock farmers can relate to this and it's something that if you want to go into livestock farming today they wouldn't share with you but you yourself when you go into it you realize how beautiful that sense of companionship that livestock farmers enjoy having those sheep or cows and lots of people that you see them go into livestock farmers especially the rich people it's not actually they want to make money from livestock no they are doing it because they are smart business people you ask yourself what is the relationship between a businessman and a politician business people are always supporting politicians so that when politicians come into power they will they will support them and that is what they do the same way some rich people who go into livestock farming they actually don't go into livestock farming because they want to enjoy the benefits that we already talked about no they'll go into livestock farming because they are being smart you know there is this sdg sustainable development goals and it talks about how you protect the environment and things and if you're a business and you are doing something to protect the environment if you are doing something to protect nature if you are doing something to protect organisms and you take your proposal or you use you seek for an investment you stick for support they are more likely to support you do why because your business is not only in for profits but it is also protecting the environment so some of the big businesses that you see and then their own livestock farming it's not actually they they actually don't go there because of the profit do they are going there to help them in the future when they are applying or they need investment or they need any financial big support from this sdg developmental goals and international association they could get that is a very smart thing that some livestock farmers are doing that they would not share with you is that a lot of people go into livestock farming not because of the money not because of the byproduct not because of manure not because of anything but but they go into livestock farming to protect nature they go into livestock farming to protect the creation of almighty god of allah because they understand that if they protect and they are merciful and they show kindness to the creations then the creator will have mercy on them so some people go into livestock farming with an idea or a sense of spirituality and most people do not know this so rich people or spiritual people or people who have a sense of spirituality they don't just go into livestock because of the money they go into it with a different agenda some have big rooms they can just have them and then they'll be taking care of them and they don't sell if they need it for their personal purpose they can use them but at the end of the day they still have a sense of doing something to preserve nature doing something to protect nature doing something to protect the creations of their almighty god and another thing the muslims know is that if you are merciful to the creation then the creator will be merciful on you the prophet muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam taught us that a prostitute saved the life of a dog from test by giving it water and this this prostitute was a promised jannah again a man or a woman i don't actually remember she he or she denied a cut and stabbed it to death and such a person was uh uh and such a person was promised hellfire so a lot of people actually go into livestock farming not actually because of the money but they go into it because they want to get the reward of showing mercy you want to bear the reward of preserving the creation of almighty god number 10 is that some people go into livestock farming because they love that they just love it not because of anything and i've personally encountered this i had a brother who has given me a lot of money he has helped he has made me buy a lot of sheep and whenever i decide to talk about the business aspect of it he's not interested he just liked he just loved the sheep he wanted to come down and come and see that he has plenty sheep he has plenty rams you understand because he loved it because when he sees since child he told me since childhood when he sees sheep when he sees a ram he just likes it and he takes care of them he's happy around them and that is why some people go into lifestyle farming not because of the money not because of anything they just go into it because they love it so some people love cow so they will always want to have cows they don't sell that is cattle some people love goats they don't they always have them and they won't sell some people will have you know a poetry some people have this and they wouldn't sell because they are not wearing them for the money but they are wearing it because they love them and this you will see it mostly with rich people rich people you can go to rich people you're having a lot of peacocks or how do you guys call them and a lot of this a lot of that he would never sell why because to him he feels self-actualized and self-satisfaction when he comes in his yard and he looks and he sees them walking about like that so to them they are not doing it for the money but they are doing it because of the love that they have it and this is one of the benefits that livestock farmers enjoy in doing livestock farming that they would not share with you guys if you this video has been impactful and you have learned a lot kindly subscribe to my youtube channel the african farms and culture and kindly share this video thank you very much
