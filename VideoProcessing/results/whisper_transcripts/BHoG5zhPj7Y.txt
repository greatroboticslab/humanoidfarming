Agriculture is science. It's not just a case of farming. So the role of extension services is to make sure that the extension staff on the ground help or assist a farmer in planning.

So you have to make sure that you work hand in hand with your extension so that they provide you with the technical backup to achieve the maximum potential of your area which is 10 tons and above. You see. So their job is to make sure that they help you without paying them any money. They help you to manage your, the resources in order for you to achieve the maximum you can from a particular ecological...
