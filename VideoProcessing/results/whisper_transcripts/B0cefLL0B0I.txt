 Here's our new hay feeder for their sheep because they literally can destroy they can destroy a huge bale of hay like this like a round bale in like two weeks they'll just rip it apart trample it pee and poop on it eat a little tiny bit of it so now anyways I got this little feeder and we can feed them and it just comes from one of those totes that take the tote out of it use the aluminum frame we heard about it and here we go they're happily eaten away
