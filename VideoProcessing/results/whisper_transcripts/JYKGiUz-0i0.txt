 Hello my people welcome back to our channel this is TagroFarms of course it's been a long time we posted and some of you might be wondering what happened why have you not posted we are deeply sorry for the break in video uploads look behind you see that bananas are already floating the last time I showed you the fruiting stage of our banana in fact we showed you the first banana that actually began to fruit in this our farm and as I'm talking to you now there are so many bananas that are actually floating which this is one of them so I'm going to go around and I will show you the stage at which we are at the moment and I'm going to show you what we're going to do and show you the level some are already in bigger bunch some are already getting ready to be harvested I'm talking about the banana bunches some are just shooting at their paws all right today we are going to basically show you how to trim your banana leaves if you look around you see that banana leaves are already bushy they are clustered and we need to actually trim them to enable them shoot at very well we're in the middle of rainy season at the moment so we're going to clear we're going to prune or trim some of those leaves so that enable them to actually produce well since some of them are already producing fruits make their environment enabling enough for them to produce and the next time we're going to manure we're going to actually apply manure to the ones that are already producing fruits so that they have enough nutrients to actually shoot their pods okay guys this is about a month plus a month plus it's about a month and two weeks so it's not yet ready to be harvested it is not yet ready to be harvested so i'm going to show you other other banana plants that are already floating just like you we have here this one is already already shot out the pod so this can see the pod over there that's the pod that's the pod if you can see that closely as the pod so we also have other other ones that are already so let's there's one thing with banana look closely you will observe that this banana was actually cut short from here we're actually due to the heavy storm so we lost some of our we lost some of our banana planks to the wind so they were actually pulled down this was cut in half from this angle but because this banana plant was already shooting out the pod if you look closely you see that a new stem was actually coming out before the banana fell and see see what we have here during that time it was already carrying this pod shooting this pod and this that's the resilience of banana plants it doesn't matter how much what happened to it it must find a way to start producing to start shooting out so this is what we have here this is the original mother plant and it was cutting half but due to the resilience it has to continue producing and now it's actually fruiting you can imagine you can imagine it's magic so this is it i'm going to show you other ones that are already fruiting again we usually usually mark the date the date of which this banana started producing or shooting out the date is the date on this body this is 27th if you look around you will see the date on the body so what we have here is the 27th of may it actually started shooting off on the 27th of may so we have to mark it so this will help you determine the harvest the harvesting time to help you know when to harvest your banana when the time comes so of course you know your banana has to stay three months before harvest okay this is another pod can you see you can see another pod shooting out from this plant and if you look closely you'll see the date as well that's the 27th of may so this pod actually came out on the 27th of may and we have to mark it on the body so as to determine when to harvest you too this will help you determine your harvesting time so we're going to go to the next one so this is the next one so you can see the pod you can see and this is the old plant old banana fruit so guys if you look closely we'll see that our banana are basically small they're basically we have about they don't have about i think five bunches which is considered small the bunches are very very very small so we're looking forward to getting new variety so you can see we have more than 12 we have more than 12 bananas that are actually fruiting here today as a Saturday first of june so guys you see but we're going to change the variety so this is basically one of the biggest we have here so these bananas started sometime on 15th of may so so guys what we're going to do today basically is actually like i said earlier to trim off the excess leaves from our banana plants this is what you have to do routinely probably three weeks in three weeks time you trim or in one more time you trim off excess leaves from your plant so we're going to be doing that right away we need enough sunlight and enough air to flow into the farm to enable them produce very well so that's what we're going to be doing now let's follow up put our more dollars I have A very good example is this. So if you look closely up there you see that it has a new pod shooting out. So I'm going to trim some of those leaves to enable it to produce very well. So I have about 1 to 34 about 4 to 5 leaves left there. So this one is enough. So at this point you're not going to trim the banana anymore because it has enough leaf to carry it till the time of harvest. And as it is now it's not going to shoot any more leaf again. So you have to understand this the moment your banana starts to produce fruit no more shooting of leaves. That will be the end of the leaf. So the fruit is actually the last thing it's going to shoot out. So the moment you see the fruit coming out that will be the end of the leaves coming out from that banana plant. So this is basically what is going to happen here. So now it's, who should I enjoy the idea of? Can I show me what you're Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. always take excess shoots you see this very plant is carrying about three to four suckers these are the suckers so don't allow them to allow your banana individual banana plant to have more than one sucker that's the best way i practice don't allow them to have more than one sucker at most two per mother plant so we're going to remove but that's the that's what we're going to do next it won't be today again so the next time we're going to come to our farm we are going to remove excess suckers so what happens here is that when you have excess suckers in one mother plant what they do is to share the nutrients with the mother plant and it's not healthy or good for the mother plant because they need enough nutrients to do what to produce so so so so so this is our water plant this will serve as irrigation plant so during the dry season we're going to make use of the water here we're in the middle of the rainy season like i said earlier well it's almost filled up but we're not going to touch the water we're not going to make use of the water up until the dry season of this year so if you want to start a banana farm you must know that water is very essential water is very important in terms of taking care of your plants during the dry season because they need to take enough water so we're not going to water then we're not going to apply water during the running season because they have enough water it drains us at least 30 to 4 times in a week so they have enough water to actually help them produce so i think these are plants so we're going to show you during the time we're going to be making use of the irrigation we're going to show you how to actually make use of irrigation to grow your plant
