Howto & Style
 Here's something you need to know before starting your own seeds this spring. Seed starting mix and potting soil are two very different things. Seed starting mix is perfect for seedlings because it's made of light fluffy materials like coconut coir, perlite, vermiculite, and peat moss, which is great for maintaining even moisture and basic nutrients, but there's no actual soil in this mix, which is where potting soil comes in because it may have some of the same ingredients, but also a lot more fertilizer and more soil for long-term growth. But it is more dense and can't impede seedling emergence and root growth if it runs into things like bark or sticks that are in the potting mix, which is why you start with seeding mix and up pot to potting soil.
