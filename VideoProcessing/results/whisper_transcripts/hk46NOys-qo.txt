 Are you trying to grow grass in these shaded areas in your yard? Certain type of grasses that you can use in these particular areas, your Bermuda grass or any warm season grasses besides zoysia. Zoysia is a little bit more shade tolerant in the warm season grasses. Primarily you're gonna want to use rye grass, fescue. You're definitely going to want to aerate the yard before you seed especially if it's super hard and possibly even bring in some topsoil to get that seed or sod to root down just that much better.
