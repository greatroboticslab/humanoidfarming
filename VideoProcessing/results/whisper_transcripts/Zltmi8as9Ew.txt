 At Greening Plus Organic Farm, sustainable agriculture is our mission. We focus on creating organic fertilizer, an eco-friendly alternative to chemical fertilizers, to nurture our crops and protect our environment. Our journey begins with collecting organic waste like animal manure, crop residues, and kitchen waste. These materials are sorted, chopped, and moistened to kick-start the composting process. This preparation is crucial for healthy decomposition. We use aerobic composting, layering brown and green materials to balance carbon and nitrogen. Microorganisms break down the waste, heating the compost to eliminate pathogens. In some areas, we use vermicomposting with earthworms for nutrient-rich worm castings. Our organic fertilizer enriches the soil, improves water retention, and provides slow-release nutrients. It enhances microbial activity and reduces soil erosion, leading to healthier crops and higher yields. This practice also cuts waste and lowers methane emissions. At Greening Plus, we redefine agricultural prosperity by working with nature. Our organic fertilizer supports biodiversity and builds a greener future. Join us in growing green and feeding the future with sustainable farming practices.
