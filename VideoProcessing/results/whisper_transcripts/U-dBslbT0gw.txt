 Sustainable practices in farming. One of the essential sustainability practice is crop rotation. So what is crop rotation and why do we do it? Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area in sequential seasons. Now let us see some of the advantages of crop rotation. It improves soil fertility and increases organic matter. It prevents the growth of pests, weeds and also prevents plant diseases. And the most important, it replenishes the nutrients which are present in the soil and are required for the growth. Now let us see some of the principles of crop rotation. Crops with tap roots must be followed by crops with ripus roots which helps in proper and uniform use of nutrients from the soil. In addition, crops do not compete with each other for the uptake of nutrients. Non-legumes such as maize must be followed by legumes such as pea. This is because legumes fix atmospheric nitrogen into soil and add more organic matter to the soil. So let us see how crop rotation works. Now let us see how crop rotation works. The field is divided into parts called beds and different crops are grown there in the beds. Year after year crops are rotated which helps in continuous replenishment of nutrients in every bed and also complete use of nutrients in the soil. An example of it is shown here. If in the first year corn is cultivated in bed A, next year it will be cultivated in bed B. eBOs minimum A, next year most of the studykten a epsilon-zoon- current area Мы можем получить большى уникcal в 2m мл verdad.
