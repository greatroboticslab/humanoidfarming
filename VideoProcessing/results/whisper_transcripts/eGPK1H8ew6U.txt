Education
 My name is Alex Munyao. I am the CEO of Trilon Consultancy Services. TCS is a leading business consulting company in Kenya. I'm excited to share how my experience in the MMA or Masters of Management in Agribusiness program at Strathmore University has been instrumental in running my company. It has made the execution of some of my responsibilities more efficient and it has actually enhanced my capability to understand the agribusiness ecosystem and more importantly my customers or our customers. The MMA program at Strathmore University has been an invaluable asset in strengthening my skills and knowledge enabling me to offer the best possible solution to our clients. Courses such as decision analysis for risk management in agribusiness and quantitative analysis for agribusiness have equipped me with advanced analytical tools to assess risk and make data-driven decisions which is critical in not only this business but in any business. This has allowed TCS to develop comprehensive risk management strategies for our clients safeguarding their businesses from uncertainties and potential setbacks. Understanding the economic dynamic of agribusiness, which was a key focus in one of the courses I took called Economics of Agribusiness course, has given me the ability to provide accurate, insightful market analysis to our customers. This has enabled us to identify emerging trends, assessing market opportunities and guiding our clients in making informed strategic decisions for their businesses. Farming systems and research methods in agribusiness is another class I took and this has played a crucial role in enhancing our consultancy services. We can now provide our clients with tailored solutions that align with their specific farming systems, ensuring maximum efficiency and productivity. Moreover, the research-based approach which allowed us to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in the agribusiness sector gives us now a competitive edge in providing innovation and sustainable solutions. Strategic human resource management for agribusiness has also been very instrumental in strengthening our internal operations at TCS. We now have a well-structured and motivated team contributing to provided service delivery and client satisfaction. Understanding the importance of human values and ethical considerations has also fostered a culture of excellence and professionalism within our organization. Courses such as agricultural marketing, international and domestic marketing, cooperative development and management for agribusiness and project planning have significantly enhanced our capability to design robust business plans and supply chain optimization strategies for our customers. As a result of the MMA program, TCS has also developed a strong focus on agricultural entrepreneurship and new venture management. This has enabled us to guide and inspire entrepreneurs in the industry, offering them personalized management education with a special emphasis on human and ethical values. In conclusion, the master's program MMA at Strathmore University SPS has been an invaluable asset in enhancing my capabilities as the CEO of Trillium Consultancy Services. With the knowledge, skills and networks gained through this program, we are able to now provide comprehensive, innovative and sustainable solutions to our clients, driving their growth and success in ever-changing agribusiness landscape. As we move forward, I'm extremely excited to continue making a positive impact in the agribusiness sector and contributing to the growth of our clients and to the industry as a whole. As a result of the industry as a whole.
