 Did you know you could grow peanuts? They aren't nuts like almonds or walnuts that grow on a tree. They're actually seeds that grow underground, kind of like potatoes. Open up the peanut, plant the seed, and a plant grows above ground. It takes a few months, the plant will die back, and then you pull the peanuts up and harvest them.
