 Okay everyone this is our 360 video on how to operate a backhoe loader. So first thing, three points of contact anytime you're getting in or out of equipment. Now again this is a 360 video so you can move your phone around or if you're on a device move the screen around. Obviously I don't want to be staring at my face. Once you're in first things first, seatbelt. We're in a John Deere 310 SL but again I'm gonna go over it kind of basic just so any kind of backhoe should be pretty similar. John Deere over here the panel one click turns the battery on. These are keyless start on the John Deere. Making sure I've got no alerts nothing like that good to go. Hold that in. Parking brake is on on here sometimes other backhoe's you actually have a lever over there. So and then on the front here move that steering closer to you and it can move the seat. So on this I'm gonna go over kind of just baseline controls here. So my right joystick is my boom and bucket control is very similar to a skid steer or a wheel loader. If I pull back on this right now it's gonna raise that boom up. And then if I go to the right it's gonna dump the bucket open it up. If I go left it'll close the bucket. These are kind of standard controls that you'd see on most wheel loader skids things like that and then right hand forward will bring that boom back down. Driving position is gonna be you know a foot or so above the ground right about there. And then for driving on this one so you've got two they're throttled there. The brakes on these are these are actually hooked together. They can have independent brakes so I've never operated really that way but if you're ever trying to pull like snow plowing or some other time where you just want to activate one brake to help turn the machine that you can use that. Shifter on these again you'll see different types of transmissions on different loaders but this one's got the shifter right on the side forward neutral reverse and it's got these are the speed settings on there so usually I'm at two of them just working around the site and then the right sizes lights wipers things like that. So foot on the brake parking brake off good to go we're just gonna go over the front initially and then we'll go over the rear. So let's put it in gear here again as I come down you'll see the top corners of my bucket that matches my blade angles. You want to kind of have that flat and then just bring it down to touch the ground and then you're just driving in. So on any time you're driving in you go into you almost feel like you get stuck and then to get a really full bucket you're kind of pulling up and in up and in. As you pull up you're putting downward pressure on that front axle so that'll give you a more traction. There we go and then bringing it down. This one's got a mechanical so it'll kind of keep you from like right there I can't curl it anymore because I have to go lower to do that. So it's a little bit of a challenge with these. Now the only thing I'll say is this don't ever I'm going to raise this up we're just going to dump it right here. On these if I there's a button on the side of this if I hold that it puts me in neutral and I can throttle it up to go up higher. Now the biggest thing with loaders they're very top heavy so with this configuration I do not want to be backing up I don't want to be doing a lot of steering. Machines are extremely top heavy so you generally just want to be slow and steady only should be above the cab when you're inching forward to dump whether it's in a dump truck or in a pile. So and sometimes you'll shake that out a little bit curl back up reverse. Got mirrors on the sides also good to look over your shoulders bring it down driving position. Okay that's the front of it we're going to drive over here get out to area we can trench. Now again you can shift on the fly in these if I just rotate that you'll see on my display it'll say 3F over there. There's also on the John Deere's a ride control this little button over here number 7. I click that it'll actually adjust my boom arm so I it it offsets that bounce a little bit so it's always nice to have on. And then trenching I'm just going to get straight here put it neutral you always want to set that bucket flat on the ground just so it's a little bit of downward pressure but not necessarily lifting the front wheels because I'm actually going to jack up the back we'll put a little bit more pressure. After that I'm in neutral I like to put the parking brake on again some people will do it in neutral so they can move themselves around really the personal preference on that but you see the parking brakes on flip this out the steering wheel and then you can underneath here there's a way to swing the back and it'll lock in place. Now I'm on the back the excavator the backhoe portion of the loader so for this John Deere a couple of things first my throttle it's a manual throttle here so I'm going to ramp that up there are two my outriggers on both sides right and left you have to have those down you never want to be digging without those down so I push both of them wait till kind of get close to the ground I usually get closer to one at a time and then you're just pushing a little bit of pressure you don't you know I want the wheels barely off the ground if not even touching a little bit obviously the higher you go raises your center of gravity so it's a little bit less stable there. After that this has got pilot controls which is great they're joystick operated where it's kind of electric controls meaning I can change the configuration but you pull these back and then yeah I'm set right there now the John Deere has an unlock right here once I click that I'll actually see a symbol over there but with these pilot controls they're easier to change configuration so I'm going to show ISO or cat controls you'll see there's a button here I can easily change between backhoe controls or the ISO ISO is the more standard one for me older backhoes are going to have two these two joysticks are going to be in front here and generally it's this backhoe control pattern which is not something I would be good at operating but most people figure it out now the the arm's always going to be locked so you'll see there's a lock in front and each machine's a little bit different how they do it but this is the unlock of it so what you got to do though is get to take the pressure off so I'm pulling back to my right and raising that up and you see how it unlocks there so now my boom arm is free sometimes you'll actually have a swing lock you can see a little hole so this would be the swing lock I've seen cat machines actually have this stored outside if they're transporting you might have a swing lock in there which means you won't be able to go left or right on it so you want to check that as well now with my let's start left joystick uh if I go forward with it extend stick out I'll swing a little bit left so you can see a little bit better the arm so push forward out bring back brings the stick back in and then like I showed you swings left it'll go all the way over and then I can swing it right we'll go all the way to right there's 180 degrees one way or the other let's bring it back to center and then my right joystick if I pull back raises the boom up push forward brings the boom down and then right hand to the right and right hand to the left closes the bucket same thing as a standard excavator controls there uh the final piece let me get this situated this is an extend a hoe which means that stick actually length will get longer so this foot pedal down here see right here if I push forward on it you'll see it'll extend out if I push on the back of it it brings it back in I really like to keep it extended out when I'm digging you're not going to see much it will reach a little bit further out I really think it's more retracting it just for transporting it makes the arm easier to you can't transport with extended so but it's really up to you I don't recommend trying to trench and use that pedal at the same time but then generally if you're digging a trench usually you're going to be in line with your machine just because I'm going to be able to push the machine or drive the machine forward you know it's obviously a little bit tougher to see so depending on what configuration you really can dig at any different angle here and then for trenching I'm not going to get into a lot of detail here but generally you're trying to take off six to twelve inches at a time so I'm kind of scraping that up and curling the bucket now we have a 101 video on our channel that'll give you a little bit more information but generally doing that scraping in and then your spoil pile needs to be not two to three feet over not too close but also not too far and dumping that out and again same thing bringing that up if you want to manage your height at all the best way is looking at the knowing how wide your or I'm sorry how deep your bucket is so if I know I need to go with three foot trench I know three feet on this bucket is from the edge of the teeth all the way down to the bottom of the top of the bucket so let's do a couple of these so I have some to kind of backfill so and then if I really wanted to push myself forward so let's say I got this trench all the way the neat thing you can kind of do on these all you do is put a little bit downward pressure there I pull my jacks back just so I'm odd I don't retract them just so I'm on my tires and this is where I'm leaning forward pulling back on my boom or just to raise it up taking out of park so I can roll make sure your wheels are forward and then all I'm doing is this pushing myself forward like that and basically rolling the machine once you're set make sure this is out so yeah and you're gonna set that back down front down parking brake on and then you're gonna put those jacks back and that's how you can kind of trench in a really long line with these things okay so now uh storing this thing you have to make sure you're always retracted with that extender oh you will not you see what has so if I curl this in even if I try and put it all the way in you'll see it's just too close to the ground there it'll drag on the ground so you always want to make sure you do that first pull that in curl that bucket retract the stick all the way it should be tucked in all the way as unless you have a quick attach like makes you where you might have uh hit the boom but generally they're designed to not hit it you want to be straight you don't want to be driving with this thing left or right because if you do you're moving your center of gravity one way or the other and then the final piece I actually have to go down here again this is that boom lock you always have to make sure you have that so if I bring that up drop it in and I'm making sure I push a little downward pressure make sure it's locked boom arm's good and then I'm just retracting slowly to bring myself down bringing both those up okay and then these just go forward like that there's a lock there spin this back around okay once I'm around back in driving position pick that up parking brake and I will just come around here real quick show you one these things are not good at back filling but if this is the tool you have you can use the excavator uh the arm those aren't exactly great either but uh line up with your nose facing where you're trying to push that material and then buck it flat scrape along the ground and then again I can give it some throttle here to make it in a little bit quicker so if you fill that in the final thing you can do floating the blade on this always checking your mirrors make sure you know where you're going you want to be careful anytime you're straddling this trench obviously you don't want your tire to go in that soft spot but once I kind of straddle this trench you can float the blade so once I do this I set this flat on actually I'm going to do it so I can see underneath kind of like a dozer blade so I can see right there underneath on both sides and I take this joystick I just jam it forward and I'm floating the blade the bucket there so to kind of float up and fill that in the rest of the way at the end of that then just want to pop it out a little bit let that trail off and I would probably do a couple more passes there to smooth that out you can also go flat over it to do that so anyway so that's the basic operating controls of a backhoe loader I hope you guys enjoyed this 360 video please comment below and we'll see on the next video
