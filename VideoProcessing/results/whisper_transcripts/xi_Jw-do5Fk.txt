Thank you. Some wood products like planks don't require much craftsmanship since it only has a straight and smooth surface. On the other hand, things like wooden window frames where patterns and designs are present need very precise yet talented hands. But woodworking isn't only composed of that part. It also includes the usage of dowels or the small wooden pins or pieces that are stuck into two different pieces of wood. Further processing is done by joining them together so that structural reinforcement is offered. In order to accomplish this step, an immense amount of precision and consistency is needed. Good thing we have the Lietz Plug-Tech Window Corner Joint. This allows many different profiles and widths for maximum customization while providing high quality stability and fitting. Not to mention that the joints are also capable of supporting up to 180 kilograms of sash weights. So amazing! Aside from wooden window frames, wooden floors are also very popular in architecture and house constructions. In fact, a lot of homes all around the globe have wooden floors. However, through time, they have observed that pure wood tends to wear out faster than any other material. So, they decided to add other components that would make wooden floors sturdier. This is where veneered MDF flooring became popular. Speaking of which, Woodlent is known to be mass producers of veneered MDF flooring. They make use of the combination of wood and medium-density fiberboard.

Did you know that some screws are made out of wood? This is what BRUSA is famous for. The BRUSA wooden screw machine processes wood in a unique way by precisely shaping and carving the threads and patterns until it becomes a wooden screw. This means that this machine was designed to excellently provide even the most complex and intricate designs on small pieces of wood. But this isn't a shocker, since BRUSA is really known for machines as amazing as this. Lastly, let's go over one of the processes wood goes through, which is jointing. It's done through preparing the edges of various boards so that it is ready for gluing. Originally, this was done manually with the help of some tools, but as the demands for it grew and grew, experts also slowly developed more efficient methods and machines to help with jointing. A clear example of this is System TM's Opti-Joint machine, which was designed for high precision and steady jointing. It also follows a mechanism that enables the machine to work with any type and size of wood. It's also very helpful for tasks where speed is needed since it transports work pieces quickly along its length. This is made possible by the computer integrated systems within the machine.
