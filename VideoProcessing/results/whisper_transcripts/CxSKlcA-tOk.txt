 In this video, I want to go over five tips for growing in deep water culture hydroponics. So for those who have been tuning into this channel for a while, know that I've been growing cannabis for about 14 years now. And that entire time I've been growing in soil and cocoa. This is actually my first run ever growing in deep water culture hydroponics. And it is so much fun. I am learning so much. This series is definitely a lot different than other grow series that have been on this channel. This is a lot of different things that I've been doing when growing in soil or cocoa. Here I'm actually doing the grow, but I'm also getting feedback from you guys in the comments. We've released three other update videos on this plant here. It went from being something that I thought was going to die out to what it looks like today. Very vigorous growth on it. And I just been having so much fun with it. I appreciate you all for tuning in and giving me that feedback in the comment section. So yeah, completely different series. And yeah, I figured I'd go over five tips today that things that I've learned just over the past several weeks here. And hopefully you guys will have some takeaways from it. So one thing to mention before we get into the tips is you may have noticed that I moved it from a 4x8 grow tent to this 2x4 grow tent. Actually started in this 2x4 grow tent. Then went to the 4x8 then back to the 2x4. The reason for that is because I have other plants in the 4x8. They're in the veg stage and that's on a veg light cycle. This one I'm prepping to flip to flower here within the next couple of days or so. So it'll be on a 12-12 light cycle. I've got it under the T22 LED grow light by AC Infinity. I've got one here and actually have some veggies down here. A little sneak peek at some other stuff that I grow here. I've got some kale and bok choy, spinach and lettuce. I'll have updates on that in other videos. But yeah, making the change over here has been huge as far as the temperature. So in the other room there, it seems to get a little bit more warmer. And as we are in the fall going into wintertime, the heat comes on in the house. And so in that room actually heats up a lot more than this room. That room in that 4x8 grow tent temperature in the environment was in the high 70s. 78, 79, sometimes touching 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Which led to issues with the water temperature. Here in my 2x4 grow tent, which is in a different room. This room kind of stays cold, which is a benefit here. Temperatures now have been about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. So a lot lower. This has made it so much easier to control the water temperature. And that kind of relates to the first tip that I have for this video. Which is to help control that water temperature. Some of you guys mentioned in the comments section to wrap the bucket and insulation. So like a foil bubble type insulation, wrapping it. They had mentioned that the black bucket helps actually heat up the bucket. So wrapping it in foil. And then when I use the frozen water bottle technique to help lower the water temperature, which is something I've been doing. It actually helps maintain that cooler temperature within that bucket. So I thought that was a great tip. I think I mentioned that here for those folks that are maybe new to DWC and didn't know about that and might be in the same shoes as me as far as struggling with the water temperature. Tip number two kind of relates to it as well. The water temperature is having the air pump outside of the grow space. Now, if it was inside the grow space, it would be bringing air of that temperature, right? Outside of the grow space typically should be a lot cooler. And so it's bringing cold air into through the air stones into the water to oxygenate the water. So I actually have had my air pump outside of the grow tent the entire time. It's something I just haven't showed. But I thought it was a really good tip. Right now, I have it parked next to my four Lamborghinis. So you can take a look at that here. But yeah, that was another tip that I thought was really, really great to hear. Because I didn't even think about that. I just had it outside of my grow tent because I didn't have any space inside of my grow tent. Really somewhere good to put it inside my grow tent. So I've always had it outside my grow tent. Just didn't connect the dots there of bringing in cooler air versus warmer. Another tip that has to relate to the water temperature is using the frozen water bottles, but adding salt to that water. Having salt in that frozen water bottle can either speed up or slow down the melting. And in this situation that I have, it is actually slowing down the melting. So if you freeze salt water in a 16 ounce bottle and place it in a bucket of water at about 80 degrees Fahrenheit, which is what these buckets have been, it's going to melt slightly lower compared to regular frozen water. Salt water freezes at a lower temperature than pure water. So when it's exposed to an environment like 80 degrees Fahrenheit in the bucket, the frozen salt water starts melting, but some salt is retained in the melted portion, which slows heat transfer because of the higher concentration of dissolved salts. Also the salt water doesn't conduct heat as efficiency as pure water, which can slightly slow the rate of melting. So that was another tip that was mentioned by you guys in the comment section. Again, I love so much that you guys are leaving feedback for me because a lot of these things I weren't, I wasn't even aware of and I have a feeling a lot of you that are tuning in that may be new to this aren't aware of it as well. So I haven't been doing the salt water, frozen water bottles, but I will be in the future sure. Once I start to need to use it again, because like I mentioned now I'm in 70 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature in here. The water temperature has been maintained about that. So no need at the moment to use those frozen water bottle pack. Tip number four is going to be about hydrogen peroxide H2O2. So this is something I mentioned in my last video. I had to seek some questions in regards to using H2O2. I knew that it was sterilizing agent. A lot of people use it to prevent fungal root pathogens. So if I struggle with higher water temps and are at risk for fungal root pathogens, using H2O2 hydrogen peroxide can help sterilize, kill off those harmful pathogens. Now, one of the questions I had for the folks in the audience, I wasn't really aware of this, because I don't really have deep knowledge in chemistry, is is this H2O2 having any reactions with some of the other nutrients in the reservoir? We'll come to find out that yes, it does have, it does interfere with some of the other nutrients that are in the reservoir. So something just need to be real cautious about. Iron. H2O2 may oxidize iron, converting it to forms that are less bioavailable. Also, manganese and zinc may also react with H2O2 under certain conditions. Beneficial microbes can also be killed off if H2O2 is introduced to it. Now, I'm not running any beneficials in there, although some people run hydroponics, they do put beneficials in there. If you've got beneficial bacteria in there, fungi, whatever, and you're adding in H2O2, you could be killing off that population. Also, some organic nutrients like kelp and humic acid, that can actually have an impact there as well. Now, I don't run, I don't really know anybody who runs like a kelp or humic acid in DWC, but in organic systems as well. I know some people do hydrogen peroxide in soil to help sterilize the soil. It could have a negative impact if you have like humic acid or kelp extract in there. So, forget to mention that one. Okay. So before I get to the last tip, I do want to change out the reservoir. That is something that needs to get done today. It's done on a weekly basis. At least that's what I do on a weekly basis. I'll clean out the res and then I'll add new nutrient solution for the week. So I'm going to get everything set up and then we'll drain the res and fill it back up. So everything's set up here that I need. I've got a shop vac, so I'll be able to suck the water out of the res. I'll be able to transfer from this to a bucket and then I dispose of this water. And so, yeah, I'm just going to get into it. One of the things I like to use is this to kind of push the roots to the side. So basically come in here, push the roots to the side, and then we're going to vacuum it up real quick. Low capacity on this. It doesn't really hold that much. So I'm going to empty this out and then I'll get the rest of it. I forgot to take out the air stone, so I'm going to take that out too. Okay, now that I've cleaned up that little bit of mess, I am going to fill up the reservoir with some reverse osmosis water. I have a reverse osmosis system in the other room. I know in the past videos some people have seen that these are... They thought I was purchasing water bottles and... Nope, that's not the case. I've just been refilling out of the reverse osmosis system underneath my sink in my kitchen. Three and a half gallons goes in here. Then we'll add in some nutrients. Measuring out a half gallon here. Okay, since I have three and a half gallons of water now filled up in there, I'm going to refer to the Blue Planet Nutrients feeding chart. That's what I'm using this time around. Blue Planet Nutrients, Blue Max, two part, and CalMag. But the CalMag I know is five milliliters per gallon. So three and a half gallons is going to be 17 and a half milliliters. I'll put that in first. And then according to the feeding chart here, the Blue Max part A and part B, in pre-flour, it's 7.5 milliliters per gallon. And then 10 milliliters per gallon for part B. And at this point I can add back in the air stone and turn it back on. In between nutrients, washing it out is important to prevent cross-contamination. I've talked about this in videos before, but I figured I'd still mention in this video in case there's folks out there haven't tuned into past videos. So with the CalMag done, now we're going to the part A. 26 to 5 milliliters of part A will go in here since I have three and a half gallons of water. And then lastly is the part B. We're doing 35 milliliters. That'll go into that 3.5 gallons of water. So I'm going to put in my pH meter. Although the air stone is actually adding in some, rotating the water around a little bit, I still like to do give it a little mixture in here. Now I am going to put in my pH meter, check the pH and water temperature. Okay, so this reading is showing 5.8 pH at a 69 degree Fahrenheit water temperature. So perfect, exactly where I like it to be. That's one thing I've noticed about Blue Planet Nutrients is every time I do a mixture it's really at 5.8 pH, which is what I like it to be in hydroponics here. So really hoppy on that one. Let's get a ppm measurement. It's showing 871 ppm on a, this is a 500 scale TDS tester. And I'll put the EC in the bottom corner of the screen right now, because I don't have that memorized what the EC is on this one. I know some of you guys go after EC instead of ppm, but we're looking pretty good there. So really happy with how that is. We'll put the top back on and that's how I do a res change. Okay. The last tip, tip number five is another tip I got in the comment section. Love you guys in the comment section for giving me the feedback. Washing the clay pebbles is important because the residual dust can actually increase the pH. New clay pebbles often have a thin layer of alkaline dust from the manufacturing process. When placed in water, this dust can dissolve and raise the pH. So pretty straightforward there. That's something I didn't know. I mentioned in the past video that I didn't wash the clay pebbles prior to putting them in there. I didn't really see any of that dust on the settle at the bottom of the reservoir, anything like that. And I didn't really notice a pH difference, but I wasn't really checking. You know, I wasn't really looking and seeing if the clay pebbles not being washed was raising the pH or not. I thought that was a really cool tip. So I figured I'd include that one as well. That's it for the five tips. I want to thank you all for joining me on this. This is brand new to me. Really happy that you guys are coming along with me and giving me feedback along the way. Also want to thank the moderators for keeping the comment section clean, canceling all the trolls that are in there. I don't even see troll comments anymore because moderators do a great job. They're keeping this community a friendly community. That's pretty much all I have for this video guys. Thank you so much for tuning in. I'll catch you in the next one. Peace out.
