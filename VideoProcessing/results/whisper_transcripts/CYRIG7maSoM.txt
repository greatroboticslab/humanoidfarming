 Do your homework, do your due diligence, keep an open mind. You're going to choose aspen. No, we don't do a lot of used equipment trading simply because our farmers are farming 12 months out of the year. And we're putting on anywhere from 1200, 1400, 1500 hours per year on a tractor. Farmers use them up rather quickly. And so they probably won't even get to eight years. And the tractor is wore out at scrap value. And everybody knows at that point in time it goes to Mexico, it goes to the scrapyard, it goes to a broker. So it really hasn't been an issue for us. And because we put so many hours on, you know, so quickly, they don't want to buy used tractors. They want to buy brand new ones. And then we go through that whole system. In addition, there's always a need for additional power, additional tractor usage on a farm over and above what they purchase. And so we've developed a fairly large rental program. And we usually rent on a monthly basis, you know, one month, two months, three months. And so we have a rental inventory. Well, in a way we generate our own used equipment. So, and everything is for sale in that, in the rental fleet. So if a customer, you know, if we, and we have a number of customers say, well, I'd like to buy one of those at the end of harvest or at the end of July when I'm going to need it. And so a lot of our rental inventory is always being turned and sold to some of those buyers who are not necessarily new buyers. So it's worked out well for us.
