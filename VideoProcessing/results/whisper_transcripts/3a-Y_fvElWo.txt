 Irrigation took me a while to get good at. I made a lot of mistakes along the way, so here's what I learned by failing. Don't use overhead sprinklers. They spray the water out of reach of some plants and a lot of it will evaporate on the surface. Drip irrigation from nozzles is ideal for conserving water. They can be set to specific gallon per hour settings. They deliver moisture directly to plants roots with minimal waste. But setting them up can be expensive and time consuming. I prefer soaker hoses or drip lines which provide slow deep watering, preventing runoff, and keeping soil evenly moist. Apply mulch around your plants to reduce evaporation and keep moisture in the soil. Run your irrigation on a timer. Water early in the morning to minimize evaporation and allow plants to absorb moisture before they get heat stress. I use a smart timer with an app. It tracks the weather so it doesn't water when it rains. Overwatering can lead to root rot, which deprives roots of oxygen, promotes fungal growth, and ultimately weakens or kills the plant. Water is the lifeblood of your garden, but it doesn't need to bleed you dry. So let's give us alinComm там we have to get more absorbed should be也可以. Yes you do!
