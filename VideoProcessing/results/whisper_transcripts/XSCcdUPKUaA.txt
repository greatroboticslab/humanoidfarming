 How to invest in farmland with an IRA. Your IRA can buy farmland in an IRA. A couple things to consider. Number one, you could not buy it from a family member. Can't use it personally. The investment must 100% benefit your IRA. Once you figure that out, the easy part is now, how do you want to buy it? Do you want to use the IRA directly or do you want to use the IRA and an LLC to get chicken control? Otherwise, it's easy and all the gains from the IRA farmland investment would go tax free back to the IRA.
