 Queen bear. Whoa that's a hundred bees. Now what can we see there? There's so much honey. Now see this on the edge here, that's the honey there. Look, watch. Oh yum. Welcome to the Oliver and Lucas Kids YouTube channel. Today we're going to the May Exala Honey Tour and we're going to eat some honey. This is Nathan and he'll be our May Exala Tour Guide today. Here's an interesting fact for you. Did you know that May Exala means respect in the indigenous language? And so Nathan is going to teach us about the bees so that we can have respect for the most important insect in the world. Bees get two things from flowers. The first is nectar. They use nectar to make honey, okay? The second thing they get from flowers is called pollen. It's really, really important that bees go from one flower to another and sprinkle little bits of pollen on every flower. And as they're sprinkling, that makes all the fruits and the vegetables grow. Here's some fun facts we learnt about bees. Did you know that bees have five eyes and six legs? Honey bees live in large groups called colonies. In the colonies there is a queen bee, a worker bee and a drone. The queen bee! Yes, well done! That is the queen bee. Now there's one queen inside every hive. Just one. The queen rules all the bees in the hive. Her job is to lay eggs. She can lay over 2,500 eggs a day! It's a little heavy. The queen will be like me in a minute. Tada! The baby brother will forget to eat. Well done! The one basic thing will be like the beginning is! So worthy of eggs is the firstnet own body being Easter as a sister. It's a house that is in a village. If you really do have animals, it's a castle or whatever you need to known. So the salmon may live. Yes, I have to know... on the side of theabile side one. Someone has a castle. That is interesting . This BA relent of the bed is a castle. Thank you. Yes, the area is waiting for a nation. You can also nearby as a soldier would be to get put on the test of a scientific feature... I'm boiling. It will be warm. I had a beehive 35 degrees. Really hot. Really hot. They love it warm. Me too. I always stand behind or beside a beehive, not right in front of it. The bees coming out. Bees. Can you see all the bees? I'm going to catch it. A few bees coming in and out. Should we open the lid? What do you reckon? Yeah. I got the smoker. This smoker helps the bees stay calm. They're going back. They're going back in. What's that, the bee? Queen bee. Whoa, that's a hundred bees. Now, what can we see there? There's so much honey. Now see this on the edge here. That's the honey there. Look, watch. Oh, yum. Can I eat some? No, you can't eat some now. You can later. We'll get some out of another hive and you can have some. I'm going in. Now, so they're all worker bees. I can't see the queen. Worker bees are females and male bees are called drones. Did you know that honey is healthy and good for you to eat? It is packed with lots of amazing ingredients that is healthy for your body and brain. I just spotted something. What's that one there? Boy. What's that one? Queen. It's a queen. So, uh, over there. The one that's walking right there. Yeah, I can see it right there. See the queen, everyone? Yeah, I can. I see another queen there. I saw another one. It's going in there. So, we'll put this one back in because that's got the queen on it. So, we don't want to... Oh, is that the only queen? There will only be one queen. Oh, I love the spider! Where did you see a spider? Over there! Oh, there is one little spider there. There you go, Maya. Be very gentle. Did you know that bees are the most important insect in the world? That's because they help plants grow that keep us alive. And so, we need bees to grow the food we eat. A beehive can hold around 50,000 bees. I saw something. Do you see that thing? Is it a queen? Yeah, it is. I see some queen. Or is it a worker bee? It's a queen. Oh, that's crazy! That's crazy. Is it doing a dance? That's crazy. Sometimes bees do dances, you know. It's a wiggle jiggle. It's called a waggle dance. Mm-hmm. Alright, let's come over. Let's do this. Can you see an ant? There is. Why are the ants there? They want to have some of the honey, I think. It's a little bit more. It's a little bit more and better. It's a little bit more. I can see it. Look, I can see boys. Can you see the drones? Who wants to see the boys? Can you see these boys here? Yeah. The boys here, see? That's a lot of power. Look! There's honey there, look! There's a boy here, see? Look, there's honey there, look! That looks so yummy, I want to eat it straight away. Should we try and get some honey out of the home? Yeah! Not this one, no. Not the roof. We'll get a frame out. Do you know that honey can last forever? If you put honey in an airtight container, it will never spoil or get old. Look at them all. Can you see their tongues? Using their tongue to lick the honey. Did you know that honey can be used as medicine? You can put honey on your cuts and burns. Honey is also good to help when you have a sore throat or cough. Did you know you could live eating just honey? That is because honey is the only food which has all the ingredients needed to keep you alive. I can see a plane. Can you see the plane? That's a plane in the middle. If you don't know what it is. It looks so good, I want to eat it. You can add a little bit of honey to your food to make it sweet. It will give you lots of energy. But make sure you don't have too much as it won't be good for you. Look at this. You ready? Look at this. Honey. Oh. You ready? Yeah. Yeah. Mmhmm. Yeah. It's all thick honey. But they're eating the honey. What are they doing? Well they'll fix it up and they'll start eating it again. They're licking. All of them eating. That's right. This is the bees working hard to repair the honey cone. Make sure none of the bees get squashed again. No, no. It's very hard. So the smoker actually makes the bees eat honey and relax. And it keeps them nice and calm while we're working with the bees. Squeeze. And again. All of the bees are going. Yeah, that's right. They go down and then we can take some honey. Look at this. So they're building, they're still making it. That's right. See that? Can you see the nectar in there? Yeah. Yeah. Because there's not enough honey in there for us to take this one. The one that's hurting. Yeah. That one. That one. That's the one? Yeah, get it. That's the one. Right. Now I'm going to shake these bees off. Are you ready to stay very still and calm? Yeah. Oh, this juicy, nice honey. Delicious. That one. Oh, this is delicious. Ooh, this is beautiful. How satisfying. This is my turn. Mmm. Mmm. That's pretty chewy. Mmm. It's honey good. How satisfying.
