The Benefits of Vertical Farming

 Music Good morning. A lot of folks end up emailing us or talking to us and asking about our vertical production system. Why do you grow vertically as opposed to just growing the old fashioned way in the ground or in beds? And the reality of that, the answer to that question is we can get a lot more out of our space when we grow vertically. So we grow up here on the high plains of Wyoming where it's bitter cold in the winter. We have a couple of weeks where it will be 20, 30 below, sometimes more. And our heating costs are very high. So for us, you know, just the labor involved and the costs involved with heating a greenhouse and maintaining it means that we want to get the most out of our space. So by growing vertically like this, that's essentially one means for us to do that. So when we grow, essentially what happens is we have our towers planted like this one here. And you can see this is, these are seedlings that got planted yesterday. And these will go into the system and they'll get irrigated here. And as they grow, as they kind of grow out from the face of this tower, this is like a good week two kind of sized seedling here. And as they grow here, we just kind of keep harvesting from the back row and just scooting the towers back as we go. So what that ends up doing for us is it ends up essentially managing the light that we have. Because in the winter, our light is to the south. And for all of us here in North America, that's true. During the winter, your light is going to be kind of a southerly sun. So because we have this low sun angle in the winter, it's literally, you know, the sun kind of comes up and does this number and then goes back down. That low sun angle will impact these seedlings. They'll get full sun. So they're facing the sun almost directly here. And there's no interference in the front. So as we move our older and more mature plants to the rear, we have less and less interference at the back of the mass. And that ends up allowing us to grow a lot more per square foot. Let's us just basically suck every last photon out of our light. So that's, for us, that's one of the benefits of growing vertically. Another one is that we can move really easily in between our towers here. And we can, you know, take care of business. And that's not always something you can do with kind of a traditional NFT or a bedside. system. So we can get back in here and we can, you know, check on bugs. We can spray our plants. We can do whatever we have to do. And it, you know, it's easy to access. It's easy to harvest. Just simplifies our life. So it's labor reducing. It increases our productivity and it lowers our costs. Fundamentally, that's why we grow vertically. We get a lot of questions about how we hang our towers. It seems that people are a little unclear on, you know, how they're supposed to do it, the exact way to do it. They want to know what the easiest way is. So I'll tell you. We, uh, we, uh… Yeah. We, uh… We… We… We… We… We… We… We…
