 New this morning, Alabama has seen 67 confirmed tornado tornadoes so far in 2025 alone, causing severe damage to several communities. And this morning, federal aid is available to three communities in Madison County, but time is running out to apply for it. News 19's Carolyn Kimball joins us live this morning. Carolyn, you spoke with the Department of Agriculture about this aid. Who can qualify? Well, Carmen, Ellie, like you said, several communities saw damage from this spring's storms. But the USDA and the Farm Service Agency announced that farms in Killingsworth Cove, Moontown and Gurley are eligible for federal aid. But to receive aid from the FSA Emergency Conservation Program, or the ECP, farmers and producers must have at least $1,000 worth of storm damage. A representative with USDA tells me that the damage must be bad enough that it impairs their ability to farm or pose a threat to natural resources. If approved for ECP aid, farmers can receive up to 75 percent of the cost of repairs in aid. The maximum is $500,000. But USDA says based on the applications they've received so far, impacted communities in Madison County have only requested around $40,000 in total. A USDA spokesperson said, agriculture is a risky business, and storm damage can be financially devastating. But ECP can help them prepare for and recover from the impact of natural disasters and market volatility. The deadline to apply is July 16th, which is coming up in about two weeks. For more information, call or visit the USDA Service Center of Madison County. It's located at 1300 Meridian Street in Huntsville. For now reporting live this morning, Carolyn Kimball, News 19. Thank you, Carolyn. Happening today, new.
