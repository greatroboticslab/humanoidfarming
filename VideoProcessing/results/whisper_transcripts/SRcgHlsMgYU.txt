If you're using your cellular phone. You could double tap the screen. And hit the like button. Support the channel. Alright. Appreciate each and every one of you. So yes guys. I'm going to show you. How I multiply my potatoes. I'm going to show you how I multiply my potatoes. Now, if you notice. These are potatoes. You see growing right over here. Also have some potatoes up the ground as well. And what I'm doing today. If you notice. You're going to see me start planting potatoes. I'm now having some potatoes from here. So since I have some potatoes. And I have the space. Why not? Okay. So I'm planting sweet potatoes. You see. This is how I plant my sweet potatoes guys. Some people do it like this. But I put it downwards like that. And then I cover. See. It has the roots. If you notice. It has the roots. So what I'm doing. I put them downwards. In a running area already. And I cover the roots then. This one again. You're going to see this one again. This one have a root there. It have root there. It have root there. It have root there. So what I do. I put them downwards like this. And I just cover the area where the roots are. Because where the roots are. This is where the potato going to be. Producing from. So this one. Okay. This is the next piece. So I'm just going to put them in the ground. This is the right time guys. Cover them. Their roots. And just leave them. Alright. Now. The soil is wet. And the rain is coming. So we know. That. We're still in spring. But we're still in spring. It ain't really summer as yet. But I'm going to show you. The same thing I did here. This is exactly what I did here. And this is. The potato them. Running here. Alright. So they're growing pretty well. So how I multiply my potato. I come and I sort. You see this. You see this one here. This one has roots. So what I can do. I can cut this. And dig up this whole area here. Which I have. A few more potatoes to harvest. And plant them here. So all you can do. This is why I love growing sweet potato. Because you could grow. You could grow a lot of potato from. Just one patch of potato. Like for instance. This whole area here. I could just keep cutting. And cut it. So what I can do. I can cut this. And dig up this whole area here. Which I have. A few more potatoes to harvest. And plant them here. So all you can do. This is why I love growing sweet potato. Because you could grow. You could grow. A lot of potato from. Just one patch of potato. Here. I could just keep. Cutting. Cutting. Multiplying. Planting. Which is what I am definitely. Going to be doing. I am going to be. Using this. Cut these vines. Anywhere you see root. You cut them. And you. Put them in the soil. And they are going to grow. But it is very important. Growing potato is very. Very important. Because. To do this. Because. To do this. Right. Because. Now. These roots. That you see. The potato is pushing out. Is where the potato is. Producing from. So. You want to make sure. That. The roots. Them covered. You want to make sure. The roots. Them covered. You want to make sure. The roots. Them covered. You want to make sure. The roots. Them covered. So. If the roots. Covered. You stand a chance. Of getting. A lot more potato. Instead of just. Leave them. To run. Everywhere. Keep them. In one. Area. And just. Keep piling. Dot. Around them. And this is. How you stand. A chance. Of getting. A bigger. Harvest. All right. So. This is.

If you're on the phone. Please double tap the phone. And that will help. That will give the thumbs up. Okay. So now. I'm going right here. I'm going to bring another plant show. You guys. I'm going to bring another plant show. You guys. okay okay This one is the comfrey plant. This is the comfrey plant. This plant, do your research on the comfrey plant. This plant, from my experience, this is my experience I'm speaking from. I use this and I extract the oil from, I extract this into oil. And I use it as a massage oil. So, if I come out in the garden and I work hard. You know what I mean? What I'll do, I'll get some of the oil and I'll rub down my knees, my hands. You understand? And it make you feel so tense and so good after a massage. Now, this leaf, this is the comfrey leaf. I remember. Guys, hit that thumbs up, guys. Hit that thumbs up. Support the child by hitting the thumbs up, guys. I will appreciate it. Anyhow, the comfrey plant. This plant, it's a, listen to me, this is a really good plant. But before you use this plant, I need you to do your own research. Do your own research on this plant before using this plant. Anyhow, this is a plant I remember that, like for instance, you have a fracture. Guys, I'm not a doctor. Do your own research, okay? But in the old time, I remember my grandmother used to use this plant. And like if you have a fracture, she will, like your hand fracture or something, she might take a leaf and wrap it around your hand. And then wrap it with a piece of plastic. And it used to, as far as I see, it was actually helping people. If you do a research, you're going to also understand that people talk about this help with fracture, bone, and these type of stuff. But I want you to do your own research. I don't want to just tell you about plants. Please do your own research. But these plants is easy to grow. They come back every year. It's a, they push seeds, beautiful flowers. Because it's a beautiful plant that you should have in your garden. But it could be invasive as well. So be mindful of that. So this is the come-through plant as well. Now, this one here, this is the eddle leaf. Let me get one of the leaves. Let me get one of the leaves. is the other leaf before it fall out like this one. Now we take this one and we cook this down like you know like how you cook down collards, collard green. We cook it down like collard green. So what we do you see these young ones yeah this come from the edo plants. So all these leaf is very tender beautiful and tender. So you cut them up and you boil them for at least 45 minutes and you would not you wouldn't imagine how tasty these plants are and their benefit is on another level. Their benefit is amazing. This is the edo. Some people call it coco yam. We also have dasheen, tanya which all of them leaf almost look the same. These are not elephant ears. So do not mix this up with elephant ears. Elephant ears is different. It looks similar to this but I don't know anything about elephant ears so please make sure you know these before you eat them okay. So you could go in the store you could buy the edo plant. You could This is basically the plant. You could go to the store and get the root get one of the root and you could plant it and then it's going to multiply into several plants. So every year you leave a few in the ground and it's multiplied. So these are very good. I remember I'm only giving all remedies guys but I want you to do your research okay. I remember in the old time because my grandmother was like a nurse. So in the old time she used to take the edo leaf these young leaf and she used to cook them up in soup. Hey Budgie Peppa how you doing? Thank you for being here. What's going on? Good to see you. Yes. Yes. Yes. So what they used to do with these. These they like for instance what my grandmother told me like a lady might have baby but when she come out from the hospital she might not be producing any milk. Right. She might not be producing any milk. So what she do what they do they're going to boil these. Cut them up. Boil them in soup and give it to the lady. When the lady eat these help her to produce milk for the baby. So this plant is loaded with benefit. The good thing about these plants they produce leaf during the garden season and at the end of the season six months after they produce food. They produce food. So these are really interesting plants to grow. Very interesting plants to grow guys. It's called the edo plant. Do your own research and learn about the edo plant guys. I didn't know if I didn't know if I show you guys my little harvest. I harvest my potato my tomato. This is dinner for tomorrow guys. Okay let me let me give you another leaf again. I'm just giving talking about plants with benefit. Yes. We all know what type of leaf this is. We all know what type of leaf this is. This is the banana leaf right. You know when I was a little boy growing up. You know when I was a little boy growing up. And you know these are old remedies guys. These are old remedies. When I was a little boy growing up. This is what I see they used to use. Like for instance if you fall and hit your back. Which it happened to me one time as a little boy. I fall and I hit my back. And what they used to use. They used to use. There was a grease. It was a soft soft grease. That if you melt the grease the grease turn to oil. So they used to use a grease. So they used to use a grease. And rub your back. Rub your back really good. Rub your back. And then what they gonna do. They gonna take this banana leaf. And wrap it around you. And when they wrap it around you. What they do. After they don't wrap it around you. They come with a piece of cloth. And wrap it around the cloth. And wrap it around you. And wrap it around you. In three days. I could never forget. In three days. I was able to stand up and walk. Because I fall and hit my back. And it's like I couldn't even get up. And they rub my back. They rub my back. Massage it with the oil. It's a white stick. Almost look like candle. It's almost look like candle. But it's small. It's small. And it almost look. But when you melt it. It turn oil. And you rub it. And then you wrap this. Over. Your back. And then you wrap it with a piece of cloth. And I don't know what it did. But I know it helps me. So it's a lot of things out here guys. That. We can. But we don't know. You know what I mean. The older people who understand. A lot of them go on with the knowledge. They go on with the information. You see. So a few people still remember. Things they used to be seeing in them times. So. The banana leaf. It's. Wonderful. And. What you could do as well. Like for instance. If I'm trying to. Bake a potato. You know. If I'm trying to. Bake a potato. On the grill out there. I can wrap the potato. In this banana leaf. Like for instance. Let me show you. There's so much things you can do guys. I'm trying to bake this potato. What. Some people. You see like how some people use file paper. You can use this paper. You can use this paper. And wrap it up inside it. Wrap it up really good inside it. Some people might put a little tie around it. And bake it. So now. This is going to be keeping in the steam. And. Something like the file paper. So much things we can do with these things guys. So much things. And we got to get back. Okay. Now. Okay. Now. This is the edo leaf. And this is the dasheen leaf as well. It looks the same. But it's not the same. Now. This is. Our dish. We also could use this. And wrap the potato. And put it to bake. We also can use this and wrap the potato and put it to bake. We also. Can use this as a dish. We also. Can use this as a dish. You see. Like for instance. I want to. I want to. Eat a salad. Give me a minute guys. Give me a minute. This is what you call living on the land guys. So for instance. I want to eat a salad. I don't have no bowl, I'm in the bushes. I'm right here. Okay? All I gotta do, get one of these leaf and put them, my cucumber and my tomato inside of it. Cut it up, wash it, cut it up and this is my dish right here. So guys, I know we in different times now and I know these things is like, what are you talking about? These things, but trust me, you never know men, this information is valuable and good. You also, this you also, for instance, you in the bush, you have no water. These plants hold leaf, hold water. These leaves hold water. So you could come out in the morning and find water on these leaves. So if you live in somewhere, you don't have no water or you out here in the bushes, you have these whole leaf, these hold water. You could walk and you could... Let me see if I see any down here with water. Alright. I'm going to show you guys exactly what I'm talking about. Let me show you exactly what I'm talking about. This is what you call living after land guys. Living after land, able to survive after land. Even though you have no access to certain things, you could actually survive living after land. So now these are the leaf. Let me show you what's going on here. If you notice down here, you see water. You see what I'm talking about? You see water. So every morning you comes out, you're going to find water on top of these leaves. You see water. So these type of thing guys is so important. These type of things to know because if you stuck in a situation where you have no bowl, you have no dishes, you have none of these things. This is your bowl right here. Look at it. You see how deep it is? Watch. This is a You see what I'm talking about. You see what I'm talking about. You see what I'm talking about. Anytime it's rain, you're going to find water on these leaves. So these type of thing guys is so important. This type of thing guys is so important. This type of things to know because if you stuck in a situation where you have no bowl, you have no dishes, you have none of these things. This is your bowl right here. Look at it. You see how deep it is? Watch. This is a bowl. This is a dish. You could actually take this, put your food inside of it and eat from it. You see what I'm saying? This is a dish right here. And I'm going to be doing a video pretty soon because I'm going to be cooking. I'm going to be cooking right over there. And I'm going to show you guys how to really survive off the land without having the spoon, without having the spoon, without having the spoon, without having the spoon, without having the spoon. And I'm going to be cooking. I'm talking about the spoon. I'm going to be cooking right over there. And I'm going to be cooking right over there. You Secret us about cooking. You meet everything. We meet everyone allowed. You meet everyone for a moment, enjoy watching, having the fruit, without having theually of living off the land. This is important because you know, you just never know if you guys are feeding them, what can happen. You see that water, right here, believe it or not. succes, if you're really thirsty, trust me you're not going to leave that water. so it's a lot for us to learn guys it's a lot to learn is a lot you know it's so much to learn out here man right now right now the garden is we had a really some cold weather right we had some real cold weather during the garden season early but the weather changing now so because we start getting the heat now things start to really like everything start running now the pepper them all these are pepper right here all these are pepper and over here these pepper was really struggling all year up in the garden season was very struggling why they were struggling is because of the the weather was so cold and pepper love hats on tomato the same thing look them right down there same thing love hats on now though let me show you guys what i'm talking about all right all right so these are these are some of my peppers right here that's some of them right here and over the side here all these is bell pepper all these is bell pepper here and these bell peppers start picking height when i say start picking height what i mean they start getting pretty tall like i always say guys i just grow bell pepper eight feet tall and you see this one here this one is actually heading for this one almost four feet right at this time and we in june we ain't even reach july yet but we already this already almost four feet tall if you notice you're gonna see the the kind of steak them that i create for them because i already know they they grow pretty tall and you gotta know how to stake them out too because if you notice you're gonna see that i put a stake here because when this grow up and it jump to the stake i tie it this other limb over here for the stake over there these two right here these two right here this stay gonna go up for them is right here for them but i also got to add one right here then i also got to add a next one right here so these pepper all of them come from a eight foot bell pepper tree all these peppers come from a eight foot bell pepper tree from right here right in the same area so i use their seed and all these is bell pepper and the way how they're looking right now they're looking like they all gonna be some pretty tall peppers this one is already picking height over here again this one also too this one is picking height as well even this one but if you notice guys if you look at them you're gonna see how healthy they are the only thing is we just see like ladybugs on top of them and the ladybugs you know ting up the leaf but that doesn't really phase me all right once it ain't eating out the pepper them and the blossom that's okay but green bell pepper i love green bell pepper i just enjoy green bell pepper especially watching them grow so tall that you got to use a ladder to go and pick from now my eggplant them is flowers in right now which is beautiful and these eggplant start looking so healthy man and the all the all these plants were struggling or no guys all these plants was really struggling why because i plant them like in march and when i plant them in march they was the weather was so cold and they were struggling but look where they are now this is a catnip this is then this thing just start spreading you guys know the catnip right thank you pure grow thank you what this is a catnip look all these things spread no man this was one this is a plant this is a plant that i take from oh look at wow see look what's going on here you have two oku plant here struggling under these things oh wow it's a good thing i'm doing this live man watch it two oku plant oh wow one one two three four oku plant right here struggling under this thing okay all right man gardening is so amazing i just love gardening guys i just love it so what i'm going to do now i'm going to remove these three oku i'm going to remove them and i'm going to create somewhere else that i can plant them over here is where we had cabbage broccoli all in this era so what i did i harvest them so now i'm planting back different things now okay so i have a hole right here between these two colors so i'm going to plant it down inside here it's a good thing i see them because if i didn't see them you know what would happen they would remain right there because the plant is just spreading wider and wider so just like that i find a few oku plants okay let me go down here all right okay one could go right here okay i'm excited guys because this wanna be some oku plant that's just there and just dry down right under that plant and because i was able to find them this ain't this amazing this is why i love gardening man so much surprises just amazing so we have three more so i gotta find okay i think i see all this area was cabbage i have growing up inside this area here and i harvest out a lot of them so what i'm doing i'm trying to plant back see like i have a oku right right here start producing already right so when you move when you move the cabbage then you want to have something to replant because the cabbage once the cabbage done that's it so you want to have something to replant within that time all right so just like that guys i find a few oku in the garden just growing up just like that and i was able to save them ain't that a blessing ain't that a blessing but that's what's gardening about it's always good to search search it's always good to search your plants search between your plants because sometimes something always growing somewhere that you did you didn't see okay these are marigold what corresponds plant to grow yes definitely pro grow definitely definitely these are is what i love with these marigold these things almost grow like trees i'm telling you you see how big this one is from right down here these things grow up like like like trees trees and they produce so much flowers i have a next one here i don't i don't i don't a next one here here have a next one over there I have a next one there. These are basically Polly for pollinators because the truth is I don't see much pollinators around here lately. The past few years gone by you don't see much. So you still try to create things that can give you could draw even as a few butterfly even as a few bees at least something to draw them into your garden. Because you need the pollinators and they also make your garden look beautiful. This is the next marigold right here. This is the next one right here. This is some beans. I don't know. I think they now start producing. I think it's llama beans. These are llama beans. I think they now start producing. I'm just allowing them to do their thing. I'm not even trying to let them run on each other produce however they can. Do you make tea out of marigold? Yes I do. I make tea out of the flowers. I make tea out of the flowers. I make tea out of the flowers. Let me show you. This I use this and I make tea out of this one. Well I have learned I don't know but I have learned this have something inside it that good for the eyes. Guys I don't know. Do your research okay. But I have learned that it has some really really good benefit. Marigold. Alright. This is actually bordach growing here. These are bordach. I plant them from the seed germinate and just grow up in the garden. So I plant these right here. And they do it. They're doing pretty well. They're growing really well. Yes guys. So garden is a blessing man. So do you guys know about bordach root? Okay. Do I need to dry? The truth is I don't dry them. I don't just. Yes I dry some of them. Because sometimes when I harvest so much. I can't make tea with all of them. So what I do I dry some. And I make some fresh. But do your research first. Okay. And what I want to say to guys. What I want to say to. Oh these peanuts looking nice man. This is peanuts guys. This is peanuts. What I want to say to is. Using herbs. And using different type of herbs. When we're using herbs. And different type of herbs. I want us to be very careful. Because. Now someone might tell you. Someone might tell you. Oh um. I use this herb. And it works for me. Well. Sometimes. Two people. Might have two different conditions. Or. Someone might have one condition. And the other have. Two different conditions. So now this person. It might work for this person. But it might not work for you. So you. You. You have to be careful. On just running out there. And just using herbs. I'll recommend. Do your research. I'll recommend. Speak to a doctor. Before you run out there. And just using herbs. Then the next thing again. You want to make sure. You want to make sure that. You don't overdose yourself. Because you know what. Let me tell you. I remember. I remember. When my grandmother used to use. Herbs. Hit the likes. Okay. Tap the screen guys. Hit the like button. I truly appreciate it. This is real information. You all get in here today. Live from my garden. Please hit the like button. I'll appreciate it. One thing I understand. Or one thing I notice. In the time of my grandmother. What I've noticed. I've noticed something. Yes. What I have noticed. She used to use dosage. She used to use dosage. Major. Choose to measure. You never see them just. Biling and just drinking. Dosage. Measurement. That's important. Doses. Measurement. You notice. When they're giving you medicine. They tell you how much to take. That's important. That's important. Because too much of one thing. They say is good for nothing. Too much of one thing. Good for nothing. And if you're taking. Different type of herbs. And it's making you feel in any type of way. I don't think you should continue. That's my opinion. That's my opinion. If you're using herbs. And it's making you feel funny. Or different. Leave it alone. But we at the same time. We know herbs. War. But it's important. When come and dosage. How much. Should you take. That's important. Yep. yep very important this is compost right there see guys just like that does this i pull some compost just like this this is compost all right this you could put this in water and it could break down and you're going to draw the nutrients the minerals into the water leave it for a few months just treat around your plants so much we can do so much we can do but because we don't know and we don't understand we had to go and buy a lot of these things but sometimes you have it right in your backyard so living off the land it's such an amazing thing because you learn so much you're able to learn so much living after life so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so do do so so so so so so so so so so so yeah so so I so start to start to get a little male juice so what I just do I just cut them off and throw them away from my garden it's it's so much to do guys in your garden man it's this type of garden is so much to do you call this you call this chop and chop this is what you call it chop and chop you chop it the barn and you just chop it right around there e yo so so this isso e e e e e This pepper is right under a tree and I think the rain hit them so hard that it bored some of the leaves then. So I am getting rid of those type of leaves. Give me a minute and I am going to show you something again about what you do with these pepper leaves. I am not doing this for the sake of cooling the pepper. I am just doing it because the leaves are damaged. So I am just getting rid of them. And the thing about it, getting rid of them too, it makes the plant focus more on the pepper them instead of all these extra leaves. I think pruning is a really good idea but you got to know which plant to prune and how to prune them. Some plants don't really like to be prune from my experience. Alright. So the pepper leaf. The pepper leaf right. I am going to show you something about what they used to do with the pepper leaf as well. you might have a boil. You might have a boil.
