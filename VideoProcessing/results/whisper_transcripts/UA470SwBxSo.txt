Guess what happens when ranching operations are closed down. You didn't expect this.

 But where you see good livestock management practices, where you see farmers or ranchers developing waters, spreading waters for irrigation, developing springs, keeping springs open and unplugged and running, where you see water spread in one form or another through wells, where wells are dug and troughs put in, what you have there is a positive symbiotic relationship between livestock grazing and wildlife. When we were put out of business in 1991 and we sold all the livestock off this operation, all of the water on the desert also got turned off because there was no reason to have, none of it was live water. And so all those troughs, all those springs and all of the things that we had maintained and kept running all those years no longer were running. And that whole area of the desert was no longer available for water for even wildlife.
