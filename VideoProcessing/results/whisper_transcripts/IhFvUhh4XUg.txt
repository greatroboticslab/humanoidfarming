Howto & Style
 Cage-free, free-range, and pasture-raised. What's the difference? In the U.S., most eggs come from caged hens. This doesn't mean that each hen has its own cage. That would be extremely expensive. Typically, each cage has six chickens with 67 square inches per chicken. Cage-free chickens have over double the space, and instead of living in small cages of six, they share one large indoor space that they can never leave. Kind of like a big cage. I mean, coop. If the chickens are free to range outside, then those are free-range chickens. But the specifics of that range can really range. It could be two square feet of concrete per chicken, or over 21 square feet of grass. And pasture-raised eggs cost so much because each hen gets over 108 square feet of space. And a third party like Certified Humane will verify that the outdoor area has grass, grubs, and stuff hens love. But oddly enough, the USDA doesn't regulate the term pasture-raised on its own. So without the expensive third-party certification, an egg that's labeled pasture-raised could really just be... adjustments considerations.ischer-raised go.
