 It's very important that India, in fact the world over, but let's talk about developing countries, especially about India, where there is water scarcity, we need to start digging our lands, we need to start digging our ponds. Now people ask me, it's okay to dig a pond, where will we get the water from? First create a pond, the water will come and this is, you can see an example over here, if you can show it on the camera, that we had, this is all manually done, this pond, it's quite a big pond, we have done, first we created a small one, and then we kept expanding it, and there is another one down there, but this pond, now you can see, you can see frogs, you can see tadpoles, there is some fish, there is some aquatic life, some aquatic plants on the borders, they have come up, so you've got to be patient, you have to dig a pond, wait for the monsoon, wait for the rains to come, just make sure that the slope around the pond is the gradient as such, that the water keeps flowing into the pond. So I think it's very important, we go into planning a lot, and whether to come from people, where to come from, whether to . Looking from people , whether to the water is the clay, the water move from them, and first you injured a pond, not theиляe pond,, because you take it naturally down and will stay the second floor of or even running the water? water will be filled and water will be filled and water will be filled in two or three times and then water will be started to stay. This is our first year and now it is filled and when there is a little rain, this water will be filled again. So I think my request to everybody is to start digging ponds. This is the best way to conserve rainwater. See, the source of water is only the monsoon in India. It is always rains. The rains when they come, that is the only source of water. The ponds, the rivers, the tanks, any kind of lakes, they are reservoirs. They are banks. They are water banks. They store water. So the water creation, the water where it comes from, it comes from the storm. That's only rain. So whenever it rains, whenever there is monsoon, whenever we have this kind of precipitation, we should be ready. Right? Our land should be ready. So always have small, small ponds everywhere, as many places, as many ponds as possible in India, as many as possible in our country so that we can have lots of ponds with lots of water in it. So the vegetation benefits, the water table benefits, it goes down, it seeps into the ground, and it also affects the flora fauna, it affects the temperature of the place also. Okay? So happy digging ponds. Let's mandar and punch all of the water. You can because of the objective.
