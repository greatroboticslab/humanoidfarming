Comedy
 We were doing impressions. You actually do a really good Ernie. Can you talk like Bert? Get me in character. Ernie, what was that? Ernie, what was that? I don't think I can do Bert. You're doing Ernie. You're taking my part. Should we do an album where we sing Christmas albums? Chestnuts roasted, I do great. Steph Infection. Well, well, well, Steph Infection guests, listeners. That was my guests. When I say Steph Infection guests, I got excited. We have one of the best guests we've had, fave listeners, biggest views. Big views? Big views. My sweet, precious, hilarious, talented, pianist boyfriend, Jefferson McDonald. Wow, thank you. What an intro. Thank you, darling. What an intro. We're both wearing pit vipers. I want to get sponsored by pit viper. First of all, look how fucking cool we look. I got him those pit vipers for our one year anniversary that we just had. It's been one year and we didn't have matching glasses that first year. And I think it would have been better if we'd been pit vipered up. It would have been better. I love these. Thank you, honey. I love them so much. Thank you. Oh, wow. You really nailed it with the gifts. And you got me that. And also you got me the Buffalo Bills thing for the wall. I got a Buffalo Bills light up light and you got me a very nice express so much. I can't keep these on. This is crazy. I can't keep them on the whole episode. It's insane. That's longer than I thought. You know, you did pretty well. I know. I felt like, you look cool in them, but like, it's weird. Show your face. No, it's bizarre. I should have worn a white shirt because I feel like I'm bunching up. It's like a fat roll. It's going to be insane the whole time. No, you don't have. Honey, you're looking fit. I'm looking fit. My hemorrhoid's back. We got a lot going on. We got a lot going on. Hemorrhoid's back with a vengeance. Well, I haven't even. It is. It's Bruce Willis. He's back there. He's bald and he's ready to go. He has a new name. Oh, no. Glenn has a friend. Die hard with a vengeance. That was a good reference. Sorry. I don't know. Hemorrhoid with a vengeance. Hemorrhoid with a vengeance. Because my hemorrhoid, I feel like if it was on the outside, it would look like Bruce Willis. It's bald. Yours aren't on the outside yet? No. Not like mine. Okay. You're getting there. I haven't shown you. Mine's full Bruce Willis. Yours is deflated Bruce Willis. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's sad now. Yours is Bruce Willis' balls. You haven't seen my ass. We haven't slept in a few days because I've been feeling very period-y. I've been feeling very fat. I feel like my gut came back. When was the last time I saw your ass? It was... You saw it. You said the hemorrhoids were gone. I was all pumped up. I was bragging. You're feeling good. We are a very Canadian-ed out right now. Look at us. I'm wearing my Molson Canadian tea. You've got your Moose Egg Canadian lager, my favorite beer in Canada. Moose juice. I'll get back. We're coming to Canada next fucking week. I never do the proper promos and I'm doing it right now. If you're in Kelowna, Victoria, Vancouver, or Edmonton, and you don't fucking come see us next week, stop listening to the podcast. You're no longer allowed to be a fan. I am pushing the... It's my first theater. She'll block you. I'll block you. And guess what? She'll find a way to block you. Oh, do I love blocking. She loves blocking. But this is all next week. This is November 8th. November, sorry. November 6th to the 10th. And I don't know what to tell you. They're theaters and I'm so fucking close to selling out. And here's what people don't realize. If I don't sell out, these places don't want to bring me back. So just come to the fucking show. I don't know what to tell you. Come. That's it. Jefferson's hosting all the shows. What more do you want? Pat Burchard's middling. I don't know what more you want. I'm doing new jokes. I just recorded an hour. Do I have new jokes? No, but I'll be trying to do them. Yeah. If these don't sell, it's back to the farm for me. I'm getting kicked to the curb. Kicked to the curb. Raising chickens again. Yeah. So better come. Better get them. I mean, to be honest, a lot of them are really selling well. They're, yeah, the issue is they're almost sold out. So I just, it's a final push here. Just, especially Vancouver. I thought you guys liked me. What the heck? What the actual heck? We're going to Edmonton. You love Edmonton. I love Edmonton. I've been there a few times. The Mayfield dinner theater. Love everything about Edmonton. Shout out to the Mayfield dinner theater. Last time we were there. Yeah, yeah. Come on by. Comes to the show. It's going to be. Stop with the Trump voice. Sometimes you can't. You can't have yourself. That's the Trump voice. That is. You come to the show. You did a little bit. A little bit. That was, yeah, baby.

Okay, so last time we were at Edmonton, we did the Great Outdoors Festival. And sometimes you get something I want to call food rage. Almost, I don't know how to explain it. You'll start eating in a way where I'm like, oh, that's enough. And you won't stop. And I don't think you realize. So Bert Kreischer invited us into his trailer. And I guess someone made him a bunch of meat. And he's like, oh, have some. You guys want some? I'm like, okay, yeah. So I have like, I know, I take a little plate. It's not our trailer. It's not our meat. I look over, you're just fucking hucking this meat on this fucking plate. And I was like, okay, well, that's a lot. That's a lot for a first topping. First topping, you went back like, I was like, and at one point, they started putting the tin foil over it. His assistant was putting tin foil, and you opened it up. I was like, this means they don't want you to have more meat. You ate all of Bert Kreischer's meat. You ate it all. Bert Kreischer has delicious meat. Bert Kreischer. Bert Kreischer. Bert Kreischer. Bert Kreischer. Bert Kreischer after all that fucking meat. I wanted to help him out. They had a huge tub of meat, and they spent a lot of time making that tri-tip nice. It was delicious. And I wasn't going to let it go to waste, because he wasn't taking it with him. No, he was flying up this for you. He was meated out. Everyone was meated out. The only one who needed meat was me. Oh, was you? I needed that meat, and it was delicious, and it was good meat. And when you're in Edmonton, you eat all the meat you can, because it's meat central, baby. It is. We're getting some juicy steaks. I love steak. I love steak. It was delicious. We went to your favorite restaurant for our one year anniversary. Yes. If you guys are wondering what we did, it was a very... Actually, on our actual one year, we flew home, and there was a fucking fly on the plane, and I'm still not over it. Remember how mad I got? Yeah, you were furious. The whole plane, it's buzzing up and down our aisle. There's 36 fucking aisles. How dare that fly, sitting right on the guy right beside us on his little fold-down table, and then he wasn't concerned by it. You almost smacked it off of him. I wanted you to. I was so close. Yeah. I was... Are we shit? We're two turds on the plane. I was so pissed. I couldn't even enjoy the whole plane ride. I kept looking for the fly. You know I hate flies. Disgusting things. You hate flies. Flies are grosser than anything else on the plane. Flies and Cristalia are my two least favorite things. I make it... I might have a Cristalia joke in my fucking special. That's how much I make fun of this man. I make sure I say it on almost every podcast, and almost every time I'm on stage. You laughed. You were on my special. I laughed. I was there. I want to give you a very sweet... Your hands are so cool and clammy. I want to give you... I don't know what's wrong with me. What is that? Disgusting. You're wet. Because my blood isn't flowing through my hands. My sweet boyfriend, Jefferson Davis McDonald, racist name. He was so sweet at my special. He did my teleprompter. You scrolled it. You told me when my bangs were out of place. It was very sweet. You helped out very, very much. Very, very much. You helped out very, very much, and I love you so much. I'm very happy, and I just want to know that... I want you to know that you were very sweet to me, and I really appreciate all the help. Well, thank you, honey. Well, you absolutely killed it. And you fucked me real good before this. Yeah. I did, didn't I? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay. Oh, I did. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because I was at my thinnest, and I felt good getting fucked, and now I'm feeling like a big blob again. You're much happier after. Yeah, you're much... Actually, we got in a fight last night. You're in a much better mood. We got in a pretty huge fight last night. We got in a massive fight last night. Was it big? I don't know. On TikTok Live. You know how embarrassing that is? Yeah. It was pretty brutal. It was really melding into the media sphere. It was, yeah. It was somebody asked who is funnier, and I said, I'm obviously funnier. And then he said, well, I'm funnier. And then I lost my fucking mind. I literally lost my mind. Honey, you're the funniest. I'm dog shit. But then you did that. I never said you were dog shit. I find you funny. I'm just funnier than you. That's it. There you go. Let me have this. This is all I have. It's settled. It turned into. It turned into. Even if you don't believe it, you know that I'm so, this is all I have is being funny. Also, I don't really remember what we were talking about because I was loaded. Yeah, we, the problem is we had a couple- Because you asked me to make you some dirty martinis. You were gonna watch- I didn't watch mine? You were nervous to watch the footage for the first time, which is understandable. I really was. I can't watch myself doing anything. It's very hard. You have to do it much more and you're very good at that and you're editing and all that stuff. So, I don't- you're incredible at it. But we were watching it and it was glorious. It's gonna be incredible. I was actually quite, quite, quite thrilled of Boston. Man, whoo, that second show came out. Holy fuck. Yeah. People are gonna think there's added laughs. They're laughing almost too much. I'm like, that wasn't even funny. It was insane. It's crazy. I'm so- Too much laughter. Yeah, it's too much. Too much. I'm very happy. Relax people. And then- But then we got- We were so good. It was going so good. The booze hit up. It was nice. I think what happened is, I- well, we didn't eat anything yesterday all day. We had a meat stick and oats in the morning. And then we had some very strong dirty martinis, which we love. We love our dirty martinis. I love them and I love and love them. I had some at the Smokehouse the other day. Yeah. That's where we went. If you're wondering, you can go there. We celebrated our one year there. So we love Smokehouse, yes. You can go there. It's fine food at a fair price. That's their slogan and I thought that he just kept saying that out loud. And I was like, you love- but you love Smokehouse. I love it. And unfortunately, Jimmy Angel wasn't playing that night. Shout out to Jimmy Angel. Jimmy Angel is a man who's probably 80? He must be. I don't know. He went to school with Elvis or something. He was telling some crazy stories. Yeah, yeah. He dyes his eyebrows black. He's got quite a history and voice of an angel. Kind of sounds like Roy Orbison a little bit, but let me tell you- You loved it. I love Jimmy Angel. And I love the Smokehouse. I know. I gotta say what happened though at the Smokehouse. I love Smokehouse. Okay? Every time we've gone, we've gotten a booth. I put in- I made a reservation. I said it's our anniversary. Because it was our anniversary. I assumed by just saying it was our anniversary, we would get a nice table. So they give us this slop table. Back corner. I can see inside the kitchen. It's a table. The chairs are like old banquet. There's no fluff left in them. They're deflated chairs. I have a bad back. Was it that bad? No. I just didn't want to sit there. So we sit down and our server comes and I'm like, I'm really sorry to be annoying. I can't sit here. Can we get a booth? Then they forget about us. They leave us there. We have just a bit of water, not even a cube. And I go, I can't do this. And you know that I'm going to be in a mood if I don't get the booth. So we go up to the front and I'm like, look, I'm really sorry to do this. Also, I will say, bunch of booths. There was nothing but booths open. Plenty of booths. There was plenty of booths open. I'm just thinking about smokehouse meat right now. I'm really distracted. Yeah. Yeah. But I go up to the front and I go, I really lay on my sciatica. I go, I'm sorry. Ooh. I toss it up. Oh, you were full acting. My sciatica is really acting up today. I needed a booth. I can't enjoy a meal. Also, it's one year. I'm sitting across this disgusting table. You were so angry. At that point, I just knew it wasn't going to work. We couldn't even have dinner. There was no, just at that point, you know what you have to do. You go back up, you ask for the booth. It was done. It was, you know, we went from being in a good mood, happy to live, to very angry. I can, I can. Sciatica. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's just say that's one thing both of us do. We can go from being absolutely thrilled and on the fucking snap, both of us can speak. It's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Yeah. My daddy used to have that and I used to get mad when he did it and now I have it. And you have it. Like last night. You're much funnier than I am, but let me just say that- I don't eat much. You know what? I can eat a lot more meat than you. Let me have that. You have, you have everything else. I eat the meat. You're hot. You have great teeth. You have a good body. My teeth are full of coconut still. I can't do- Right now they're filled with milk. I can't. I'm very distracted. I can't do the piano like I've never seen any other human being play the piano. Like what the heck? I'm mostly proud of the amount of meat I eat. Yeah, why is that your one thing? What the hell? I don't know what all this other stuff is. You love meat. It's nothing to me. It's just meat. I don't know how you don't have gout. I always wanted that. There was so much tri-tip left in Burt's little thing. I remember I was trying to take it. I was like, we're going to bed. We fly out the next morning. We had like a 6am flight. Which is good that you held me off because it is hard for me to sleep with that much meat in my stomach. We're taking you. We're going to the keg. So he's coming home next- Oh yeah. By the time it comes out, this is very- Next weekend we're going to a wedding. I'm the maid of honor. Have not written a single thing for my speech yet. Or my bridesmaid. Whatever, I'm a bridesmaid. But my family's very excited because you're coming into town. And that means we get to go to the keg. And my family loves the keg. Big eaters in the old Toll-up household. They have meat at the keg. The keg is- They might as well just call it meat. Fine food at a fair price. It's a nicer chain restaurant steakhouse in Toronto. And it's, I would say, the happiest moments I've had with my family. Throughout all of Canada, really. I think, yeah, all of Canada, yes. But we love the keg. It's where we all thrive as a family. We keg-size stuff. I won't be keg-sizing. So that's like, what's the equivalent here? Was it like Ponderosa? Like? No, it was way better Ponderosa. The fuck Ponderosa? Disgusting. Ew. I made a Ponderosa reference on stage the other day and no one got it. I was like, oh, we're insane. Ponderosa's disappearing. Like, they're really having problems. I think they're more upstate. I don't think they're like, I don't think Ponderosa's a West Coast restaurant. Yeah, we never went to Ponderosa. No, it's fancier. There's, there, there, it's nice ambient lighting. It's like smooth jazz in the back. You always get a, you always get a good steak. You never get in a fatty piece. But did you go there as a kid? I never went out to eat as a kid because we couldn't afford to do that. No, we went to Swiss chalet. Swiss chalet. We got the family dinner. Okay. But the cake size, I don't want you to cake size things because they offer it to you. That means you get, they make everything bigger. So if you get the Caesar, you get cake size, they make you bigger Caesar. The steak, they give you bigger, it's just a whole thing. Well, maybe I'll do a Caesar. I cake sized one time and I went home. How big is that? Like the size of my head? It's big. Big Caesar. I cake sized the salad. I cake sized it all. I was being picky. I was being a big picky, picky. I was being a big fan this time. Because I went home and my sister made me laugh and I puked on her back. And you always say I'm the one puking after I eat. I know. So you can't cake size. Well, I sometimes do. You puked so much after you eat. Because I eat too much and then it just comes out. And I don't even notice it's coming out. But you hear it. Oh, I hear it. You puke more than, it sounds like you're anorexic, but you're not. No. I just eat like a snake and then my body realizes I'm not a snake and then it just comes out. You don't even chew. What was the other day I watched you just- Why bother? I have a photo of you that I was going to post there one year. You're naked in a hotel on your hands and on your knees. You're using the bed as a table. There was a table there. And you're eating a lean cuisine that you got from the hotel lobby, which I've never seen anybody ever before buy those hotel lobby snacks. You always do. Sometimes they're good. The lean cuisine. No, it was better than that. It was like one of those other ones that's decent. It's like supposedly USDA organic. So it wasn't complete trash. Trash. Trash. Chassey, Chassey. Why do we both have a lisp today? I have a lisp because my mouth is filled with coconut. I can't talk. It's filled with coconut. We also are a little hungover. I can't get it out. We had a couple of sippes. We had a bottle of wine last night. I don't feel so good honey. No, I don't feel great. I don't feel great. I don't feel great at all. But yeah, we're coming to Canada. My family's excited. They like you. My dad's so excited you're coming. He already brought you beer. That's amazing. How cute is that? And we're coming in a week and he's like, God share me some beers in the fridge in case you want some. My dad loves you. I love him too. I love your whole family. They're very nice. They've been very inviting, very accepting. Because I've only dated pig slob trough shit. Trough shit? I actually can't talk today. I just did a podcast and I talk normally. Now I can't talk for some reason with you. The hangover is hitting us. We're in trouble. I've only dated the one boyfriend they like, Steve Oak. And then since then, all the middle filters, it's not been good. So now you're in the picture and they're like, we want this one to stay. Yeah. They're latching on to you. Yeah. So we need to stop having blow ups during family Euchre night. Oh yeah. Because that wasn't great either. No, it wasn't. No. Because I was trying to do the Bondi, Bondi, maybe chatty chatty with Daddy-O. I forgot about that. And then we cannot be on the same Euchre team anymore because we- No, I threw a pretzel at your head. You threw a pretzel at my head. Did I throw a pretzel at your head? Well, you threw one first though. I threw one first. You kind of snapped. I just threw it at my head, yeah. The hard one. I whipped it? Oh, that's an exaggeration. Whipping. Oh, you did a full over-harp. So many exaggerations. No, no, no. Overhand whip. No, no. It was a flick of the wrist. A flick of the wrist. Okay. Then how come I was bleeding right now? Oh my gosh. This is how they get us, man. This is how it happens. Okay, wow. Here we go. Just do an incel. This is one pretzel and now all of a sudden I'm abusing her. Yeah, don't do it with a pretzel. Something else. I love pretzels. It's meat and pretzels. So, you know. Oh, those are your two favorite things? Meat and pretzels? Yes. And I'm a far third. No, no. You're my little pretzel. I'm your big fat fucking pretzel you get at a guy named baseball game. I'm your pub cheese. Dip you in some mustard. You would dip me. I can't believe we haven't played with food yet. We haven't? We did. No, like sexually. Sort of. Oh, I was eating while you were. Yeah, yeah. You were eating an ice cream when I was sucking you off. Yes. Oh, we can talk about how I sucked your dick when we were. I didn't know I could say I was being polite. How I sucked your dick when we were watching Forensic Files. That was a mistake. That was a big mistake. Yeah, because you were laughing and I thought you were going to bite my dick off. Well, because it was crazy. I was like deep throat and you're nuts and then we just hear, they found her under a bridge. I was like, oh, oh, oh. Yeah, it's kind of funny but after a while it just, it's gotta go. After a while, the second they said that she had like abrasions and she was raped, I'm like I can't continue on like this. No, no, we can't. No, no. What channel? And that voice too. That guy, I love that guy's voice. It's so hard. Whenever we were trying to do impressions of him, they found her under the bridge. He has such a weird cadence. They found her under the bridge. That's not it at all. They found her under the bridge. Oh, okay. The last night we were on a TV Live because I've been really pushing these West Coast Canada tickets and we were doing impressions. You actually do a really good Ernie because I sent him the meme. Someone sent me the meme where it's like Bert and Ernie in bed and Ernie's like, boy, am I thirsty. If there's one thing I am not tired, I'm thirsty. And it's like that's you. Every time I get in bed, you're like, I'm thirsty. Do your Ernie. Ernie is good. Do my Ernie because and you'll be Bert. Yeah, I'll be Bert. So can you talk like Bert to get me into character? Ernie, what was that? Wait, I don't know what I was. Ernie, what was that? I don't think I can do Bert. You're doing Ernie. You're taking my part. Oh wait, Bert's more. He talks more nasally, right? I got Bert. You're doing Ernie too. I'm doing Bert now. This is Bert. Ernie, go to sleep. Wait, you're Bert. I'm Bert. I'm Bert. I'm Bert. I'm kind of thirsty. Can you pass me the water, Bert? It's a mix. It's a really fine line mix. I think it's the same voice actor. It's Kermit. That is so Kermit. Um, um, um, it's definitely Kermit. I can do Miss Piggy. Okay. Kermie. Why didn't we go as that for Halloween? Miss Piggy and Kermit? Are you kidding me? I don't know. That's a real Miss opportunity right there. Oh, my sweet. My sweet. I started snorting because I don't know what she does. What does Miss Piggy say? Oh, Kermit. Oh, Kermit. Oh, Kermit. You can't do it. My throat's so fucked. Your voice is too low. Jesus. Yeah, but you gotta really get up there. She gets up there. Oh, Kermit. God, rabid, rabid, Miss Piggy. We are good at Batman though. We realize we both can do Batman. Come fuck me. I'm Batman. Let me put it in your bat cave. Put your dick in my cave. My ass and my pussy are both my caves. Alfred, would you help me move it in there? Wait, there's a third. Where is Alfred? Alfred always helps me put it in the bat cave. Do you think Alfred did help him fuck? Well, he was there from the beginning, you know, because think about it. He, you know, somebody had to teach him sex ed because he wasn't going to a normal school, right? He had to learn from Alfred. Did he go to school? Did he go to school? Well, according to that show Gotham, I think he's sort of going to school, but then he's not going, he's not attending regularly. Oh, you know Alfred is putting on Batman's condom. Yeah, he taught him. He gave him that lesson. Oh, pleasure. I lost it again. I lost it again. I lost it again. Ripped for her pleasure. No, you lost it too. But which, which Batman are we doing? I don't know. We've been watching him on us. The Christian Bale is just tearing his throat out. Ripped for her pleasure. Yeah, Christian Bale, there's no way he could talk after that. Yeah, that was hard to do. That wasn't even close to anything too. You're very good at voices though. Once you like know a voice, you can do them pretty good. Well, I can pretty much do this one. That's the only one you can do. Give me some, give me some water please. I'm also thirsty. I'm so thirsty before I go to bed. I can't sleep because my knees are sweating and you have the temperature jacked up. I haven't had the heat on in months. We have one of those mattresses. What is it? Just like make you hotter? No, it's an aero mattress. Can we get sponsored by one of those things that cools you down or anything? Yeah, you can do one because you got night sweats. Yeah, in the back of my knees you're sweating. We're getting on the night sweats. You're soaked in the bed. I'm so warm. Every time we fuck, it's like a goddamn puddle. Every time we fuck, I'm like, am I fucking Joe Rogan or is this Jeremy McDonald? Soaked. You are dripping sweat every time. Gosh. You're more jacked than Joe Rogan. That was almost an insult to you. Me? No way. That guy is jacked up. I don't want to see him with his shirt off. I'm sick. He's got the abs. I feel like what Joe Rogan looks with his shirt off is just a bunch of jerky sewn together. Jerky sewn together? Yeah, I picture a bunch of flat jerkies and then his head on top of it. And then his two legs are slim jeans. Honestly, this is making me hungry. Wow, the Joe Rogan jerky dog is getting you parched. You're parched, you're hungry. If somebody could make a Joe Rogan jerky doll. How they did Fusili Jerry, there must be a jerky Rogan. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not a me. It's not a me. That would be delicious. Yeah, but I've been kind of off the jerky because I was shit in blood. You were? Yeah, yeah. Did you show me this? Oh yeah, remember our trip across the country? We were only eating jerky. Oh yeah, I know. I ate jerky for six months. The first, when we started dating. That was good jerky. I got you that in Wisconsin. That was good jerky. You were feeding me so much jerky and I loved it. Why was that? Yeah, yeah. Just jerky. Everywhere you'd go and you'd call me, you'd be at a jerky shop somewhere. I was. You're like, here honey, here's more jerky. And I ate so much jerky that something bad happened. I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I made your ass bleed? I was bleeding a lot. Why was I giving you so much? Was I trying to fatten you up? I'm not sure. What the hell was that? Or shrivel me up with all the salt. I was salting me up. No, that's retaining. I was retaining you. I was getting puffy. What the hell? I just looked at your balls. What about my balls? I just looked at them. I liked them. Can you see them? I'm sick. What do you think of my balls? Do they need a little help? I like your balls. Yeah. I suck your balls all the time. Am I doing it right? I get down there and I realize I don't know what I'm supposed to do down here. Well, I was trying to instruct you on like the two-hander where you hold the thing down. I've been doing the two-hander. No, you kind of stopped doing the two-hander. No, I have been doing that. But you have been doing the ball suck with the hand, which is nice. I like that. Okay, but I don't know how, sometimes when I grab the balls, I feel like I'm squishing them like one of those stress balls. And then I see them bulge to my fingers. I'm like, that's too tight. Yeah, because that's not what you necessarily want to do. Sometimes you want to like grab. You can kind of grab and pull the, you know. No, what? Grab and pull what? You can put like your hand around them and you're like kind of like caressing them down. Caressing them down. So like say the balls are here, down here. It's like an udder. Like an udder. Treat them like an udder. Try that technique as opposed to the ball crush. Okay. But it's not like you're crushing them at all. The balls can take quite a bit. I'm not crushing, but then it's, my question is, with the licking, with the licking and the sucking, I might, I'm trying to get a full ball in there. Then sometimes I like to challenge myself and try to get two in there. But then I don't love it. Have you ever gotten two, all two of them in there? All two of them. All two of them. All two of them. I feel like they're fucking huge. I can tell when you're trying to do that. And I'm like, is she distracted now? I am. When you're just trying to get both balls in your mouth? I do get distracted. Yeah, because then it begins to be competition for me and then I'm not even focusing on playing anymore. Yeah, I'm like, what's going on now? I'm like, but I just, I feel like the second I go down there, I'm like, okay, I've dedicated. You know what though? They never, they're always clean. That's why I'm down there. I've never sucked a dick this much in my life than yours. It's so clean. It's squeaked up. Squeaky, squeaky clean. You put that through, it's cleaner than our cars. Your dick is close. Oh, well our cars are filthy. Our cars are bad. What are you talking about? No, but I mean like, even like after the gym there's no smell. First thing in the morning, even when you're sweating, there's no smell. Yeah, but I shower pretty quickly after the gym. I'm not letting it, I don't let it marinate after the gym because believe me, it would soak up. There's only one time you got after the balls after the gym and that was fast. And they were sour. They were sour, see? They were sour, see? But I didn't hate it, I still liked it. I still liked it. Somebody actually asked us last night, this is a good question, somebody asked us last night on the live, what our ick is with each other. And I thought when someone says you have an ick, in my opinion, when you get the ick with somebody, it's done. I've never had an ick with a guy, I've been like, okay, and seen through it. Once you get one ick with somebody, you're like, I'm like disgusted and it's over. Yeah, for instance, I thought an ick was when I told you, could you please not blow your nose at the table at the smokehouse. Yes. I thought that was an ick because when I grew up, you know, we weren't allowed to blow our nose at the table. That just was a general thing. Okay. And my father would always equate it to just might as well pull your pants down at the table and take a shit on the plate. That's what he would teach us. Well, that seems a little drastic. And you didn't take very well to me saying that. Well, here's the thing. I blew my nose at the table. I was sick for a bit. The amount of times I had to get up, I didn't do what we were eating. I waited until there was no food there and I would turn and I'd blow it in the napkin. I didn't think there was a problem with that. I've always blown my nose at the table. I think we farted at the dinner table. Your family? Yeah. Yeah. So we were gross. I think it's bad to blow your nose at a... No, it's not bad. Aaron's on my side for this. Thank you very much. To blow your nose at... Are we talking about a dab? Because one thing is like a dab because you can like turn that from like a face thing into a dab, but actual blowing out big loogies of snot at the table. But I don't do the look. I never do look. It's disgusting. I blow. Yeah, I put it down. I blow. Exactly. You blow it. You dab and you put it away. Blow and the dab and then put it away? The way you looked at me, the face you gave me after I did that. It was more than a dab. I honestly thought you were breaking out with me. You were repulsed. And I was like, huh? I've never seen you looking like that. And I was like, what? I was honestly alarmed. I'll never do it again now. Now I know there's an issue with the blowing nose at the table. Hey, chime in the comments if you think it's that repulsive. Now here's the thing. If you're leaking and the leak is coming down and... I was leaking. You gotta like get the leak. But if you're doing a full blow because it's forceful in order to get it out, I think that's you gotta reserve for going to the bathroom, you know. People are eating here. The next night I did it and I went to the bathroom 48 times. So that meal to me sucked because I spent half my night in the bathroom. I spent that entire meal in the bathroom. Yeah, but you were just leaking so you needed to do the dab. No, I needed a blow. You needed a blow. I was so congested. You were so congested, yeah. You know, in that situation it is tricky. But was that the ick with you? But you were legitimately kind of sick. I was deathly ill. I was so sick. Something was wrong with you. Sick as hell. Yeah, you were sick as hell. So we... We're just going out apparently sick. But you've been kind of... I'm sick all the time. Sick all the time. It wasn't COVID. I knew what it was. It was just cold season. It's just cold season. Snot's pouring out of your face. I have allergies. I'm covered in hives. My hives were so bad this morning. I thought I'd go to the hospital. My hives were very bad this morning. They were very bad. They were very bad. I was getting concerned. And then I flashed you and then you said that my hives are the same color as my nipple. I'm like, well now we can't fuck. And then you pretend to suck them. And I was like, well you can't suck my nipples now if you said my hives are the same color. That's not... That doesn't mean I can't fuck. Just because of the same... What are you talking about? That means extra nipples for me. Ew! That wasn't nipples. You haven't fucked in five days. Six. Well, I got... You sucked me off yesterday, right? Yeah, I sucked them off. I'm kind of happy. What the heck? What the heck? I'm doing well over here. What the hell? But you said we couldn't because... No, I'm on my period. I was just feeling gross. I'm feeling congested. I have this cough and I always coughed. You look great. What are you talking about? Cough? I don't care if you're coughing. It tightens things up. Oh my God. Ew! I just coughed. I'm like, fuck. Keep coughing, baby. See? I gotta make her laugh over having sex. No. Ew. Oh, honey. Please cough. Please cough so I can cough. It feels good on my cock. God. That's weird. Muppets during sex? No, that is gross. At funlove.com, it doesn't matter what type of relationship you're in. Who cares?

We did Boston together. It was nice. We drank a lot in Boston. After the specials, I had not drank for so long. We got fucking twisted in Boston. I haven't recovered yet. I'm still a shade of a human being. But I had so much fun. It was so nice. It was so fun. The oysters were so good. We had a really fun night with my sister and her husband. Had a great time. Jess and Alex. We had a really fun night with those guys. Yeah, they're so much fun. That was great. Yeah, it was her birthday. To hang with them a little bit. With everybody, so many people came down. Some family came down. Yeah, your family, Joe, tried to fuck every single girl that I brought. Anything that moved. Taught them well. Joe was so funny. His brother Joe came. Very sweet. Wow, really. Taught them well. It took a minute on that one. Yeah, because I was ignoring it. I was going to talk over it. Then it pissed me off, so I had to stop. Uh-oh, she's angry again, folks. Uh-oh. Wow. Uh-oh is right. And he also started big feet in the live last night. He was like, no, like those big fucking honkers. I was like, jeez. No, that's not. They are big. I'm self-conscious. You are? Are you Chinese buying them? Yes. I can't make a little stupid comment these days. You can't. No. The ones with the feet are off-limit. What else is off-limits? Me not being hilarious is off-limits. Yes, not being hilarious is obvious. What else? People keep saying we look like siblings and I'm getting pissed off. Last night on the live, I asked, I'm like, I gotta stop. Why does that piss you off? It is weird, but I don't get it. We don't look alike at all. That's why. Do people not have eyes? Someone said it's the same mouth and jaw. Someone also has the same nose insulting to him to say that we have the same nose. That's actually offensive. Let's look straight ahead and then we'll see. Do we look like siblings? Yes or no. And, uh... We don't at all. I'm looking like I can see us. Should we take a test? Hey, 23 meters got sued. Apparently, something happened or they're getting sued. All the info leaked. They had like a breach. Well, I think they've been doing that for a while and also aren't they going under and all of the info, they're selling it to another company? Yeah, that's what it is. Oh yeah, I mean that's... Ta ta if you thought you... Also, who cares? I don't get worried when there's a breach. Who is coming after you? What info am I getting? Like, oh, I'm part Dutch. I already knew that. Yeah, what the hell. Now I know what percentage, supposedly? See, that's the thing. You have no Bulgarian in you. And I'll tell you what, I have no Irish in me. I'm Bulgarian, I'm Greek, I got a whisper Jew in me. I don't know what to tell you. But where are the Bulgarians coming from? Like, you've got a Slavic thing happening? Like, what's happening with the Bulgarians? They're over, this is Bulgaria. Okay. That's where they are. But don't you have like a little percentage of whatever's happening over in Turkey? Because you're near kind of where everybody was really mixed. There's Greek in my family. There's Greek. My baba was born in Greece, so I got Greek. I got a Greek family. Okay. I heard my dad was Greek, so I'm Greek and Bulgarian as a combo. Okay. So the closest we might be is I've got the German-Dutch thing. That's on the same continent. They're close. There might have been some leakage over there. Some leakage. Someone might have spilled a sperm on a dress. Somebody might have pulled an old Bulgarian sheath condom, an old goat condom. Oh yeah, wearing one of those nice hats, one of those things that I really want you to wear when we get married. That is very... Yeah. I need the goats, and I need the outfit with the red and white. It is nice. I do look in red. You look great. With your eyes, you've got great eyes. Thank you. I have great... Everything else is disgusting. No, look at those big beautiful eyes. Those eyeballs. Big beautiful eyes. Yeah, look at those. Look at those. Look at those chestnuts. Chestnuts, roasted all over. Should we sing... Should we do an album where we sing Christmas albums? Lipping out your toes. Yeah, what ones would we sing now? What do you all sing? Any Bulgarians? We don't... Do you think my family sings together? Your family actually sings... Joy to the world. Do you know that one? That's why my mom's named Joy. From that song? My mom was born December 22nd, and my grandma said the second my mom popped out, that song came on and it seemed to Joy. I don't know. Well, we've got to get her singing on that one. It's a cute story. We'll get her on that one. You think my mom can sing? Even better. She sings worse than me, and it's crazy. I'm not saying this album's going to be good. This is not going to be like a... The Tollams and Dunn. The Tollams Family Christmas album. Hosted by Jefferson McDonald. It's just you going, all right, guys, can you try... No, my sister can actually sing. But nobody else in family can. Oh, she can. Because your whole family's musical. Everyone can sing in your family. Yes, yeah, pretty musical family. Yeah, it's crazy. Mm-hmm. My dad just bought my niece, my sweet little niece Penelope, who's a cute baby of the entire planet, but you're never going to see her because I don't want you fucking pig perverts looking at her and putting her in a dark one. Yeah, sorry, pervs. Sorry, you sick fuckers. She's so fucking cute. I... He bought her a little guitar. He's going to give her guitar lessons. I took piano lessons, by the way. Wow. My grandma got me piano lessons. You did, and what happened with that? I'm stupid. I can't figure things out like that. Didn't pick it up. We were sort of picking up the theme to the news radio. We've been playing that. You were getting good at that. You've got to teach me something good. You've got to teach... And I was teaching you the theme to Law & Order. You were picking that up. That, we've got to get back into that, because that I want to do. We were doing pretty good at that. That I want to do. Yeah, but we need to spend more time at home. The problem is, we've been on the road too much. Like, this is what we do for fun. That's what we were doing for fun. We would eat and play themes, and then I would teach it to you. It was nice. And then Susan was there dancing around. Yes. I was going to bring Susan today, but we have a meeting after this. We have a lot of stuff. We're very busy. It's very... We're going to buy a lens today, actually. We have to go to Best Buy. Oh my goodness. Because we're going to start filming more sketch stuff. I love Best Buy though. You do love Best Buy. We're going to do a Creepy Girl Best Buy. We are? We're going to do that? We're going to do that. Okay. We'll pump it out. Oh yeah, yeah. You'll be manipulating some cables. Oh, I'll be sucking off two cables. Some filming equipment there. Finding the speakers. Are these lenses capture or anything? We just did the Creepy Girl on Spirit Halloween and I'll tell you what, no one in that store gave a shit what we did. No one cares. No one ever cares. We were like, I can't believe they filmed this in public. Who the fuck's looking at us? No one. No one looks at shit all we do. No one. It's absurd. And we're relatively respectful. We wait till people are out of the way. I don't want people in the shot. I hate that. I'm not trying to get people in. Drawing attention to ourselves. We're not being overly obnoxious. No, no, no. I make sure I don't want people in and we're not messing anything up. No. I'm putting things back. Yeah, I'm putting them on my face. I'm putting on the Batman thing and I'm walking around in it for a bit, but I'm taking it off. Someone also commented how gross that is and that actually made me sick. I never thought about that. Trying on a public mask. Yeah. Sick. If my dad had been there, he would have said something about it right after he told you not to blow your nose at the table. It's like taking a dump. It is like taking a dump. It's like something from your body. It's not like taking a dump. It's your fucking anus shitting. It's a little bit like, yeah, but these are like two anuses. Okay. Whereas that's one. So it's kind of like, it's just different color. It's much different. There's no smell. Scentless. Yeah. If you're mucus from your nose smells. Yeah. If you're mucus from your nose smells. And also, I don't do the look. A lot of people look. Yeah. Then you got other issues. Something's wrong. What's going on? Smelly mucus over here. Let's get to your issues. What time are we out here? What the hell? We really talk a lot. Jeez. My issues? Well, I was out there. Because you always make notes, yes. Oh my gosh. I was talking to Michael and Joseph out there. Okay. They were cracking me up. There's some crazy stuff going on on the farm. A lot of weird anus stuff. I know, and shitting and that kind of thing. I was thinking about that. When would it die? Well, I mean, just the typical anus stuff, you know? I don't know. I don't know. You know? Well, there's a couple things. I guess we could start with, what we were talking about when we were young and we, of course, we didn't have doctors. We couldn't go. We weren't like you nice Canadians where you go up and you've got this free healthcare. Is it because you're home schooled? Your dad didn't believe in the doctors either? No, we just couldn't afford it to go to the hospital. Oh, right. So it's just, he was the doctor, doctor dad. Doctor dad. And, uh... Doctor dad. Let me tell you. It's fine. Go rub some salve on it. Well, it was similar to that. It would usually be something like that. Yeah. And, um, but Michael was telling me, oh my gosh. He was... Michael's his second brother. He's my second brother. Yes. Jefferson, Michael, Patrick, Rebecca, Joseph, Matthew, Philip, Paul, and James. So that's the list of the siblings. And Michael, he was next to me. And the Lord. And the Lord. And the Lord. Yeah. Yeah. He's in there too. Yeah. He's also invited to our dinner table. All those names are very... Aren't they all? Some of you sinners should do as well. Wow. Yeah. What the heck? Just throwing that in there. Jeez. You know, watch a lot of those exorcist ones, you know. Creepy stuff. It apparently was making it so hard to shit that it wouldn't come out at all. It can't... I guess it was just like rounded off. So he was saying that he would have to go in and help shape the shit inside his stomach with his hands. But he said he could do it because he's a very strong lad and he's got hands. I mean, these are like sausage fingers. These hands can get in there and dig things around. And so he would shape... Stop turning me on. Of course, you sick, sick fuck. But yeah, no, this will turn you on. He would shape it and try to mush it to the end of the shit to be kind of like a... Pointed? A pointed, like a top hat. No, like a... What's a cone hat? A party hat? Like a cone head. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so he was turning it from a Joe head to a cone head. Or like a... Yeah, a Joe Rogan head to a cone head. And that way he could shit it out. Yeah. That's fucked. Yeah. But apparently, I'm wondering how you... Without going inside, because when I was young, I used to have to pencil it out because I was so... Because mostly we were just eating like... What? Wait, sorry? What do you mean pencil it out? You know when you have to like shove something in there to like loosen it up? No, I actually don't know. No, I actually have no fucking clue what you're talking about. You've never penciled out a shit before? You put an HB pencil in your asshole and penciled out a shit. For sure. Jefferson. Well, because you can't use your finger because that's... Jefferson. That's weird. Are you serious? If you're a pencil you find doesn't work, then you have to use your finger. I mean, you gotta get this shit out. Stop. We're not gonna go to the doctor. What am I gonna tell my dad to stick his gnarly big finger in there? No. Because he would. Big fingers in this family. He would. You're telling me... He probably had some dirt on me. You're telling me right now that your shits would be so hard to come out of your ass. Yes. You would by yourself, you would take a pencil. Sharpened? No, you'd use like the other end of the pencil with the eraser. The eraser. The eraser end. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And what would you do? I don't understand what you're poking your poop. I don't... What are you doing in there? You're just trying to poke it around, like, kinda like, mush it up a little so that it'll come out, cause it's rock hard in there. You ever just shit granite? Yeah. You're saying this as if anybody else listening right now has shoved a pencil in their ass. There's no way! I think I did that once, it didn't work, and then I had to like find some other methods, but I thought penciling it out was a phrase. Penciling it out is not a phrase. Penciling it out... You never penciled it out, babe? And then you're using that pencil after? Well... You go to erase something and you're like, oh no, it's made more of a smear. Shit, me, me, me, me, me. Shit, it's poopy art. Oh my god. It's poopy brush. No, you just wash it off. I wonder if you're having a white, this is crazy. Shut up a pencil in your ass. I'm not at that point, but it's surprising, yeah, that my asshole didn't tear. Well, it probably was torn until I was 12. There was so much blood. Oh my god! Yeah, but you know... I'm taking you to a doctor on the way home. This is crazy. No, they're much better now. I don't have to pencil it out now. I mean... No, I mean you sprayed the toilet today though. Oh, I don't even remember. Well, I was hungover. Yeah, I sprayed the full bowl. I had a full bowl spray that you couldn't see any porcelain. And I don't know where... This was, I think, at an airport. I don't know where it was. I don't know where it was. Okay, I have to bring this up because I can't believe he does this. I need to know if other people do this, especially guys. I know... So you love... I'm actually asking to buy you for Christmas. I'm gonna buy you a travel bidet. Jefferson loves to wash his ass. That's a thing? Yes, I'm getting one for you. Oh, but how does that work? No, you need one. Because I think you just fill it up with water before you go in the bathroom. Jefferson will be at an airport. Take a shit. Get toilet paper. Wipe his butt a bit. Take toilet paper. Go to the sink. Get water. Go back into the stall with that wet piece of toilet paper and clean his ass. But now I'm starting to do it before I go in for this shit. If I remember that, then I know I'm in good shape. So I'll go in. Aaron, have you ever done this? This is crazy in public. So men are... People watching you... I don't want to sit on a plane for 10 hours with shit ass. No. I mean, no. That sucks. They go to the wheelchair stall because they have a sink in there. Well, yeah. If that's ideal. Yes. Or go to the family one, then I'm set. Yes. I waddle around with my pants around my ankles. Your nankles? My nankles. Your pants around your nankles. And water up my ass. Then I'm good. Okay. Then I'm thrilled. I just can't believe you do this in public. Well, I sneak it in, obviously. I make it look, you know, not suspicious. Like you go, oh, I forgot something in the bathroom. And then you walk back in. I don't walk out with my pants down. I'm like, oh, like, what am I doing here? No, I realize you put the back up. Yeah, I'm subtle. I'm like just sneaky. I come back and I'm like, oh, I forgot there's more shit. Like in my head, I'm doing some method acting that makes it seem like if there's someone else there, I'd be like, wait, he's washing his hands, but he's going back to the stall suspicious. So in my head, I have to do a little acting and be like, oh, oh, what's that I forgot in there? Okay. And then I can like wipe up whatever. All right. I kind of got to moisten it up in there because you, you know. You do have to moisten it up. I do, but there is a handheld one going on right now because we have the tushy, you love the tushy, but my hemorrhoid is so bad at it now that I can't even use the tushy because the pressure hurts my ass. It hurts your ass, but it's not an outie hemorrhoid. Yeah, but it's an innie, but it's just, you just. It's innie, but my ass is so swollen right now. My ass is so fucked up. My gosh. So no anal for me ever. You're never. I told him today, I'm like, if you want anal, find another asshole because it ain't. What other asshole would I be banging in the ass? None. None. Obviously, there's no option for you here. There's no option. You're never doing anal. That's it. I wasn't really interested, but you kept harping on it. You're like, you're gonna fuck me in the ass. And I was like, well, I was starting to come around to it. And then what happened? We just ate so many chicken wings that now we're. I don't even eat chicken wings. We're getting duffs when we go to Toronto. I love duffs. No, I can't. They're so fatty. Exactly. Duffs Famous Wings in Toronto where I worked for like seven years. We can just split eight and something like that. I'll tell you what. That's when you know a restaurant is clean. I go back there every time I go home. It was squeaky clean. The chicken was so fucking fresh. Never frozen. Huge shout out to fucking Duffs Famous Wings. Love the guys who work there. Very supportive. They got annoyed of me a lot because I would take off so much fucking time for stand up, but they're so sweet. Wow. Lauren, Richard and Steven, if you're listening, they're not listening to my podcast. What if they were? They were. Well, Duffs, you know, it originated in Buffalo, right? I know. Where my favorite team resides. Buffalo Bills. I'm a Bills fan now. I'm learning Josh Allen. Look at him throwing that spiral. She's learning a lot about football, as you can see. Hey, first and ten. First and ten. First and ten. First and ten. We love a first and ten. We do love Josh Allen. Love the Bills. Love the Bills. Love the Bills. Could I name another player right now? Absolutely not. Coleman? Coleman was doing good yesterday. That's right. Yeah, look at this. Look at me. Number... Zero. That's right. Lucky from FSU. He gave me no hands. My other alma mater. And the other guy... Oh, yes. There you go. And then the other guy who got the first interception yesterday, his first interception of all time... Austin Johnson. Austin Johnson. Austin Johnson. Honestly, he's never got an interception. He doesn't typically get the first... No, that's what he said, but that's what they said. This is his first one ever. But if you're just throwing that out there, like, then people are gonna be very impressed. I really need to. If you lead with that, he'd be like Austin Johnson with that... I want you to take me to a tailgate so bad. I want to go tailgate with you, your uncle. I think I'm getting his name. I know we have Taron Johnson is... Yeah. But Austin Johnson, yeah. I want to go to a game. Me, you, and... Me, you. Oh, my God. Shooter and my dad to a fucking Bills game would be so funny. It would be funny. It would be good. I mean, last time I went with Shooter, I still got kicked out of the box. You're a fucking pervert, you pig. I don't think I was. I was just drinking it up. You were flirting. I may have flirted a little bit, you know. I was young. I was horny. I was like Joe, young and foolish. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, we didn't tell him what Joe did. So Joe came to the special. Joe came to the special. And then he was trying to hook up my one friend. Thanks for coming, Joe. Thanks for coming, Joe. Joe was on one of my friends, Sam. And then it didn't happen, but she still let him sleep on the floor in the hotel room. But Joe was so sweet. He went out and got a breakfast sandwich the next day. He, and he wanted to take us out for sandwiches the next day. He was very nice. We were dead. We were dead. No, we were dead the next day. Sorry, Joe. We wanted to come out, but... That next morning, my body, I can't believe... It is insane the way the body works, how I was so stressed for so... That's one thing with the hemorrhoids too. I was so stressed for so long. The second the special was done, my body went... And then I got like sick and my ass got sick. And now I'm just like, I've been to this cough and it's just a whole thing now. I'm always sick. You are sick. People always ask why I do self-infection. I'm always ill. My hives were so bad, it was crazy. You had a good streak there. I had a good streak, yeah. You had a good three month streak because you typically get sick once a month and I gotta take care of you. Yeah. The only thing I haven't been able to take care of is this bleeding, sliced up asshole that you've got right now. So that's been tricky. Well I'm getting fingered tomorrow morning. Fingered tomorrow morning. Not by me. Not by you. You can't go in there. I can't finger your ass these days. No. Here's the problem. Also, when they finger it, I got a woman and I like to make sure she's of Asian descent. Because very small hands. I don't even know what I'd be doing in there. I'd be like just making you cry. You'd be angry at me. Like what am I doing? I mean, but typically if we had an issue like this back in my day on the farm, you'd stick a pencil in my ass. No, it would be my dad figuring it out. So what else happened? We gotta, what the heck, we talk so much, the hell, we'll end soon. Oh, well Joe's telling me also that, I mean, we all had psoriasis, you know. Okay. Yeah, but no, and it got so bad. Not now. I mean, I didn't know what psoriasis was. Whenever I had something growing on me, I would just like rip it off. But Joe had it so bad, that's why his head was buzzed until he was 12, because it was just, he had all of the psoriasis, and of course no one was going to get any medication, you know, we weren't going to the hospital or anything like that. But my dad would just cut it off with a knife. It'd be so thick, it'd probably be like half an inch thick, and he would just slice it off. And Joe said, oh my God. He said he just thought it was normal for dad to just be cutting skin off of him and for him to be bleeding all of the time. Oh my God. What the heck, Joe? Now I feel bad he's having it on the floor. So they'd be watching a movie, and dad would just be slicing and dicing all the kids. Oh my God. I love the way you laugh at these traumatizing things. But you didn't grow up like this? No. Just like getting psoriasis cut off of him? We had no pencils in our ass, we had no knives. We had very good hospital. We would go to the hospital a lot. Bragging. I am bragging, because it's the one thing fucking Canada has. Yeah. Well, we had a nurse down the street, she would come over for like really special cases where dad couldn't figure it out. Dad couldn't cut it off? Dad couldn't cut it off. Dad couldn't cut it off. Yeah, that was his go-to. If he could cut it off, he's cutting it off. He also, Joe, we would eat so much that we were just putting, you know, dad out of house and home. The way we were eating, it was insane. So at one point, dad took Joe out to the fields where all this sorghum was growing. You know what sorghum grows. It's related to corn. It's sort of a grain. Okay. And it's sort of related to sugar cane. So you can sort of suck on it. Okay. And dad told Joe, listen, son, if you're out here, you could just eat as many of these plants as you want. You don't have to eat as much of the inside food. So Joe is out there sucking back sorghum. Sorghum. Disgusting. Was it just dry? I mean, if you get it at the right time, then it's like can be a little sweet, right? Because there's some sweetness to it. Give him a sauce for the sorghum. The sorghum. But the thing is you can't let your animals out because at a certain point, once the sorghum turns, if the animals go out there and eat it, they will die. The gases will bloat them up and you got to like spike their stomach and release the air. Oh my God. I don't think it's good for humans either. I think that'll mess you up pretty good. So you got to stay away from the sorghum. But I just think it's funny that dad was trying to make us eat sorghum because we were eating too much of the inside food. That's so fucked up. Dave, you're so traumatized. No, I think I was sort of finding food other places. Because I was running the farmer's market so I would eat like a bunch of burritos down there. So I was burritoed up. So I'd have that as a base. But Michael told them that because Michael apparently broke his back when he was seven. Never went to the hospital. Fell out of the barn into a pile of mud and rocks. You know, and you haven't seen the old barn but it was pretty high up. I did dry it. We did dry it. And you've seen that old barn back there. So he fell out and his little peanut body broke in half. And Bob came out, found him and he was like, how are you doing? He was trying to tell me the sounds he was making. Bizarre. They brought him in. They didn't take him to the hospital. But he was just always wondering why he had a hunch for the next 10 years. Full broken back. This is fucked up. Well, Michael, did he break his ankle and then he had to like... But he healed. He doesn't have that hump anymore. Well, the ankle was later. He broke that in 12 places. But even that, he doesn't walk like the penguin anymore. He's healed. And this is because, you know, of all the spaghetti that he had, but we didn't have sauce on the spaghetti, but just the spaghetti. Well, we couldn't afford the sauce. So we just ate the spaghetti. Put some sorghum on it. Yeah. You sprinkle some sorghum. Sorghum? Sorghum spaghetti again. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Disgusting. Yeah, yeah. You could maybe do that. Yeah. We have to go. We're wrapped up in time here. We have to go. This is so fast. This is fast. I only have 10 other things, but... Obviously, you're going to be back. You're the number one listening of the episode. We'll talk about beaver fever later. For fuck's sakes. You always leave them wanting more. Yeah, yeah.
