 today we're actually going to be showing you uh putting up a temporary fence basically on this back side of our property if you know we call it the sheep field but it's growing too good of grass just for the sheep because the sheep cannot catch up so we're going to be building a poly wire fence basically we're a gallagher affiliate so you'll see a gallagher link to all the things that we have here such as the poly wire and things like that but we're going to run this fence we're going to show you what we're using and pretty much you can keep animals in with this fencing right now everything is expensive so when we talk about barbed wire we just redid some sections of barbed wire in in perimeter fencing the material was astronomical it was about two times what it was just last year this is an easy surefire way to make paddocks and it's so easy and so economical to do this way now we do have permanent fencing and going around our property the only reason we did that is just so we could keep certain people certain things out not really cows then we use simple fencing all the way throughout our property not only for our cattle but for our sheep for our pigs all of them are using some kind of net wire or temporary fencing wire we're going to be using just basically a poly wire today that's actually what we're doing to keep in the cattle that's all you need one or two strand we use two strand a lot of people use one ours tend to do better with two especially when it comes to bulls and yearlings so we're going to be running two strands today she's going to be using uh two gallagher gate hooks and handles basically to be able to open and close the poly wire easily gallagher turbo wire we really like it just use the poly tape and still have a bunch of poly tape areas but the wire seems to do really well and that's why we tend to run two strands because it it tends to be seen better when you're not using poly tape to run two strands for the cattle we also have some ceramic post hooks basically where we can go into the wood post and that way that whole holds stability as we uh kind of run this fence fiberglass temporary fencing stakes they're they're the four foot you can buy these anywhere we tend to get ours either at a co-op or you can buy them from gallagher you can get them at off tractor supply i mean you really can get them anywhere they do phenomenally well there's nothing wrong with using the pigtails but the pigtails are usually for single strand being that we're using double strand we need something that's got another hook on it we like the fiberglass better than the straight plastic they're about the same price but the plastic to me after it's been in the weather a lot and we leave our fencing up even though they're temporary we still leave a lot of our you know rods in the ground they tend to break and get brittle after a while compared to the fiberglass now these will tear up too don't i mean you're not keeping these for years and years and years and years but the ones we've had for you know five to seven years since we've been on this property we've probably gotten rid of five or ten the plastic ones after two or three years i just feel like they get a little bit more brittle especially if they're in the sun a lot before we run fence we actually have to put the actual temporary fencing pieces up it literally will take about five minutes to actually get these in the ground it's so easy and it makes it where i'm literally moving cows here and i made this decision this morning said okay you know we need to get cows on this fresh beautiful bahia grass that's growing because our sheep are still if you remember by our soybeans and corn and they're clearing cleaning that area up instead of mowing it so they're utilizing that grass so this grass needs to be utilized too this will help those new fields rest and get some height on them to where they'll reseed their self to where that pasture will start looking better then 10-15 minutes you can have a whole field of ran that quick so i want to talk about this rod just for a second we put these rods about 30 foot apart about 10 yards or so apart not exact measurement just going off my feet a few things if you're teaching an animal about this fence i would get it tighter i'd maybe go you know instead of going 10 yards maybe five yards a piece tighten it up make sure your net your line is tight but also don't give them any kind of dip extra space to test it you want to make it look like it is a true hard fence that hurts them now say you're putting it up only for a day say you just you're rotating almost like a greg judy style very regenerative mob graze you've got you know 40 head coming in on an acre and you're going to be moving them just for the day i would not put them this close 10 yards apart i would put them close probably 30 or 40 yards apart all you want to do at that point is have a hanging temporary fence on these and then that way it gives you it's less work that you have to do because there's no point putting all this rods up for you know a half a day or a whole day we put it up because they're going to be here in about two or three days we want it a little bit stronger plus we have calves like we talked about if i have calves i want to put two strands one low if i have just cows one strand will be sufficient uh if you have a bull a bull will test this not because a bull wants to test it typically if you have say you have a cow in heat or you have a heifer in heat that he can smell or he there's another bull over there he's trying to uh you know to uh to show his dominance to he may test this fence too so we tend to make it a little bit tighter a little bit stronger if we've got calves or bulls in here however our calves are pretty used to this and also they're with their mamas so i'm not worried about it we're gonna put them 30 yards i'll be 30 foot apart 10 yards apart and then that way it makes it easy for me to set up but back to this on these that is a foot positioner to where you can drive it in the ground with your foot on these rods now these are fiber glass but the little pedal here in the foot spot is just plastic i've broken many of them going into hard ground if you're in gravel or you're in a harder ground i would say get you a little mallet little you know just a simple rubber mallet that'll help drive these a little bit better because if you're fully aware if you're fully relying on that it's not going to get you in hard ground and you're going to break them then you're going to get mad that you spent four or five bucks on this thing and all sudden it broke and you didn't get to try it so no waste policy this is all the extra lettuce that we're not taking the seed we gave potatoes to the chickens yesterday so the pigs get the lettuce and then aiden's also got our scrap bucket so we have no food waste at all if we don't eat it and we grow it and then we still can't eat it it's either going to chickens or pigs we literally have a zero food waste here and it guess what if it's pork or bones where we don't want our pigs to eat it we give it to our dog so it's truly we have no food waste here at the max so before we actually run our fence we have to put our ceramic fence holders on the reason we buy these these go into the wood post when you're running temporary fencing especially if you're making curves and corners the little fiberglass rides will not keep it tight so what we'll do is either put a t-post up if we have to make a corner but if we have these wood posts are in the ground we're going to use them and that helps keep everything tight as we pull it tighter it keeps everything snug tight and where if a cow does want to test it with their nose because that's typically what they're going to do is touch it with their nose to it it's going to keep it tight enough to where when they put it on there it's going to sense and within two three seconds it's going to pop them hard another thing to be conscious about when it comes to temporary fencing is you need to make sure that if you can run a continuous strand or as less connectors as you have to put in there where you're binding and crimping and tying i don't care what anybody says that does hurt your charge a little bit so if you can keep one continuous run going that makes it better so how do we do that when it comes to running you know two or three pieces a a fence so we're going from basically where the driveway comes in we're going to circle this post and make our way all the way behind here so at the ending point where your fence needs to end not start not where your gates are going to be so where you're actually putting them together and running them through and making two fences instead of one so you need to go to that side so not the gate that you start so most people would say let's start this right at the very front with one of the gates holding it on there you can't do that because guess what you've got to go through ceramic fence holders and there's no way to put it in there so for instance i'm going to show you what i mean so with these you have clips you can open it up and it can slide right through there just like that but with ceramics there's no way to get into there like that so what we have to do is we will start going through the bottom first so we will run this in through the bottom back to the top now we're going to run the top first so the top will be pulling and it will be going all the way back down to where this will be the fence connector this will be where we tie our gate to but if we tied it off now we're not running through here and if we started way down there then basically we could not keep it one continuous run because this could not fit through there so just a hint think about your fencing actually before you start running i know that sounds stupid and i know you say hey you can crimp it you can tie it and i have but it does do better it it carries more jewels it has more punching power for these animals especially if you're training them to run one continuous piece if at all possible or if you have to mend it maybe one mend verse having to mend it so many times just by not thinking the plan out so what i'm saying is think the plan out leave the spool right here and actually have everything now this is what we typically do again on a big run it's very important to have something there if you don't have an actual spool holder what we'll do is we'll put a grounding rod right in the ground and then put the spool on it so that way it won't tangle up especially when you talk about poly tape poly wire is not as bad so i'll just lay it on the ground plus it's not a long long long run run it through the bottom first then to the top and then we're going to pull this all the way through starting it not tight right now you're not going to get it tight until you secure the bottom too we're going to pull it remember this top strand is 42 inches and then from the 42 inch one we'll drop down two more and you're going to put it around 16 to 18 inches just depending on how far you got the the rod in the ground pull this through once you get to the end you're going to tie it off there's your tightness there and then when you start walking back and putting the second in you're actually going to hold the roll walking it all the way keeping it tight we got to the last fiberglass post so then once we came through it we went on put the gate hanger on there i always leave extra poly wire i know people say oh well then it could touch you and electrocute you well i mean if you're smart and you're watching it it won't get you but always leave this because you never know when you may need a little extra slack uh on any piece you see it's tight but not as tight as i want it but the first strand is not running off tightness the tightness is going to come when you run the second strand now again we're running two strands so the first one's 42 inches if we were running just one strand i may not go that high especially because your calves can walk under it with no issue so i'd probably drop it to like a 36 inch probably i don't run a lot of single strand because it's just as easy to run two strands and those two strands give you a little bit more security when it comes to difficult animals i've had somebody message me and you remember peaty we just got processed is in freezer camp now but when people call they say well that ain't gonna keep my cow in well if you got a cow that's crazy enough to jump through barbed wire or jump over fence or to break through wire or bust wire or go through poly tape or go through poly net which pd did and i had another cow at one time and the old videos of the max uh sizzle you that might just be telling you you don't need that animal farm anyway because they they shouldn't be that difficult make sure you have smarter animals and docile animals now if you're dealing with more difficult animals i would probably do that make sure they're in perimeter fencing try them out so you can make a real tight paddock in perimeter fencing like 10 to 15 like a little corral form put them feed put them water so that way they don't have to get out for any reason let them test it first before you start putting them in big paddocks where they chance getting out because livestock's an investment the last thing you want to do is lose your investment you know this is not this is not fail safe i've caught animals that's gotten out of full fencing i've caught animals that's gotten out of one strand and i've got animals that will literally graze like my dairy cow will graze out here with no fencing because she don't know any better so when i when we talk about this nothing's surefire nothing is but this is the easiest way to make sure you're taking care of your animal but doing in the most efficient way of rotational grazing you're not having to put a lot of cross fencing you know barbed wire in which if you have the money and the means to put a ton of barbed wire in of course i mean it's great it'll hold a cow a whole lot better than temporary fencing but that's just it this is called temporary fencing the whole purpose is to be able to move it when you need to you can't move that barbed wire i always have a lot of naysayers oh i can't have no cows in that well it's because you might have crazy cows uh if your cows are not used to rotating and being part of this movement of true heavy mob grazing getting the fresh grass moving the next day moving the next you've got to train them so this is how you train them by putting them in something that may have some perimeter fencing keep it tight also maybe put them tighter than 10 yards a piece put them five yards a piece like we talked about originally and that way they're going to learn to do better second wire is on remember the top needs to be tight but your bottom more than anything needs to be tight when it comes to the fencing because that's the one that especially your calves or younger heifers are going to try first is a calf especially is going to put their nose down like they're trying to eat below the wire and then it'll graze their face so cows are back on this fresh grass we've got the grounding rod in now we have gallagher patrick american farmworks uh zariba premier one we have so many different chargers because we run about 10 to 15 solar chargers on average in a week don't try to buy um the ones from the co-ops that are cheaper or track supply no offense to american farmworks or zariba they don't hold up their charge is good their jewels are good they do good for a while but they cannot hold up with weather like uh the gallagher's or the premier ones my favorite even though i'm not of course i'm not affiliated with america with a premier one or anything like that i love gallagher fencing but i actually like the charger of premier one the teleshock 60 is probably my favorite for all animals we've got it hooked to the bottom so that way we know it's going to hit harder on that one because it's got to travel a long way to get up to the top the top is good there's nothing wrong with it but we don't need it really charging the top as much as we need the hot bottom because that's where the cows are grazing where their noses are that's where the calf is going to try and get nosy and find out what it is they're eating this grass they'll be here for two days the good thing is it only took me about 15 to 20 minutes to actually set the fence up so it doesn't feel bad when you turn around have to move it all over here to the other side because it wasn't that much work how you train your cows all about making sure when you set your fence up you've got it hot you do not want them being around any string like this without it being on if they ever test it and it's not on so you just forget to turn it on it's gonna be hard to break them from that because a cow is plenty big enough to walk straight through that and really not feel it on their skin you want to feel it on their nose on their head on their legs where they can feel it and know it's there so don't don't ever let your fence go without being a charger on it or let it get too weak or it's not popping them they're gonna walk through it every time uh other than that have fun
