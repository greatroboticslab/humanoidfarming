 So Paul, what about the grass species in the greens? How does that affect golf? Well it will affect the playability of the greens and the different grasses within a green whether it be bent grass, fescue. Golfers might know the name Porannua, annual meadow grass, common in the UK. But what we're trying to do is create a blend, a uniform blend of grasses. Porannua will have its problems, annual meadow grass, with seed heads in the spring. Golfers might see that it can produce seed heads at other times of the year as well. We might want to do a bit of work on the texture of some of the quarter grasses, find them out at the right time. But what we're trying to create is a blend. There's a risk with a monoculture of grass species, it might be more affected by disease. But with the right maintenance practices for the golfer we can create smooth, true, uniform greens with a blend which is more tolerant of heat stress conditions, drought and other issues. So grass species is important.
