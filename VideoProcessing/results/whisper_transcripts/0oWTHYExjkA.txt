 Let me break down my composting system for you. I've tried a bunch and so far this is my favorite. Some people use tumblers or bins. Some people create an open pile and cover it with a tarp. I like the cylinder compost system because it's simple and anyone can do it. The best part of this system for me is that it's cheap, easy, and doesn't require me building a permanent structure so it gives me flexibility. Use a roll of wire mesh or fencing to form a 3 foot wide cylinder, securing the ends together. Place it in a well-drained area away from buildings or trees for fire safety. Layer carbon rich material like dead leaves or straw with nitrogen rich material like vegetable scraps or chicken manure. I call this compost lasagna and I figured out a super easy way to mix it. I use a flower bulb auger attached to a power drill for aeration once a week. And then I just water the pile from the top. Regular turning speeds up decomposition, producing rich, dark compost in just a few months. When a pile's done, just pop it open and start over. I needed a system that was dummy proof for no particular reason. Punch Half If youン Win Theیک
