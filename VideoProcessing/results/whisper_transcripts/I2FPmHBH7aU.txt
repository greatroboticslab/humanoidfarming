 What is the OECD? At the OECD we think that innovation, sustainability and resilience are the three key words when it comes to the future of agriculture and also when it comes to developing further the CAP system. So there's a lot of potential when it comes to digital technologies and when it comes to sustainability more evidence base is needed in order to see which are the best practices and the best ways how agriculture can be a solution in tackling the climate change.
