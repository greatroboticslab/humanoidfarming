 So, you wanna start farming broiler chickens or leia chickens, but you wanna grow them from day old chicks. You don't know the equipment you need to buy, you're the right channel. So in today's video, I wanna discuss the equipment that you need to buy to grow your broilers or pin your leia chicken from day one old. So farmers, the first thing you're gonna buy or the first equipment to buy is this light. It helps to provide heat. It's called heat lamp. So it helps you in the protein stage to heat up the environment where your chickens are or to provide heat for your chickens. And per 100 baits, you buy one light during summertime. And during winter time, you buy two light per 100 baits. So another equipment you can buy is this feeder over here. So this is the feeder that I normally use. I only use this feeder because I can use it from day one until day 42. So what I do is that as my chicken grow, I also put bricks under it to lift it up so that my chicken can eat properly. So from day one until day 42, I'm using only this feeder. I don't buy those other feeders, the big jumbo feeders. But if you're lazy to come offently on your house when she can grow to put more feed, you can use or buy the bigger one because with the bigger one, you don't need to come into the house to put more feed many times. Also you can buy two feeders per 100 chicks. That's what I recommend to you. So this is the big feeder that I was talking about. And there's something interesting about these new big feeders. They also made legs because they are aware that we don't like hanging these feeders with the rope. Because when the feed starts to be little in the feeder and the chicks start to push it around, it starts dropping feed on the ground. And you find that you're working on a loss, so you're losing more feed on the ground. So they have meat legs for them so that you can adjust and not use the rope. So we don't like using the rope as farmers because you know that using rope, it's wasting your feed. So as your feeders start to drop inside the feeder, the chickens can push it and that feeder can easily split. Is it split or what? Feed on the ground. Yeah. So this is the first drinker. Now you're moving to drinker. Now you're moving to drinker. So this is the first drinker that you're going to buy. It's a 12-liter drinker. And normally used from day 1 until day 14. Then after day 14, you switch the bigger ones because now your chicken will be consuming so much water that you need to put enough water in the feeders. So if you're using this small one, you're going to come to your house like every 18 minutes to put water. So if you switch the bigger ones like this one, now you know that with this 12-liter drinker, you're sorted. You don't need to come back to the house many times. So the 12-liter drinker is 1 per 100 and the small one is 2 per 100. So this is the last equipment you can buy just to transport your chickens, you know. Each grade carry 10 chickens.
