 As many of you who've watched our previous videos know, bales are used to feed livestock in an efficient way. But the process of preparing bales for storage requires some hard work and impressive machinery. Welcome back to another video from Lord Gizmo. Today we'll be looking at a number of awesome bale handling machines we think you'll enjoy learning about. First up, we have the Balenboy GmbH. It's a bale accumulator and transport system designed explicitly for round bales. The unit has hydraulic valves connected with its wheel. Because of these, the driver can lower the unit to the ground to catch the bales and lift it up again. All of this takes just a few seconds. You can attach the unit to any 55-horsepower tractor, and it can handle six round bales at a time. Next, we have the MarCrest Swing Max. This system lets you use two balers simultaneously with a single tractor. One baler is connected behind the rear of the tractor, and the other with a 36-foot-long boom. The boom arm is hydraulically controlled from the cab to drive the baler. The Swing Max effectively divides your tractor's current PTO power into two to connect the extra baler. This saves labor costs, money, and time. The Big Baler 1290 is the most energy-efficient large square baler in its class. It has three 3-tine packer forks constructed of heavy-duty components that provide durability while keeping up with the high output of the baler. Its high-density crop cutter and packer models are known for productivity and comfort. They generate up to 22% more dense bales than traditional big square balers, substantially improving transport and bale handling efficiency. The Kuhn 4014 is a versatile square and round bale wrapper that is packed with unique features that set it apart from the competition. Its twin-satellite architecture enables rapid, cost-effective, and operator-friendly wrapping. The revolutionary laser-guided auto-load feature automatically identifies loads, wraps, and unloads bales, resulting in a more ergonomic and stress-free working environment. Moreover, its sturdy construction and hydraulic sliding frame offer drive-through operations. This dramatically enhances the wrapper for more effortless bale loading, exceptional stability, and unrivaled visibility of the wrapping operation. relative to this grain of ti- начинает stacker, which can handle almost any kind and size of bale. Its pickup automatically lifts the bale from the ground and rotates it onto its platform. Once the platform is complete, the bales are placed onto the trailer bed. To correct the alienation of oddly-sized bales, the tractor's right-side panel can be adjusted hydraulically. A section of the trailer was utilized to transport all of the grouped bales from the loading platform. A single ejector on the chassis pushes on the middle part of the stack's base, allowing the operator to unload the trailer bed tips vertically. Baleors are typically intended to be mounted on tractors, but the ZR5 is a self-propelled baler, the first of its type. Thanks to its improved suspension system, the operator enjoys a smoother and more comfortable ride. Critical functions of the baling process are automated. For example, when the desired bale size is achieved, the machine will automatically stop, start typing, quarter turn for bale ejection, open and shut the tailgate, and return to where it was in the window. Its integrated quarter-turn technology enables the operator to eject bales to the right, left, or straight back. Its max speed is 30 mph. In short, the ZR5 is nothing short of impressive. Vermeer has unveiled the world's first self-balancing bale mover. It drives autonomously across the field, and using a system of onboard sensors, it detects the bales, picks them up, and transports them to a preset position specified by the owner. It can pick up and transport up to three 5-foot bales. By transporting bales from where they are dumped in the field to the field's edge or a storage facility, this autonomous bale mover will expedite the collecting process and minimize the need for manpower. The Freeman 280 is a 21'6", 12'10", wide, and 10'10", high, self-propelled hay baler. It incorporates a spacious cab, a powerful 99-horsepower John Deere engine, and excellent working visibility. Some of its standard features include the environmentally-friendly, tailless knotter that leaves your field clean of string trimmings, a remote-mounted video camera for viewing the knotters, and an on-the-go moisture sensor. The SP3255 is a self-propelled wagon with a 340-horsepower Cummins Stage V engine. Its pickup unit rapidly lifts the bales off the ground, minimizing debris that is created while they slide about. You can adjust it for 3x3, 3x4, and 4x4 bales, and the spring-loaded bumper adjusts to accommodate a variety of bale lengths. Rolling forks help to secure the bales to the bed and maintain a tight, consistent stack. All the stack operations are controlled through a full-color display and a joystick installed in the cab.
