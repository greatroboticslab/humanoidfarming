 Never water your garden the hard way again. This terracotta is porous, so if we bury it in the garden, as the soil dries out, it's going to pull moisture from the inside of the pot to the outside. The water comes out of tiny holes in the clay and is pulled through the soil by the roots of your thirsty plants. The best part is this means your soil will never become overwatered either. Plus, it eliminates wasted water lost to surface evaporation and encourages plants to develop stronger root systems. You usually only need one pot every two feet or so, and you can DIY it or get a system that refills itself automatically from captured rainwater. Let me know if you want the info so you can add these to your own garden.
