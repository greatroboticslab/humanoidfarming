Oh, sorry! Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Hmm... Okay, well everyone must let Bartolito answer. Understood? Okay, well Bartolito, this feather happens to be the same color as our... and also the same color as your crest. I imagine you know the color of your crest, right? Well, I'm going to give you three options. Orange, yellow, or red. Wait a second. We said that the orange color was the color of the Halloween pumpkin, and the yellow was the color of the sun. So, my crest is red. Yes, Bartolito! Very good, Bartolito! You really did it! So now, what color is my body? That's very easy. It's blue. No! Bartolito! Bartolito!
