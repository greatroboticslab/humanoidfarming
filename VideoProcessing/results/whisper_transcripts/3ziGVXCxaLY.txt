 all right guys hanshani david is my name aka chidav and if you're just coming here i this is an update video of the two-acre planting field that was established four months ago and if you're yet to subscribe to this channel i need to punch on the subscribe button turn on your notification bell and do what you like and video so i'm going to be taking you all into the field and see what the field is like after four months after establishment okay so let's come along let me show you guys quickly why we there are usually disparity in terms of the growth of this plant and and that is why you having you having this guy looking so very tough so there are several factors responsible for it in case you have your your food set up and then you are wondering why is one doing better than one it is it is normal okay all you need to do is you just ensure that every of your food is properly maintained and those ones not doing very well you ensure you increase the level of the nutrient because your soy there's something there's something we refer to as soy variability so not every part of the soy would have equal level of nutrient and and that is the reason for disparity there are several factors that when you cultivate the suckers there are certain suckers that would sprout force before the others and yeah that's the reason why you have all of these disparities but then in general for four months feud four plus months feud is not doing bad it's not doing bad it's really doing well and and this is the reason why i talked about you having the right plant population is usually very key so you can imagine how this whole guys look like and then also the suckering as i when necessary very key um all these are maintenance practices you have to put in place you the sucker you trim the leaves as i went to you and you ensure that weed is really not competing with your field so this is a two by two meter plant spacing that we use there and it is super cool for commercial farms so that is what i recommend that is what i use so these guys are going to be coming here to the sucker okay and then transfer them into places where that needs to be you know properly supplied so that's it that's it guys so basically you need to also reduce the number of leaves you have on the plant so that they can focus more on the epical leaves so that they can develop and grow faster okay and also it enables because of the population it enables air to penetrate easily run the so once these guys come up a bit with the sucker because we only want to have just one one daughter sucker growing alongside the parents the parents the parents so so that's it that's the guys it's really been an amazing time the feud i'm quite impressed yeah i'm quite impressed so so this is what it looks like four months down the line so a whole lot have been you know really put you know for these guys to to look this awesome so that's it that is it on on the update here of this very feud i hope you all are doing great like i told you while we're sitting here i told you these guys are very awesome guys and then they've been quite dedicated to the job and really making sure that the planting feud is really really doing well stay glued and make sure you do agriculture right peace guys we should be having our first set of harvest after nine months definitely we are really going to meet that target peace guys you can see we we supply the very best of suckers actually okay so if if you if you want to get the some of these suckers all you need to do is just hit hit me up go to the description hit me up and then sure we help you process it and then you receive you receive the suckers and depending on your location in a couple of days okay so so that's that's how we would go about our suckers supply these are elephant giant varieties and they tested and trusted okay so just need you to to you know to get the very best best of uh okay guys so we need need to you know we need good supply okay so kaja peace morose more
