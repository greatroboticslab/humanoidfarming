Howto & Style
 I'm back in South Korea four years later to visit Mr. Yongsong Cho again, the inventor of Jadam organic farming. We are at his brand new farm where he has two different setups. One that's set up for farm-scale agriculture and one that is set up to show off more garden-scale growing of food. And what's so amazing about Mr. Cho, if you are not familiar with his work, he's created an organic farming system that's extremely inexpensive for farmers and gardeners to implement where you actually make all of your own inputs. So your own inoculants, fertilizers, even natural pesticides, and even your own soap that you can use in your house. So he is a genius in my opinion. He's invented so many different things and even this house behind me, he designed it. So today I'm here with Cho Yongsong, the inventor of Jadam organic farming. We're here at his new farm. So he's going to take us all around and give us lots of different updates about what he's been working on the last few years. So Cho Taep-myung-nim, thank you for letting me come to your farm and showing us what you're working on. So there's– There are a lot of things that are doing research. There are 70 different types of animals in this small area. They are always used to catch birds and insects. They are always used to research how it works, and they don't have a better way. My friends, there are many trees here, and there are many water, so I've been able to live for the most long time. Yeah, this is a very beautiful place, and I love how private it is too. You're just all back here by yourself. So let's go check out the farm, and tell me there's two different sides of your farm here, and tell me why did you design it like this? This space is 1 acre, 1,200 p.m. This space is mainly because people are usually farming. They are mainly farming, and they are trying to test different trees. So this It's a great farm to the Korean farmers. It's a small farm to the Korean farmers, but it's a farm to come to the farm. In Korea, it's normal. Every time they make a new crop, they till it, right? It's a 1.6m range. We're going to shoot a rotary, and we're going to make this farm. We're going to use that farm for forever. We're going to use this farm for a few years. This is a land scape fabric for about 7 years. These are all of the things that are applied to. We don't have them, just leave them. Then we cut them, and then we'll take them to the ground. Right, so you recycle this plant back to the ground. Yes. When you made these beds, how did you start the soil? Did you put compost, JMS? To cover the soil in the beginning? You put compost, JMS... And fig to UP, and the tiger furthest. And then rock powder. розиссer. Yeah,akterized Bea plus honey. We usually put the�� on a�� on top, when Big Se good yapmış wood, putting the grass from 3 sacks will it not, but it's not my fault. But one thing that is absorbed in the dirt, א� now our woodland has been driven by the percent, It's a perfect vegetable for the best fruits. So it's better to put it here in the summer. So many people would be concerned about the disease coming, but that doesn't happen. In the desert, there are certain diseases that are found in the desert. But we don't want to kill that certain diseases. There might be something similar to theedor, that we use a bean juice and other plant that will probably gear. Everything comes from most rooted if По-apdate care victims of the acid source, which will suggest and lack of relief. It has an enormous effect by clicking on the keyboard signal and a lemon disappearing. Our honey's unique thing is thatrey looked like figs when the樹 growing the por ADS produced so large and deep so Official Starting a big field like this and the soil is poor, how much JMS does he recommend? Should we do JMS once a week for four weeks before planting? Do you get a lot of microbes in the soil? Or just one time and plant and go? Before I sow this, I'll keep JMS for a month. For a month, four times. If you use this plant, you'll get the results of the growth. It's a lot of money. The drip irrigation, it's just water, nothing else, nothing special. JMS and water. Just JMS and water. So, I didn't do that before, but the plant is too big, so I took it away from the plant. It didn't have any problem. I didn't have an additive fertilizer. I didn't do it for the irrigation. I didn't do it for the fertilizer. And one thing is, JADAM, JMS, JHS, JHA, JWA, and the JWA, which is a good product. So, it's also possible. That's so cool. I mean, this is what I believe about farming too. The microbes do everything. Yeah, the microbes do everything. I think the animals are doing everything. If you just take the roots of the soil, it will be good for the soil. There are rivers outside. So, there are a lot of bees here. But we have to do it for the perfect solution. So, there are lots of bees. How many pounds of peppers are you going to grow this year in this area? This is a tree. 500 grams of bees. It's been very hot and still the blossoms. Because usually, like, above 32, it's, you know, there's no blossoms. There's no blossoms. When you see the plants, there's a green leaf. It's already grown. There's a green leaf. There's no green leaf. When did you plant these? This plant was around 120 years ago. Oh, wow. They still look really good. Wow. The process is, it's a very simple way to grow. It's just a simple way to grow. But, regardless of our rights is to understand whatever other product is given to it. But, when we do a- Although, there is, small barn cave. Because, there is a seeming to have a sense ofdepth perguntination and individual very difficult. I spent the best learning of growing goingjang. If you know someone, how many bees do uh, these are some 03. Okay, so that you can useasycore, It's a basic principle. As Jesus said, I'm interested in the father's influence. You're like the farming Jesus? I'm like... I'm like Jesus, you're like the food. I love drinking like Jesus. You're like this. Actually, this farm is only for two years. So next year it's going to be taller. Yeah, the soil will be better in two years. These are very important. It's used as a result. It's used as a result. It's used as a result of the forest. If you go to other farm, the chilies are going straight. Right. It reminds me of like a peach tree or something. You keep the middle is open for light. That's right. Tell me about how the experiment has been going on all these fruit trees. It's different from the plants. It's only two years ago. This thing is very beautiful. So that's why in the world I calculate the creek like this. It's just intense. And here it is no- I was not a 겁니다 além of the Jeffrey Coleganda I am using new youtube research This is an easy way to drillulas When you were made to garden кот You know it I can work out When you dive in about food I was going to cook Why did you see the destroyed Why did my field do not mess with this? Don't forget Because there's so many diseases and the disease in general Those whoi know i have crunching and other education prize writhing the food we think from instance surface very했던 water Because we learned from his book You know that we've learned from the book and I'm sorry I'm not sure how to use landscape fabric. But I don't use it properly. I'm not sure how to use landscape fabric. I'm not sure how to use landscape fabric. But I'm sure it's good to use it. And I'm sure it's better to use it. I'm not sure how to use wood chip, Sl氣, brethren, We could have storage. Definitelyظ третьwater, into the potential for 농ification during the summer. We've had to easily use the term electronics from big wood. Minutes allmäIDS with cement and rock wood. We all been hugging some water, and that usual, it was late Arbeitists to rip off a kilometers in Korean. It's nearly a couple of months in the process, and instead just tried to swim in the middle Christmas spring, and there is a which is very cold. David Mark says these Affairs are something great to do. Most people have nice ground, but if they dude, these are basically revenues rotating. So don't do much in the middle. And then same system with this one. This is a cellist. So it's like a little staple in there. And this one keeps it from going. When you put it in, you can put it in the middle. And then the tomato is like tomato. If you look at the American people, it's weird. You can put it in the tomato and put it in the tomato. You can put it in the tomato. You can also put it in the tomato. And there's also a pumpkin. There's also a tomato. You can put it in the tomato and tomatoes. If I use a salad for a day, then it's a good amount of water. It's very important to me. And in Korea, there's a lot of vegetables that are in the middle of the summer. So you can put it in the middle of the summer. There's also a lot of vegetables that are in the middle of the summer. We can plant fruit in the summer at spring. But for these vegetables that we've prepared to give up and have them buy têm corruption. So it can be simplified to plant things last year because the characteristics of the entsteht is small. I can pull some shallow shelter in because of plants. Does this mean something? When we've zoomed out, it almost looks like it spells something. But it's not Korean, but what is the... What it is that? I had a lot of trouble, but it's not good. I was shooting a drone, so I had a tree here, but I couldn't do this, the ordinary people. I put a land-scale fabric on the ground, and put a wood chip on there. If you don't use a fabric, then the tree will grow a lot of trees. I used you in land-scale fabric in Tennessee and still the weeds come. Yeah, yeah, still, still. Right? Yeah. So now this next section that we're going to talk about here, this is more set up for a full-scale farm, so don't be intimidated by this, but you can have a much smaller, easier system to set up for injecting JMS, the inoculant, or fertilizers, or whatever you want into your garden, or your farm, of course. There's something called an easy flow irrigator. That's an example of just like a siphon pump that you can just hook up to your hose, and then you can put the JMS in that, and then that will put it out through your irrigation system. But let's hear Yong Song tell us how he designed this, and I also want to ask him how he prevents clogging in his irrigation system, because that's something a lot of farmers and gardeners have problems with when they do inject inoculants or other fertilizers. So this is your full system for your pesticides and the JMS. So tell me, this looks really cool. Just tell me how you designed this, and how does it work? And then that's one you can get it from the United States, too. You use it for natural pesticides. So this line is done here, so you can go and go back to the whole forest. And you have the pesticides in one of these tanks? Pesticides. Pesticides, that one. And this one, JMS. D This is a waste. When you take the waste, you open the valve. Oh, we use the belt. And then the water is going to get out of here. Oh, fresh water. He just runs fresh water through? Yes, fresh water. But if you don't get it, it won't be able to get out of here. So it's going to get out of here. So just after he sprays JMS, does he, at the end, fresh water to clean the line and then leave? Okay. So if you take the waste, it takes 15 minutes. 15 minutes. 1,000 liters of JMS is 1,000 liters of JMS. Then, you can take it out and wash it. Just 1-2 minutes. The important thing is, you can use this filter. So the JMS goes through this filter. Before going... Yes, you don't want to get it. This filter is all done. It's all done. But the reason is, you can clean it. It's not easy to clean it. Because if you open it, the inside will be clean. Right, you flush it. Yeah, flush it. That's very convenient. So you have two filters, two pumps. This is the pump that powers the spray line though, right? These are for the drip irrigation. Ah. Two pumps. There's two pumps. And you're using the lake water. Ah. He's pulling that into this tank. Ah, okay. And then... And then... Filter water. Filter water. Filter water. Soft water. Soft water. This is a JWA to make it. For making. For making. And when it's in the winter, it's going to be a fire. So you open it. So you put it in the water. So you put it in the water. So you put it in the water. And then... And... Potatoes. When we put it in the microwave, the potatoes with potatoes, these potatoes are very expensive. Yeah. But with this, you can save money. Oh, you put it in the water. 1kg of 15L of water. 1kg of water. And then 15L of water. 15L of water. Then it's going to be a water. Then you put it in the water. Then you put it in the water. Then you put it in the water. It's going to be a half-dumb, red light. So you put it in here. And then we add to this... And then we add to this... Right. And you culture it here? Yes. Then you put it in there. And then you put it in the water. And of course, we need to see some water. And of course, we need to see some water. And we need to live more. It's not a good thing to use. It's not a good thing to use. Yeah. Maybe certain countries might need that, or... If you look at the river, you can't see the river. Is there any other starchy vegetable? Oh, it's possible. Yeah, it's possible. Like taro, or sweet potato... It's possible. Yeah. It's possible. So before we go, I have something really exciting that Mr. Cho is working on. He's working on a third edition of the Jadam Organic Farming Book. And this is going to be more than just another edition. I mean, he's rewriting a ton of the book. Because with all the new research that they've done here at this new farm, there's just a lot of really interesting updates that he has for us that I think is going to revolutionize farming even further than what he's already done in the first book. So, Cho Temgye-nim, thank you. Thank you for teaching us and showing us a better way of farming without the use of chemicals and helping us to save money and just grow healthier food. So go check out his book. I'll put a link down below and check out their YouTube channel and their Instagram as well. They put all of their content out in English for us and even some other languages as well. So thank you so much. Thank you. We'll see you again.
