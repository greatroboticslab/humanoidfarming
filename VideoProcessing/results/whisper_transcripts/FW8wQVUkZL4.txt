 Uttarakhand is one of the fastest growing state economies in India, with a GDP growth of almost 14% between financial year 2005 and 2012. Agriculture is one of the most significant sectors of the state economy, even though because of the hilly terrain which covers over 90% of the land area, the state's yield per hectare stands at just about 14% of the total produce. Living in the hills poses many challenges, from landslides and soil erosion, to scarcity of water and erratic but heavy rainfall. Rajinder Singh Rawat from Jethogao village had to migrate to a bigger city to make ends meet. But the farmer in him could not be held back from his land for long. He decided to return, but little did he realize that even at his home, there was a battle waiting to be fought. Here the rainy season stays for more than three months. This is a problematic area for us, because if we want to put up a nursery, then we have no dry land for cultivation. This situation is different from plain land. There the farmers have such options and facilities that we don't have here in the hilly region. The soul of a farmer lies in his farmland, no matter how much havoc nature creates to test his patience. Ronu Lal, a daily wage laborer, was often caught in a whirlpool of unfortunate situations. Between no rains on one hand to heavy rainfall on the other, he had lost many of his ready harvests. Last year it rained so heavily that all my tomato crop was destroyed. No one came for my rescue. The local agents exploit this situation. They assume that we are fools and know nothing. They offered just 2 rupees per kg for tomatoes and said we will pay only if your tomatoes get sold in the market. A few kilometers away in the same district of Bauri Garwal is Naini village, where Bhagat Singh was dealing with a different situation altogether. Lack of water supply was making his farm dry and stony. The total harvest from his land was not even enough to feed his own family. In desperation, Bhagat Singh had to take up daily contract work to supplement his livelihood. I had problem of water and good seeds for cultivation, but I had no means. I was totally dependent on the mercy of nature. In the hills of Uttarakhand, there were many villages where agriculture was proving to be non-profitable and farmers were either migrating or working as daily wage laborers on someone else's fields. This was the situation when Society for Rural Technology came as an answer to the farmers' problems. The farmers told us about their difficulties in finding seeds, fertilizer or knowledge about certain pesticides. Also they had no other means to acquire good quality seeds and fertilizers. This being a hilly region, getting potable water remains the biggest challenge. Lack of water for drinking and irrigation were the main problems facing the village. At the same time, excess rainfall was another concern. The climate in the hilly areas restricts cultivation to only a few crops and it gets worse when the farmers are unaware of the new techniques of cultivation. SRT decided to take a multi-level approach to deal with these adversities. We worked on the concept of integrated watersheds. At the top of the hill, we constructed control lines and recharge pits. And further below, we built check dams and percolation tanks. All our water sources used to get dry during the months of March and April. But now, thanks to the efforts of SRT, we are getting proper water supply. Today, RS Rawat owns 50 Nalis of land, which equates to almost 2.5 acres, where he grows wheat and many seasonal and non-seasonal vegetables. SRT has changed my life and the way I used to do farming. It helped me immensely and I am very thankful to SRT. On the other side of the mountain lies Eidhar, a small village in Rangoon region near Thalisen, where SRT has taken Ronu Lal under its wings and has provided him with new seats, a poly house and a bar beetle, changing his life for the better. Ever since I came in contact with the SRT, my life has been transformed and I hope that they will keep supporting us in the future too. With the help of SRT, Bhagat Singh has built a water reservoir that has solved his problem of water scarcity. Plus, with the addition of sprinklers and drip irrigation system, he is able to provide enough water to his crops today. Whereas in the past he used to mainly grow seasonal vegetables on his farm, today because of his poly house, he grows non-seasonal vegetables as well. Now he sells his yield directly in the market and gets an amount he deserves. We have constituted Kisan Clubs and self-help groups at the village level. Then we established a federation where the farmers could inquire about market rates and take unanimous decisions on what price they would sell certain products at. Initially, the local agent used to buy potato at Rs. 5 per kg. Now we sell directly in the market and get double the amount. Similarly, the local agent used to buy garlic from us at Rs. 20 per kg. Now we get Rs. 50 per kg. The Society for Rural Technology's support to farmers extends beyond the fields as well. They also hold knowledge-based training camps where villagers are taught ways and means to develop sustainable home-based agribusinesses. Today, SRT has organised a training camp for rural women where they will learn to earn cash from a wild flower by converting it into a refreshing squash. In the hilly region, the wild flowers like Buransh is available in abundance. So here we are training the village women on how to extract and make refreshing squash from this flower. During the course of the last two decades, the Society for Rural Technology has spread its reach to almost 600 villages in the three states of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. And thousands of farmers like Rs. Rawat, Ronu Lal and Bhagat Singh are ushering in a new era of learning-based farming, thanks to the efforts of SRT. Hello.
