Howto & Style
 hey guys welcome back to my garden today we have episode 2 of our tomato series for spring of 2020 and I'm basically just going to be showing you guys how we're going to be growing tomatoes indoors and I like that we're growing a nice variety of tomatoes one of I believe two of them are like cherry tomatoes and one of them should be like a regular sized tomato now you could see when I flip it around the root system has developed quite a bit and I'm going to be basically planting this in a Kratky system so it's a nice easy hydroponic system so I'm going to be using three inch net cups because those fit perfectly in a wide mouth mason jar and you want to basically grab your plant and make sure that your plants are labeled this way you don't mix anything up and you know you want to be able to keep track of everything and you see the root system has developed quite a bit so it looks nice and beautiful down there and I made sure the plants got nice and leggy on purpose you'll see why because when you place it down at the bottom of the net cup and you flip it around you could see the plant has gotten nice and tall where it's freezing reaching just over the net cup so basically what I'm going to do is just kind of fill it in with some clay pebbles here and I pre-washed my clay pebbles and I let it sit in some water so they're kind of soaked a little bit this way helps the root system develop a little bit further and being that the plant got nice and leggy all that space in between that's basically covered up with the rock wall cubes right now I mean with the clay pebbles right now is basically or should essentially grow into new root systems and kind of help the plant support itself and get nice and strong so the fact that the plant is already covered up with some clay pebbles here you can see that it's already being supported nicely and it shouldn't topple over or anything like that and when I flip it around you can see the root system is there at the bottom so it's going to basically grow out from the bottom there and I'll show you guys what I mean by that once I set everything up but for now let's kind of finish setting up the other two the same way we just did this first one here so we got our cherry tomato plant right over here and same thing just kind of taking that cup place it there at the bottom and fill in the clay pebbles and you want to make sure that you wash your clay pebbles I mentioned that earlier because when you get them in the mail due to shipping and everything like that they shake around and compress against each other so it develops a lot of like dust and debris and that's really not good to get into your hydroponic system and you want to make sure that you're labeling these as well since it's covered up now it's going to be hard to tell what plant is what when tomato plants are really small it's really difficult to tell the difference between them I've even spoken to like people that have been growing for many years and even they have a hard time to differentiate differences between them when they're really small when the plant gets a little larger of course it's a little bit easier but for now you can see the plants are looking nice and healthy and everything is ready in the net cup so all we got to do is basically take our our glass jars right over here and I'm going to be using quart-sized mason jars just to start now you can see I covered it up over here with some um with some foil just to keep the the sunlight from penetrating inside and developing algae uh the reason why I did that is because you can see right over here I painted this jar this is already two coats of paint and you could see that by simply covering it up with some with some foil absolutely no light penetrates through the bottom or the inside and it'll keep your your root system nice and healthy and it'll keep the algae definitely away from your system so I labeled the glass jars as well so I'm just going to take a one gallon size um container here I'm just going to fill it up with some water and you want to make sure the pH balance your water tomato plants like more of like a slightly acidic um pH more somewhere between like a 6.0 to 6.5 and I'm going to be using maxi grow for this growth and I'm just going to use the basically the the minimum requirements of what it says so just one teaspoon per gallon so that's what I'm going to put right here and I've used this mixture before so it should roughly give me like just around like a thousand ppm something like that so it's perfect for vegetation stage as well as even plants when they're in following stage as well and you can see after it's shaken up it changes to like this like yellowish almost like opaque color and you want to make sure you check the bottom this way if there's any solution at the bottom you want to shake it up a little bit more like I need to here now that that's all mixed up we're basically just going to start our our kratki system and like I mentioned the easiest way to do it is just take a take another net cup and just kind of put it right there and once you start pouring in your your solution or your fertilizer you want to stop once it reaches basically the the bottom of the net cup and it kind of covers the the bottom of the neck up slightly now you can see when I lift it up over here that's what the bottom neck looks like and you can see clearly that it's submerged and if I zoom you guys in just a little bit you could see a little bit more of how much I put in it looks like just about maybe like not even a quarter of an inch something like that and I'm just going to do the same thing for all three jars and if it's slightly higher slightly lower it's not a big deal guys it's not going to change anything the reason why you want to make sure that it's it's touching the bottom of the neck up is just to get a wicking system going between the clay pebbles and the plant just for the root system to start developing and growing downwards once the roots already are growing down into the water it doesn't make a difference what at that point if it's touching the bottom of the neck up anymore because the roots are getting everything they need from the inside of the container and we'll most likely have to definitely be you know be doing refills and things like that so you want to keep keep watch of your of your solution and and what the level it's at especially since you're using foil everything is kind of covered up it's a little bit more difficult to see but you could always tell by simply just grabbing the glass jar picking it up you could see how heavy it is or just lift the neck up and take a peek inside now if I could just get the label out this is the cherry tomato plant and I'm just gonna want to test make sure once you place the the neck up inside when you lift it up you should see like so the water is kind of dripping at the bottom meaning that it's definitely touching the bottom of the neck up and that's pretty much what you want guys so we got the black vera massage right over here and we're gonna be growing three varieties like I mentioned this should be like like a beautiful like small little I believe like a two ounce maybe three ounce size tomato I've actually yet to grow that to full completion something always ends up going wrong or like the plant gets infected that plant dies or you guys know it's gardening not everything is a hundred percent and this is gonna be a beautiful little blueish green looking like tomato and when you slice it on the inside it's absolutely gorgeous looking based on the photos I'm really excited to grow these three varieties guys I think this is gonna be a really good season my other plants are doing really well so I'm hoping you know with a little luck you know I have a little bit more more growth to go and it looks like I got basically about maybe another two to three maybe glass jars I could fill up with that solution so what I did is I had some basil and some thyme growing on the side so I just kind of did the exact same setup that I did for the for the tomato plants over here and basically we just have a kratki system going over here there's no air pumps or air stones or anything like that it's just really simple way for the plants to start growing and developing with a couple ingredients you may have just laying around maybe like a little pasta jar or something like that you guys may have laying around just give it a nice good wash if if your pieces don't necessarily fit exactly for kind of DIYing this a little bit more it doesn't need to fit it hundred percent as long as you know you're getting basically the water touching the bottom of of your container the root systems should technically grow downwards and and and start doing its thing so you can see the time is doing absolutely beautiful and the tomato plants are looking really good right now and I'm gonna show you guys it's basically a couple days later after I put it into the system how things are looking and you can see things are doing really well so the plants look overall nice and healthy right now since you know it's still early in its life so this is basically a couple days later you can see the plants are nice and perked up and they're reaching up towards the lights I actually put up a little box underneath to kind of raise things up a little bit higher you want to kind of keep the plants nice and close to the to the lights when they're growing originally I kept the lights really far away to get the plants nice and leggy this way we could plant it out and show you guys you know pretty much what you've seen in the video why we got a leggy this way we could plant it out and cover things up and you can see for the most part things are looking really really good right now I I would say it's probably about 90% covered up well it looks like maybe like the time needs a little bit more clay pebbles maybe like the basil also but for the most part everything seems to be covered up and I'm pretty sure I should be avoiding like any type of algae growth or anything like that but we'll definitely be monitoring that together closely as the videos and the season goes on and I'll show you guys kind of how things progress so I'm really excited basically for episode three to come and I'll show you guys what changes but for now let me kind of show you in the last couple of days if what the root system looked like and if anything has developed so lifting it up you could see the roots are starting to finally poke out it underneath there at the bottom and it looks like the cracky system is on the way finally so you could see basically the second plant over here let's lift it up same thing I could see what a roots are starting to poke here in the bottom looking really good guys the systems are working and the last one let's see it looks kind of hard to see oh there we go looking really good guys I definitely see roots on all three of the plants everything is looking nice and healthy and good every it seems like the cracky system is doing really well right now for the most part we're gonna probably increase the size of the containers but we'll talk about that later on and you could see it's basically about one maybe two inches away from the grow lights right now and that's perfect what you want in the beginning this way the plant gets nice and compact and bushy and instead of trying to stretch and reach for the lights it's gonna get nice and compact for you so as always guys thanks for watching we'll be back soon
