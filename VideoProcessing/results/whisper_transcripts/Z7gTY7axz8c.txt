 If you want to get big and many pumpkins, do these two things first. We can pinch off the heads of all the vines. This weakens apical dominance and encourages nutrients to go to fruit development. Second, we use a knife to make a small hole in the root of the pumpkin on the sunny side and then insert a small wooden stick. This will slow down the rate at which nutrients are transported from the roots to the top and has the effect of air layering. This will help the pumpkins grow bigger and more numerous.
