 Her name is David His name is our Presbyterian We have all Weil who can do it Here are the explanations that we are The referral of our emails Please join us in joining us Please join us in yourifall Hurry and meets another女 Jill and I will watch audio Look at these crown roots and the root hair density. See how these roots are. They're fantastic. Look at here, here, over here. The white. Mm-hmm. Biology allows us to get more out of our fertility. With this taproot you'll get through some drier conditions with the soybean plant. You move with this. I figure it's either the micro-essentials phosphate and the mes makes it too acidic and that's where I'm getting the disease coming in. Sulfur usually doesn't give you disease. I'm struggling with their observation that they're getting the disease. It's very good soil but you see the plates that we're creating inside of this root ball. One of the things that I'm asking the guys to do is I finally found a biological that I think can help us get more out of our fertility. Experts I talked to just in the last two weeks still agree you can only identify about 10% of ones in there. That's all that's been done agriculturally and that's all they can find. 90% of the organisms you don't know. You can't even get to grow on a plate so you can't get a genotype so you can't DNA sequence them. So it's very difficult. You want to know what you're looking for. Yeah. If you know exactly what you're looking for you're looking for one in trillions. Isn't there a lot of debate out there which ones do we want? I mean that's what everybody's trying to outdo each other. That's getting defined. Yeah. That's getting pretty well defined. Okay. Okay. You may have them in the jug but they got to compete out there and some of them have good ability to compete and multiply. Others not so good even though in the jug or in the lab you know they're good and they should work but do they impact? You're looking at over 20 years of experience working on that plant. But the other thing to power this plant and keep it going this long a good inferral, a good starter furl has always helped this horse. Your placement and everything you couldn't ask for a better placement. Genetic expression, gosh we just about had it nil if we had moisture. Now we're really cutting teeth here now. Yeah we are. You could sit here and argue both ways for the next hour and a half. You know you got to ask questions. The main difference between the SP1 and the control would be much more dense foliage, better leaf cover, reduction in sun scalding on the fruit of the plant. In addition I think we've got a much heavier fruit set here than we did on the control. I'm so amazed by the roots and you know this is out of the cucumbers Jim but you tell me do we or when we have a root mass like this do you think we have a much more efficient fertilizer program and a much healthier and more active plant? So the architecture and kernel placement in a cob is determined early on. Many people think it's determined to pollination but it's not. It's determined as early as V4, V5. So if we get more sheet erosion of phosphate across these types of soils that want to plant that runs off into a stream we got a problem. So I mean I keep looking at this and saying if we reduce pollution into the streams of phosphate or nitrates that's a win-win-win for the farmer. Overall I think that given the weather conditions that we've had we've been able to pull a pretty good crop with our programs and what we're doing. We're pretty pleased at quality and skin set and what we're seeing. No one's perfect. No soil's perfect. No soil is totally balanced in fertility equally on every field or in every part of the field. yet this plant, this miraculous plant has the capability of showing a shield. Our goal needs to be to learn how to make every plant contribute profit to our bottom line. more bottom line. 2 3 4 5 Thank you.
