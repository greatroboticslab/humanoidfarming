 Happening in Buffalo, giving more access to healthy food. Two Buffalo guys created a grow operative. It's a co-op where people can grow their own vegetables and herbs. News Forest Ali Ingersoll takes us to where it's happening to show us what they're doing. More than 1,000 herbs are growing in this basement here. And as you can see, they're stacked vertically. It's an idea two local guys have where everyone can work together, grow together. And while they're doing that, they're changing the way people in the city are looking at farming. Urban communities have often been left out of having good, healthy, sustainable food. Mike Zach is one of the co-founders for Grow Operative, a vertical farm located in a basement in the university district. We stack it up to the ceiling, which makes us able to grow just as much as four times as you would as a conventional farm. Zach says being able to grow these goods is important because people around the city need access to fresh produce. It really impacts every part of your life. If you do or don't have very healthy food every day of your life. Studies show diets saturated with foods that have high sugar and calories can affect focus. Zach says for many people, that's all they have access to as they're living in what Zach calls a food desert. He says up to 75% of Buffalo City residents don't have access to fresh local produce. Juanita Jackson lives on the east side, one of those areas. They just need more grocery stores. She says it's important for people to be able to see where their food is coming from, and that's why she likes the urban farming idea. It's like you grow your own food, you know, what's in it. You ain't got to worry about the chemicals. Due to its setup, the grow up uses 80% less nutrients than what a conventional farm uses, and it's also using 1% of the water at a conventional farm. The grow up co-founder says showing people how to do this, how to grow their goods on their own, can change how people think about food. There's no connection with them, and if they don't understand how the food system works, then there's no way that they can be a true part of society and be actors and how we can change it for the better. Their business is expanding right now, and they're trying to get community support, so next month they're launching a crowdfunding initiative. There's information on how you can donate them.
