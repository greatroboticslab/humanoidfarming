 Forests are much more than just trees. Covering a third of the Earth's land, they play a vital role in preserving the water cycle, conserving soil and protecting biodiversity. By storing carbon, they are a front-line defense against the effects of climate change. For many, they also provide food, fuel, shelter and income. Yet forest cover has been shrinking at an alarming rate, with a net loss of 3.3 million hectares per year. Much of it, about 80%, is cleared to make room for agriculture. As the world's population continues to increase, demand for food will also rise. The challenge will be to feed 9 billion people while also preventing further loss of forest land. The experiences of more than 20 countries show that increasing forest cover and improving food security can go hand in hand, and that forests, in turn, can help communities to prosper. In Costa Rica, rainforests are recovering after decades of cutting them for cattle pastures and commodity crops left the country in an environmental crisis. Forest cover has now expanded to 54% thanks to more sustainable agriculture practices, stronger legal controls over land use, and especially funding for forest protection. Farmers like Victor Julio receive payments for keeping forest area intact. Julio earns a stipend for his protected forest land, which helps cover the family's expenses. About every 15 years, he is allowed to harvest and sell a limited amount of timber. But aside from extra income, the rainforest offers a value beyond price. I feel relaxed because I have a forest where my children will enjoy it. My grandchildren will know what is a forest. They will know what is a mountain or a forest. Costa Rica has been a pioneer in developing a system of payments for environmental services, or PES. Since 1997, PES funding has boosted forest and watershed protection, agroforestry, and reforestation with native species. Obviously, and without a doubt, the pay for environmental services has had a role and an important contribution in that it has reversed and increased the rate of forest coverage in the country. Where large-scale farms once cleared the land for plantations of coffee, pineapple, and sugar, many farmers are now pursuing a forest-friendly model. Coffee planner Guillermo Vargas has adopted sustainable agriculture practices using soil composted with animal waste, intercropping his coffee with fruit, and leaving large areas of forest alone. Today, we don't have much land. We are more people in this planet, so we have to understand how to grow more food in smaller areas, still protecting the environmental conditions for the long term. In Vietnam, food security and forest cover have both increased significantly in the last 25 years. The country has changed from a net importer of staple foods to become one of the world's top rice exporters. And forest cover has grown from a low of 28% in the 1990s to more than 40%. In a nation where all land is owned by the state, farmers used to have little say in how they could use forest resources. But economic and agricultural reforms have reshaped the way local communities interact with the forests, as an emphasis on state forestry has given way to more community-based management. It helps farmers to grow the land. It helps to grow the land. It helps to grow the land. It helps to grow the land. Winti Mi Hui cares for two hectares of acacia trees in northern Yen Bai province. She and fellow villagers have formed a forest and farm producers group, which receives loans and technical assistance in managing a small forestry enterprise. In the past, farmers here practice shifting cultivation, leading to heavy soil erosion. Now they collaborate to grow trees and raise livestock. When it's time to harvest the wood, they receive valuable information about current timber market prices so they can negotiate a better deal from the middlemen. My friends, I feel that the time as I am, the people of my family and my family have been planted trees, green trees, green trees, and the forestry tree is very good. So I feel that the environment is now. I feel that I am still here today. In the Gambia, local communities are setting the rhythm for protecting forests. The village of Linbanbulu Yanmedu has something to celebrate. It has taken ownership of the nearby forest, part of a nationwide program to transfer government-owned forest land to local communities. communities. As elsewhere in the Gambia, rainfall here has declined in recent decades and bushfires have grown rampant. In the past, families scavenged at will through the forest for firewood and fruits, steadily degrading the forests. A village committee now manages forest affairs. Villagers take turns going on patrol and work together to build firebreaks and plant new trees. With less risk of fire, an orchard of mango trees has flourished, providing an abundant supply of fruit for all to eat and sell. The village uses proceeds of the forest income to maintain the forest. The village uses the forest to maintain the water pump and pay for gasoline to carry the sick to the nearest health center. Limbambulu-Yenmadu is one of more than 450 villages that manages its own forests. By 2019, the Gambian government aims to transfer to local communities some 200,000 hectares of forest cover. The benefits are felt by men and women alike. In the past, the farmers have been able to find the forest for a living. We have been able to find the forest for a living. We have been able to find the forest for a living. With innovative approaches and collaboration between governments, businesses and local communities, agriculture and forestry can and do co-exist. Producing food and forest products in highly productive landscapes that are also sustainable. Sustainability doesn't understand about borders of farms. The birds, the air, the pollution, even the pesticides, they go beyond the borders of our farms. So sustainability is about mutual cooperation integrating farmers, communities and countries. We try to do the best in the local context, but we have to work also in the global context. Well, let me know. Tell us everything to find the forest there, we fear. I use an anaesthetist for a living in a forever state. I think we deserve to work. Oh my gosh. Ooh. That much is lovely. What do we miss the reacting that we hear today? I see it all the things we eat together.
