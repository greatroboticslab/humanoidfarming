 МУЗЫКАЛЬНАЯ ЗАСТАВКА Israeli engineers from Ben-Gurion University have created a robot called Sweeper designed for harvesting sweet peppers. The robot moves along rails, carefully scans the fruits, and can automatically adjust to the height of each plant. It is important to note that Sweeper only picks ripe peppers. The robot assesses the fruits using computer vision and artificial intelligence technology. According to the engineers, using robots like Sweeper will reduce the number of vegetables that spoil due to not being harvested on time, cut labor costs, and free farmers from performing tedious work while protecting them from the impacts of market fluctuations. In theory, once the robot is available for sale, it will allow farmers to harvest crops continuously, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, and this could bring about a true revolution in the agriculture industry. Researchers at Wageningen University have developed an unusual robotic manipulator designed for harvesting Gerberos. The robot has been in development for over a year and has undergone several improvements, although it is still unclear when it will reach the market. The robot's operation can be briefly described as follows. An overhead camera detects flowers that have fully bloomed and are ready for harvesting. The robot's arm, equipped with a specialized mechanism, approaches the stem just below the flower and moves down to its base, and the mechanism then cuts the stem at the base and transfers the cut flower to a holder. The robot's main task is to accurately locate the base of the stem. It determines the flower's position using a special camera, and the robot's arm then moves about 4 centimeters below the flower. This is the only place where the stem can be, allowing the gripper to easily slide down the stalk and cut the stem more quickly. Engineers from Pixel Farming Robotics have introduced their agricultural robot called Robot One, designed to tackle the challenges of sustainable and biodiverse farming. This autonomous robot is built to combat weeds without the use of chemicals and can perform multiple tasks simultaneously thanks to its 10 robotic arms, which can be equipped with various tools. These manipulators have millimeter-level precision, allowing for plant treatment without harming the surrounding environment. With 14 high-resolution cameras and advanced computer vision algorithms, the robot can recognize and classify plants in real time, creating a 3D map of the field. This level of accuracy allows farmers to optimize crop growth and maintain high soil quality. The robot's price starts at 185,000 euros. One of the most famous robots in the world named Spot from Boston Dynamics has learned to herd sheep, inspect crops, and even relax in the grass after a long day of work. This has been made possible by the company Rokos, which demonstrated how such a device can be used in agriculture. For now, this is just a demonstration of capabilities that are expected to be implemented in the future. Rokos intends to collaborate with Boston Dynamics to develop a software platform that will enable Spot to perform the actions shown in the video. This means the robot can help to herd sheep, check crop yields, and create real-time maps and routes. According to Rokos, using such robots in agriculture increases food production efficiency, improves crop yield assessment accuracy, and reduces the burden on workers. It's still unclear when the platform will be ready, but with the capabilities of Boston Dynamics robots, it seems very likely that Spot can handle these tasks very soon. Engineers from Australia have introduced the Swagbot, which is agricultural robot of the next generation. Swagbot can navigate rough terrain, herd cattle, and transport heavy equipment around the farm. Using computer vision, the robot can identify weeds and spray them with herbicides. Swagbot can reach speeds of up to 20 kilometers per hour and is powered by a battery. During tests, the robot demonstrated its ability to avoid obstacles such as streams, logs, and steep inclines, and effectively interact with animals. It can also tow trailers and perform other farm tasks. In the near future, developers plan to equip Swagbot with sensors that will allow the robot to monitor animal health based on body temperature or gait, as well as assess pasture conditions to identify the best grazing areas. This is Verdi, a unique AI-powered gardening robot that will win your heart while taking care of your lawn. Verdi is a gardener robot with artificial intelligence, capable of performing multiple tasks autonomously. He may look amusing, but he's incredibly serious about his work. If you've always dreamed of a tireless, hardworking, yet sociable gardening assistant, it might be time for a special introduction. Verdi is the latest addition to the outdoor robot family. Beyond his charming appearance, Verdi represents a significant step forward in automation that respects the environment and serves people. Electric Sheep Company envisions that in addition to mowing, edging, and blowing away debris, this AI-powered garden helper will one day perform additional tasks like planting, pruning, and weeding, working alongside human crews, rather than fully replacing them. A team of researchers from University College London has developed an innovative quadruped robot called RoboHike. This robot is designed for autonomous navigation across complex and hard-to-reach terrains. The goal of the project is to equip robots with the ability to efficiently model, identify, and map safe routes on rugged landscapes. RoboHike's primary applications include fields like agriculture, forestry, construction, and search and rescue operations. It can be used to automate labor-intensive and dangerous tasks, such as monitoring remote farmland, assessing pasture conditions, and performing work in areas where human presence is difficult or impossible. The technology combines autonomous navigation systems, sensors, and machine learning to accurately determine safe routes and mitigate risks when operating in extreme environments. The company Yarbo has introduced its autonomous robot called the Yarbo Blower, designed for automatic leaf and debris clearing over large areas. This robotic blower is the world's first autonomous solution capable of generating an airspeed of up to 190 miles per hour and moving up to 760 cubic feet of air per minute. The Yarbo Blower can precisely follow designated routes, avoiding obstacles and efficiently cleaning the area. A single battery charge provides 70 minutes of operation, after which the robot automatically returns to its charging station. Its multifunctional modular design allows for the use of various attachments to perform tasks such as snow removal or lawn mowing. On a farm, the Yarbo Blower can be used to maintain cleanliness in open spaces like yards, pathways, and fields. Write in the comments which of the robots shown in this video did you like the most.
