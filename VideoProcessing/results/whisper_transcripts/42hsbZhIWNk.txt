 Pelleonea repens, often referred to as the watermelon begonia or rainbow vine, has become the plant of choice for closed terrariums. Native to Southeast Asia, this plant is admired for its striking leaves which are typically small, oval-shaped and range in color from vibrant greens to deep purples and reds. This low-demand plant enjoys a humid environment and is one of the hardiest plants in my experience with a failure rate of almost zero. The plant can be placed in the foreground or mid-ground inside a terrarium and will lift up any dull spot within this cape.
