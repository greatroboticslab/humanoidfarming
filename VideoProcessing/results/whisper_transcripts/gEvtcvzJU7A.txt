 Big mama did not come up to eat and she's already laying down so I'm real real nervous that we're starting to see just that first twinge of pregtox. I got this a few years ago from my vet it is just a ketone tester. I'm going to take a little drop of blood from her ear. Please don't run away. I know I know. There. 3.9. So she is in full-blown ketosis already without really showing a lot of signs. Just backed off the feed. That's it. So we are going to start treating her for pregtox. Okay I've got the cocktail. Medicam. Painkiller. So we can hopefully get her back eating. We have glycol sugar and we have calcium borogluconate and I'm going to be doing this sub-Q along her back. I lift the skin and sort of put it in multiple spots every day.
