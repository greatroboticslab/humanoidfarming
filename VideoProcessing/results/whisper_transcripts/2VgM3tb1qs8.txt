Howto & Style
 Three mistakes you need to avoid when planting peppers. One, after you plant them, don't overwater them. You need to consistently water them. Number two, don't give them a whole lot of nitrogen. Give them something like a 3-6-6 or a 2-12-12. And number three, don't plant them too close together with another variety because they will cross-pollinate. Hey, followers for more content.
