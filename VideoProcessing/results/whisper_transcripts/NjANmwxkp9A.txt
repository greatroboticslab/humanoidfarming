 Tomatoes seem to be everyone's favorite crop. Here's a few extra tips to help ensure a successful season. Select tomato varieties with 60 to 90 days to maturity. Smaller tomatoes are more likely to grow well. Remove lower leaves and plant deeply. Roots will form all along that stem, giving your plant a strong root system. Add worm castings and some fertilizer to get them off to a good start. Don't forget to give tomatoes something to climb.
