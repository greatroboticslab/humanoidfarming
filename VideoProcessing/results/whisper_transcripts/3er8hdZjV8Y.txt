How to Grow Thresh and Mill Your Own Wheat for Bread

 Is it feasible to grow enough wheat at home to make a steady supply of bread? Well, we did it. Here's how. We started with a land-race wheat variety called Red Fife, and we devoted one of our entire boulevard spaces to wheat production. This 450 square foot plot was seeded quickly with our Earthway seeder on May 11th. And after watering in the beds at once initially, the crop grew really well with minimal maintenance and irrigation throughout the summer. On September 8th, the entire plot was cut with a sickle, then bundled into sheaths and hauled back to our home for threshing. I didn't just want to randomly beat this grain with a flail, so I built a small-scale threshing machine. It knocks the grain from the heads and separates the kernels from the chaff. After threshing, we were left with 25 pounds of grain from our plot, which is now stored in our walk-in cooler. So whenever we're out of flour, we grind a small batch with our tiny flour mill and put it to use for bread like this. If you've also grown your own grain by hand, please share your experience in the comments. And if you'd like to learn more about our threshing machine, you can check out my longer video demonstration. I'll leave a link to that in the description. See you in the next one.
