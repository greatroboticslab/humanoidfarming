Howto & Style
 Here are two ways that I'm going to sow marigold seeds. This is what they look like. Place them down on the soil sideways and then just cover it with some soil. The other way is just scattering heaps. This is probably a little bit too much but what I plan to do is thin them out and place them around in other areas of the gardens. Water them and wait 10 days.
