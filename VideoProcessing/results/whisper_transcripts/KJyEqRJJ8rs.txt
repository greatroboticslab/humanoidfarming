 Starting year two farming from scratch I made the last minute decision to seed 15 of the 50 acres to alfalfa and oats as the nurse crop. First step we started by doing some spring tillage with the chisel plow that I should have done last fall. But I got lucky with an early dry window in March followed by a couple weeks of snow and freezing weather to help mellow things out. The final pass with the soil finisher to level it out and break up the clots of dirt. I borrowed a three point beryllian seeder to seed the alfalfa and broadcasted the oats with a fertilizer spreader beforehand. And this is what the stand looks like now. Unfortunately we got pretty heavy rains following seeding and some spots flooded out but it could have been much worse. The stand isn't terrible but having a poor seed bed on my part really hurt things. And after the first cutting I think I'll try and come in here with a no-till drill and seed the bare spots again. The plan is to have a really good stand for next spring and make square bales off this alfalfa field. If you want to watch the full video you can click the text in the box below.
