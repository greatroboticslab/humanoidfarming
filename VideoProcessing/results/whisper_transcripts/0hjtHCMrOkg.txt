 Now about the HOMEE. The HOMEE system is perfect for growing herbs, leafy greens and mini greens. The tubes, they have enough room for that kind of plant. And also, if you put fruity vegetables anyway, then you can open the lid and you can cut the roots if they overflow. The water overflows because of the roots. It stands on its own, the assembly is very, very quick and it doesn't take any experience to handle. So everyone can do that.
