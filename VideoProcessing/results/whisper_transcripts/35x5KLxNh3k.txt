 ...or at least we didn't have any trees in Nebraska back then, so this is what the houses looked like. There were no trees, but that didn't stop people from building houses, so they just cut chunks of the sod out, and they made these sod houses. You guys have so many trees here, that probably never happened here. But the government was encouraging people to move west and to settle west, go west, young man. Some other advertisements that would have been in the papers, you know, the finest farming lands, Nebraska, the Garden of the West, 50 million acres of grain and grazing land, offered to settlers for $1.25 an acre. Or, here's a better deal, you can get 160 acres for $18 through the Homestead Act. And so there was a big push to move people to the west, because that's where the new land was, the Louisiana Purchase had brought in all of this ground, and a lot of it was not really settled yet. Now, this is the quote that Chris was referring to. This is the mindset of our esteemed government at the time. In 1909, from the chief of the Bureau of Soils, the Bureau of Soils would have been the precursor to the Soil Conservation Service. Professor Milton Whitney was in charge of our nation's soils through the government. He says, the soil is the one indestructible, immutable asset that the nation possesses. It is the one resource that cannot be exhausted and cannot be used up. And I show that to you because I want you to see what the mindset of not only the government, but a lot of the settlers were at the same time. Because we had huge expanses of land to settle, to be farmed. And so they were pushing people that direction and saying, we have so much soil, we can never use it up. It's one of our national things that cannot be exhausted. Now, Hugh Hammond Bennett, who we'll talk a lot about here this morning, he, in commenting on that statement by Professor Friedman, he says, I didn't know so much costly misinformation could be put into a single brief sentence. And isn't that so true? Isn't that so true? Think of the destruction that that mindset caused. And here's Hugh Hammond Bennett standing in a field that does look like it's been exhausted. It does look like it's on its way to being used up. And so we'll talk a little, a lot more about Hugh Hammond Bennett in a little bit here. But as World War I ended, you know, in the late 1900s, or in the, you know, around 1919 through 1920s, that period, there were more people pushing west. There was a recession after World War I. But there were also a lot of new technologies that always come out of a war. So there was farmers that bought a lot of tractors. They bought a lot of plows. And because of the recession, you know, when farmers aren't making money, farming a little bit, what do they do? They go out and farm a whole lot more to make even less. And so that's what happened. There were, between 1925 and 1930, more than 5 million acres of previously unfarmed land, basically of the virgin prairie out on the high plains where I'm from, was plowed up. That's a lot of land. With the help of all this mechanization, with all of these acres, farmers, like we do, do a great job. We produced record wheat crops in 1931. But guess what? Nobody had any money. It doesn't matter how much wheat you can produce if nobody could buy it. So this overproduction, along with the Great Depression, led to severely reduced markets. So again, farmers couldn't make enough money, so they plowed up more land. And so they broke more land to grow more grain to make less money. And that's what all this is setting the stage. You guys know what's coming, probably. On the heels of all of this, of all of these people moving west, of all of this land being plowed, we had one of the worst droughts in the history of our area. Multiple years of severe drought and very, very strong winds led to the greatest man-made ecological disaster in modern history. That's the Dust Bowl. Now, when I give this talk back home, people can relate to the Dust Bowl very, very well. Well, you guys, we probably donated some of our topsoil to you folks out here. I'm guessing that you guys didn't blow like this. And I would really like to be able to stand up here and tell you that this, you know, we solved this problem as it hasn't happened since. I'd like to be able to tell you that. But I'm going to tell you that there was stuff like this happening this week. Back in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska, when we flew out here on Saturday, the wind started really blowing on Sunday and Monday, 60, 70-mile-an-hour winds. I know there was over a million acres of ground in Oklahoma that burned. There were big wildfires in Texas and in Kansas. Hundreds of thousands of head of cattle died because they just literally got burned up. And now the ground is blowing again. So this is still happening, not on the scale, but this is what happened. And you've all seen pictures of the Dust Bowl, a huge, huge disaster. This one is from 1935, dust storm approaching Spearman, Texas. I've seen pictures exactly like that from recent times, recent years. Just utter destruction of the land blowing way. Just buried vehicles, buried equipment, buried buildings, utter destruction and desolation. And so that kind of sets the stage for this whole conservation movement. And the shifting from the mindset of our soil is the immutable resource that cannot be exhausted or used up. It's a shift in thinking. And so the 1934 yearbook of agriculture, the government reports that 35 million acres of formerly cultivated land have essentially been destroyed for crop production. 100 million acres now in crops have lost all or most of the topsoil. And 125 million acres of land now in crops are rapidly losing topsoil. So that's over 250 million acres of land that they basically said it's either gone, on its way to being gone, or almost there. Pretty dire situation. If you haven't been it, in 1934, on the heels of that, said now we have this evil with us. And when he's talking about evil, he's talking about the whole soil erosion. We have this evil with us on an enormous scale. And the nation may as well gird itself, gird tightly its belt for a continuing battle against this process of land wasting. That is, if we are to avoid the eventuality of becoming probably the world's most outstanding nation of subsoil farming. Which, of course, generally means bankrupt farming on bankrupt land. And, you know, that's what a lot of us have been doing. We've been farming bankrupt soils, and it's hard to make a living doing it because so much of our topsoil has been lost. I'll show you some pictures of that here in a little bit. So if you haven't been it, again, very much like what Chris was talking about, in my opinion, Mr. Bennett was a true visionary. Because even back in the 30s, when all of his colleagues were, you know, saying, you know, terraces and waterways and, you know, different things like this, he understood the problem. He understood that the problem with soil erosion is not a physical problem. It's an agronomic problem. He says soil erosion control on cultivated land is essentially an agronomic problem. It's the way that we're farming. It's not working. And so the government forms a bureaucracy. The Soil Erosion Service, the SES, was formed in 1933 and was established to kind of make these demonstration projects throughout the country. You can see all the different demonstration stations that they set up. But it was very limited in funding, very limited in scope, and it would expire in June of 1935. So this helped. It was the first step. But there was so much political infighting and bickering. I know that's hard to believe because that never happens now. But back then, this whole concept of soil erosion, everybody agreed something had to be done. But the Department of Agriculture wanted control over it, but so did the Department of the Interior. And so there was all this bickering back and forth within the government, and nothing was getting done, and the soils continued to blow. And so in 1935, at the height of the dust storm, in the midst of all this political infighting and nothing getting done because they were just arguing about turf wars, and some of this is kind of an urban legend. We don't know how much of this actually happened. We do know the dust storm happened. The worst dust storm of the entire dust hole happened in March of 1935. And it started down in Texas, and it blew up through Oklahoma, came up through Kansas, probably took some of the topsoil from right in Webster County, Nebraska, where we farm. And it was such a sustained windstorm, it just made its way across the entire United States. And Hugh Hammond Bennett was testifying before Congress, and he was getting telegraphs on a regular basis from his friends across the country. So he was tracking this cloud of dust, this enormous, huge cloud of dust, as it made its way across the Midwest, as it crossed the Mississippi River, and it just kept marching eastward. And on March 20th, 1935, this is what Washington, D.C., looked like. This is a clear day. That's not fog. That's not smoke. That's the Lincoln Memorial. And you can barely see the sun, but it's all but blotted out because of dust. Dust from Texas and Oklahoma and Kansas and Nebraska. It made it all the way to Washington, D.C. And this is where kind of the urban legend or the – it makes a good story anyway. Hugh Hammond Bennett was testifying before Congress, trying to get legislation passed to do something, to get the government to do something about soil erosion. And the legend has it that as he's testifying, and, you know, I can picture the congressman kind of not paying attention or dropping off to sleep or whatever. He walks over to the windows of the room where they're testifying, and he throws open the curtains, and this is the type of thing they see. And he says, gentlemen, this is Kansas passing by the window. And that got their attention. The dust storm that blew all the way through and actually affected the politicians in D.C. Sadly, that's what it took, I guess. But that got them moving. That got them doing something. And so in April, less than a month later, they passed Public Law 74-46. And here's what they said. They said the wastage of soil and moisture resources. And I like that, that they recognize it's not just soil, but moisture resources on farm, grazing, and forest lands is a menace to the national welfare. And they established the soil conservation service, a permanent agency, not a temporary thing, as a permanent thing, a permanent division of the USDA. So they gave control to the Department of Agriculture, which is good. You could be working for the Department of the Interior. I don't think I do you better. But they established a permanent agency. The SCS would later be renamed to the NRCS, the Natural Resource Conservation Service. So this was the start of kind of this, what I would call the conservation movement in the United States. Now, I make a lot of fun of the government because they do some silly things. But I will give them credit. They understood that 75% of the land in the United States is privately owned. And they understood that for some unknown reasons, farmers inherently don't trust the government for some reason. We don't know why. But they understood that if there was really going to be effective change in soil conservation, it had to be more than just a government program. They couldn't just force a government program on all these private landowners. And so, to me, this is one of the most successful government-private partnerships ever created in this country. And it's been very successful and very effective. In 1937, FDR wrote to all the state governors and encouraged them to write their own legislation in their states to allow landowners to organize and form local soil and water conservation districts. And they were to work in conjunction with this newly formed soil conservation service. And the partnership between the government agency and the locally organized, locally controlled soil and water conservation district has been very, very successful, in my opinion. So, in 1937, Brown County, soil and water conservation district in North Carolina was formed. And nearly 3,000 more were to follow. And so, there's just a few of them listed here. There's almost every county in the United States is part of a soil and water conservation district. It's a great, great partnership between private landowners and the government entity. And so, conservation, that's how we started. Conservation in this country started with trying to stop erosion, literally to stop the dust bowl. How can we stop the high plains from blowing away? That's how it started. It continued largely from the mid-1930s until, really, I think now, it has continued with focusing on preventing erosion. And as Chris said, you know, we've got terraces, we've got waterways. There was a big emphasis, you know, back in the 70s and 80s on reduced tillage or conservation tillage. You know, the 90s and the 2000s, a lot, you know, no-till, a lot of promotion of no-till. You know, get your conservation plan put together. All these things are great things. Like what Chris was saying, these are all good things. But we focus mainly on trying to prevent erosion. And we've got this T factor. But we still tolerate soil loss. We'll talk about the T, which is the maximum amount of erosion at which the quality of a soil as a medium for plant growth can be maintained. That's what's called T, or tolerance. But I'm here to challenge this a little bit this morning. And to challenge myself as well, because we find that we need to move beyond that. We need to change the way that we think. And Albert Einstein said we cannot solve our problems with the same thinking that we used when we created them. And it's time that we change the way that we think. We need to move beyond preventing soil erosion. We need to move beyond tolerating soil erosion. We need to move beyond sustainable even. That's kind of been a hot word here in the last few years, sustainable farming. And I think you guys had Dave Brown here a couple years ago. I've heard Dave say this many times. Why would I want to sustain a resource? Why would I want to sustain my soil when it's already degraded? I don't want to do that. We can do better. And it's time we move on, in my opinion, in our conservation movement to rebuilding our nation's soils. And not just tolerate soil erosion. Not just sustain what we have. But to rebuild our nation's soils. And it's going to be a huge task for us to do. Here's the enormity of this task. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got 900 million acres of farmland in the United States. And the vast majority has experienced significant degradation through erosion and loss of organic matter. And I'm not just talking about how much topsoil we've lost, although that's really important. We'll also talk about how much organic matter we've lost. I would suspect none of you have ever seen this in person. No? Nobody? Okay. This is from a rest stop of all places. This is a rest stop in Iowa. If you ever drive down Interstate 80, Iowa's got the best rest stops in the country. Very cool. Each one of them kind of has a theme. And they spend a lot of money. And they do it upright. A lot of things I don't like about Iowa. This is pretty good. So this particular rest stop on I-80 in Iowa is all dedicated to soil. And I don't know exactly what they're trying to show us here. I don't know what their intent was. But what they're showing, this is the deprogression, if you will, of topsoil in Iowa. Iowa has some of the best soils in the entire world. So in 1850, they're showing you the subsoil here and then the black column, that's how much topsoil they had. That's 10 to 12 feet. And this is the part of Iowa where this thing was. 10 to 12 feet of topsoil in 1850 when people would have came there and started farming. By 1900, look at that, they've lost 2 to 3 feet. By 1950, lost another couple feet. By the 1970s, lost a couple more feet. And by the year 2000, they're down to that. Now, they still have more topsoil than most of us start with. And they don't probably even understand how much they've lost because they still have a fair amount. I say most people would be thrilled to have that much to start with. But look at the percentage that they've lost. They've lost almost two-thirds of their topsoil. Now, where I farm, where you farm, none of us have lost 8 feet of topsoil. But I'll bet you that most of us have lost 50 to 60 to 70 percent of the topsoil that we started with. That's pretty standard from anything that's been farmed for more than 100 years. You're going to see over half the topsoil already gone. And in my opinion, you know, every area should have one of these as a monument to what has happened so that we can look at it. And hopefully, you know, when my grandchildren drive down Interstate 80 in Iowa, maybe they can add on to this. And maybe we'll see that thing start coming back up. Because it can be done. And we're going to talk about how can we rebuild this? How can we reduce this trend? And it's not just about topsoil depth, but it's about organic matter. In addition to losing all of our topsoil, we've lost the majority of the organic matter that we started with as well. Most people would say that the majority of the soils in the United States have lost 60 to 70 percent of the original organic matter. And you can see that. Just go out where something has been farmed for many, many years. And then compare it to like a fence line that hasn't been farmed. And just look at the color. One of the, I think it's the NRCS booth out in the hallway here, has a really good display there talking about soil color and what that tells you. The dark color comes from carbon. Carbon comes from organic matter. And the darker the soil, for the most part, the darker the soil, the more organic matter it has. And so we started out with this, and now we've got a lot of this. This is a picture of Oklahoma. You've probably all seen pictures of Oklahoma famous for their red soil. I was at a conference, I was speaking at a conference out in western Oklahoma last year, and there was an old guy on the bus with us. And he was an old farmer, and he was talking about his grandfather. So this would have been the grandfather of an old guy, so this would have been, you know, back, you know, 100 years ago probably. He said, and I've never heard anybody say this before, but the other guys on the bus agreed with him. He said, I can remember my grandfather saying when they moved here, because they would have been one of the first generation to move to Oklahoma, the soil was not red. I was like, what? Oklahoma has always had red soil. It's the iron. It's the iron in the soil that makes it red. And that's true. The iron's always been there. But when they first started farming it, it had enough organic matter that it was a very dark brown color. It wasn't bright red like this. It was a dark brown. They lost their carbon. They still have the iron, and that's why it looks like this. Most of these soils in western Oklahoma have less than half a percent organic matter. Half a percent. No wonder they struggle to get much going. No wonder it kind of looks like this. Pretty sad. So we've got a big, big project ahead of us if we're going to rebuild our soils in our country. And any time I think about a big rebuilding project, my mind goes to the story of Nehemiah. Nehemiah also had a huge rebuilding project that he wanted to undertake. And so I want to take us back in history, take us back in time, and look at Nehemiah's story. And then I want to pull out some points that I think that Nehemiah did that we need to be doing if we're going to rebuild the soils, not only around us, not only in Pennsylvania, but in Nebraska, but in our whole country. And so I want to just briefly look at a little bit of history and then apply that to our future. So in the year 586 BC, long time ago, the Babylonians attacked Jerusalem. Okay. And you got to think Babylonian, the Babylonian empire was basically modern day, modern day Iraq. Jerusalem is still Jerusalem. Okay. So they're still, they were fighting back then. They're still fighting. But in 586, the Babylonians came in, they destroyed Jerusalem. They burned down the temple. They broke down the city walls. And that's important because back then every city was its own little nation or its own little fiefdom. And if you didn't have a wall around your city to keep other people out, you had no protection. Your neighbors could just stroll in and take whatever they wanted to. So a city wall was incredibly important back in those days. And they carried all the people off into exile. 47 years later, Persia defeats Babylonian, the Babylonians. And Persian is modern day Iran. So basically the Jews that were in captivity get moved from Babylon to Persia, Iraq to Iran. And as part of defeating the Babylonians, all of these Jewish people are moved over to Persia. Three years after this, the emperor of Persia, Cyrus, allowed a few Jews to return to Jerusalem. A guy named Zerubbabel leads the first wave of Jews to return. They rebuild the temple over a 20-year period, but they don't do anything with the city wall. And I'm telling you all this because it sets the stage for our story. 61 years later, Ezra leads the second group of Jews to return to Jerusalem. And this time it's a larger number. It's about 1,500 men and their families go back to Jerusalem. So now they're starting to get more and more people back there. And then 10 years after that larger group goes back is where the book of Nehemiah starts. Okay, so I set all that up so we can see what happens in the life of Nehemiah. But before we do this, I want to just briefly tell you who Nehemiah was. Nehemiah was a Jew. He probably was not born in Jerusalem. He likely was born in Babylon because he would have been born from parents that would have been captured and taken to Babylon and then later moved to Persia. And it says in there that he's the cupbearer to the king. Now that doesn't mean anything to us today, but it was a very important position back then. And what this was, it's kind of a good thing, bad thing kind of a deal. It's a good thing because it's a very prestigious position because basically what you did is before you took any wine to the king, you had to taste it. Because even back then, probably especially back then, there was a lot of political infighting and a lot of assassination attempts. So what better way than to try to poison the king if you wanted to get rid of him? So they would always have someone taste the wine before the king did. Okay? If you didn't die, it's good for the king to drink. All right, go ahead. So it's one of those deals where I trust you enough to taste my wine, but if you die, we can replace you. Kind of one of those deals. So he was still a slave, but he had a very high position. He was a very trusted individual because he was a cupbearer to the king. And so this is where we start the story of Nehemiah. Remember, it's 10 years after this group of 1,500 families moved to Jerusalem. And Nehemiah said, now it happened that some men from Judah, from Jerusalem, they were coming back to Persia. And I asked them concerning the Jews who had basically returned to Jerusalem. And he asked them, how's it going? How's things going over there? I haven't really heard. I knew this group went back. And they said to me, the remnant there in the province who survived the captivity are in great distress and reproach. They're in bad shape. Because the wall of Jerusalem is broken down and its gates are burned with fire. And so this starts Nehemiah on this journey to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. And we're going to see how big of a task this is. This is no small thing. This is not going out and putting up chain link fence, keep your dog in kind of thing. This is a big deal. And so this sets the stage for this rebuilding project that Nehemiah undertook. And I think we can glean lots of good information out of this as to what we need to do to rebuild our soils. And specifically, we're going to look at we need to have the right leaders. We need to have the right workers. And we need to have the right tools if we're going to rebuild and repair and restore the soils that have been entrusted to us. Okay? So that's what I want to do. So first of all, we need to have the right leaders. No good project can survive or even get started without having the right leaders, having good leadership. And there's three characteristics of leaders that I wanted to share from you that Nehemiah exhibits. And I see exhibited in many of the leaders in our soil health movement. Number one, they care deeply. They care very deeply. Nehemiah did not find out about the walls by accident. He asked. These guys were coming through Persia. He knew that they were from Jerusalem. And he specifically asked them, how are things going back there? What's going on back there in Jerusalem? He would never have known this if he hadn't asked. And once he asked and found out, verse 4 says, when I heard these words, when he heard that the walls were still broken down and that the people were basically at the mercy of their neighbors, he said, I sat down and I wept and I mourned for days. Now, I'm not saying that as leaders of the soil health movement, anyone needs to sit down and mourn and weep for days. But maybe we should. You know, when we see pictures of a field blowing or a field washing away, and I'm sure you guys experience much more water erosion here than wind erosion, but it doesn't matter because you're losing soil. When you see that, it shouldn't hurt your heart. It shouldn't hurt. It shouldn't hurt your heart. Because that's soil that we're not going to get back again. And so we need leaders that care deeply. And I think within our soil health movement, from the very national level all the way down to the local conservation district level, we do have a lot of good leaders. And I want to encourage people in here that I think every single one of you has not only the ability, but I'm going to tell you at some point in your life, you're going to have the responsibility to be a leader. Whether it's in the soil health movement or some other movement, you will be called on to lead. Now, you may only be leading a small group, maybe yourself and your family and a few neighbors. You may be asked at some point to serve on your local conservation district board. And by the way, if you ever get that opportunity, if there's an opening available, I would highly encourage you to consider doing that. Because that whole thing was set up to be ran by private landowners. And we need the best private landowners to be on those boards to set those policies and to direct those programs. So I would encourage each of you not to tune out when I'm talking about leaders because you think, well, I'll tune back in when he talks about workers. Most of us, all of us in this room are going to end up being both leaders and workers. So leaders care deeply. They see that erosion going on and they say, that's not right. We've got to do something about that. Nehemiah felt that way. He sat down and he mourned and he wept for days. Then after they understand, once they recognize the problem, they prepare thoroughly. They don't just jump in and try to start fixing things. They prepare themselves thoroughly first. Now, Nehemiah, I believe when he heard the report that these walls were broken down, I believe he started to make a plan. He didn't know if he'd be successful, but I believe that he had a plan to rebuild the walls in Jerusalem. But before he started, he writes in there that he prayed and he fasted for four days. That's how he prepared. He planned. He prayed. He prayed. He fasted. Now, again, as leaders, we don't necessarily have to pray and fast for four days before we go out and try to rebuild our soils. But we need to prepare thoroughly. Don't just jump into things without being prepared. And once you're prepared thoroughly, then you act boldly. Okay? That's a hallmark of leadership is you act boldly. You don't do little things. You act boldly. But you don't act boldly until you prepare thoroughly. We'll see how this played out in Nehemiah's life. Okay? Remember Nehemiah's position. He was a cupbearer to the king. He had an important job. The king depended upon him. The king trusted him with his life, essentially. But yet he was still a slave. He wasn't really in a position to say, I need to take a few days off and go do this little project I'm hatching up. So here's what it says in chapter 2. So as Nehemiah says, I took up the wine and I gave it to the king. Now, I had not been sad in his presence before. So the king said to me, why is your face sad, though you are not sick? This is nothing but sadness of heart. Then I was very much afraid. I said to the king, let the king live forever. Why should my face not be sad when the city, the place of my father's tombs, lies desolate and its gates have been consumed by fire? Then the king said to me, what would you request? What do you want to do, Nehemiah? I understand your situation now. What do you want to do? So I prayed to the God of heaven and I said to the king, if it please the king and if your servant has found favor before you, send me to Judah. Send me to Jerusalem, to the city of my father's tombs, that I may rebuild it. Then the king said to me, the queen said to beside him, how long will your journey be and when will you return? So it pleased the king to send me and I gave him a definite time. You see, Nehemiah had prepared for this moment. He was scared to death because he didn't know what the king was going to say when he says, can I take some time off and go do this? But when the king said, how long is it going to take? He had an answer for it. So leaders, this is a bold move. This is acting boldly, but it's being prepared thoroughly first. And so that's what leaders do. They care deeply. They prepare thoroughly. And then they act boldly. And as leaders in rebuilding and repairing our soils, that's what we need to do too. Whether you're just leading your own family or your own farming operation, whether you're a leader on the district conservation board, maybe you're at the state level, maybe at the national level, you'll be called upon at some point in time to be a leader. You know, FFA students, you guys talk about leadership all the time. You guys understand that very, very well. But that's what leaders do. That's what leaders do. Okay. So once we have the right leadership in place, and I think we do have a lot of good leadership in place in the soil health movement, a lot of them have been here speaking to you over the last couple years. You've had some of the best. Then we need to focus on the right workers because the leaders are great. Leadership is important, but leadership doesn't always get all the work done. Okay. That falls on the backs of the workers. And the first characteristic of the workers that I want to share with you is they have to have a common vision. They have to have a common vision. Look at how Nehemiah does this. Okay. He's back in Jerusalem. He says, So I went up at night by the rabini night, and I inspected the wall, what was left of the wall. Then I said to the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, and the rest who did the work. So basically, he's talking to the workers. You see the bad situation we are in, that Jerusalem is desolate and its gates are burned with fire. Come, let us rebuild the walls of Jerusalem so that we will no longer be a reproach. I told them how the hand of my God had been favorable to me and also about the king's words which he had spoken to me. Then they said, here's the worker buy-in. Then they said, let us arise and build. So they put their hands to the good work. You see how he did that? He got this, this, and we'll talk about these workers. He did not, he was not addressing the union of stonemasons that could really do a good job building a wall. He's talking to a bunch of priests and nobles, lawyers, preachers, teachers, not blue-collar workers that knew how to build a wall. But yet he was saying, this is the situation we're in. Here's where we need to go. And look at how they bought in. They said, let us arise and build. Good leaders inspire like this. So they put their hands to the good work. And what a tribute to this conference it would be, when we leave here this afternoon, if we would maybe not say this, maybe we should say it. Let us arise and rebuild the soil. And we put our hands to that good work. We have to get the workers to buy in. We have to have a common vision. That's the job of the leaders to initiate it. But it's the responsibility of the workers to accept it and to understand it. So once they have a common vision, they have to be willing to learn. Because dedication to a cause is more important than a pre-existing skill set if the person is willing to learn. Because Nehemiah, like I said, he did not have a bunch of stonemasons. He didn't have a bunch of carpenters at his disposal. He was talking to a bunch of priests, lawyers, rabbis, you know, people that didn't have a lot of building experience. That's probably the reason the wall had never been rebuilt. They didn't really know what they were doing. But they were willing to learn. And I would dare say that a lot of you in this room do have some pre-existing skills when it comes to rebuilding the soil. But there's going to be lots of other workers that we need to bring on board. And they may be hesitant to try no-till. They may be hesitant to try cover crop because they say, well, I've never done that before. Or that won't work here. Well, we've heard that one a lot, haven't we? Yeah, I should be keeping a list of all the excuses that people give. Why? Well, that works in Nebraska. That works in North Dakota. But that won't work here. It will work. Not the same things that I do. Not the same things that Gabe Brown does. But the principles will work. And you have to be willing to learn to figure out how to apply these principles that we're going to be talking about throughout the rest of this day. You have to figure out how to apply those principles to your operation and make them work. You have to be willing to learn. And that's much more important than already knowing what you're doing. Some of the most successful people at rebuilding their soils had no farming background whatsoever. Case in point, Gabe Brown. Gabe Brown was a banker. He didn't grow up on a farm. He had no farming experience. You know, several years of hail and drought drove him to the verge of bankruptcy. And he had nowhere else to turn other than to do what he started doing. And he's definitely one of the leaders of this whole movement, the regenerative agriculture movement. So dedication to the cause and willingness to learn is much more important than already knowing what you're doing. And number three, you can't get overwhelmed. Remember, we have 900 million acres to rebuild. That's overwhelming. What did Nehemiah face? Here's what artist rendered what the city of Jerusalem would have looked like at the time of Nehemiah. This wall that they're going to rebuild is a mile in circumference. Think about walking a mile. That's quite a ways. The average height of this wall would have been 15 feet high. Okay? So that's probably, you know, almost to the top of the ceiling here. 12 feet wide at the bottom. 7 feet wide at the top. 10 big, large, wooden gates that were all burned. 6 towers. They had these kind of these watch tower type things. And he had a bunch of unskilled workers. And as we're going to see, it was a hostile work environment. His neighbors didn't want him to succeed. This was an overwhelming task. Nehemiah had an overwhelming task on his hands. So how did he handle it? Well, like I said, we've got overwhelming on our hands, too, with 900 billion acres of farmland. Lots of erosion. Both water and wind. And people keep throwing this in our face, too, don't they? Oh, you guys got to feed 10 billion people by the year 2050. You know, better get going on that. And maybe some of us work in hostile work environments. We'll talk about that. So here's what Nehemiah did. This is genius. Above the horse gate, the priest carried out repairs, each in front of his house. After them, Zadok, the son of Emer, carried out repairs in front of his house. After him, Meshulam, the son of Berechiah, carried out repairs in front of his own quarters. You see the pattern? You see what Nehemiah did to overcome being overwhelmed? Basically, he says in there, each of you to your own work. Each to his own work. In essence, he was saying, fix the part of the wall that's right outside your house first, because that's what you're going to be most motivated to do. That's what's going to be the easiest for you to do, because it's just right there. And then you can start helping your neighbor. And that's exactly what we need to do as workers in this rebuilding the soil movement, is we need to rebuild the soils that we're farming first. That's where we need to focus, and I think that's what we're doing. But we need to not look at all 900 million acres. We need to look at that portion of the work that God has given us to say grace over on a daily basis. And then once we get that going, then we can expand. We can move out. If we don't do that, if we don't focus on our own little piece of the pie initially, it's way too easy to get overwhelmed. But then once we get it done in front of our own house, then we branch out. Then we start helping our neighbors get their work done. And the last part of being a good worker is you have to be courageous. This is not going to be an easy thing. It was not an easy thing in Nehemiah's day. They were under a lot more distress than we probably will be. But look at this. Not everyone's going to support your work. If you go out and you start changing the way that you farm because you're going to try to rebuild or regenerate or repair your soils, you've got to do some things differently than what you've done in the past, most likely. Not everyone's going to support that. You may get made fun of by some of your neighbors. You know, Russ will talk about some of those experiences. I'm sure our neighbors talk about us. We just don't go to the coffee shop, so we don't hear it, but I'm guessing they do. My dad goes. I'll have to ask him what they say about it. But listen to what his neighbors were saying. Remember I said each kind of city around that area was kind of its own little nation, its own little gang? Sien Belay and Tobiah were two leaders of these other gangs or cities around. When they heard about it, it meaning Nehemiah coming back to rebuild the city, it was very displeasing that someone had come to seek the welfare of the sons of Israel. They didn't like it. They liked the fact that Jerusalem had no law. Why? Because they could ride in there any time they wanted to and take whatever they wanted. They had free access to the whole city. And they could come and go as they pleased. They could take as they pleased. They had no protection. They had a pretty good deal. But they would be ridiculed for your work. I would imagine that some of you in here have been ridiculed for some of the farming practices you've tried to implement. Look what happened in Nehemiah's time. When Samuel heard that we were rebuilding the wall, he became furious and very angry, and he mocked the Jews. He spoke in the presence of his brothers and the wealthy men of Samaria and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? Are they going to restore it for themselves? Can they offer sacrifices? Can they finish it in a day? Can they revive the stones from the dusty rubble, even the burned ones? And then Tobiah, the Ammonite, was near him and said, Even what they're building, if a fox should jump on it, he would break their stone wall down. And I don't think that was probably true, but he was making fun of them. They were being ridiculed for the work that they were doing, and that may happen to us. That may happen to you. I have a friend in Louisiana. He's a very progressive, very good farmer. He's trying to implement cover crops in a really tough area where they grow a lot of rice. His neighbors have actually come to him, actually have come up and had the boldness to come up to him and say, We think that maybe you should find another place to farm. Because all this cover cropping stuff that you're doing makes it really hard for us to bring the airplanes in and just spray everything like what we're used to doing. They've actually come to him and said, We think it's time for you to move on. Well, he's not moving on. They're going to have to put up with it. But that happens. That happens. If it doesn't happen here, it's happening somewhere. You're going to get ridiculed. Now, hopefully, it never goes this far where you're the subject of plotting and attacks. So when San Belay and Tobiah and all these other guys heard that the repairs of the walls of Jerusalem went on, that the ridicule didn't stop them, and the breaches began to be closed. They were very angry. All of them conspired together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause a disturbance in it. They're actually plotting to attack them. Now, again, I hope, I really hope and pray that that never happens to us as we're trying to rebuild our soils. Hopefully, it doesn't go that far. But what did Nehemiah do? How do you help workers to be courageous when you're faced with this hostile work environment? Again, it goes back to leadership. Leadership prepares workers. So Nehemiah says, We pray to our God, and because of them, we set up a guard against them day and night. So you don't just sit back and do nothing. You make a plan. So Nehemiah's plan, they set up a guard against these guys day and night, and they prepared themselves. It says, Those who were rebuilding the wall and those who carried burdens took their load with one hand, doing the work, with the other hand holding a weapon. Okay? So this is the original conceal and carry, although I guess they probably weren't concealing, but they were carrying. It literally says they had a trial in one hand laying stone, and they had a sword in the other hand ready to be attacked. Because they knew that was imminent. That was a very real possibility. So courageous workers, you know, have good leaders inspiring them, but you also have to be prepared for whatever comes. And number three, you continue the work in spite of the threats. Just like my friend in Louisiana, you know, that wasn't necessarily a threat. Well, maybe it was. I don't know. But he's continuing the work that he does in spite of those threats. Those who were rebuilding the wall, again, it says they took their load in one hand, and they took the sword in the other hand. So every job, well, I guess, let me just go back here a second. So courageous workers, you know, have those good leaders. They have a good plan. They're prepared, and they continue the work in spite of the threat. So as workers, we need to be prepared for having people ridicule us. We need to be prepared for people not supporting us. But we need to continue the work in spite of the threats. And that's why conferences like this are so good. Because we can come together here, and we can talk about all these crazy ideas that we're thinking about doing. And we know we've got people that will support us. Now, when you go back out to your own areas, maybe not so much. But that's the value and the importance of having conferences like this. So I applaud Chris and his team for putting these on and allowing me to come here and share this. So after you have the leaders, after you have the workers, the last thing that you need is the tools. Because you can't accomplish big things without using good tools. Now, the Bible does not tell us anything about the tools that they would have used to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. So I'm just guessing, speculating. I went on Google and just kind of looked for tools. They probably had some blocking tackles to lift the big stones up. They would have had, you know, in our standards, pretty primitive tools. But they used, I'm confident that they would have used the best tools that they had at the time. Okay? I'm not going to talk about any of these because that's not important. The important thing is, is are you using the best tools that are available to you? And in our task, our job of rebuilding our soils, we have some great tools at our disposal. And we're going to be spending the rest of this conference talking about a lot of these tools. So I'm just going to briefly highlight them. And then we'll talk about them in more detail. Cover crops are one of the most important tools for rebuilding our soils. And as you'll see throughout the day, they're important because they put into the soil without taking out. Okay? They give without taking. And that's the value of a cover crop. And cover crops are one of the missing links that we have largely ignored. You know, our great-grandfathers, grandfathers, great-grandfathers, they used cover crops. You know, we think we're so smart because we found cover crops. Now, we just rediscovered what our ancestors would have known. They didn't know why they worked, but they just knew they worked. That was enough for them. And they used them because they knew that they could put nutrients back into the soil and they could protect their soils and rebuild their soils by using cover crops. So cover crops are one of the tools. No-till farming. This is what it looks like when we plant corn. We want to do as little disturbance in the soil as possible. This is planted in the wheat sow that had a cover crop following it. And you can kind of see right here maybe this is an old radish. And that corn is coming up right up through that old radish carcass. So no-till farming, not disturbing the ground any more than you have to, is another really good tool. Keep the soil covered. Keep the soil covered. It's extremely important to do that. If you don't keep the soil covered at every opportunity that you have, none of these other tools are going to work very well. They lose their effectiveness if your soil is bare and exposed. Soil biology is a huge one. One, we need to be rebuilding our soil biologically. And I'm going to spend a lot of time this afternoon talking about this. Russ is going to show you some pictures too that are going to draw this out. This is a picture of our soil here in Nebraska. And when we first started farming, or when we first started no-tilling back in the mid-90s, the average organic matter level on our farm was about 1.7. Okay, our native organic matter. And that's what you should always compare yourself to. What was it before we started farming? You know, in our area, that's probably between 5 and 6. If we go, like, to a fence line or to native prairie, we take an organic matter level, it's going to be between 5 and 6. So we were about 1.6 and 1.7 back in the mid-90s. 20 years of no-till brought us up a full point. We got up to about 2.7. Pretty good, we thought. But we kind of started leveling off and we weren't seeing any really big changes anymore. When we started using cover crops back in 2008, 2008, 2009, we've seen almost another full point, about 3 quarters to 8 tenths of a point in the last 7 or 8 years. Almost as much as the previous 20 years combined because we started using cover crops. And a large part of that is because we started getting the soil biology more involved. We'll talk a lot about this guy here. This is mycorrhizal fungi. We'll talk about that this afternoon as well. Beneficial insects can be a huge tool in rebuilding our soils as well. And then properly managed livestock. Properly managed livestock. Russ is going to do a great job talking about that as well. So when we have all these tools in place and we have the right leaders and we have the right workers, we can do some really good things. When we put all those things in place. So my question to you is, how long did it take Nehemiah and the Jews to rebuild that wall? Okay? Remember, it's a mile in circumference. 15 feet high. 12 feet wide at the base. 7 feet high at the top. 10 different large wooden gates. 6 towers. How long would it have taken them to do that? Hostile work environment. These guys attacking it. How long did it take? Well, let's find out. So the wall was completed on the 25th of the month of Hillel in 52 days. 52 days. How did they do that? If you would have asked me that question, I would have said, well, 5 years, 6 years, 10 years. I don't know. That's a big project. 52 days. They got this done. Because they had the right leaders and they had the right workers and they were using the best tools available to them. It doesn't take as long as what you think. How long will it take us to rebuild our soils? What are the... When you took soils class, how long did they say it would take to build an inch of topsoil? Hundreds of years. Thousands of years. And that's true if all you're doing is letting a rock be exposed to the elements. Because that's what they're talking about. They're not talking about applying the best tools of agronomy that we have to the situation. They're talking about just weathering a rock. It's not going to take us as long as we think. Like I said, our soils, we have rebuilt our organic matter. We've doubled our organic matter over the last 25 years. And we may not restore all of the topsoil. It may take us a long time because we've lost a lot of topsoil just like everyone else has. We may not be able to rebuild the depth, but we're putting the organic matter back into the soil. And that's a big part of rebuilding. Before we ever rebuild the depth, we're going to have to rebuild the quality of what we still have left. Then we can focus on rebuilding the depth. I talked to you about Oklahoma and the red soils and how the old guy said, as Grandpa said, when we started farming here, these soils weren't red. Look at this. This is my friend, Alan Mendeman. He farms in western Oklahoma. His neighbor's soils are all red, just like that picture I showed you earlier. This is what his soil looks like. Alan has been no-tilling for over 25 years. He has a very diverse crop rotation. He uses cover crops. In my opinion, he's one of the best farmers in Oklahoma. He grows a lot of the seed that we sell. A lot of the stuff from the south comes from Alan. Look at the color of his soil. Now, that would look pretty bad compared to what Iowa looks like. But for western Oklahoma, come on. That looks pretty darn good. He has changed the color of his soil. He's putting the carbon back. He's rebuilding the soil. And he's done that in 20 or 25 years. Not hundreds of years. Not thousands of years. Dave Bram, I think, has he spoken here? Okay. He was here last year. I'm sure you saw some of these pictures. NRCS actually had to come in and reclassify Dave's soils. He's changed them so much that when they came through with the original soil survey, they come back and look at him again. And they said, these aren't the same soils. I'm sure Dave said, well, I didn't bring new soil in. But he's done no-till. He's done cover crops. Dave's done cover crops for probably 30 years. And he's changed his soil so much that they've actually had to reclassify some of them because he's changed the color and the texture so much. So we can do this. We can change things much quicker than what we initially thought. If we have the right leaders and we have the right workers and we have the right tools, we can pull all this together. And we can do it much quicker than we thought. I believe that we do have all of these things in place. Now it's just up to us to rise up and rebuild our soils. So thank you very much. Do we have time for a couple of questions? We have about two minutes. We have about two minutes. Does anybody have a question before we move on here? I do want to say I know they're filming this. This will be made available probably later. But I have this talk on YouTube. The one I'm doing this afternoon is, too, if you want to listen again or if you want to share this with someone, you can just go to YouTube. Search for Green Cover Seed. We have a YouTube channel there. Also, I just want to point out, I have, we have some soil health resource guides that you're welcome to take. We've got a couple boxes. There's a table out in the hallway here. Actually, Green Armor Seeds. Mark Rohrbach, he's just down the road here at Catawissa. Mark works with us at helping sell some seed in this area. So stop by his table out in the hallway there. These are, these are a 44-page resource guide. It's not just about cover crops. It really talks a lot about soil health. Lots of pictures in there. Lots of good information. So make sure you stop by and grab one of those over there at Mark's table as well. We appreciate that. And this afternoon, I'll be talking a lot more about the tools that we're using. And that may generate some additional questions. So thank you very much for your time and your attention.
