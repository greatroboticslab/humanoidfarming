 Hi neighbor, today we're going to be talking about five ways you can go out and amend your sandy soil. I know, I have it too. Don't believe me? Just look at the ground right there. There's some things we can do. So I'm going to give you the five ways, plus I'm going to talk to you kind of through why they work, how they work, kind of the pros and cons of them so that you can make the right decisions for your garden. So number one, this is going to be just buy more soil. Just get soil, put it on top of the sandy soil, don't even deal with it. Number two, get mulch. Do back to Eden method. Layer it on top and let it break down. Number three, chop and drop. Grow it, chop it, drop it. Fix your sandy soil. Number four, compost. Have food scraps, have yard waste, put it in a bin, let it cook, let something eat it and poop it out. One of those things and fix your sandy soil. And number five, charred wood ashes or biochar.
