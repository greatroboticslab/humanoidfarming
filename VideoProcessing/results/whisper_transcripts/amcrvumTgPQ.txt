 Imagine a small, soft, moist creature raised in the billions to create valuable medicinal products. That creature is the leech. A creature with an appearance that gives many people chills, with an unappealing shape, but a crucial role in a billion-dollar industry in China. Leeches are not simply left to live in ponds. They are carefully cared for and cultivated. What makes this strange creature so special? Why are people willing to invest in farms, raising and nurturing billions of leeches to supply the market? Join me as we explore this unique process, from the leech's natural habitat to its transformation into a valuable medicinal product. Let's begin the journey from muddy ponds, where leeches thrive, to unique dried leech products. Leeches are hermaphrodites, meaning each leech has both male and female reproductive organs, but they still require another leech for reproduction. After mating, the female leech lays eggs in a moist, stable temperature environment to increase hatching success. The female creates egg cocoons, each containing 3 to 8 eggs. On average, a female leech can produce 65.25 offspring and up to 136 offspring in its lifetime. Each leech egg cocoon contains 3 to 8 eggs, and within 2 to 3 weeks, these eggs hatch into young leeches. This characteristic allows leech farms to grow large populations quickly. After hatching, young leeches are nurtured in a special environment to help them grow strong before reaching adulthood. The leech's habitat is crucial for optimal growth. Leech's need ponds with clean but not clear water, stable pH, and a water temperature between 15 to 25 dvd. Water is regularly pumped and filtered to avoid contamination, and aquatic plants are added to provide shelter and attachment surfaces for the leeches. Besides creating a suitable environment, the leech's diet is also essential. They are fed small animals like snails, clams, fish, organic matter, or even animal serum to help them grow healthily and reach the ideal size. An adult leech can grow to 10-15 then 30 nitsat 10-30 min long, and ponds can house millions of leeches. Leech's selected for breeding must be active, have smooth skin, bright color, and no injuries. With a density of thousands per square meter, a large farm can produce millions of leeches annually, meeting the enormous demand in the medicinal market. Once they reach the ideal size, the leeches are ready for harvest, at which point they are turned into economically valuable products. When leeches reach the required size, they are harvested for processing. Each harvested leech undergoes a strict cleaning process to ensure it is free from impurities. After cleaning, leeches are threaded onto skewers and sun-dried naturally or dried in ovens to retain nutrients. Drying extends storage time and is a crucial step in creating high-quality dried leech products. A large farm can harvest and process hundreds of thousands of leeches monthly. Once processed, dried leeches can be stored and transported easily to serve the medical and pharmaceutical industries. These dried leeches undergo further processing and quality checks before reaching consumers and medicinal manufacturers. Dried leeches are an important medicinal ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, used in many remedies for treating diseases. Additionally, erudin, a substance found in leeches, helps prevent blood clotting, supports circulation, and reduces the risk of blood vessel blockages. Not only that, erudin is also used in modern medicine for treating cardiovascular diseases and blood clotting issues. This is why leeches are not merely creatures, but also valuable medicinal resources. Thanks to their high medicinal value, dried leeches have become an export product to many countries worldwide, significantly contributing to the medical economy. From leech ponds in China, leeches are nurtured, harvested, and processed into valuable medicinal products. This is not only an economic sector, but also an essential part of both traditional and modern medicine.
