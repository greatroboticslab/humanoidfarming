 Reviewer.pxs.tv Sometime in the past few months, the seven billionth person arrived on this planet. Now, we don't know exactly where, we don't know anything about this person's family, but we do know that shortly after she was born, she was crying out in hunger. We know that every day, as long as she lives, she's going to need to eat. And we also know that by the time she reaches her 40th birthday, she'll be sharing this planet with an estimated 9 billion people. We also expect that 2 billion people, primarily in India and China, will be moving from a subsistence lifestyle to a more middle-class lifestyle in that same time period. Together, that means that we're going to have to double food supply, in this world, between now and 2050. That's quite a challenge. Now, I've been involved in agriculture my entire life. I live on the same farm that I grew up on, that my grandfather bought in 1918. And I'm amazed, as I travel around the country, just how little most people know about American agriculture. In fact, most people seem to think that this is what an American farmer looks like. And a surprising number of people think that if this is not what an American farmer looks like, it's what an American farmer should look like. But you see, the reality is that there's been a lot more published about farmers and agriculture in the last three or four years than probably in the last 30. And it paints a picture of agriculture that I don't recognize. Now, we're going to have to produce more food on less land, with less water, less chemical and fertilizers, and we're going to have to do that cheaply enough that the poorest of the world's people can afford to feed their families. Wow. That's quite a thing they'd have to do. But here's the great news. The theme of this conference is thrive. And there's no other word that could possibly describe what American agriculture has been like over the last decades. The good news is, this is exactly what the American farmer has been doing over the course of the last decades. Okay. So this painting, this iconic image, was painted in 1930 by the artist Grant Wood. And it's interesting to me that he lived in the middle of Iowa, and apparently he couldn't find a farmer to paint. Because this image is actually of his sister and his dentist. Be that as it may, the average farmer of that decade, of that time, fed approximately 15 people. In the time since that time, agriculture has progressed to the point where the average farmer feeds 10 times as many, 155 people. Total US production of corn, of wheat, soybeans and corn, have increased 650% over those decades. Per acre yields have increased. For soybeans and wheat, they have more than quadrupled. You have to put that on a different scale because rice has also quadrupled. But get this, per acre yields of corn have increased more than six times. That's a level of productivity such that the average American spent about a quarter of their income on food in 1930. Today, they spend less than 10%. If that doesn't describe Thrive, I don't know what does. Maybe we need to update our image of the American farmer. So if we're going to produce more food on less land, less water, less chemicals, and to do it cheaply, we're going to have to use all the tools at our disposal. For example, the same technology that the US military uses to send a cruise missile in a third floor apartment window is being used by farmers across the country to control their sprayers with global positioning systems. Reducing overlaps, reducing oversprays, and cutting chemical usage by more than 10%. The same technology that lets you Google Earth your daughter's boyfriend's house I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one that's done that. is being used by farmers to determine how much fertilizer to supply, not per field, but per acre. The same technology that lets you play words with friends with someone thousands of miles away waiting for a plane to take off is used by farmers in Nebraska to control their irrigation systems in real time. Saving water, but also increasing or maintaining yields. And the same technology, the same biotechnology that we've used for more than 20 years to safely produce insulin and other life-saving drugs, and the same technology that we've been using in agriculture for the same 20 years, to save chemicals and increase productivity and decrease variability, is going to have tremendous dividends in the years to come. Now I recognize that GMO crops are controversial in a lot of circles. People have a dogmatic opposition. And quite frankly, many of them are impervious to reason. But we're not going to be able to feed this world without this vital technology. We've been using it for 20 years. There's no scientific evidence whatsoever that stood up to the rigorous scientific testing that shows that there's any problem at all here. Yes, there's risk. But these are the most intensely studied, the most rigorously regulated products on the market. Okay, now, when I think about all the things that are happening in agriculture that are helping us to reduce resource use, less land, less water, less chemicals, I could talk to you guys about that for a week. Unfortunately, I don't have 18 minutes. I can tell that that's not disappointing to you. So I picked just one thing out of each category. So, less land. Most of the world's best farmland is already under production. Most of the land that could be brought into production today is either politically or environmentally sensitive. The FAO tells us that 12% of the greenhouse gases released are released from bringing new lands into production, primarily rainforests. So, we must not fail. But make no mistake about it. If people are faced with starvation or bringing the rainforest into production, those rainforests will be brought into production. So, we have to succeed. Okay, how about less water? Agriculture uses about 70% of the fresh water in the world. And we're going to have to reduce that. But we can't reduce productivity. Now, the good news is, in the United States, about 85% of the farmland is rain-fed, requiring no supplemental irrigation. But a lot of that land does suffer from droughts, either chronically or sporadically. So, here's an example of a technology that's being used to help mitigate that. Because we can now sequence the genomes of people and crops and so on, we've identified thousands of genes in corn, and we can find certain candidates, gene candidates, that we know have some effect on water usage. By growing those crops and identifying the alleles that have a positive effect on water usage, and then using molecular markers to bring those into the germplasm, and this, by the way, is not GMO technology, we can increase water efficiency dramatically. This particular product, from Syngenta, is estimated to increase yields up to 15% under moderately or severe drought. Now, that in and of itself is not a big deal. But this is just one example of many things that are happening. Okay, how about less chemicals than fertilizers? We have a bit of a phobia about chemicals in this country. I would almost guarantee you that every one of you has chemicals in your house, probably under your sink or in your cleaning cabinet, that are significantly more toxic than most of the chemicals we use in agriculture. And yet, you know, and I know, that if those chemicals are used correctly, they're not only safe, but they're useful. About a third of the food produced in the world is eaten by insects before people have a chance to consume it. So we need to be very careful when we start talking about reducing chemical use. But I want to talk to you just a little bit about fertilizers. This is a picture of a cornfield on my farm. By examining the soil types, drainage and other things, we can determine that the green areas of this field have much more productive capacity than the yellow, orange and red areas of this field. Then we can develop a variable rate fertilizer map that allows us to put more fertilizer on the better ground, less fertilizer on the poorer ground. This enables us to produce slightly higher yields, but to save significant resources. We can then confirm that with a yield map made by a combine with GPS technology and weigh buckets, or not buckets, but weigh system, to measure the yield on the go and create this map. We estimate on this field that this technology could save about 39 pounds of fertilizer per acre. Now that's not a big deal, but there are 90 million acres of corn in this country. If we could save 39 pounds of nitrogen on all of those 90 acres, that would fill a train 150 miles long. So that would be a big deal. Okay, and this is the most important part. We're going to have to do this cheaply. See, we have a skewed perspective in this country. The average American spends about 10% of his income on food, and about half the food that we buy is wasted. If you compare that with other parts of the world, it's a very different perspective. In Cameroon, for example, the average income is a little over $2,000. They spent almost half of that on food. And these are only the countries that we have reliable statistics for. The FAO estimates 3 billion people, 43% of the world's population, lives on less than $2 a day. Their view of the food system is significantly different than ours. That leads us to a lot of what we hear in our press is what I call rich people problems. Now, I'm not talking about rich people like the 1% or anything like that. But if you're an average American, to someone who makes $2 a day, you look pretty rich. And so, I think it's important that we recognize two things. First, you know, the American farmer can feed the American population without much effort. We export a lot of our food. Not only that, our population is not growing that fast, and our consumption is not growing that fast. So, the increases that we can make in American agriculture can go to feed the poorest people in the world. Now, whether we like it or not, in this world, money is power. And what that means is, the rich people, that's us, are going to get what we want before the poor people get what they need. And so, the only way that we can be sure that the poor people get what they need is to produce enough for everybody. Okay, so I want to talk about some of the rich people problems just briefly. So, what about local food? We hear about local food, and the idea is that we should procure our food from farmers in the local area. So, I thought I'd go check this out. This is my garden. That's me. That's my garden. That's a dog. And here's what I discovered last week. You know, the raspberries weren't quite ready. If you dig a little deeper into that concept of local food, you find it's really more about social systems. It's more about trying to design some kind of an agri-utopia than it really is about feeding the world and producing more food. Okay, how about organic food? Now, I have nothing against organic food. I can tell you that our little seed company for a time was in the business of processing and exporting organic soybeans to Japan. So, I understand the organic system very well. And if you can afford and want organic food, knock yourself out. No problem. But how does that compare to our goal? Okay, our goal is more food on less land with less chemicals and fertilizers. Now, the organic system does use no chemicals, so that could be considered a positive step. But it's also less food on less land, and it's more expensive. Now, I'm sure that some of you are thinking, well, now I'm looking at this guy talking up here, and he looks like somebody who could stand to use less food. And you're absolutely right. Obesity is a huge problem in this country. But let's be honest. I'm not fat because I don't have broccoli. I'm fat because I eat too many donuts. And it's my responsibility to not eat so many donuts. It's not the problem of somebody who is producing food to limit my ability to get donuts. Especially when we think about changing the way we produce food and the effect that that will have on the people in poorer countries. Harvard Business Review, January and February edition, carried an article called, Audacious Ideas. We Need to Grow More Apples and Less Corn. Now, I'm a businessman as well as a corn farmer, so I thought, this looks like an opportunity. So I hustled down to the grocery store to see about this apple shortage. And here's what I discovered. There were apples everywhere. There were big apples and small apples and red apples and green apples and yellow apples. There were apples in bags. There were apples in bulk. There were a lot of apples. So I thought, well, it must be that they're too expensive. No, they're actually pretty cheap. The first words of that article in the Harvard Business Review were, The American foods, or the modern food system is failing. Does this look like failure? It doesn't look like failure to me. Now, I've got to say a word about corn. You hear a lot about corn in the press nowadays. I mean, you guys probably don't read those articles, but I do. And the idea is that corn is a low-quality foodstuff. So we need to have less corn and more of the higher-quality foodstuffs. And that does make some sense. But here's the thing. American agriculture has many, many millions of acres that are suitable for grain production. They're not suitable for almonds or apples. They're suitable for grain. And the productivity of corn is so much higher than any of the other grains that we can produce. We will be much farther ahead by using genetic engineering to improve the nutritional qualities of our corn than we will be to take another course. And let me assure you, those things are happening. Nature magazine last week, the toxic truth about sugar. We are in the midst of the biggest public health crisis in the history of the world. Really? Bigger than the bubonic plague that wiped out half the population of Europe in the 14th century? Bigger than the flu epidemic of 1918 that killed 50 million people? Bigger than AIDS? We need to regulate sugar as a drug. Because, of course, the drug war is going so well. And you know, if they criminalize, they outlaw sugar, only outlaws will have Skittles. Imagine getting that call from the school. Mr. Peterson, your son is in serious trouble. No, it's not alcohol. It's not drugs. He's fallen in with the notorious Skittles gang. It makes me kind of laugh until I think about this. And then it makes me want to cry. Because while we're sitting around sipping our $4 lattes and talking about how we need to rework the food system, on the other side of the world, there are an estimated 1 billion people without access to adequate food. Now, today that's mostly because of political and economic problems. But in the future, as population grows, that will become the biggest public health crisis in human history. For those of us in agriculture, more food on less land, with less water and less chemicals and fertilizers. That's not just our goal. That's our mission. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
