Education
 I grew up on a ranch in central South Dakota. I've been in banking, I guess about 23 years now. I grew up on a ranch, graduated in the 80s, and so kind of seeing what tough times are, been through some of that. There's plenty of work on the ranch, but there wasn't any money, so I left and pursued a different career. I work mostly with what they call large or complex or trouble credits in the bank, and so kind of a jack of all trades, master of none, I guess when we get down to it, but work with a lot of different varieties of operations. I work with some hunter-eye colonies, I work with some large feedlots, and different opportunities like that. So again, if you have any questions or any thoughts or something you agree with or don't agree with, don't hesitate to throw your hand up. We'll talk through it. So I'm going to start out just telling you a little bit about First Dakota, and then we'll get into the the meeting of the presentation. So First Dakota, we were established in 1872. We were actually the first chartered bank in Dakota territory. And, you know, there wasn't much going on right then. They were started right there in Yankton, and that's still our main hub right now. We've got about 365 employees. That means we all take about a full day every year. Try to get something done. That's a joke. We got about $2 billion in assets. We got $4.75 billion in assets under management. So what I mean when I say that is we have other opportunities within the bank and not just direct ag lending. We've got a department called Dakota Med, and we actually have a loan production office right here in Columbus, and that does the secondary long-term ag lending financing for real estate. Nick is right here in the room, and we'll talk about that when we get done a little bit. But keep that in mind. First Dakota does have opportunities right here in Columbus. We've got over $1 billion in loans to ag producers, and I want to comment just quickly on that. You know, when Larry Ness, our CEO, bought First Dakota, he bought it in 1983, and it was literally under cease and desist with the OCC when he bought it. First Dakota has grown from then to right here through the 80s, through the 90s, and of course in the 2000s. When Larry bought the bank, it had $700,000 in ag loans, if you can believe that. So all he had was $700,000 in ag loans, and now we've got over $1 billion. That $700,000 was his entire ag portfolio. He can't. I don't know if he can buy a quarter of a ground for that now. I don't know if he can put up one of these confinement farms for that now. So when you think about how times have changed and how banking has changed and how everything has changed in a very, very short period of time, I just wanted to kind of drive that home a little bit. We're going to talk a little bit about characteristics of successful farms and ranches. So the point of the day, if you don't take anything else out of the presentation, is optimism. In ag right now, there is a lot of optimism, and you need to keep that in mind. I know there's tough times out there, and we've all been through them, and we all see it, but there's a lot of good things going on right now. At First Dakota, I'm just going to give you a little bit of statistics here. At First Dakota, we're about 60 plus percent through our renewals for the year, okay? So just think about 60% of our customers have gone through the renewal process. Right now, we've got 83% of them have had an earned gain. So if you look at that, that's an earned gain after depreciation. So what's that tell you? Things have been pretty good this last year. There's some money out there. There's some things that are going good. You know, first thing in mind, you always have all that stimulus money. Well, that's a big part of it. There's no doubt. It is. And please, for all of you out there, don't ever farm for the government. Because if you farm, counting on government payments, that's not a good business plan. So it has been very helpful this year, but don't count on it for years to come. And so when you look at that 83% of our customers that have had an earned gain this year, I want to compare that to the last five years. And those numbers are 60%, 52%, 63%, 64%, and 60%. So now if you look at this last year, 2020, and we're at 83% of our customers have had an earned gain, that tells you why there's so much money out in the community right now. There really is. There really is. Go to a bull sale. Bull sales are good right now. And that's why. People are feeling cash. And I'm not saying that's bad. I'm saying that's good. But just remember where it came from in your own operation. You know, when you look at it, when you go to your own lender and get renewed, take out your government payments. Because that's where you're really at. That's what you really earn from operations. And it's just a nice way to look at it. Some successful farms and ranches that need a strong accounting system. That's not news to anybody, I'm sure. But you'd be surprised at the number of operations out there that are still doing it on the back of the sous can. You really, really need to have a good accounting system or someone that will help you, whether it's a sister-in-law or daughter-in-law or a brother or nephew. Someone that will get in there and have a program and get you set up so you know where you're at. Every year, these successful farms and ranches, they do a balance sheet. I'll bet there's people in this room that have never done a balance sheet. I actually took an application just earlier or later last week and that individual had never ever done a balance sheet before. So do one. Frankly, whether you need to or not, you should do a balance sheet every year. A successful operation knows their historical profits and loss. And when you look at the historical profit and loss, I jump right down to enterprise analysis. I think that those tie together really, really well. You know, we talked about diversification and that's key to a lot of successes. But you don't want one enterprise to subsidize the other year in and year out. Otherwise, why are you doing them? Diversification is really, really good. But without the enterprise analysis, it's really hard to tell where you're at and which enterprise is doing well. Do a budget. Projected cash flow. And then what's really, really difficult but is so needed is compare your actuals to budget. Don't wait until the end of the year and you're doing taxes to figure out where you ended up. And that's where it's tough. You've got to be disciplined to go out and know where you're at. Know how you're compared to budget. Your budget is going to move around. We all know that. There's nothing set in stone to a budget. But know where you're at compared to it with your actions. Know where you're at in your break evens. I'm going to dig in a little deeper on break evens when we get into financing some of the operations that these people around the room are talking to you about. Because there's a lot of differences in break evens and you have to really know what you're looking at. And know what all is involved in those break evens. And what does the 20% down do if you don't have that? You know, if grandpa's going to give you 10 acres to put a barn up and you think you've saved all of this. Cash flow. Well, it's still 100% financing. And so the break evens that you're looking at, they don't work. Because it's still 100% financing even if you've got the land given to you. Because you're financing the entire construction. And so those are just some of the things that you want to kind of think through and understand when you talk about that. And of course, due time will be updated. That's not news. I'm going to have a defined marketing plan. The thing about marketing plans is they are absolutely a living and breathing document. Don't ever get stuck on, you can't change a marketing plan. So, you know, we don't know what's going to happen. We don't know what the weather's going to do. You know, we don't know what interest rate's going to do. So we can't do a marketing plan because Mother Nature runs it. Well, Mother Nature does a lot of things, but she shouldn't run your operation. She has a huge effect on it, but she should not run your operation. So have a defined marketing plan, but know going into it that it's going to change. It's going to move. It's going to alter where you start out, where you end up that year. It may be entirely different. Applier new technology based on a good return on investment analysis. So what I mean on this is, you know, just because it's new doesn't mean it's good and it's better. And not all of those things that make things easier are affordable. And that's why we talk about return on investment analysis. You know, new technology is great. It's awesome. It's what's got us here in the industry, but it comes at a cost. And we're, I really see this a lot. I mentioned earlier that I talked a lot of, or I finance a lot of colonies. And if you know about colonies, you know that there's, there's, you know, the minister and the president and the secretary of treasurer. But then each one of these enterprises have a boss. And their sole purpose is production. They never look at the bottom line. Because there's, their success is rated based on performance. Bushels, pounds, all those things. They never look at the bottom line. And I'm sharing that with you because it's, it's a good way to relate to return on investment analysis. And I tell them, if it, if it costs you too much money to get those last three pounds on your turkeys, you may have the biggest turkeys on the processing plant. But if you lost money getting it there, what good was it? And so that's, that's what we mean by that. Um, strong production practices. Know your operation. Nobody knows your operation better than you do. And so listen to your gut. And, and know what your gut's telling you. And I know that sounds elementary, but, you know, there's a lot of operations out there that aren't comfortable with their, with their, with their own decision making. So they rely on, on vendors and, and other people of influence, um, to, to help them or to make their decisions for them. And you need those help. That help, but don't ever count on them to, to be your strong, to, to answer all of the questions to your strong production practices. So, this is a big one for me, annual strategic planning. How many in your room do a annual strategic planning or a SWOT analysis on their operation? Anybody? No? It's a really important practice. So when you look at what, what is a SWOT, SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. And you, you go in and let's just say you wanted to, to put a new confinement system in your current operation. A SWOT analysis will help you determine whether that's a good idea or not. What you do is you go in and you, you list your strengths, list your weaknesses, list the opportunities, and list the threats. And, and then you analyze it and you talk about it and you communicate about it and you prioritize some of the things, especially the opportunities. And when you get done, you, you, you may want to go a totally different direction because all of the strengths and weaknesses, all of the strengths are taking you to a different option or, you know, there's just too many threats. Or, it'll take you exactly down the path that you thought you should be on. And that's when it's really cool when those work out. You got to have goals and objectives. Again, that probably seems elementary to a lot of you, but you'd be surprised at the number of people in this room that never write their goals down. They have them, they have them in their head, but they never write them down. And at times it's kind of the easy way out. If you haven't written down, then you're never wrong. And so it's, it's good to have goals and objectives and the vision for your operation down in writing. And so you can go back and review it and think about it and talk about it. Action plans with accountability. This is, this is one that's, it's a little tougher to talk about, a little, a little touchier. Um, everybody wants accountability in your operation, whether you're the manager, whether you're the owner, whether you're the hired man, whether you're the flunky, it don't matter. Somebody should be pointing out and talking with you about accountability. And with our action plans with that accountability, what happens is some of those action plans get blown off. It, it, you know, might be junior that blows it off. It might be grandma that blows it off, but somebody will blow it off. And if there's no accountability, it just gets forgotten. It just gets moved down, moved down the list of things that we wish we'd have done. And so accountability is, is really key to having action plans and what's going to happen if those action plans aren't taken advantage or used, utilized. To find the ongoing communication processes with all the stakeholders. So I do a fair number of those strategic planning sessions, those SWOT analysis. And when we get to the strengths, you know, we get a big old long line of those and everybody's feeling pretty good about it. And we get to the weaknesses. I'll bet the 95% of the strategic planning sessions that I do, right there, communication is a weakness. Maybe 98% is a weakness. We're just not very good about talking with people involved in the operation or that are key players that, you know, they have a role or they have a stake in it or they have, you know, a reason to be communicated with. And, and successful operation will, will do well at communicating and have a plan on how they're going to do that. Have it scheduled, have it ready to go. And I'm not saying you got to have weekly meetings or anything like that, but, well, there's sure nothing wrong with everybody sitting down quarterly or monthly and, and talking about the operation and talking about what you want to do. And where you're headed. Get human resources right. You know, it's tougher in, in a, in a small operation than it is in a, in a big, uh, corporate setting. You know, you might be working three or four generations and it's pretty hard to get HR right. When maybe grandpa and dad are still calling all the shots or the son or daughter comes back and they've got all the answers. And you guys know what I mean. It's, it's, it's just tough when you want to try to get that right, but it's a lot of work. And we see more operations fail, small operations fail with HR than the larger ones. Cause the larger operations will turn it more into a separate entity within their business. And it's, it's their focus. It's their purpose. It's what they do. I'm not saying you got to have an HR agent, but someone that's dealing with the, with the healthcare with it. I had a customer that they provided cell phones to all of the family members and all the hired men and all of the healthcare and all of that. And the cost just got astronomical. They just couldn't afford to do it. They didn't understand the necessity of having somebody in charge of the human resources. Understanding the difference between management and leadership. We talked about that already a little bit. That's really tough, especially in smaller operations, but just, just know where you're at, knowing what you've got going. Um, is, is really key to that. And, you know, when, when I think about leadership, I think about somebody like Larry Nance, or he's our, our, our, our, our CEO and chairman of the board of First Dakota. Larry is a leader. Now we've got lots of management throughout the bank system. But you can identify your leaders. So in your operation, determine whose management and whose leadership. And it, and it really goes, and it might be the same person, but it really goes a long ways. If you can, uh, identify those things. Advisory groups. So when you do that, it kind of sounds like I'm really pushing for SWOT analysis. And I do love the process. But when you talk about your weaknesses, look at an advisory group to cover those weaknesses and challenge those thoughts and ideas. Look at your agronomist, look at your veterinarian nutritionist, banker, accountant, attorney, insurance, marketing advisors, IT person, agribusiness leaders in the community, and your peers. You guys know who are good operators out there and you are. You know, talk with them. See what they're doing. See what they're doing right. See what they're doing wrong. And, uh, you know, look at this group of, uh, people as, as part of the team. Again, as I said earlier, don't, don't let these people make your decisions for you, but let them contribute to your decision making process. And, and it will go a long way for you. Want to be accountable. I'm a, I'm a big, I'm a big, uh, proponent of accountability in the operations that I finance. Um, you know, it's always easier to point your finger the other way. And, well, I, I was, I was supposed to do that. It wasn't my deal. I wanted to do it. And hindsight's 20, 20. I'll guarantee you, um, it's always easier to point your finger at who should have done something than why they didn't. And so the accountability is key. And I, I'm going to tell you just a quick story on accountability. When, first, at banking in general, we deal with a lot of scams. And, uh, they're, they're a serious part of the world right now. Um, you know, there's so many scams out there that, um, they are so much smarter than, than we are. People, if they'd spend half the time doing good with all the time they're thinking about how to scam people, this would be a better world. And, you know, the, the, the biggest one that I've been personally acknowledged, knowledgeable of, it, it was a seven figure loss to a, a farming operation. And it, it devastated. The reason I'm talking with you about that, about accountability is, the reason it happened was, was because grandpa could not accept and acknowledge the fact that he'd been scammed. He wouldn't accept it. He just kept sending more, sending more, sending more. And, and that grandson came to me and told me that. He goes, you know why this happened? It was, grandpa's never been wrong in his life. He could not accept the fact that somebody had taken advantage of him. He lost over, they lost seven figures because of it. And, and so accountability is, is just so key to a, to a successful operation. And that doesn't mean that there's got to be blame. It just means that you have to be accountable. We all make mistakes, but be accountable for them. I think that there's a very good job. This is something we're not going to dig into very deep. You guys have it in the folder. There was a, this handout, so it were in the bag. I think they, they handed it out, um, but you know, if you want, when you get home over the weekend or something, go through this. It's kind of a management, IQ management factors, critical questions for critical conversations. And what this does is it's got green three points for written and had no idea. So, and I'm not going to go through each and every one of these you guys are obviously can do that. But know your cost of production. Is it written? Is it in your head? No idea. Go all the way through these. Score your operation. These are important. If you get into a progressive business, you may receive four points for these questions. If you're struggling with operation, attempting to turn it around, you can receive four points for these. And then here, you got your total score. Strong management. Creating five levels. Your score on your 20. You need to look at your operation. Go back to those people, those peers, and those advisors, and those operations that you can look to that are successful, that you know they are, and see what they're doing right. Okay. After you've done that, this is a kind of a mini strategic planning session of your own. You can do, and you don't have to have anybody involved. Just talk about three areas, points that you want to continue in your operation. Write them down. Remember we talked about it's easy if you don't write them down because they don't happen, they don't happen. Then you got three areas, points to improve on. And write those down. And look at it every month, even every quarter. If you have a quarterly family meeting or corporate meeting. I'm guessing that most of the room are more family operations. And so, you guys meet quarterly or monthly. Talk about them. Talk about them. Talk about them. We're going to get into the meat of the program. I don't know how much time's going. We're going to get into the meat of the program here a little bit. Meeting with the banker. Because I'm sure the reason you're here is because you guys are looking at, or considering, expanding, or doing a confinement system, or you want to do something like that. So what do I need? The most important thing when you're meeting with a banker, do it yourself. Or do it with your team or your family. I can tell you, I get a lot of calls from vendors or integrators. They're saying, hey, Mr. and Mrs. Farmer, they need a loan to put this barn up. And they just don't have time to meet with you. But could you put your stuff together and go out and get your information from them or deal together for them? Well, probably if you're too busy or not motivated enough to put your own package together and come and set an appointment up, you're probably not going to be very successful in putting a new business plan together or a new enterprise. So do it yourself. Don't have a vendor. Don't have somebody trying to sell you a business or a business client or something like that. Don't have them try to line your banker up for you. It's usually not very successful. What do I need? Three years tax returns. Three years financial statement. That will always get you started. It will always get you in the door. It will always give them enough to give you a picture of what they can do or what they can't do. Be prepared. Know your state and local requirements. That's a big one for me because, you know, in Nebraska, well, in South Dakota, I can tell you every county is different. And the permitting is different. The setbacks are different. There is a state general permit for anything over 1,000 animal units. I don't know the specifics in Nebraska. I apologize for that. But that's how it is in South Dakota. So depending on what you're wanting to do, they're all different. There's one thing that I probably differ a little bit with some other lenders that we'll talk about. If you're looking at a confinement system, I will finance a confined system without an arrangement file in the county. And I'll tell you the reason. You know, family is really cool to do business with. But families change. And relationships change. And grandpa changes. Grandma changes. Dad and brothers. It all changes. And just imagine if you're in the banker, you're in my shoes, and you have a 2,400-head finisher sitting in the middle of grandpa's ground. And the grandson just blew the coop. And you get this barn back, and you have no place to pump in there. You are done in the water. Nobody's going to buy that building. It costs them too much to pump it. And so you have to have easements filed. So you've got a place to go with that. And it's really key, not only for the lenders, but as an owner of this building. That's not saying you have to go there with a nutrient. You don't have to. But you do have the right to pump onto that ground. Doesn't mean you have to, but you do have the right should you need to if things change. So know those. The other thing on the manure easements, and it gets into a little bit down here when we talked earlier about cash flows. Manure nutrients have a value only in two scenarios. And I'll probably get some pushback, I would guess. But if you have your own land to put it on, or someone will pay you for it, that's the only time it's an asset. Because if you don't have the ground, and nobody will buy it from you, trust me, it's a lot of money. And I'll probably get it from you. Because we, the first Dakota has had to pay to pump. And it's not fun. And it's not cheap. So just keep that in mind when you look at that. When you look at these cash flows that people prepare for it, they'll put a value in their farm. And it helps it cash flow. It helps raise the dollar amount that, you know, looks like you're going to make if you are operating the farm. Now, that there only has a value that someone will pay for it. Does that make sense? Any questions on that? Does that make sense? Any questions on any of it so far? Okay. Communicate with your neighbors. That's kind of a no-brainer, but for the most part, it's one that's pretty overlooked most of the time. You know, we're all pretty independent. We want to be able to put our arms up where we want to. But it goes a lot smoother at those public hearings, if the neighbors are all in there. Now, they may not all be in favor of their agreement. But at least you can say, hey, we went, we talked, we tried. So that's important if you can. So communicate with your neighbors. Communicate with your family partners. I think I talked about that earlier with communication. Being normally an issue in the strategic planning. Talking about tax returns. The business plan. The business plan. And P&Ls. Most of these operations, the integrators or the vendors will help you prepare a cash flow. And it's based on how much you're going to pay down. And that's where I touched on earlier. You know, if you're going to pledge other ground as collateral, that's great. On a collateral side, it doesn't help very much in the cash flow side. It's still 100% financing. It's still going to be skinny, skinny, skinny without cash now. Does that make sense? Getting kind of wrapped up here. The website for First Dakota. If you have any thoughts, you can reach any of us on that. There's good information on there. We've got a lot of presenters and people under contract. Like, I'm sure most of you have heard Dr. David Cole. He works with us. Puts publications on our website. And you can go to firstdakotaag.com and go through all of that and see if there's anything in there. Or contact any of us. We've got some testimonials, agravisions, knowledge. We have a program. WNX hit down this far. I yanked it. So we're on agravisions every Monday and Friday. This is kind of the team. Nick, as I said earlier, is right here in Columbus. He's right back there. And happy to answer any questions that you may have. James Bonczak, a million, is also right here in the room. If you have any questions for him or would like to visit with him about your operation or financing. Nick specializes in long-term real estate financing. James specializes in more of a conventional line of credit ag financing. And Derek Little. Derek is out of Sioux Falls. He has a lot of expertise in swine and confinement buildings. And I'd be happy to visit with you on any of that. I'm going to ask one more time. If there's any questions other than that, I think we're going to stay on schedule. Oh, there's got to be something. You've got a free shot at a bank or a bank. I got it. Yes. Well, you don't want any old stories told about you. What's that? You don't want any old stories told about you. Oh, so go ahead. I do have something else. So I started farming in the late 70s. And what made that time significantly worse was when I started borrowing some money, doing some things. I was working with my dad. And I presumed I knew his financial situation. And my banker, who was not the same banker as my dad, assumed that also. And as a lot of us learned, you know, values dropped and things changed so hard, it ended up my dad trying to help me, more than likely, accidentally put us both in a worse spot. And we both worked our way out of that spot. But I think communication to the generations is as key today as it was back when we didn't do that. And it just wasn't very common to sit down and talk about it back then. And so it's one thing in our operation we really try and do. The other thing now, I'm on that other side of the coin. And we're trying to do some things. But we need to plan. We need to share information. But then with an exit plan in mind is really challenging today because maybe I can afford to do something. And maybe I can afford to help, you know, one of the kids do something. But I've got to make sure I look ahead if I want to get out of the operation at some point. That I don't put them in a worse position at that time, you know, which isn't so far. Does that make sense? It makes all the sense in the world that, you know, what we're talking about a little bit here is transition. And that's tough. I mean, that is really, really tough, especially if every generation is on the operation, on the farm. And it gets even tougher if some of the siblings or family members don't have anything to do with them. They may not have had anything to do with it for years until there's an estate set. Then they get real involved. So at First Dakota, what we did to try to help people work through that is we put together a program called Keep Farmers Farming. And it's separate. It's kind of like DMACC. It's within First Dakota, but it's a separate entity. And it's called Keep Farmers Farming. Separate, dedicated staff and process. But they will help go through that transition. They'll help go through some best management practices, some strategic planning. They'll do it. Alan Courier is in heads up that program for us. So if you go online, go to Keep Farmers Farming, and they'll help exactly with what he was talking about. But he's right. Communication is huge. And, you know, when you... I've seen operations lost trying to help the next generation get started. And it creates a lot of heartache and a lot of issues. But, you know, it led to lack of communication, lack of planning, led to the situation where they lost place. And so you need to be exactly what he said. You need to be talking about it. You need to be communicating about it. Any other... Yes? Where are interest rates going to go now that we have a new administration and the FEMS are in a state of constant confusion, maybe? No, we know you're going to say they're going to go lower. Ah, yeah. Yeah. You know, that's a... I tell you what, if I can answer that with all certainty, I'd love being here, but I wouldn't be here. I'd be on a beach somewhere. But our guts are telling us that rates are going to move up. We're already seeing it in the long term. We've seen those rates bump, you know. They bump 60 basis points or more in some cases. So if you've got some long-term real estate out there that you don't have your rates fixed, I'm not saying you missed the boat because there's still an opportunity, but you need to get it down sooner than later. Lines of credit. Here's what's interesting on lines of credit. The guys here are probably shooting me for saying this, but we're all out there competing for your business. Right now, the short-term stuff is still pretty low. You know why that is? There's a lot of money out there. Renewals are going really well. And banks are very liquid. So they want your business. Okay? The only way they're going to get their business is to have a lower rate operating. And so lower rates on the operating lines, I think, are going to be here for a little bit. Long-term real estate, those are going up. And again, the other thing I think that's going to help with rates is commodity markets. And I'm guessing as long as the dollar stays weak, our exports are going to stay strong, and commodity prices are going to be solid. Anything else? Can you stand with my time? Four minutes. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.
