 Hi everyone, I'm Emily in our dairy parlor here at Farm Park and this is my friend Carmel. Carmel is one of our dairy cows here. Specifically, she's a milking shorthorn and her job on the farm is to make milk for us. Now before Carmel can make any milk, she has to eat a lot of food. As you can see, she's a really big animal. She weighs around 1,300 pounds or so. Her diet consists of hay, grass and grain. All together, she's going to eat around 100 pounds of food every single day. And she's going to drink about 30 to 40 gallons of water every day. So she needs all that food and water to make milk for us. But she will only make milk if she's a girl and if she's a mom. So when we say the word cow, that's actually what we mean. A girl that's a mom. Now Carmel had her last calf in February or her last baby. So she's making a lot of milk for us right now and she keeps it right here on her udder. Now we can either get that milk out by using our hands or by using the machine. Now I'm going to show you how to use our hands. So the first thing we do is we want to put some teak dip on her. This is basically just a sanitizer for the cow. After that sits on there for a little bit, we can go ahead and wipe it off. So the way we milk is we take our pointer finger and our thumb. We wrap it right around the base of her udder where it meets her teeth. Squeeze those together. And then just squeeze our fingers around. A lot of people think that you have to pull down to get the milk out. But actually we just squeeze our hand around almost like a fist. That sound you hear right now is our milk machine. Rather than trying to hand milk our cows twice a day every day, instead we use our milk machine. It's a lot faster and a lot easier. So before we put the machine on, what we want to do is get a little bit of milk out of each section of her udder. So on the inside her udder is divided up into four different sections. And we just hand milk her to make sure that her milk looks alright and that her udder feels okay. So we're going to put the milk on the inside. So we're going to put the milk on the inside. After that we put some tea dip on each one of her teas. And we leave that on for at least 30 seconds to make sure we kill any germs or bacteria on. So after it's been 30 seconds we can go ahead and wipe the tea dip off each tea. So now we can take our milk machine, we call this piece the claw, we flip it over and once we push in this button it turns on our suction and that's what's going to suck the milk out up. So now we're going to put the milk in the inside. So now we're going to put the milk in the inside. So now we're going to put the milk in the inside. We're going to put the milk in the inside.
