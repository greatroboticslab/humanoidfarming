 These are some tips I think would be helpful when starting a farm stand. Number one, you don't actually have to have a farm stand to get started. I started selling bread out of my house long before we got the stand set up. If anything, I think it makes it better because then people have a familiar location they're used to picking things up at. Number two would be to get into your community Facebook group. When we first started our farm stand, we were the only one in our town. So I started posting in a couple of local community groups and people were over the moon about having an option like this. My last tip would be to start small. If you're baking, bake to a level that's manageable for you. And if it sells out, awesome. You know you can bake up the next week. However, if you bake too much and are left with a bunch of stuff, it can be a little defeating. So don't overdo it immediately. Good luck.
