 Hello everyone. Okay, we'll be looking at JAMB, that's the UTME, that's our focus for this moment. And I want to talk about five areas that an agricultural science student should have a good grip on in order for you to excel in your UTME examination, that's for agricultural science. And those five areas have to do with what is called the general agriculture. We also have agronomy, animal production, agricultural economics and extension, and also agricultural technology. So these are the five areas that every agricultural science student should have a good grip on in order to excel in your UTME examination. So looking at general agriculture, this encompasses many areas that you're supposed to know as a student, starting with the meaning and scope of agriculture. Here you need to know the definition of agriculture, you also need to know the branches of agricultural science, you should also know the types of agricultural science, where we have the commercial agriculture and subsistence agriculture. Of course the branches, we're looking at agricultural economics, we're looking at agricultural engineering, soil science, animal science, crop science, these are some of the branches. So you need to understand the rules these branches play in agriculture. And as I said earlier, you should also know the definition, which is just the basic aspect of agriculture. You should also know the importance of agriculture to the farmer, to the society, to the nation. You should also know what agricultural ecology is all about. That's plant and animals, studying of plants and animals in relation to their non-living factors. That's the living factors relating with interacting with the non-living factors in an ecosystem. You should also know about genetics, which has to do with, of course, breeding, which is a very vital part in agriculture when it comes to animals and also for crops. We also need to know about farm inputs, where we have planting materials that are used in order to carry out propagation of our crops. Also chemicals or agrochemicals which are used to ensure the successful growing of our crops on the field. Another aspect we should know as a student in under general agriculture is the history of agricultural development in Nigeria. We need to understand how agriculture came about from the early men up to this present time, where we have science, the role of science and technology taking over to help boost agricultural production. Still under general agriculture, you need to know the rules of government and NGOs, which are non-governmental organizations, the roles they have played in order to boost agriculture in Nigeria or West Africa. And here, these roles, you see the government has developed policies that have helped to boost agriculture and some organizations have been, some programs have been formed by, or established by the government and some of these programs have been formed by the government. And some of these programs include, just to mention a few, we have what is called the ADP, Agricultural Development Project, we have GR, the Green Revolution, we also have OFN, Operation Feed the Nation, we have RBDA, River Basin Development Authority. Some of these programs have been established to actually help boost agriculture in our localities. There are some NGOs, which are non-governmental organizations that have been established to also help boost agricultural production are WADA, which means West African Rice Development Agency, we have IITA, International Institute for Tropical Agriculture, we have ILRI, which is International Livestock Research Institute, we also have FAO, Food and Agricultural Organization, just to mention a few, there are others. So, I'm just trying to let us know some areas that we really need to pay attention to in order to make sure that we are interested in the future. student And some work is always out there. because in fact, we also have it is higher opportunity for climate culture, right there are just over reduced number of resources, they're still in the future, not high level,but what we Lunar Limit and like downtown and that was a şöyle patient, and there are little ones we need to do, and given you some resources on the future, we need to come out to enter into these topics. So, we're getting ready, available for the future, and we are running through the projects. in agricultural science. Still talking about, remember all those I've mentioned falls on the general agriculture. As I said earlier, there are five aspects where you have to have a good grip on. And let me just give a recap again. We have the general agriculture, we have agronomy, we have animal production, we have agricultural economics and extension, and we also have agricultural technology. So I've just talked briefly about general agriculture. And now I will talk about agronomy, which is the second aspect that is key to your excelling in this UTME examination. We have agronomy. And what does agronomy involve or entail? This has to do with the study of crops, it also has to do with soil management, and it also has to do with pest management. Now, anything related to soil and crops falls under agronomy. So here you should also know about rocks and soil formation. You should also know about soil water and how to conserve soil. You should also know about soil fertility. In fact, what is soil fertility? The factors that influence fertility of our soil and certain factors that can lead to loss of fertility of our soil. And certain factors or ways by which we can replenish the fertility of that has been lost from our soils. Land preparation and soil tillage is another factor, another aspect under agronomy that you have to pay attention to. Also, propagation of crops. That's the production of independent units of plants. How are crops propagated, either sexually or sexually. We need to know more about that or pay attention to that. Also, cropping systems. That's mono cropping, mixed cropping, interplanting, intercropping, strip cropping. All of these are aspects that you need to pay attention to. Another aspect under agronomy is crop husbandry. Here you need to understand about the various crops. That how they are cultivated, their varieties, their method of propagation, the soil requirements, the cultural practices carried out, weeding, the fertilizers that are applied, their maturity period, and then their planting depth, their spacing, all of these, the pests that are attacked that are, I mean the pests that do attack such crops. How to control such pests. The diseases that also attack such crops. And how to control those diseases. Also the symptoms of those diseases. The uses of these crops. How they are processed. How they are stored. All of these you need to pay attention to under crop husbandry. Another aspect under agronomy is pasture and forage crops. We need to understand what pasture is. We need to also understand what forage crops is. How to establish a pasture. The types of pasture. types of forage crops. So these are things we need to pay attention to. So these are things we need to pay attention to. Leguminous crops. And grasses. You know we have crops that are leguminous crops. We also have that are crops that fall under grasses. Like the elephant grass. The guinea grass. The gamba grass. The northern gamba grass. The southern gamba grass. These are examples of grasses. And they fall under pasture crops. Orton grass. They fall under ngambar grass. And we also have pur професс. And we also have purary coral leaves. We also have timbal seals. We also have an important grass that form trees. And we also have pourary sage crops. These are examples of презents. Whereins photos forycak is it. All of all of this fall under forage crops. So it is important for you to know many jobs. We also have Calopugonium muconoides. These are examples of leguminous crops. So all of these fall under forage crops. So it's important for you to know them, quite a number of them, because it's part of what will help you to excel. We also have floriculture, which is still under agronomy. Here, remember I said there's five aspects. So we've talked about the first aspect, which is general agriculture. Now we're looking at agronomy, which is the second aspect. And I've elaborated a little on this, and I'm at the point where I'm talking about floriculture, which has to do with our study of our ornamental plants. This also has a role to play in agriculture, so we should understand the importance of floriculture, of the role they play in our environment. These are crops or plants that help to beautify our environment. We need to know the examples, the types of ornamental plants. We have shrubs, we have flowers. We need to know the examples, the types, the roles they play, how they are established, and how important they are to agriculture generally. Then we also need to look at weeds, which is another important aspect, which falls under agronomy too. Here we're looking at the types of weeds, the characteristics of weeds, the importance of weeds, or the economic importance of weeds, which some weeds, even though weeds are unwanted plants, they are also useful, you know, in some aspects too. So we need to also understand how the weeds are controlled, either chemically, biologically, or physically, or mechanically. These are ways by which it can be controlled. So that's another aspect you should look at. Then crop diseases too. There's another aspect that you should pay attention to. There are so many diseases that affect crops. The symptoms of these diseases, how to control them, how they are classified, the causal organisms of these diseases, whether they are viruses or caused by viruses or they are bacteria or they are caused by fungus. For example, we have the maize streak, which is a viral disease. We have the maize smout, which is a fungal disease that affects the maize plant. So we need to understand and know that there are so many diseases that affect our crops, both cereals and leguminous crops and fiber crops. We need to understand that. Then also pests too. We need to elaborate, get an extensive knowledge on pests, how they affect our crops. We have insect pests, we have non-insect pests, we have field pests, we have storage pests. These are pests that affect crops on the field and we have pests that affect crops on the store, like the weevils. So we need to understand how to control such pests. Then we also have forest management. Talking about forest, which is an area of land where trees are grown. We have both trees and other plants growing in an area of land that is forest. We also have silviculture, which has to do with the study of trees and other related trees. Although forestry encompasses not just trees, we talk about trees and other related trees and other resources that are found in the forest. So we have another, the third aspect we are going to look at here is animal production. Here we are going to, you should also pay attention to this aspect, which has to do with just the management of our farm animals. Not actually wild animals, just the farm animals. Here you should be able to know the terminologies associated with the various farm animals. The cattle, the sheep, the goats, what the adults are called, what the babies are called, the young ones are called. The people are called. The animals are called. They are called. They are called the cattle. They are called the cattle. There are a method of mating. For example, for cattle, when we talk about mating in cattle, we refer to it as servicing. We talk about mating in sheep, it is called tooping. You need to understand some terminologies that are involved or connected to these animals. Poultry, sheep, goats, pigs, what the young ones are called, what the adults are called, what they are mating, when they mate, what term you are supposed to use. You know, when they give birth, which is parturition, what terminology is used to describe the process. For example, for goats, the act of parturition is called killing. For a rabbit, it is called kindling. So you need to understand all of these. Then you should also look at nutrition and feeding required by these animals. You know, how they are, also their health as well as ways to improve these animals. All of these fall under animal production. We also have agri-economics and extension. When we talk about agri-economics and extension, we are looking at, what are we talking about marketing, financing, management of factors of production. You know, factors of production involved in agriculture. Agriculture has to do with production. So of course, you know that the factors involved in production are land, labor, capital, entrepreneurship, which is the same as management. So how to manage these factors of production is what agricultural economics is. And of course, extension has to do with the transfer of information or knowledge from research institutes to the farmers and from the farmers back to the research institutes. And lastly, we have what is called the agricultural technology. Here, you know, agriculture has advanced. So there are a lot of improvements or techniques that are involved in farming, livestock rearing, and grain of our crops. We have irrigation, which is a modern technique. The drip irrigation, the sprinkler irrigation, or the subsurface irrigation. Machines, equipment, you know, farm tools, all of these play a major role in agriculture. And so you need to also have a good knowledge of all of these in order to excel in your examination. Thank you. Thank you.
