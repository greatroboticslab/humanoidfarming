Howto & Style
 Did you know you can grow the same pepper plant two years in a row? Despite what you might think, peppers aren't actually annuals. This habanero right here is five years old. The first step to doing this is, of course, harvesting all of the peppers on your plant. Step two is doing the unthinkable, cutting off two-thirds of your pepper plant, leaves, and stems. On step three, I'm giving you the feed for free, but you want to take a shovel and get out as much of the roots as possible, and then pop that baby out. Then gently take your pepper and put it into another container, add some fertilizer, some extra soil, and then water it in. And you'll have your favorite pepper plant next season with about a two-month head start.
