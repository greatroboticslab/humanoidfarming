 When people see the fences on our farm, they often wonder what keeps the pigs from running through the fence. After all, the pigs could charge through the fence without any problem if they wanted to. Further, suppose Ferdinand, our 700-plus pound boar, wanted to, he could bust through just about any fence people could build. This is also true with cattle, though. There are very few fences that could stop a determined 1,500-pound bull. Electric fencing is a psychological barrier. Once trained to the fence, the livestock respect the 8,000 to 10,000 volt fence, and you can't even run them through it most of the time. But first, you have to train them to the electric fence. In many ways, it's better than a woven wire or barbed wire fence because the livestock respect it, even if a tree falls down on the fence. But if a tree falls down on a barbed wire or woven wire fence, livestock will often cross it freely.
