Howto & Style
 Hi everyone, I'm Scott from Sharky's Floral and Greenhouses and today we're talking about fertilizer injectors. Now some of you have a lot of flowers that you need to fertilizer on that fertilizer Friday and maybe you want to cut down on that time. So you're ready to step up from the watering can and the next step after the watering can are the hose and sprayers and we have videos on how to use those and this is the next step up from that. If you have a lot of flowers in your backyard this is the next logical step. This is a fertilizer injector and this is what we use in our greenhouses. We have several of them and over the years they're very expensive but I started looking as those prices doubled and tripled because I need them we go through them and this company Nutri and it's N-E-W-T-R-Y. This company is actually an Amazon startup company and they focus on products that they find that there's a need for and I don't know why they thought that fertilizer injectors are something that was in their spectrum but they made it and I was I was kind of in that market as as those prices really skyrocketed and I thought you know I'm going to give this a try and see how it works and I'm happy to say that it worked fantastic. We have a couple of them in our greenhouses and they work flawlessly all year long so I was really happy and they're they're very cheap. Now I know that maybe some of you aren't in this market but this was it was about a right around 140 150 dollars you know if you have several hours of watering and fertilizing especially on that fertilizer Friday I know a lot of you like heck yeah I'll pay the money and save myself some time because time is money. So this company it's like I said it's an Amazon startup it's they're about 130 to 150 dollars and what happens is it draws up you mix up your fertilizer and it draws up and it meters it out right into your your watering hose so it's very handy to have and so this is a one to four percent system and what that means is you can adjust this and set it to take up one to a hundred parts so one part fertilizer to a hundred parts water and you can go all the way up to four parts fertilizer to 100 parts water. So I set it right in the middle at two percent so what I did is I took my beat your neighbor fertilizer I put the entire contents of the package in and I filled this up this bucket with water mixed it and this is my solution of fertilizer that I'm going to be drawing from into my fertilizer injector. So when we turn this on you'll be able to hear it clicking and what it's doing is there's a piston in here and it's pulling fertilizer so what it's doing is it's drawing the fertilizer into the system and it just mixes it right into the hose. So it's really handy and I'll just show you with a clear glass here it's just a very light blue and we're kind of in the shade so you don't it probably won't show on the video but it's all we're looking for is a really light shade of blue and I remember our beat your neighbor fertilizer is really concentrated so yes it doesn't come out like a like a really blue because you know those big national brands are a lot of filler and they're you you know you have to use this great big shovel full of their fertilizer remember ours is very concentrated so this jar makes a hundred gallons of fertilizer so it it might not look really really blue and that's that's fine because ours is concentrated you're just looking for a really really light tint of blue at the end when this is coming out so it's drawing the fertilizer into the hose and then I can just easily go along and water all my flowers and they're already getting the fertilizer right in it so I can go right along with the hanging baskets I can I can really speed up that process and it just makes it a lot easier so I know that there are several of you that are in that in that level of you've got a lot of flowers in the yard consider a fertilizer injector again you can find them on Amazon look it up it's Nutri N-E-W-T-R-Y there's a couple different ones I got the one to four percent and we we use those in our greenhouses and I've been really happy you know all season long we've had no no breakdowns nothing and they've they've worked absolutely flawlessly so check it out I hope that helps some of you that are in that market where you've got you've got a lot of flowers to use to use the fertilizer on and this might really save you some hours have a great day hope that helps thank you
