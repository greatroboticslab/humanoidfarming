 In our day-to-day life, we face small actions that can make a big difference for the environment and for our pocket. For example, when choosing lighting for the home, did you know that LED bulbs can be a great saving over conventional bulbs? They consume less, so having them turned on for the same length of time means less spending at the end of the month. This way, we can save almost $220 a year while we contribute to energy savings. For short trips, the bicycle is a better option than the car. Aside from saving money on gas, the bicycle is a zero-emissions vehicle, while the car consumption increases as you go, emitting up to 1.7 kilograms of carbon dioxide every 10 kilometers. In the kitchen, we can also reduce costs. A simple action like covering the pot while cooking is a saving of 25 percent, or even 50 percent if we use the pressure cooker. This way, we can save the money a year covering the pot and using the pressure cooker. We continue taking care in the kitchen. Recycling used oil prevents severe environmental damage. Did you know that one liter of oil pollutes 1,000 liters of water? Furthermore, the recycled oil can be used to make soap, fertilizer or fuel. When shopping, we can contribute to sustainability. Always look at clothing labels and buy fair trade products, which guarantee respect for biodiversity and the workers who have made the garment.
