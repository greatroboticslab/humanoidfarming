 Hello farm, greetings and blessings everyone. Welcome back to Anastasia Blessed's YouTube channel. Today I am taking you around my farm and I'll be specific. I'm going to show you around my kales and my tomatoes how they have been doing. It has been a rainy season and at one point the vegetables were not doing so well but right now they are doing so well because at least the rains have reduced and the farm is now doing great. So right now I am showing you how my kales are doing and this is small scale farming. It's in urban and I'm just doing some farming in a... In a... What are they called? Here in Kenya we call them in Swahili gunia. What is the English name for gunia? Just a bag, a cement bag. Yeah, a cement bag. So thank you so much guys.

I can deliver you tomatoes and kales if you are living within Fika town. Stay tuned and stay... Watch till the end.
