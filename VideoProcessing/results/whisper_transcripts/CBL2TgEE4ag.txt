 From the information standpoint, you see young people that maybe grew up on a farm, want to go back and work the farm with their family. Given today's prices of land, given today's input costs, how does a young person, maybe a young couple, take on that next generation of farming and make it work? It seems really expensive given today's environment. Thank you. We'll set up a table right out front. Give that man a mic. Maybe there's some positive news then from the low commodity prices because as cash rents fall, it'll be more affordable for young people to get involved in agriculture. But it's almost impossible to accumulate enough money in your lifetime to have a commercial-sized farm and own commercial-sized equipment. So we may end up having two sources of capital outside investor capital owning the land and people accumulating their own machinery. And then we're going to need some risk management tools to accommodate that where we end up with people who actually are farmers who don't own the land because they don't have the capital. And crop share leases, crop insurance, risk management could get us harder the way they're.
