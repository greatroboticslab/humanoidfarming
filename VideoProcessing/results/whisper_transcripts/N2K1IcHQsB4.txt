 What's up farm talk? I'm out here waging war on these godforsaken plants but I have run into a problem and I need your help. Thistles are bad enough but this plant, the Sericia lesbodiza, is just a plague all the way from me down to this pond. What to do about it? I've heard a lot of chatter about fall burning that's pretty effective but I just don't really understand how that's gonna work running pairs out here. I get it if you're just summering yearlings but I'm assuming the only other option is herbicide. What herbicide are you using and more importantly what's your timing of that throughout the summer? Let me know I'd really appreciate it.
