 Frozen alive, ripped to shreds, thrown around, gassed by the dozens. This is what PDUS found when an eyewitness went inside an animal mill that supplies Petco and PetSmart stores. Thousands of animals were crammed into bins or wire-floored cages before eventually being shipped to pet stores throughout the eastern United States. Petco, PetSmart, and other stores returned unwanted, sick, and injured animals back to the dealer, including this sick guinea pig named Elvis by the eyewitness. A few days later, Elvis was dead. Cats were allowed to roam freely in a warehouse, panicking the small prey animals being housed there. Cats knocked over bins and attacked dozens of small animals, leaving the floor spattered with blood. This hamster was bitten by one of the cats, but was denied any veterinary care, finally dying alone on the floor. Animals were dumped by the dozens into a cooler smeared with feces and gassed en masse. Other live animals were crammed into zipper bags and frozen to death, including these newborn rats. PDUS eyewitness tried to comfort some of the sick and injured animals. But there are thousands of animals suffering at this one supplier alone, and millions more in pet stores around the world. The best way to help these victims of the pet trade is to refuse to shop for anything at Petco, PetSmart, or any other pet store that sells live animals. Go to PETA.org slash pet stores to tell Petco, PetSmart, and other pet stores that you won't be buying anything from them, not even supplies, until they stop selling animals. And if you want to give a loving home to a small animal, there are many awaiting adoption in shelters across the country. Thank you.
