 Music We farm a wee bit differently to the normal traditional New Zealand farm as we house our cows inside, we milk them through the Lely Astronaut and we do this because my father is from Holland and he was growing up with freestyle barns and milking cows under a roof and he's seen the way of the future to invest into robotic milking he sees it's something that's going to expand in the future because of more and more rules around the environment and having cows out in the fields so he has set this up so that we can be ahead of the game and continue to keep farming sustainably and profitably The goals of the farm to breed are moderate sized cow that does really high yield not in the way of litres but the way in milk solids so a heifer that would do 650 milk solids and a cow that would do 800 milk solids in her 305 days of milk lactation we can see this on the T4C and this helps us alongside using genomic testing to breed from the best cows and to breed from our best heifers also so that we can improve the quality of our herd I think within the barn it's really important to have quality over quantity within the cows as we are putting everything into this feed, staff, we're really working hard so we'd like to get as much out of the barn as we can We milk cows through conventional rotary systems also and we find that the Lely astronauts are vastly better because we can track the cows performance we can use this data to look at any health issues or any breeding techniques we want to put over these cows and we can just monitor their performance day to day really easily I think the breeding is a really important thing within the barn so we're really concentrating on that at the moment we're doing genomic testing and really picking out our best cows and going for it on the breeding side so I think that's the main thing that we'll look for also health traits as well because we like to keep cows with low health traits to keep the cost of treatment down so just an overall healthier cow The transition period from the conventional rotary system to the Lely astronaut it didn't have a negative effect on milk production it actually had an increase in milk production as they were being fed a TMR diet where they had the nutritional elements to keep the milking better and we could feed to production as well so cows that were producing a lot more milk would be fed a bit better in the robot and this had a positive effect on the whole herd Management of the Jersey cows in a robot system doesn't change very much to a Holstein Friesian robotic barn the day-to-day routine is the same the only thing different with the Jersey is they're a bit more efficient with feed conversion efficiency and in New Zealand we're paid on milk solids and these girls, they per kilo alive weight they're producing more milk solids It's easier for us to find workers that want to work in the robot barns compared to the outside traditional grazing system just because it's different and it's interesting Normally an outside farm would be averaging maybe 20% 20 litres of cow a day and the cows inside now are producing around 28 litres a day Well I think the public's opinion is very important on dairy farms these days and I think if people can come and see the barns and how the cows are in the house system see they're happy, they can eat whenever they want they can lie freely and get milked I think it will change their views on dairy farming and hopefully for the better If you don't like farming it doesn't it's a hard job to get into you know the early mornings, the long hours you've got to really enjoy it and that's what we do it's a lifestyle for us more than anything It's a lifestyle for us more than anything
