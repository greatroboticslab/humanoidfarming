 South Australia is recognised as one of the global leaders in the grain industry, with some of the most diverse producers in the world. Grain production has a rich and proud history in South Australia, with wheat growing starting on the state's Adelaide Plains in 1839, as innovative farmers took advantage of the inherently fertile soils. Production quickly expanded to other areas of the state, including the Eyre and York Peninsulas and Murray Mallee. Today, grain is grown in all the southern regions of South Australia. We're home to around 4,500 grain farms, producing on average around 8 million tonnes of grain annually. Crops include wheat, barley, lentils and canola, with South Australia contributing around 20% of Australia's total grain production. South Australia's clean environment, typically featuring warm and dry conditions during grain ripening and harvest, is ideal for generating wheat with golden grains and higher protein. We're renowned for high quality grains, with the state producing some of the best malting barley for brewing in the world. South Australia is now the largest lentil producer in Australia. Our grain industry is noted for its innovation, with farmer-led developments in machinery and land management, and today with grains research and sustainable production practices. South Australia's production of grain is produced on natural rainfall and is therefore not reliant on irrigation. South Australian grain yields continue to increase, minimising the impact on the state's clean soils and water resources. Our integrated transport and storage network across road, rail and sea gives local grain a quick path from farm gate to international markets via deep sea container and bulk loading ports. The network pathways to market are flexible and able to quickly adapt to market changes. South Australian grain is also used to locally manufacture an array of premium food products, including pasta, beer, oats and flour. Our grain and premium products are exported to key international markets, including South East Asia, the Middle East and the European Union. From Belgian beer to Italian pasta, you'll find South Australian grain being used across the world.
