 It's auction day today at this farmhouse in the Tennessee countryside. I'm on the prowl for maybe a tractor, some old stuff, maybe an old truck. We'll see in a few minutes. It's not exactly sure everything that's here, but wow, there's a lot of people here. So it must be a good auction. No idea what that is, but it's cool. Thomas, Columbia. Wow. Old air compressor. Oh, I like that air tank. I need one of those. This is more my style right here. Wow, look at that. An old federal. I don't see a number on this. Actually, I don't see a number on most of this stuff. Very cool. That's a neat little tractor. It's actually a diesel. Wow. This thing's tiny. Give you some perspective. It comes up to my wallet in my front pocket. That is super cool. Bush hog. Bush hog. This is another neat tractor. Heston. Pretty neat. Again, nothing has a number on it. How in the world are you supposed to know what you're bidding on? Wow. I want this one. Not that I'll buy it, but it is awesome. Of course, I said that about the geo, too. And look what happened during that auction. What a piece of lawn art that would make. Wow. This is pretty neat, too. Wow. Cool old leather belt. It's one of those hit and miss engines. Boy, I'd love to hear this run. I'd like to tell you I knew what this thing is, but I don't. That's a good one. Oh, I don't know. I don't know where I'm driving. I'm just driving. I'm like, hey, two, and seven. I'm going to walk this morning tomorrow. I went up right here and did it.

Oh, look at this old band. Wow, look at that. It's a diesel. Would make quite a storage shed if nothing else, and it looks like that's what it was used for. This is neat. A gauge to measure the cleanliness of the air filter. Pretty neat rig. For somebody. So this is under the hood of the van. It turns out it's an ex-postal van. There's a sticker inside USPS. Battery from 2017, so it hasn't been sitting forever. Look at that master cylinder. And the assisted brake booster. Pretty neat. More stuff. More stuff. FMC Bolin's mulching mower. You know, my push mower has been giving me a lot of hassle. Yeah, that's not stuck. I could see myself getting one of these old guys instead. They're so simple. That one's not stuck yet, but it will be soon. Wow. Wow. Wow. He's got a lot of these. Yep. That one's got compression. Look at that little bush on. That one's got compression. Look at that little bush on. More like a lawn mower there. There. There. There. There. There. There. There. There's some really neat stuff here. Such a pretty property. It goes way, way back. Way back beyond this tree line. It's got hills. A huge row of firewood. I don't know if you can see it there or not, but actually two rows of firewood. All right. You're getting ready to start, so I've got to pick it up a little bit. All these tillers. Wow. Wow. Think about this stuff that, all this stuff was no doubt made in the USA. Everything was made in the USA back then. Manufacturing was unbelievable. You've got to wonder what would happen today if we were in a conflict, a global conflict of something that required us to spool up manufacturing of things. We would be in trouble. Now that is cool. Synchron. Synchron. I'm going to have to bid on that. All together in and get set down. We'll get started. We've got a good day in front of us. I think if you don't see that, this must be the first time you've ever been to an auction. We've got plenty of good stuff to sell for you today. Good quality. We have found it in every barn, every loft, every attic, basement, hole, every woods lot on this place. We've drug it out and displayed it for you the best we can. There's a lot of it. We're going to sell it to you in an auction-style manner today. So we want you to bid fast. We're going to sell it to you fast. And take good care of you and take good care of our seller here today, too. It's actually goes fast. I got that memorized now, Sam. You can put that thing up here. So maybe it's my ignorance about auctions, but this auction is going to take all day, maybe longer. They've started with one auctioneer doing everything on the front table in front of the auctioneers. And it's taken forever, even though they're going fast, and they are. It's taken forever. So I'm backing the stuff, looking at it. No sense sitting there. By the time they get to the good stuff, I mean, it might be hours from now. Can you imagine how long it's going to take to auction all this stuff off piece by piece? Oh, this is cool. I'll stop complaining. Oh, wow. That's neat. I got to send a picture of that to my brother over at the Florida Rustic Repairs channel. I think he'd like to restore this thing. $174. So, Tom Tucker. $400 bucks on. $174. Y'all give that young lady a hand. Chris, who's wrong? It's the Dixon County plate right there. $25, $30. $30. $35. $35, $40, $45, $45, $50, $50, $50, $50, $60, $70, $70, $70, $70, $80, $80, $80, $75, now $80. I'm a man of my word, Chris. $75, $80, $80, $75, $80. Anybody want to be $80? I'm $75, just to be clear. $75, $80. Anybody want to be $80? Anybody want to be $80? $80, $80, $80, $80. So $75. What's my number, man? $103. Kansas City Computing Scale. This thing is neat. Chain drive special. Look at the size of that device. Let me see if I can see a brand on it. Looks like AKIRO Manufacturing, Erie, Pennsylvania. Wow. This thing is huge. Wouldn't even want to try to lift that. Right up my alley. This is by Dixon, Inc. Probably a cheapo back in the day, but it's pretty cool now. Inside of this building is a lot of hidden stuff. Just on the floor. Like that old GE heater right there. Old bike seat that's... Looks like it's... What is this made of? It's rubber, but it's so old it's hard like wood. This entire property has been sold. Who knows what'll happen to it. Okay. I walked right by this thing. Okay. Okay. So what is it? Wow. I think I walked by it just because it's covered up with this tarp. You know it's old when the ID plate's made of brass. Very cool. Some chain falls here. Look at this thing. See my rototiller. Man. You had to be a tough guy to work this thing. Wow. We... I mean, it's heavy. It's heavy. People were a different breed back then. And, you know, as heavy as this thing is, it's not that wide. So you'd be using this machine a long time to till up a small area. Oh, isn't this cool? Murray Tot Rod. I have not seen one of these before. But this one is in really good shape. It's even got the rubber pedals still. About the only thing it's missing is one of the rear tires. Wow. That is neat. There's also a couple of these tractor trailers here. Two of them. I guess they're empty because they're not opened up. Perhaps most of this stuff was in these trailers. It's actually more than two. There's four of them. There's four of them. There's four of them. Neither one of them. It's only four of them. Name it off to the front. Okay, I'm calling it for the day. It's an hour and a half in, and it's still on the first table. None of that stuff there in front of me has even gone up, and nothing beyond the pavilion has gone up. There's a thousand things that have left to be done. So it's just not going to work for me. I can't spend the entire day here. Usually these auctions have more than one auctioneer, but not this one. So I hope you enjoyed this and seeing what's out here. If I can get the prices on this stuff that it's sold for before I go to publish, I will put them in the comments.
