 My name is Matt Woodward. I live down at Mount Vernon. We put in a drip system about three and a half years ago. I cannot say enough, but the biggest thing I wanted to try to get across when I got here was, there's a lot of guys who irrigate in this tent right now, and they've been doing it a lot longer than I have. So they know a lot of things about irrigation, so I don't pretend to know more than they do. I will say that being a part of Nutri-Drip, I've been with Kurt since it started, and his dad came out to my farm right before he really started this whole thing. I cannot say enough about the help that they have given me to become a successful farmer. I just really want you guys to know that when you do business with Nutri-Drip, you're doing business with an American family who's using superior products, and they work harder than anybody that I really know in the industry for sure. It's not like they drop a pivot off and here you go. They help you and they move you forward, and it's an annual deal.
