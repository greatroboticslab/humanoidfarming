 It is 617 this morning and last month we told you about some Ozaki County farmers who have been using new farming methods to improve soil and water retention. And now after weeks of little to no rain, Consumer Investigator Jenna Ray checks back in with them to see how these new methods are holding up against Mother Nature's challenges. It's prime farming season in Southeast Wisconsin, but the weather has had other plans. It caused planting issues. It's caused growth issues in the fields. The National Weather Service reporting some of the driest days over the last month. I'm concerned, but I can't do anything about it. But hope isn't lost yet. Over the last decade, both Brian Vorpagel and Mike Paulus, who sit on the Ozaki County Clean Farm Families Board, have implemented no-till practices at their farms, meaning they don't turn over the soil. They plant cover crops twice a year. Those crops are used to improve soil quality and retain water instead of being harvested. A method this dairy farmer says could help save crops through the dry spell. Some of this no-till has got more moisture in the subsoil right now. And if we do not get into a rain, that might be the savior of it. Keeping the soil covered. Tuesday, farmers took a look at both tilled and no-tilled land. You can see here the tilled soil is a clay texture, more stuck together, and red. The no-tilled, brown, healthier-looking soil with room for water to move through. It's definitely making a change in the amount of soil that we're saving, amount of ground. It's making a huge improvement. NWS says more rain could come over the next week, but likely not enough to improve drought conditions. Something Paulus and other farmers say they can manage. When your soil holds more moisture, you're going to be able to float through these spells, these dry spells. But, you know, it usually pans out average-wise that the water will come. Maybe not when you want it, but it'll come. For now, these farmers are hoping for rain come July and August for a successful fall harvest. I'm Consumer Investigator Jenna Ray.
