Entertainment
 it fantastic good day everybody thank you for joining us on yet again another episode of the podcast and today i have a phenomenal guest with me in the studio and we're going to be having a very interesting conversation uh around waste to wealth unlocking the power of secular agriculture in africa and our guest today is joyce kamendy uh all the way from uh kaya she's gonna be teaching out more about secular economy in africa and she happens to be the c c o o of safi organics and so before we start out the conversation i will read out her bio so that we get to know her much more better joyce kamendy is the visionary social entrepreneur whose work is deeply rooted in creating sustainable solutions for food security and rural development across africa she is the co-founder and chief operating manager of saki organics a pioneering agribusiness that transforms crop waste into high quality organic fertilizers tailored made for the need of small-scale farmers through her leadership at taffy organics joyce has been instrumental in building decentralized production system that has that brings fertilizers manufacturing closer to farming community this is not only reduces the cost and the carbon footprint of traditional fertilizers supply chain but also empowers farmers to boost their yield and income using environmental friendly methods joyce and ensure the staffy organics fertilizers are accessible affordable and available and where farmers needs them the most joyce is passionate about social impact and this has shaped her from her early professional experience in the insurance and technology industry where she worked as a procurement officer for over three years her decision to transition into agribusiness was driven by the desire to make more direct and lasting contribution to underserved community especially in rural africa today joyce is not only helping to build more resilient farm systems but she's also inspiring a new generation of young leaders to explore innovative ways in agriculture secular economy and community empowerment so joyce welcome i must say that your profile is really impressive thank you sarugui for the introduction and thank you for having me today in your podcast i'm very excited and looking forward to the discussion beautiful that's really good so as we delve into the conversation today let's start out with your journey uh let us know what sort of i know i've said that in your bio but i also like you to sort of reiterate a bit uh what inspired you to transition from insurance and even technology was like a dominant you know industry right now and i'm going to be a very good one of the uh you know industry right now to agriculture and specifically uh the secular economy part uh and what was that turning point for you uh thanks that's a good question uh first i would i would also add that i'm a farmer uh so apart from making fertilizers uh farming business yeah so i'm a proud farmer in that business so having my hands on uh day to day activities with the experience of more holder farmers across the continent so we share the same challenges right um and so going back to more than 10 years ago so insurance was are something that i used to do when i was in the university i did a few businesses here and there I did a few businesses here and there, but selling insurance was doing comfort in the second year, the third year and the fourth year. So that was exciting. It was going on well. But just to say, I studied procurement and logistics. So I had zero background in agriculture. And so, of course, it's an African division that I had was to work in the corporate world and get a white-collar job, get the first one in the family, get our siblings out of puberty and our family out of puberty. It was pretty, you know, it was like go to school, work hard, get a job, you know, and the cycle continued. But during my fourth year in the university, I met my co-founder. His name is Samuel Rigu. So we co-founded stuff organics together. But my interest actually sparked when he was telling me, you know, I'm doing this research and we are utilizing waste to make briquettes. And I was like, what is briquettes? So by that time, briquettes was really, really new. So I was like, ah, this sounds cool. And because I was in the fourth year and I had a lot of time, I was like, why would I not help you out do research? So when we are doing research, you know, I fell in love with the concept because I was like, this sounds interesting. I've not seen anybody doing this. And furthermore, was the vision that he was telling me, you know, if we recycle these waste, we are going to reduce, you know, greenhouse gas emissions. The waste that we're using by that time used to take seven to ten years to compose. So that sparked my interest. So we did make briquettes in the fourth year, but that was not successful, apparently, sadly. So after that, we got into mosquito quills, manufactured around a million and sold about the same million mosquito quills in the market. And by that time, we're still using the rice husk as our major source of biomass. And the partner we were working with was like, you know, your mosquito quills are burning around six hours, but then almost mosquito quills in the market are burning for eight hours. Why don't you change from, you know, rice husk and incorporate rice husk? And we were like, yeah, that sounds interesting. But then we still have turnages of, you know, rice husk quills laying on the ground. Nothing has been done about it. It was a nuisance seeing that people are burning rice husk all over. So they were smoking all over. And they were like, no. Apparently, we are still very young. By then I was 22. I was like, yeah, I still have time to make mistakes, you know. So we were like, no, because we have restrictions in terms of capital and the funding, because both of us were really young. After just him, he had finished campus. For me, I was in the fourth year. So we were like, no, we can't do this. It doesn't seem feasible for us at that time. So we said, why can't you not, you know, do more research and see what can be developed from this like that? Because there have to be something that is workable. And actually, that's how now Safi Organito's born. We realized, oh, after we did, you know, about more research, we found that the right hub is turning to biota and it can do this as an amendment. So that's how coincidentally I found myself in the agricultural space. It was by luck. And of course, after luck, I made a choice to stay in the agricultural system. Because my call to action at that time was the problem that I'm solving is actually what has been affecting my community. Because we are solving, that directly means that we are solving food security issues. So that's part of my interest. And I would say that that's what kept me going by that time. And which still keeps me going at this time because we still have, you know, we have decimal, decimal result in terms of, you know, the journey that we are taking to food security. Wow. That's really beautiful. Really beautiful. It's also interesting to know that you guys have seen the problem and you applied yourself to wanting to create solutions to solve that problem. And that's how, like, the journey began for you. And, you know, it's also beautiful to hear that over the years, like, what you started out with, you transitioned, transitioned, then now onto this. All within the secular economy. Just allowing people to know that, okay, sometimes when you start out with something, it might work for a while, then you move to something else. Still pervert within the same ecosystem. So thank you so much for sharing that. So when we talk about secular economy, what exactly does that mean in a more practical term in terms of, like, small-scale farmers or small-scale farmers in Africa? Can you sort of break that down for us? Yeah, that's a good question. Circular economy sounds like, you know, it's a big, big, big word. But just explained to a layman language, you know, it's using the minimal locally available resources within your reach. And then, you know, turning it around, creating value into it, and getting to the same system. So it's like it's a continuous or kind of loop that needs to, you know, from the beginning, and then it gets back to the beginning. Yeah, so, for example, when a farmer decides, you know, I'm doing the harvesting after the harvesting, rather than, you know, throwing away the biomass waste. Why would I not bury it, you know? That is circular economy in its own simple way. It's just recycling what you have, minimal resources within the most efficient and using, you know, also minimum investment or minimum capital. Just to ensure that you're using the minimum resources as much as possible and looping them back to the system, rather than, you know, doing a lot of dumping and all that. It's just embracing what are the minimal resources you have in a more efficient way. Fantastic. Fantastic. And so another example I would post there. Yeah. Another example probably I would also post there is, you know, when farmers opt to, like, use wood waste, maybe from the forest, from their own fences, to make biochar using contiki. Because, like, for example, use a high intake, they cannot be able to do that. And they can be able to produce biochar using contiki method or a method where the decals on the ground leads to the biomass. And then it produces biochar. And then after producing that biochar, they take it back to the farm. They can do it maximally, but then there's still being small contributions that are still creating impact. You know, one step at a time. But what matters is that we're still making small steps towards meeting the goal. Beautiful, beautiful. We know that waste management is more like a growing concern, particularly in, like, rural or even urban farming communities, right? So what are, like, the most common types of agricultural waste you have seen? And, you know, and why they are sort of overlooked, even though they are valuable resources? Yeah, that's a good question. We have a lot of tiny desmetric tons of waste produced across the continent every day. In Nairobi alone, we estimate around, you know, 10,000, which is quite huge. And I would say some of the waste that are generated daily is the household waste. Everybody, every house, as long as you're eating, you're cooking, you're generating waste. But people never see that, you know, as something that they can turn into something useful. So, for example, if, you know, you have a family of five, you know, in Africa, you know, we are big families. So, of course, that means that you'll have contribution of, you know, a few kgs here and there of waste. For example, when you're cooking the peels of bananas, the peels of potatoes, name them. But then what people don't do, you know, you just put them in the bin, somebody comes collected, you're lucky, if you're staying in the urban centers. But then if you're staying in the rural areas, you know, you just put it in the bin, throw it in the farm, you know, or dump it somewhere here and there. But then some of the opportunities that are available in this, and I would mention my government because there was such a regulation that is coming up. Though it has not been picked up on segregation waste. So, for example, you are able to, you know, segregate the food waste, which you call organic waste in this case. You can segregate the plastic waste and the metal waste and all that. So some are biodegradable, some are non-resectable. So if you're able to segregate that, let's say, for example, it's plastic, you segregate that. If it's metallic, you say segregate that. And then there are different sources and different funds that are coming in in the market to actually purchase it. So that is an opportunity that people can actually track into. And it's not, you know, people overlook that either by one. They are not informed. Secondly, they find it's a lot of work. So you find that the waste collectors coming in to collect, they have to do the double work. Collect all of it, then, you know, segregate, sell what they can be able to sell, some recycle, which means a lot of work. So but then those are some of the available waste that can actually be utilized. Another type of waste that I would like to mention is probably the maize cones. And especially because, you know, farming is a staple food in most parts of the countries in Africa. And so you find that the maize stalks, the maize cones, some farmers cannot actually be able to utilize all of it because they are farming in a huge dump of land, and especially the maize cones. So you find that they are easily, I would say they are fragile because if you stock maize cones somewhere, they are rained on, they get holes, they start staying. So you cannot even use them as a fuel. Most people may not use, don't use them as a cooking fuel, but that can recycle different types of, you know, value added to actually produce different types of things. Most players or entrepreneurs are getting into the maize cones. So they can use maize cones, they can sell them on a small machine because, you know, the people who are doing the collection are actually coming to the farm or to where the people are doing the milling of the maize. So, yeah, yeah, I mean, those are some of the waste that are found. But the most, most available waste is the market waste is the lot, a lot, a lot, a lot that is adding up at the jumping. Oh, wow. Incredible. It's good to know that they're like different kinds of way, the way waste can be sort of separated. And also even the usability of the waste themselves. It's just, it's good to know that. Running Sapphire Organics, right? What is like the biggest misconception you have seen from farmers? You know, because they also have a misconception about organic fertilizers made from waste. You know, so what's like the biggest misconception you've seen? And how have you sort of helped them overcome those doubts or misconceptions? Yeah, a good question. So, getting back to 10 years ago, because Sapphire Organics was established in 2015 from an idea. And of course, we are locally set up with a village where biomass is available. Getting to 2015, February, and then I tell our farmer, you know, you know, when you're making a fertilizer, like making fertilizer from what? Are you, you are doing the collection of the rice house that has always been laying over and telling you're making a fertilizer? I'm like, yeah, it's an organic fertilizer. So the farmer's, hmm, what I mean, how do you make, you know, waste and make an organic fertilizer that is certified? And you tell them, you know, you can give you a standalone fertilizer. So, you know, that doesn't make sense. And why it doesn't make sense? Because an average farmer in Kenya, in Africa is around 45, right? So if they have been farming for the last 20 years, are the fertilizer they know? Is it a given you make it? It's important to make fertilizer. And it's an organic fertilizer. It was actually imported. So, how do you make a certified organic fertilizer from our own locally available biomass? That is one thing that they get, they are not able to come up to actually understand the entity to their head by 10, 10 years ago. But things are changing. The other misconception farmers have is that you cannot farm organically with organic fertilizer and still get a good plant, right? Because they believe in the provision of minerals and NPK from the importance of organic fertilizer. Yeah. And so they have this misconception that organic fertilizer, they are not profitable. And the other thing is like, they are super, super expensive. When you hear the word organic, it's like, yeah, that is expensive. Which sometimes might be the case and sometimes not be the case. Because if you're producing locally, there's some of, you know, logistic costs, taxes and tariffs and all that, that you're able to avoid. So that's not always the case. But those are some of the misconceptions that farmers have. Organic fertilizers don't work. Organic, you cannot invest an organic certified fertilizer locally using our own available biomass waste and for it to work. And so, you know, it's just a way that they are already, you know, ingrained to what they have been using over the many years during their farming season. Even when I'm growing up, I know how fertilizer should look like. So that misconception of how fertilizer should look like and how it actually looks like when it's organic most of the time. Because 90% of the organic fertilizers are actually in powder form. Because it has to be from manure, compost, now bio, all this. So it's, you find that cheap layers coming up in the market with stuff organics when we are having a good product. So that can show you the whole product. So yeah, that's how it has been. And how we are able to convince them that this fertilizer works was like our first farmer. We gave him our bags. We told him, you know, look here, Mr. Dan, we have a fertilizer. Please can you apply it in the farm? It was a one acre rice farm. And if it works, you can pay us back. If it doesn't, don't pay us a dad any time. And so he did apply the fertilizer. Remember, it was in December 2015. And he was like, let me do the application of fertilizer. So in July, August, because that's when we start farming. And then in December, he was like, oh, you guys, can you come over for a good feeding? And I'm like, why? Because he did actually 100% increase in yields. So from 10 bags to around 22 bags. So that was amazing. So with the demos and encouraging farmers for us actually, we are like, wow. We are like, we are surprised. Do you need to do an increase of yields? And I think from the literature review, it was around 30%, but this time it was 100%. Actually, plus, because there was the two bags. They're like, oh, okay, that sounds amazing. So with that farmer, we actually now get to use this farmer in a bathroom that brings other farmers to actually see. And also the other things that we have done demonstration plots where we also bring in other farmers in those farms. We are working through the journey of how we're using self-organic fertilizers from the start, the application from the top dressing, all through. And then we do the comparison between a maker, which is just next to each other, that is using self-organic fertilizers and another acre that is using, you know, the normal practices of a farmer, whichever kind of product you need. And then we do the comparison. So a farmer believes in what they're able to see. They don't believe in story. So if they're able to report them, we got some farmers on boarded on, you know, self-organic work. Yes, it's a local fertilizer, but it's working, you know, and that's how we got to have our traction, our numbers cracked for the farmers that are using our farmers. So we write on our farmers who are giving the products to act as a partner. And that's how we have got where we are today with the 7 or 16 that we will go to the farmers of the country. Wow, that's a lot. You guys are doing a lot. We have 2,000 farmers. That's good. Good numbers. And just hearing that there was a 100% yield increase as against the 30% that you guys have projected. So that means it works really well. It works really well. As good as inorganic fertilizers as well. So my next question to you at this time is, what do you think the role of secular agriculture plays in tackling soil degradation or even climate change, especially in African countries where we face more unproductive. We're the patterns. What do you think about that? What do you think about that? Yeah. So, secular economy in its own self, of course, translates to different practices. Which one, which is the most famous is regenerative agriculture. It's part of circular economy. Yeah. But there are also other, you know, agroecology, many practices that are involving the circular economy. And why I truly believe is that in Africa, how does circular economy contribute to improving our soils? And now does it also act in reducing the impact of climate change? It's because Africa is a farming continent. And most of our GDP and what we are producing is actually backed on agriculture. And agriculture is a whole perspective, not only farming, but also in terms of the food consumption. People are eating every day. So if you don't do anything around, you know, the wastage that we are generating, the practices that we are embracing in our farm, then we might be doing zero. And just bringing into numbers is that, you know, most of our soils in Africa are actually a city. And how did we get here? Yeah. We got here because of the practice in the over application of, you know, the synthetic fertilizers. And also us ignoring, turning God's way, ignoring getting back what's not gotten from the field. And so we are not paying back our soils. So of course, they get educated, they get frustrated. And so what do they do? They have declining in soil properties and organic matter and all that. And that's how we end up, you know, getting more of what we think that is needed for the farm. But actually, this point is that we need to feed our soils. We are talking about increasing yields, but then what is needed is actually feeding our soil soil so that it can become a stable source of growing our foods very organically. And if not organically, maximally, what best it can be able to produce. And so how circular economy plays a key role is because it's providing organic water to our soils. The other thing it does, it also helps to actually, farmers not use so much of, you know, a lot of inputs in the field. So we're not making them get tired, if I may say so. And so the other thing that we're also solving is, you know, there's a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the waste of the organic is working with, is dry-safed biomass. And other biomass that we're also scouting in the market. So if I talk about dry-safed biomass, it's about seven to ten years to decompose left on the ground. What that literally means is that there's a lot of greenhouse gas emissions that is released to the environment, right? So if this kind of waste recycling, it has the capacity, and talking about transforming the right earth into this product called biochar and applying it in the farm. It has a capacity to sequester about 1.4 tons of CO2 from the environment, right? And burning it as well. So what that means is that we are drastically contributing to climate change, to solving the climate change crisis that we have at the moment. And the thing is, people would actually say, why are we bothered that, you know, we should do something about climate change? How did we get here? We did not contribute. But the fact is, climate change is real, it's already here, either you contributed to it or you did not. It is a high time for you to do something about it, because we're talking about the current generation and the future generation. You bring in your family here, what kind of a life do you want them to live? And so if you do something that is contributing to, you know, solving climate change, is on touching with you on a personal level. And in this case, for example, as a farmer, you have to do things right and in a more effective way, not the old ways that you've been using, you've been used to doing practices in agriculture, but in a new way that is also sustainable, right? And even if a consumer, a person who is consuming food, what are you contributing in terms of agriculture? Because if you know, you are having a lot of food in your house, you keep dumping, we are talking about food loss, we will never get anywhere, because it's not about production. It's about a balance between production and construction. Some of us do the best they can, and sometimes, you know, supply chain is getting this product to the consumer. There's a lot of food loss that is happening, and it's huge in the country. From there, when the food gets to your house, what are you doing about it? Are you consuming responsibly? Because if you don't, you're also contributing to money. So it's a call to action to everybody. Let's embrace the circular economy because it's working for us. Less capital is needed. If I pay less money is needed. So it's a more open, you know, trying to use the available resources that you have within, you know, within your own space. And how you are able to turn that around to making things in terms of production, the consumption, become more cheaper and efficiently. Yeah. So it does contribute, you know, to soil degradation and climate change if it's not used appropriately. Hmm. Wow. Thank you so much for sharing the thoughts. Personally, I believe that the work that you guys are doing at Sapphire Organics, you know, it's amazing. Just hearing that you guys have served over 15,000 farmers there in Kenya. And it would be great to see that that work is scaled across Africa. So my question to you at this time is, what do you think are like some of like the policy changes, the funding infrastructures, or even the partnerships that would be needed to be able to, you know, sort of scale the work that you guys already do within Sapphire Organics? Yeah. So as we look into the future, Sapphire Organics looks at the future as, you know, you want to be the leading biochar for building company in Africa. And so looking at a scale up model where we incorporate the youth, we incorporate agripreneurs, you can use our technology and, and you learn other the branches of organics to make their own organic, right? And so, for example, doing research in Uganda and Tanzania, there are some of, you know, there are things that you don't want to dwell with, especially maybe coming from a different country, because different, you know, you have to accept that we are, we are different, we do things differently. But at the end of the day, we are still African, right? And Africa is our business. So let's say I want to set up in Tanzania, and I will need a local or Tanzanian to actually help me out, navigate this landscape, because they know the structures very well, political structures, social structures, and the adoption of the products in the market. So what we look into is that if the, one of the private stakeholders, in this case is the government, and those are the policies that are set by the government, for example, scaling up in agriculture, in agriculture, and especially on, on fertilizer production, it's not easy, the machinery are really, really expensive. So if the government can, you know, can cut on tariffs of importing, you know, circular economy machineries, or somebody who is contributing to recycling of waste, and, you know, tax exempt in the machineries, that would be great. Because what it does, it encourages local industrialization, right? And it sort of encourages people to get into that. Because what we need to identify and recognize is that, we say agriculture is highly funded, but it's not. Because if you're talking about the investment getting into the agriculture, they're still very minimal. And the work that is needed in agriculture is more. And in this case is that, if we can get in partners, partners, investors coming in to invest in agriculture based businesses, and recognize that, you know, agriculture is not like in a cool tech, I will not get, you know, quick returns, as if somebody was, you know, investing in another space. And that's for sure. So the patience, and somebody, and partners who understand the journey, and how we got here, and how this space looks like, and not copy pasting it from somewhere else, because somebody did something similar in another different context. It's, you know, kind of, you know, different dimensions and different changes, and getting the right people who understand what is really happening on the ground, is what is needed. And government support is one that I highly mentioned, because I feel that's an integral stakeholder who is really playing a key role in agriculture, and especially even setting up . And when we talk about fertilizer subsidies in the continent, it's a huge, huge, huge, you know, political tool, and the farmers need subsidized fertilizer. But then we ask ourselves, we have important key players, like, among others, many, many, many, many, who are doing the production of organic fertilizers in their country, but then they can get that product subsidized. And, you know, they are still, they're still presenting their products in the field with the same, with the same products that are supplied. So that, of course, is a huge challenge. So my call to action would be, why not, as well as we are subsidizing the synthetic imported fertilizers, we also need to have a space, and, you know, a certain cup, that we also need to subsidize the organic, locally manufactured fertilizers, so that we can encourage industrialization, so that we can encourage more entrepreneurs to come into the space, and also these products can become competent with the same price as also the synthetic fertilizers, which are . Yeah, so those are some that are coming on top of my head, but that's what I think that poses some challenges, especially in this agricultural landscape in that world. Yeah, I like the part where you talk about restructuring in terms of the policy, and even subsidization, subsidization from the government as well to aid much more scaling of starting back food work as regards that. And so this is like my final question to you. We still have a lot of young people who see agriculture like old fashioned and like unprofitable ventures. How can secular economy sort of create like new business models or job opportunities for the African youth? What's your thoughts around that? Yeah, we need more people and more youths like myself. I'm still under 35. So we still need more youths in the agricultural space. But why are we even asking this? Because in some of the careers, we are talking about gender, not about, you know, getting youths into that space, because they feel attracted to it. So number one, people say, you know, you need to make agriculture sexy, you know, you need to make agriculture profitable, because there is money where there is profitability, people are going to be attracted. But how are we we managing it? You know, sometimes it's very sad when you see an African, an African farmer, how they look like you don't want to be a farmer. And surprising is that when I tell somebody I'm a farmer, you can see the reaction in their faces. Oh, and I'm like, how should farmers look like? Right? So there were we packages from the communication, that is one recognize that, you know, we're having few people, you know, coming in and say and putting these nice pictures of people who look at this commander who are farmers and don't want to look, oh, he's a farmer, she looks really, you know, very nice. Doesn't have to be the person in there that he has and all that. But the fact is agriculture is about don't talk about agriculture, you're not talking about soils, right? Because that's the genesis of way of what agriculture is. And people need to get into this space. There's more app, there's more app systems software that are coming up in this space. But then how do we integrate? Because all of us cannot fit in the app. We need more mines and fresh mines in the agricultural sector, and especially even on the farming and the value addition. So agriculture is not all about going to the farm, farming using, you know, the gem and how we have seen it when we are growing up. But now things are changing, we are transitioning the system. But of course, as Africa, it's going to take us some time to get there, to really automate the agriculture. But there is no more than that. Because number one, you can plug in, let's say, for example, in, you know, advocacy of policies and all that, they can also do value addition, where, you know, you can, you get the product, do value addition to it, like how we are having dried foods, how we are doing, you know, potato flour, you know, those kind of flags, banana flour and all that, that is also a space that youth can plug in. You can also plug in where they become influencers, they're trying to advocate, train people, because what is lacking also in agriculture is that this duplication of what's great, but there's also a mismatch. The thing is, why don't, why would a youth not rise up and identify a space and the challenges that our farmers are having in Africa, and actually tap into that? And the other thing is that, in every aspect, what we need to look around is how much are we getting? How can we transition or make a dollar, multiply that dollar into two dollars? Those are the spaces that we need to check in. So it's becoming more innovative, not relying on what agriculture has previously done to be, and how it has actually been done before, but trying to check, which gap are we having here? How can we resolve that? And also to add into that is, even on market linkages, because one of the challenges that we have is that farmers are farming, but then, even after farming, and to me, I always say, a farmer is the most vulnerable person, be it whether, be it farming, be it marketing, be it selling their products. So, you all have problems all around, right? So, if we can be able to solve just one segment, and it needs to be probably less of the issue about market, because a farmer is farming already, but at the end of the day, they're standing, where can they sell the product? If they sell the product, they're making losses. Sometimes, we talk to substance and farmers, and they're like, they just come, because if they talk about profit, then they can no longer farm, right? So, the question is, how can we transition, you know, from making just a product, from just getting or plugging in in the agricultural sector, to making it more profitable? And I think the youth are bringing in a fresh perspective, fresh money, fresh energy, and they are in the future. So, more of, even having key stakeholders playing part, an example, because it can actually, you know, how agriculture is integrated from, you know, primary, secondary, and all that. Just for people to understand that food is an inevitable topic that we need to talk about, it's our everyday, today challenge, but it's also integrated in other departments and other industries, and that's how we propel agriculture, because it's a whole spectrum. It is not, it is not, it has to depend on other sectors for it to actually grow and grow very fast. So, I think that brings some sense, but those are my two sense in that regard. Yeah, that's really good. Thank you for sharing that. Youth can club even within the value addition. You don't have to be in the production. Value addition chain, whether it's marketing, it's sales, it's communications, there's all different, you know, facets that youth can come in and just utilize their skill sets, which is also like a firm belief that I have. I feel like agriculture is one of the sectors that have enough room for so many people to play in, regardless of your skill set, your expertise, your competencies. There's always something for you within the agricultural space. So, that would be it. I know that you have to run now, so that would be like the final question for us. But just like your pattern shots, which would be like more or less like your advice to any person listening to this call, whether they're like a farmer or a student or an entrepreneur, in terms of one step they can take right now to start, you know, to start seeing waste, not as a body, but as a potential source for wealth. What would be that one advice? That's your potential source. Yeah. Yeah, my potential source. I will always say that as long as you eat, you're directly involved in agriculture. So, what I'm doing now in South Oregon is value. I can do, you know, value addition to the rice earth, which is in the circular economy. But we cannot all fit here. And we cannot all be in agriculture. But when I talk about waste, as I said earlier, it starts with you as an individual. And how are you managing your waste? Because, number one, when you see waste, you can see it as a resource. And the other thing is, like, you know how people just are, you know, traveling and throwing away waste and all that. That thing is, you know, it makes it even more complex, even for waste collectors and even for the environment itself. But if you start seeing or valuing waste, it's something that you can tap into. Because most of the time is that when individuals don't see waste, it's something that they can actually even venture into. Because what can you do with this waste? Number one is that get online. There are a lot of entrepreneurs. There are a lot of innovation happening across the globe. Leave alone Africa. If you read about the history of Singapore, you're going to be amazed about what they are doing within their own country to get where they are today. And it's about waste, waste, waste, waste. Turn it into valuable products. So get their online connection with the right people who are doing something around waste. And that will inspire your mind. You know, what can I do better? And the other thing is that start from where you are. And starting from where you are is starting from your own house. Disintegrate that way. Because you'll be amazed by how much waste pick have you accumulated over the last six months. And actually somebody who is a waste collector or a waste picker can actually purchase that. And you're also contributing, you know, to a cleaner environment and a more extremely environment for us all. So start where you are. Get online research. Know what people are doing. Know what countries are doing. Which kind of technologies are being used. But even though you cannot get into that space, we still need you. As a stakeholder and as a user and as a consumer. Or somebody who generates waste everything. To play your role. It doesn't matter how small it is. But then we still need you. And as I say, as long as you eat, you're directly involved in agriculture. So contribute your quota to this industry. Fantastic.
