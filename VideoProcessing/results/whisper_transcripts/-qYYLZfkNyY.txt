After giving birth to a calf, a cow will produce milk for about 11 months. Young cows that haven't yet given birth to a calf are called heifers. An average cow will produce about 30 litres of milk every day. Cows love to be milked, and they need to be milked at least twice a day, usually in the morning and late in the afternoon. At some farms, cows are milked three times a day. Years ago, farmers milked cows one at a time, by hand. But today, farmers use milking machines. There are three common types of milking systems. In what we call a tie stall, the milking machine comes right to the cows, and they are milked in their barn stalls. In a parlor system, the cows come as a group to the milking parlor and patiently wait their turn. And at some farms, there are robotic milkers. Whenever a cow feels like she needs to be milked, in she goes, and the robot does the work. Whatever milking system a farm has, there are some basic steps that have to be followed to ensure good milk and healthy cows. The cow's teats are washed with a disinfectant and wiped dry. Then, the milking machine is attached. There are four suction tubes, one for each of the four teats on the cow's udder. It takes about five minutes to milk a cow. After milking, the cow's teats are dipped with an iodine solution to prevent any bacteria from entering the udder. The milk runs through a hose from the milking machines, to a pipe, to a bulk storage tank, where it's kept really cold until the milk truck arrives to pick it up.
