 The key benefits are, me as an agronomist, it's going to greatly save me time. I can be instantly directed to problem areas in a field so I can give them closer inspection. So my time efficiency is maximised and if you like my time can be spent doing more important things for the farmer. With a farm my size I cannot be in every field every day or every week and nor can my agronomist but with this technology we can target the areas that do need want. By both the agronomist and the farmer having access to the software it's basically bringing us together. We've now got a shared platform of knowledge so I'll go in and see a farmer normally after I've walked their fields but quite often now if they're looking at the NDVI maps they're going to know what part of the farm that I've maybe targeted and possibly if it's a farmer I see on a Monday they might have gone and had a look at that same spot over the weekend so I think it's just it's just bringing our knowledge a lot closer together really. The services that Agri provide can really help the agronomist on farm to make better decisions. All the data that we can generate is available to the agronomist on a tablet on a smartphone that he can see live in the field and he can make better informed decisions there and then on that day.
