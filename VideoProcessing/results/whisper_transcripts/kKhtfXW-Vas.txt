Howto & Style
 Did you know if you grab an apple, slice it in half and take out one of the seeds, wet a paper towel, put the seed on top, then sprinkle a little bit of cinnamon on it, fold the paper towel over a few times, place it in a Ziploc bag, zip it locked, and then store it in the fridge. In nature, apple seeds go through cold temperatures. This is called stratification. That's why we put them in the fridge. Keep checking up on your apple seed and pretty soon you'll see, boom, it's sprouted. The next thing you want to do is grab a pot with soil and plant it tail down. Keep it warm and moist and before you know it, it'll grow into a seedling. And when it's at least six inches long, plant it outside and grow an apple tree.
