 stop the disposal of waste. The land is not a toilet. The Animal Waterfall Act, despite its name, provides no significant protection to farmed animals whose bodies are used for food, furs, or skins. This means animals such as cows, chickens, pigs, foxes, turkeys, mink, are not protected by this law. These animals are not entitled to federal protection of humane conditions in America. Rather than protecting these animals from cruelty, the United States enables fur industry and the factory farm agriculture industry, aka the meat industry, to continue what they are deemed common farming practices. A common farming practice is an action that is seen as common throughout farms and is thereby legal. The exemption takes no stance on whether or not the action is humane or causes suffering to the animal overall. There are numerous ways in which farms utilize common farming practice laws.
