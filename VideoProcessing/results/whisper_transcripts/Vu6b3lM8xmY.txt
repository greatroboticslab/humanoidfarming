Science & Technology
 What's the main differences between homesteading and farming? Because I think you cover both really well. So what are some main differences and how do they really relate also? Well, so the technical term, like if you want to be an actual farmer, according to the USDA, you need to make over a thousand dollars in sales to be labeled as a farmer. Now, I have always kind of struggled with that because I consider myself a first generation farmer, but I live here in Nebraska and the farmers here are row crop farmers. So they've got a couple hundred acres, a couple thousand acres, and they're growing corn, beans, wheat. I don't grow any of that. So it's hard for me to go to the local co-op and say I'm a farmer because what I'm doing is more vegetables and I'm doing chickens and I'm doing goats and sheep. And so I don't really try to get caught up in labels too much.
