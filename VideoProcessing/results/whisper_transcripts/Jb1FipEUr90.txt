 What did we learn in the last lesson? Traditional methods of irrigation, that's right. But do we still see farmers employing these methods? Not really. Traditional methods of irrigation have now been replaced with modern methods of irrigation. The first modern method of irrigation is the sprinkler irrigation. The name itself is self-explanatory. In this method, water is sprinkled onto the crops. As opposed to pouring buckets of water, sprinklers save a lot of water. This is the first reason why modern methods are more efficient than the traditional ones. Let us now see how sprinklers work. Long perpendicular pipes are fitted on the ground at specific distances and these pipes have a rotating nozzle at the top end. The nozzle has tiny pores that allow water drops to be pushed outwards when the nozzle rotates at high speed. Where do these pipes get their water from? Well, horizontal pipes carry water which is pulled with the help of a pump from a well. It could be any other water source as well, and this water is then carried through the pipes. Water is under pressure and this allows easy ascent and flow of the water. What do the nozzles do? The nozzles then sprinkle the water on the crops. This saves a lot of water as well as human labour. So yes, this process is quite efficient. What about the second type of modern irrigation? It's known as drip irrigation system. As the name suggests, water drips and reaches the plants. The pores in the pipes are situated just near the roots of the plants. This ensures that no water is wasted. This is the most efficient system of irrigation. Water can thus be used judiciously. So, which methods would you favour? I am sure the modern ones and for all the right reasons. In our next video, we will look at the idea of weeding. Do you know weeds are unwanted plants that grow alongside crops? Farmers have to protect their crops from these dangers. Farmers. How do they do that? Why are weeds a danger to the crop? We shall see that in our next lesson.
