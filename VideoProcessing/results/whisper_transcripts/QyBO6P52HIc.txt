 It's harvest time, the crops are ready. Pumpkins, corn, and apples so steady. Grab your basket, come along. Join the fields, let's sing a song. Harvest time, oh what fun, working together under the sun. Pick the fruits, pull the weeds, we're learning how the earth meets our needs. Say the wheat, golden and tall, soon it's bread for us all. Carrots hiding underground, let's dig them up, let's look around. Harvest time, oh what fun, working together under the sun. Pick the fruits, pull the weeds, we're learning how the earth meets our needs. See the wheat, golden and tall, soon it's bread for us all. Carrots hiding underground, let's dig them up, let's look around. Harvest time, oh what fun, working together under the sun. Pick the fruits, pull the weeds, we're learning how the earth meets our needs. Plant a seed, watch it grow. Rain and sun, help it, you know. Now it's harvest time to share. The bounty's rich, there's plenty to spare. Harvest time, oh what fun, harvest time to share. Harvest time, oh what fun, working together under the sun. Pick the fruits, pull the weeds, we're learning how the earth meets our needs. Harvest time, we work and play, learning from nature every day. So grab your friends and lend a hand, together we'll harvest the good from the land. Harvest time, we'll be learning how the earth meets our needs.
