 Hi, I'm Daniel Pinsulin and this is how to prepare the dirt to put lawn seeds. The things you will need. A yard, a shovel, and grass seed. First, begin by looking at your yard and testing your soil. Note any elements that will affect your growing a lawn such as big established trees or large bumpy areas. Clean your lawn area of any debris or unwanted growth. Decide whether you want a perfect lawn or a good lawn. A perfect lawn may require heavy re-grading of your soil. And finally, do not walk on the dirt. All your work has produced light, fertile soil that is right for grass seed. That is how to prepare dirt for lawn seeds.
