 Diko, thank you for the introduction. Good morning, everybody. My talk is on harmonizing agriculture and vulnerable drinking water abstraction over IJssel. And I would try to explain that we do that in a collaborative approach together with the farmers. First, I would like to give some information on the context of the project. The starting point of the project is the Water Framework Directive, which has some objectives, and the objective important for us is that we face a diffuse pollution of nutrients, which poses a risk for vulnerable drinking water distractions. The project itself serves as a pilot. We have selected five most vulnerable research areas in Overijssel, the Netherlands, and we are working with 20 farmers, and these 20 farmers cover less than 30 percent of the agricultural area within the groundwater protection areas. Looking at the measures we have to take or decide on with the farmers is that there is no political support for tightening provincial regulations. So in the Netherlands, it's quite easy that the province has the authority to tighten measures if they want to, but there is no political support for it. On the other end, there is also no political support for supporting the farmers financially. It's seen as paying the polluter rather than helping the functions which are vulnerable. So the measures are based on voluntariness. So we invite the farmers to participate in the project, and we try to create a mutual gain. So the problem more specifically is nitrate concentrations, which are exceeding standards in research areas. Looking from the perspective of the Water Framework Directive, we see that the standards of nitrate are exceeded in shallow groundwater, but also in deep groundwater and sometimes in the individual abstraction wells of drinking water wells. And that threatens or may be a risk for another Water Framework Directive objective, which is a reduction of the purification effort to produce drinking water. However, if we look at these objectives, we see that they are not too close to the farmers. So it's not an objective which you can use as a farmer for your management. So for the farmers, we have a clear objective related to their agricultural management, which is the soil nitrogen surplus of a maximum of 100 kilos per hectare. And the amount, 100 kilogram per hectare, is taken from an experimentally farm, also in the eastern part of the Netherlands, on very poor sandy soil, in which, let's say, decades of that amount of nitrogen surplus results in approximately 50 milligram nitrate per liter. So this is a clear objective for our farmers. If you look at the gains, in our mutual gain approach, that the province and the water company, they are focusing on the improvement of the groundwater quality and the reduction of the risk for the drinking water. And the gain of the farmer, at the same time, is that increasing the operational result of the farm will increase by optimizing the use of the nutrients. In addition, we see that the policy with everything concerned with the agriculture is changing very, very quickly. And I really like some help anticipating on future policy developments. The tool we use in the analysis of the farm system is the annual nutrient cycle assessment. I'm sorry for the quote. But the annual nutrient cycle assessment. And what we do is, for each farm, we follow the nutrient cycle. From father to cattle, from cattle to milk, from manure to soil, and from soil to crops. And by following the whole nutrient cycle, we are focusing on the losses, which are specific for each farm. You fill in the form for each farm, and you get your results for each farm. There's only one problem, that reduction of losses benefits all, that's for sure. But the nutrient cycle analysis assessment only produces figures. It does not produce any, let's say, effective measure or what. It only produces figures. So you have to decide on your measures after. This is in Dutch. I'm sorry for that. But it explains what we are doing. It's that, on the one hand, it was too much to translate. But on the one hand, you have the specific figures of your nutrient cycle for each farm. And you have, let's say, a long list of measures, which are, let's say, potential measures to be used to increase your farm management. And you discuss the measures, which are, might be effective. You discuss them together with the farmers, whether it's, let's say, feasible to implement these measures in the farm management. And sometimes the measure is already implemented. Sometimes it's considered. And sometimes farmers really want to give it a go and to try implementing them. The implementation of measures is, let's say, something special. It's not just handing over a list of best management practices or measures. We use several steps for that. So, on the one hand, we try to explain the measures and illustrate the measures by field demos. For instance, here we see two examples. Grass in maize as winter cover crop. And you see on the one hand, mutual gain, uptake of redundant nutrients by crops, preventing them from leaching. That's the gain for the province. But on the same time, you increase your organic matter and your structure, which is, let's say, the gain for the farmer. And comparable, we see the application of manure exactly with the maize, with GPS machines, which helps you that you have the same yield of maize using less manure, and on the same time you can use the manure on grassland to increase your yield on grass. So, we illustrate the measures. The second step is helping the farmers to implement the measures in their management. Every farm has specific management, and you help them with the measures in their management, and we help them solving problems doing so. So, we have quite, let's say, an intense contact with the farmers on implementing these measures. If you look at the results, then we see that the soil nitrogen surplus really decreases fast. So, in a couple of years, we went from 165 to about 83, which was a very, very, very good year meteorological scene. So, that was a little bit, let's say, too good. And 2015, it went a little bit up. But what you see is that there is a strong decrease in your nitrogen surplus, and we are close to 100, but it's not yet stable. In addition to monitoring the management of the farm, we also monitor the groundwater quality. There's a lot to say about the monitoring network, monitoring the way we monitor the groundwater, but let me stick to the results. We see the first three years, it was a little bit going up and down. But looking at the last three bullets, you see the concentrations going down in a steep line. 92, 84, and 75 on average in our agricultural area. Especially some, I like to point out the results in maize, because we focus especially on measures in the maize, and we see the concentrations dropping from 130 to 70 milligram nitrate per liter. In addition, we had one measuring round focusing on the concentration in natural areas. And there we have 31 milligram nitrate per liter, which is rather high, but it's because of, let's say, the deposition in that part of the Netherlands. DECO helped us with some information and to help us in putting the results of Overeissel in, let's say, a national perspective. So we compared it to the concentration of the monitoring network in the Sandy regions. And there are two features which I like to point out. The first is that our concentrations seem higher than the average national concentrations in Sandy areas, about 20 milligram nitrate per liter. I'm happy to say that our farmers are not worse than the average farmers in the Netherlands. But if, because if we compare the specific soil types and the specific ground water tables in our area, there is no difference with the national data set. This illustrates that our areas are even more vulnerable with poor sandy soils and deep ground water tables. So that's the reason that our concentrations are higher. But the other interesting feature is that if you look at the national trend, then the last, let's say, four or five years, you don't see a downward trend. It's maybe a little bit stable or going upward a little bit. And if you have a very strong focus with advisors and consultants discussing with the farmers on groundwater quality, you are really able to decrease also in the groundwater your nitrate concentrations. Second objective is the gain for the farmer. You can make huge and very sophisticated calculations. We did not do that because for me the gain for the farmer is only true when it's true for the farmer. So what we did is we used the data of the nitrogen cycle assessment. And we had some rules of thumb, which we discussed with the farmer. And the rules of thumb together with data they provided and data from their nutrient cycle assessment, we used to calculate the effects of the measures in their, let's say, the income and operational result of the farms. The graph below, you see a little bit, let's say, the idea of the economics, that you start with fertilizer in which nitrogen has a value of, let's say, one euro per kilogram nitrogen. And you transform it into milk in which nitrogen has a value of about 40 euros per kilogram. So that's basically where dairy farming is all about. If you look at the economic results per farm, if you implement the measures we agreed on with the farmers, then you see that it changes a little bit depending on the farm, depending on which measures are already implemented and which measures are farmers are willing to implement. But you see a range somewhere between 33,500 euros and almost or even more than 14,000 euros. I don't exactly, they didn't provide me the information on their whole economics of the farm, but those numbers are substantial. So the farmers are really interested in this type of measures. So the conclusion so far is that the approach shows excellent results. So we are happy. There's still some work to do for both the nitrate concentration in the groundwater and the nitrogen surplus at farm level. We are happy to say that the participants really like the project and are willing to continue. They also are ambassadors of the project. So they're actively inviting colleagues and neighbors, et cetera, to join. And what we see is that the politicians are getting more outspoken regarding to the project. So at the first, nobody was mentioning the project very much. Concentrations were high. The surpluses were high. But now politicians are starting to say that the glass is half full rather than half empty. So in result, or in return, the farmers start being proud. So we have a next challenge, and that's scaling up. The scaling up is based on, let's say, three tracks. First is increasing the autonomy of the farmers that they can, let's say, do whatever we do alone. So fill in the forms, interpret the forms, identify and implement measures by themselves. Of course, we have to extend the group because we are only covering less than 30% of the area. And we have also to involve the social context because in the Netherlands, the farmer is not doing everything himself. There's a lot of people are connected to the farm doing things like doing the pesticides or sowing the maize or whatever. So if you really want to make steps in an area, in a region, you have to involve the social context. And the results of the upscaling are a little bit, let's say, disappointing that the farmers are doing very well. Our participants are really enthusiastic. The contractors are really interested as well. But then we have the results of the information sessions of, let's say, this spring. And the province came up with a list of 1,500 landowners who have more or a smaller or bigger piece of land within groundwater protection areas. We selected 560 people to be invited. Our farmers were involved in calling 50 people. They know in those research areas. 20 people were willing to participate on information evenings, meetings, and only three new participants. So it really confuses us. So if we look forward, I have mixed feelings. I have mixed feelings about the results so far. So there's some work to do about the nitrate levels. And that's true. We see that the farmers still need some support. We see that the social context of agriculture is also happy to do. But my problem is not really, let's say, a problem at farm level. I have to run the project and meet the water framework directive objectives. So I have to increase one way or another the 30% of area which is participating to meet these objectives. And at this time, maybe you can help us, but we don't know what to do. The farmers are doing whatever they can. We do whatever we can. The projects or the results are good for both gains, the gains for us and the gains for the farmer. But they are just not interested, not interested enough to participate. So thank you for your attention. And if you have some ideas or I will be very interested. Okay. Thank you, of course, for this presentation and also for keeping in time. We have time for questions. First going out to the end of the room. Thank you. Thank you for your interesting presentation. Fraser Schilling from UC Davis. I was wondering if there's an opportunity here to maybe buy down some of the nitrogen application and see if there's a benefit you'd realize if you could estimate it or just make the experiment of encouraging farmer participation by buying down or subsidizing the decrease in use. By buying down, you mean that we are paying the farmers to do something? Yes. Well, there's no way in paying farmers in the Netherlands at this moment. That if you see that the nitrate levels are over, let's say, the limit, and there is in political way no way of paying any polluter. That's at least that's the feeling at the moment. So we can help them by giving advice. We can help them by trying to arrange the context. We can do a little bit of everything for them, but paying is out of the order. Sorry, it's an American solution. So then I have about eight questions, but I'll just ask one. Who exactly are the people that are doing the ANCAs and who is paying them? I mean, there are people working on this and somebody has to pay them. Who is that? The ANCAs are the support for the farmers. The team supporting the farmers is paid by a project financed by the province and the water company. So this kind of, let's say, paying in nature. In-kind paying. So there's an in-kind way of paying the farmer. So they get advice, and that's quite a team supporting those 20 farmers. So that's why I'm looking as a project leader to expand the idea of the project without expanding the support of the farmers, because nobody is able to finance that. Just a short question. Regarding the groundwater monitoring, did you use dedicated groundwater monitoring wells to collect your data, or did you use existing wells that were already on farm? No, we use open borehole measurements, like in line with the monitoring network Esther explained, to be comparable with at least the way of monitoring is comparable to the Dutch, the national Dutch monitoring network for San Diego. So I'm gonna pump up some of the 머리 можно down the ground for the turkey can and go to the WA petition there. So let's do this little of a year, you're going to test it and all the penalties can be engaged within the amount of power of that. So let's check out whether the fish is mujizundi or Andrea to review the해untussamb apron chat, or whatever. Just like the Liverpool rocks page, so I have to jump in front of the beş report you can.
