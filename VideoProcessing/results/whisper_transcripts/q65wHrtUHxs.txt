 I'm in one of my Gala apple orchards today and I grow apples both organically and conventionally. In our conventional orchards, we're constantly striving to reduce pesticide applications. Here in California, we have the most stringent pesticide use requirements of anywhere in the world. One of the things that I'm doing to reduce pesticide use is a pheromone mating disruptor, which you can see up in the top of this tree. And this pheromone mating disruptor prevents the male coddling moth from mating with the female coddling moth so they won't lay eggs on the apple and develop into a worm. The use of the pheromone mating disruptor is an example of the methods that I'm using to reduce pesticide use in my apple orchards. We have our apples tested annually and the pesticide residue in our apples are at very low levels, significantly below the maximum that it's considered safe to eat by the government.
