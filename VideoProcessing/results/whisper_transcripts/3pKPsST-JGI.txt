 Hi guys, good morning, welcome back to my channel. So I wanted to give an update of the greenhouse. I know we said we are going to put the Amerian tomatoes again, all of it, so that to reduce infection because when you're into a crop, it's very hard to control pests and you have to spray the whole greenhouse well. Only the tomatoes are sensitive to the disease and stuff like that. So we have decided to do tomatoes for the whole greenhouse. You see how huge it is? It has 11 beds, which is about 22 driplanes, which is a huge, huge greenhouse. This is not a customized greenhouse, so it's just me who just counted feet with my legs. And now I'm realizing that it was a bit big, so we are going to do capsicum and tomatoes. And one of the consultants that I'm using, I think you guys have seen his video on vegetables, Caleb told me that if I can just intercrop with kunde, I think they're called, there are certain type of beans, I know them in Kiswahili, they're called kunde, which helps add back nitrogen into the system and also tests the greenhouse to see if it's functional. So we are just testing if all the drip holes are working because when you're working with such a small plant, you are able to know whether the driplanes are blocked or not. So the other thing why we did this is so that we can add nitrogen back to the soil. So we planted all over. You can see they're shooting because of the greenhouse, these beans shoot in like, these are two days old. So in about three weeks, we'll be harvesting them. Then we sell them. At least we get back the cost of not much, maybe about 2000 for the beans that are here. And then we shall plant our tomatoes. Don't know if you guys can see. Yes, this, because of the heat of the greenhouse, they come out quite fast. They're called kunde. You just uproot them as they are and just bunch them and sell them. So I've noticed because of the salty water that we use, we use borehole water, the plants are not as refreshed. They don't look as jazzed as they do when it rains. So we've been supplementing by using a hose pipe like thing with the jet at the end, just to, when you spray out that water, I think it, it reduces the, I don't have the scientific explanation, but you guys get my drift when it's just dripping from the drip line like this. You see, this is salt and ends up blocking the drip holes. But if you spray it with a hose pipe, I think some of the elements are just left in there or something, or just spread around and not just to that, to that one specific plant. So yeah, so we are using a hose pipe to spray and we are just testing. So obviously this greenhouse is not evenly distributed. That is why some are slower. You see like this, they are lagging behind. And to shoot literally taking too long compared to this drip line, which it means that this drip line is getting less water than this one. Yeah. So those are the things that we are testing, pre-testing before our tomato planting. And so we are targeting the January market, which is usually a time where there is no tomatoes in the market. So if we plant from October, no, maybe mid October, because this will take about three weeks. They will rush very fast because of the heat inside the greenhouse. And we are adding nothing else. As you can see, the soil is well manured. We have used our compost and just added on a lot of manure. We don't want to say that the plants don't have food. The plants will have enough food. And since we don't use chemical fertilizers, we are really emphasizing on just having enough of that, so that the plant has enough. So this plant adds nitrogen to the soil, which is a good thing. And just troubleshooting, checking where we'll go wrong because those amaranth seeds are expensive. You find back for a thousand going for about six thousand. So we need to be sure that whatever we are planting will succeed a hundred percent. And that's why we took a pause, planted these beans just to go through all that and just test it. So, yeah, I'm thinking of putting a dam where the water that is coming from the boahol can first be chilling in the dam. I've seen that concept being used by some of the big professional farmers. The water, they pool the water together to just test whether it can be, to just reduce the soil in the water. Then it becomes a little bit more fresh compared to just get the water coming from underground and then straight into, you know, it's getting no exposure to the outside world where I think there is a chemical reaction. I will research on this. There is a chemical reaction and then the water that is reaching your farm has less cell and so you just see the vibrance in your plants. So that's the update for the greenhouse. We are excited. I will go to the garden and then we will go to the garden and then we will go to the garden. I will go to the garden and then just plant with you guys as well. So I just wanted to update you on what is going on and some of the tricks we are using just to make sure that we have an optimal crop. Yeah. Bye guys. Have a great day. Please subscribe.
