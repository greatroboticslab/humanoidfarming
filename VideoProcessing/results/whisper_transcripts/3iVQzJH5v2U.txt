 This is AA Farms back out. This morning I am visiting Sparrow & Kennedy, John Deere dealership. Get back in a few more of the dealership videos. A nice little selection here at Sparrow & Kennedy in Bishopville, South Carolina. Got a good little range here of a smaller John Deere. I think these are the 25 horsepower, 30-25. They got a good many of those. Nice little tractor there. Get up to a 30-32. These are hydrostatics. And they got a 30-35 neat looking little tractor here. It's actually a gear drive. 35 horsepower tractor. Nice little tractor. Another one there. Selection of gators. More of the 25 horsepower tractors. Nice little 50-65E. I'm going to tell you I really like this baler here. This is a 450E. Very nice. I really like the features of it. I was here at this dealership a couple weeks ago. Really looked this baler over. If I was at the point I could trade my New Holland baler. This would be probably a choice of mine. This is a net wrap plus string tie. And it's actually edge to edge. Cover over the edge net wrap. I was actually just talking to one of the sales guys about it. But I do like the features of it. It's very simple baler. It's a baler. It's a baler. It's got very few chains on it. Very few moving parts. It's just simple and easy. It's what I like in a round baler. So I do like this 450E. Like I said if I was at the point that I could do some trading on balers. This would be probably my choice of baler right now. Because this is a very nice baler. I do like it. Really nice. I think this must be a new series here. The 50 50. Must have went away from the 50 55's and 45 and 65. I got the 50 65 here. I think it must have went down a number to a 50 50. I do like these too. They got a 50 horsepower tractor. It's got a huge frame on it. Especially like these 50 60. This is a 50 60. I think it's probably the same horsepower as the 50 65. I like it because of the size of it. It's got a ton of ground clearance on it. I don't see a whole lot of differences other than the hydraulics. They are a little different. It's got the side by side hydraulic valves on it. Whereas this is 50 65. They're stacked on top of each other. Otherwise I don't. Ground clearance height. But this tractor here has got the. What they call it. R4 tire on it I believe. Sort of landscape type tire. It don't tear up the landscape too much. Whereas you got the typical ag tires on these. I do like the stance of this. Series tractor. I mean. It's just a huge. Stance on them. To be a 60 horsepower or a 50 horsepower tractor. So. I really. Really do like it. So. Definitely a tractor I would. Consider. 50 75. Nice tractor. And then there's got a 50 60 cab.
