 Music Again we're in the second week of April. We've rolled on a good few months now since you started here first. And you're maybe about a week away from milking. All going well. All going well. And I suppose maybe for the video here we were hoping maybe just discussed from you know your farming, you're making a good few cows here. But also you've been a project manager here now as well. And maybe the journey that you've had over the last few months and balancing how to, I suppose, milk your cows day to day, keep the farm going, but also keep a large building project going. So I suppose we were just maybe going to discuss a bit of that today if we could. And where the challenges were and maybe what lessons you learned and what farmers could learn from it. A lot of stress. A lot of stress. There was a lot of planning in it. And even with the best plans, things don't go according to plan at times. Yeah. In that it's just the environment we're in with building and builders and various things like overruns and time delays are just commonplace. Yeah. It reminds me of the North Sixes and the North Sevens and the housing trying to get toilers and plumbers. Yes. But it's even down to that now on the farm situation. Yeah. So I guess originally you would have liked to have been obviously milking here, you know, be ready for milking or ready for calving there in late January, early February. That was the plan. Yeah. And that reality soon was different I suppose. No, it got delayed due to like just like lots of different things. Lots of different things. Like it was basically down to help with a lot of like help is just the problem with every walk of life. Yeah. Yeah. And that day to day run in the farm. Yeah. It was a problem on the farm as well. Yeah. That this, this, this if it was up and running particularly this spring would have helped our workload. But like we had a massive workload because with our numbers like on a 25 unit, it was, it's just taking, milking is eating up our whole day. Yeah. But, and, and, and, and with calving and everything like it was totally the wrong time to have a project like this on. Yes. And that, it, it, it, it, it, it added a lot to the, to, to the stress of it. Yeah. I suppose the main thing is you had a 25 unit parlour to work in, in the, in the interim, you had your old parlour. Yes. It's, it's, it's in the, it's really in the last, I suppose since the first march on that the, it became pressurised in when the numbers. Yeah. Well, like at the start, they wouldn't have made a whole pile of difference. Yeah. But like, it, it was a rough march, but we were very fortunate that, that we had very good weather in February and the start of March. Mm. And now we got our second winter then after that. Yes. But like, all in all, it could, it, it could have been worse, but it, it is, it's some, it's, it's, it's a project really that has to be started very early. Okay. That's that 12 month period I think in Dairy Master have said that as well a number of times. You would want to be, you would want to be breaking the side note to be going for next year. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And, and, and, and, and you have to, you would have to keep pushing and, and, and, and trying to keep timelines. You need, you need, like, whoever you're lining up to do to, you would want to make sure there's someone that's, that are handling large projects and have a good help. And have capacity. And have the capacity to get through it. Okay. Okay. So let's discuss through all of your, you're, you're obviously running the farm and you're, you, you were the project manager again. If you were doing this again, would you be the project manager or do you think you might have got someone else to do that? If I could get someone else to do it, it would be definitely the way I'd recommend a person to go. So what pressure would they have taken off here? Or what would they have solved you think? Um, it, it, it, it would, it, it would give you, it would give myself more time to, to just observe things. And, and that, uh, what, what, what I found, uh, like, you know, that, uh, you're making fast decisions. You were under pressure, uh, with the workload. Uh, and, and, and, and, and it was have to get time to just to get, get little nitty. It, it, it was a simple thing like the teeth spray and all. Uh, like I just, just didn't get the time to observe where it was being fitted. And it, it, it was fitted alongside, uh, the discalers and the detergents. And, look, it's probably working fine in some places. But, uh, I, it's, I, I would prefer to, uh, and I got them to move away from that. And that I'd be afraid of an operator. And sometimes that one must be in holidays or something that, uh, that a mishap that, uh, they could put it into the wrong container. Just small little issues like that. Like if, like, you know, if, uh, if it was a few years ago and there was plenty of help on the farm that you could stay full-time nearly at it. Yeah. Uh, it, it, it would be fine. But in present circumstances, uh, like in our situation here, like as most people are going to a Rotary, they're overloaded. Yeah. With what they have. Yeah. And, and, and, and, and, and, it's, you know, you're in a pressure situation, uh, trying to do an extra, what's a lifetime job? Okay. Like that, uh, lifetime decisions. Okay. And budgets, budgets would be the other thing, like in that, um, like trying to keep budgets on target, like, you know, and, uh. So how, what would they, how would they have changed in reality, say from in, in this eight, that 10 to 12 month period, how would, how would they have changed? Or what were you dealing with? I, uh, it was actually, uh, it, it wasn't as mad as I thought, but I probably, probably a 30% increase. Yeah. Like, uh, I would have been kind of budgeting for 2025 due to things going, uh, 2025 in the 12 months before it. I know they're very. And when you say 2025, what do you mean by that? Uh, 2020, like, uh, like, uh, a lot of products have increased an awful lot in price. 20, 25% is, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Financially wise. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. You saw increases maybe above to 30%. Yes. Okay. Yeah. You know, tie down, I would say Dairy Master, fairness, like the deal, the deal was done, the spec was done and, and, and, and like everything was fine and that side of it. But, uh, you are little nitty and gritties, air compressors, plumbing, heaters, you know, various little, little extras and, uh, like, uh, they're all, they all would be, so not eight years. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, and, and, uh, I, I, I, I would, I would, I would think, uh, 45, 50% that's an increase that's, uh, from, uh, if a project was done at 98. 2018. Oh, sorry, 2018. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. Uh, like, like that's the, like that, that was the biggest worry through a project like this was, uh, uh, what was it, what was, uh, to ensure that, uh, that, that, that was enough to finish it out the project. Yes. Having enough finance in place is key, obviously. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and, and, and, and, uh, like when you get the big projects like this, uh, like any finance, uh, like it takes, takes a few months, not a few weeks. Yeah. To, to get your finance in order to get your finance in order. Yeah. Yeah. And having a contingency then as well, obviously just for the last few months has been critical. And, and, and, and, uh, the big issue is that like, uh, any finance, like if it isn't drawn down within a three month period or could be shocked with some, uh, institutions, you're starting all over again. Yeah. Yeah. Which isn't a nice place to be when you have a big project started. No, it, uh, like it's, uh, it's, uh, it could be another big issue. Like. Yeah. Yeah. But, uh, like it, like it is, uh, like that's why I would say that a project like this, like, uh, well, we got the, like, we were very, like very happy with you also. Like we definitely have the right site and it wouldn't have been the site that I would have picked. Uh, but like that, all that was very important. At least we had, uh, we had the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the footprint right in the first place. Yeah. And if we start say, so just briefly on the, on the key aspects of the project, your groundworks, getting that started early, you had a lot of rock to, to move. The lesson out of that was having, I suppose, somebody with a capacity in big gear. Uh, definitely. Uh, we had a lot of limestone here. Uh, like there was a 52 ton machine from April to October. Yeah. Uh, like, uh, removed a lot of rock. Yeah. Uh, and, and, and, and, and, and. That was even with big gear in Green Valley. That was with a big gear like, you know, that, um, like I noticed an awful difference compared with, uh, my housing project, uh, in, in 2017 and 18, uh, we would have, uh, started with that rock that time and we would have been using, uh, 20 ton machines. But the difference in capacity with the 35 and 50 ton machines, like it's a no brainer. You just wouldn't put a small machine at a project like that. Did you save money by being able to crush rock and used in stone? Do you think that was a help to you? Uh, it was, it was a help, uh, but it still was an expensive site. Yeah. Okay. Uh, like, uh, if, uh, the site, the site that, that, that, that, that, that you remove the top soil and, and, and buying your limited motor stone and putting it on it is the cheaper option. Yeah. But, uh, but we had no choice here. Like, uh, this, just like we, we, we, we, we twisted and turned it and look, this was the, it was the best site for it. Like. Yeah. Due to the fact that we had so much spent on, on housing. Yeah. Uh, and, uh, and, uh, in 17 with, uh, an 18 and 20, like with a large housing project that, uh, we were tied to this, uh, area then. So groundwork's done. You're, I suppose your builder then Brian Quinn. Brian Quinn. Obviously like a lot of builders are all under pressure at the moment to get jobs done for farmers. And, uh, having someone that can stay on site and, um, yeah. Having an experience like Brian had obviously was a big help. And, and, and, uh, uh, like, uh, the issue was that, uh, there was other projects coming into the autumn time with any of those builders. You, you, you, you, you have a lot of, uh, cattle housing projects that, uh, need to be finished off. Yeah. And like that all eats at the time. Yeah. Like you, you, you really want to be, like to, to know you want to be starting. Yes. A project like that. Like. Yes. So like you've had a builder on site on and off for months really, haven't you? Just on the various stages of it. Uh, he, he, he, he, he would have, he would have been with us, uh, for the full month of, uh, uh, the full month of, uh, uh, uh, October, September, October. Right. So he, he was with us, uh, he, he went from a student and came back for the full month of, uh, February. And, uh, uh, and, and he, he, there, there, there would have been nights, was, there's nearly four months work. Oh, sorry. He, he was with us, uh, last January and February for the tanks for Stendian. Okay. Yeah. Uh, there, there, there, there, there was, uh, the, he, he, he was with us for the month of January and February doing, uh, the first, uh, uh, doing the tanks. Yeah. And, uh, and, and he would have been with us in August, uh, for, uh, for, uh, doing, um, doing tanks for water. Okay. Uh, uh, like, uh, like, uh, like, there's a lot of. Huge time. Uh, of time for the builder, like a lot of, uh, tedious work. Uh, like, uh, it takes a lot of manholes. Your concrete supplier then, where'd you get the concrete from? Uh, it was, uh, I got from Duke and, uh, and, uh, Belly Hare ready mix. Yeah. Okay. They're not far from here. So obviously that was a big help. Two local suppliers. Yeah. You could get concrete quickly enough. Yeah. They were never an issue on concrete. Okay. Let's move on to the shed then. Dwyer's, Dwyer's Steel. Obviously a lot of experience as well. Yeah. Uh, like, uh, like, uh, they were very timely and. So from the time of ordering to when it was erected or pricing wise, were the prices stable or did you have to, uh, take a bit of a hit with inflation? Uh, there was a bit of inflation. I, I locked in, I'd say in, uh, in, I think it was April or, or, or me, I locked in, uh, uh, and I put an extra B onto it a month later. Right. And it cost two and a half thousand extra that time just to get an extra B onto it. Okay. Like that's the sort of, uh, where things were moving at that stage. For the equivalent B, that's. For the, uh, yeah. It was, uh, uh, uh, initially at a price for the six beers. And, uh, and I took it down to five beers. Uh, and, and, and, and, and, and, and like when things were planned out, it was right. Well, I like realized that it wasn't, it wouldn't have been, it wouldn't have been, if the function right inside. Okay. It would have been too tight. Okay. That's fine. So, uh, we, we, we put it back on, but, uh, very, very happy with wires. Uh, like they have doors and that no yet to finish. Yeah. So Martin, then I suppose, onto Dairy Master, then your, your machine supplier, um, the key periods for, I suppose when they were here, started when? Uh, they started with a very large team and, uh, I'd say the very first, uh, week in, uh, December. Yeah. And, uh, they, they, they worked for the full month with us and they basically had all the physical work inside, uh, including the milk silo was delivered as well. Yeah. Uh, and, and, uh, all the, all the physical side was done inside in, in, in one month. It is, it is, then it got slow with the electronics and that. So what would, on that alone say, what did you learn from that? If you were doing a second rotary again, what, what did you learn from that in terms of being ready for them or, um, was, you know, having a good electrician to support them or having enough concrete poured in front of them or, you know, anything there that you would have learned that comes to mind? Uh, we, we'd coordinate the builder to, to put the concrete into the platform and there was a large team required to float, uh, uh, the, it's, it's a dye product that was put into it. Uh, like, you need a lot of help for that. Yeah. Uh, and that was your responsibility to have that. Yes. In reality. Like, like, like, like, like, like the, like the, like the, like the, like the Zander builder to, to, to do that. But, uh, the other master looked after everything else themselves. Um, uh, like the electrician didn't really come into the fierce pile at that time. Okay. Uh, and, and, and, and, and that is, uh, just from that time on then that the, that the electrician was while, while taking wire things to isolation switches for different mortals or different places. Okay. But, um, lots of work on the electrician side of it. Yeah. Like, you know, you're, you're, you're the only electrician outside the other master. Like, uh, it's, it's, it's another big, uh, big one. Was that hard to budget for that? Next time possible. Yeah. Um, probably if you could come and see a project like this now, maybe. And probably if that electrician was doing another one now, he, he'd have some chance. Yeah. But, uh, we were kind of on the unknown with a lot of it. Yes. Yeah. Between, uh, you, you, you, you, your daily master side of it. Uh, you, you, you, Michael White stood on the, on the, on the pumps. Yeah. The water. Yeah. Like, uh, I suppose we've done a lot, a good few things different here as well. Hmm. And that, uh, we, we, we, we've done enough to try and get more uses over the water. Yeah. Okay. But there's a lot of extra pumps and. Yeah. Lot of electrics. So it's fair to say, I know, you know, Michael White was your plumber, but it's fair to say it's hard to budget for what that's going to cost for a project like this when you have, um, you know, it's hard to ignore ideas to come into your head as, as the project progresses, I suppose. And having extra water points. And it would be easier for people going forward, I think, and that there's more of these projects done. Yeah. And, and, and through the likes of yourselves, uh, like, uh, that, that, uh, if you had the template that you were filing. Yeah. Um, it, it, it, it, it, it, it would have, it would be easier. Mm. And that our, our, our, our issue here was, uh, we, we, we, the fair with 90% of what we wanted to do, but there was still, there was still things as you go along that you would. Your wish list or your want list. Yeah. Yeah. Like, uh, it is like the crush there, uh, like, uh, we were very lucky there. We were factored, we nearly put in a herding bone crush. Mm. Until, uh, like, that I found that, uh, I, I think it's from yourselves, actually, that, uh, they don't work well. Uh, uh, uh, work fine coming from a herding bone. Okay. But, uh, when cattle get used to the rotary and heifers that only want a rotary. Yeah. Won't line up right, you know. Mm. So, uh, we went with the idea of two small crushes that, uh, that we can have one loading, uh, while the vet is testing in the second one. Okay. And, uh, and we hope that will work well. The plumbing side again, say then, how many key visits were there from Michael White's team? Was it, what's the year? Over two key periods, three key periods, or how did that pan out? Uh, a lot, uh, a lot of calls, actually. Um, it's just like, uh, Michael, very stretched. You know, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of, a lot of different, uh, uh, projects on it at the time. Mm. But, uh, it possibly, if, if, if it was a dead right template, it probably could be done in two or three phases. Mm. But, uh, like, uh, the, the, the, the, the first phase was basically, uh, after the outer ring being done. Uh, I'll say, uh, after the ring wall for the turntable, uh, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we put, uh, an outer ring for the high volume washer. Yeah. And, uh, uh, like, uh, uh, like, uh, uh, uh, ran, ran a lot of, uh, circuits before the finished floor was done on the outside of it. Like, uh, uh, there, there was probably three days or four days with a few, with a team at that. Okay. Uh, the, the, the, the, the, the, when, uh, when the, when the other master were, were spinning that first initial month, doing the inner part of it, uh, they came at that stage and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and did the pipe work before we closed off, uh, overhead to do the rotating boom. Mm. Um, but, uh, like, that big work now, uh, like, or they had to come when we started, when the builders came back in February to do the outer section here, uh, like, uh, he did the outer ring of the, uh, uh, uh, uh, of, of, of pipe work, uh, like, there was another three days, I suppose, in that. Mm. And, uh, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that's possibly a week, I'd say, a walk from the finish now. And that's a commissioning phase, you know, you're a week to 10 days away from hopefully milking. So, I suppose it's fair to say that there's commissioning required on a few aspects. Plumbing is one there, as you said. Plumbing is, it's a big one now at the moment. Yeah. Electrical, is there much to do on the electrical side? There's, uh, uh, not, not, not too bad. Uh, like, there's still, there's still a lot, like, uh, like, uh, like, uh, uh, like, uh, uh, uh, if we on the side, say, he, he, he, he, he, he'll be ready as they already like. Yeah. Um, you have, the main power is connected, is it, into the fuse board? The main, uh, the main power is connected to the fuse board, but we're on the old system. Right. So is there a changeover required or DSB needs to come? Yeah, we were looking for a new connection, but, uh, due to the price to wear price, ESB, and that is gone, we're actually going to go to the generator, stand alone generator. Uh, and, and, and, and, and, and with the view of going solar panels with existing down the, down the line. Okay. We're, we're, we're going to wait and watch that spot for a year or two and. Fine. Yeah. But, uh, like, uh, uh, we, we, we, we've, we've variable speed motors put for everything, but, uh, the power requirement is, is probably going to be very high. That would push us into the, the commercial rates. Okay. And, and for that reason, we're, we're going with the generator for a short period. Yeah. And, and, and, and with the solar panels that we'd get, uh. Keep your options open. Yeah, that we'd get our requirement down again. Okay. So there's obviously some gates from Donovan's as well, I think, to, to be fitted. Yes. They, they, they are actually being delivered tomorrow now and hopefully being fitted tomorrow or Monday. Yeah. Uh, we've, we've actually, there's actually doors and, um, we're going, we're going with a mesh as you'll see later, um, for these two low gates and, and, and that I'm afraid of wind. Yes. Okay. Like in that we're, we're a little bit elevated here and like a large gate, a fully sheeted door would be the endless. Yeah. So you're back and get us where beside it. That needs to be commissioned or has it run yet? Uh, it does just the last bit of duct has to be done to take the power to it, but, uh, it's, it's 90% there. Yeah. And that needs, you know, there's a bit commissioning and all that. Your, your feed bin, your augers are in. The augers are in. The augers are in. The augers are in. The second feed bin will be put in when we, when we decommissioned the dual pallor. Right. So we'll have to be up and running here first. Yeah. And that there's going to be two different types of feeds being fed here. Yeah. But, uh, we'll be initially better to start with the one. Okay. Spire feed, uh, fitted that, uh, like that was, that was only a couple hours of a project for them. Yeah. But, uh, very, very pleased with it. Like there's plenty of side classes and, and they have the inspection, uh, on the side of it, which will be safer if it has to be used down the line. So Dairy Master provided a project manager in Podrick. Podrick, yes. Yeah. It was a big help. It was a big support for you. Big support. Yeah. Yeah. Big, uh, big knowledge on it. Yeah. And say you as the project manager, was the reality you always needed somebody on site here? Say you or your son on site to manage it day to day or? Not, not, not really like, uh, like not for Dairy Master. Yeah. The wider project. Uh, they, they, they, they, they, they, they, they were like, you know, they were well able to, uh, and, and, and, and they would, they would query, they would query if there was any questions like they came and. Yeah. But like they were, they were very organized that way. Okay. Yeah. Like we would, like we would have, we would have a, a daily meeting or like, uh, uh, uh, as such, uh, you know, just, just to see what they were planning and doing and just, uh, like all that, uh, and was that something you did often have all, you know, get all the key project people in together or did you just meet them as individuals and then try and pull it together? Um, it was meeting as individuals, you know, due to circumstances, it was next to impossible to pull them all together. Mm. Well, uh, like, uh, like the, uh, like the builder, the builder was, was gone off the site here before the early master came in. Yeah. And, um, like, due, due to, due to, due to, due to everything running a little bit later. See, everyone, everyone due to the stuff to other, uh, in other projects, uh, like the, the, the time wasn't matching up dead on with it, with everyone. Okay. Was, uh, like it, it wasn't that we had to overlapping. Yeah. I suppose just to summarize all Martin, it is, um, you know, project managers are common, I suppose, for people with houses and stuff like that, or in the wider commercial industry, but it's maybe for farmers and I know it's not easy to get somebody, but not to rule it out where for a large project. Um, I would, I would see the big benefit. Yeah. Like, uh, I did make things easier. No one was one of the reasons I went with the early master because, uh, like, uh, like, uh, the milk tank was with him, the backing gate was with him. Uh, like, you know, that's a, that's a, that's a whole lot tying in together. Yeah. Like, uh, that, that would have added to more complications if there were, if there were different sources, those heat exchanges now, uh, and that's true. That's true. The early master as well. But, uh, time, time being a massive one then as well. Whatever you think it is, you might want to double it. Like, you know, if you're not, not to underestimate. A project like this, uh, running right would take nine months. Yeah. Nine to 12 months probably. And you could, you could, you could nearly be called heat. Like the, like it's, it's going to take 12 months in most cases. Yeah. Okay. Managing the finances then is another challenge, obviously in the budgets, keeping control of that. Yes. Uh, with what has happened in the last two years. Yeah. Hopefully it might be different going forward. Might settle. Yeah. But, uh, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, uh, it, it, it, it, it, it was one of the big worries I would have had. Yeah. Going through because I t, I think this is, when this tank was standing on here, uh, to, to, it was January 2022, that my builder came back here and informed me the first day that all concrete was up 14%. Yeah. So what did the cube of concrete cost then relative to now roughly? Any idea? Uh, I couldn't answer that. No, it was, like it was got through the builder. Yeah. Okay. That's okay. Uh, but, but it, it, it, it jumped, uh, from, from, um, from 2020 to my knowledge, it has changed four times. Mm. Uh, like, uh, I, I, I, I won't be sure of the percentages now, but it, it, it's, it's, it's probably, it's probably 35 to 40% more expensive. Yeah. And, uh, mightn't be stopped at that. Yeah. Uh, steel was the other big one. Rebar, rebar, uh, I think, I think that January, that January 22, now was the time that things were going, like, I think it was February, it jumped 30% one night. Yeah. The time of the war probably there in Ukraine as well. Didn't help. Uh, yeah, it was, I, I suppose it was around that time or just before it. Mm. It was, yeah, it would have been that time, I suppose, but 30% one, one night. Yeah. It, it, it, it jumped the rebound. Okay. But, uh, like, but hopefully we won't see the likes of that, but, but like, I never, I never, in my lifetime see double digit, digit increases, uh, to that, like. Yeah. Yeah. And it's become part of the norm, unfortunately, but hopefully it'll settle. And, and see the other thing now as well is that interest rates have been moving as well. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, like, uh, on, on, on, on the larger projects make a big difference. It does. And your input price is not dropping as fast and maybe your milk price dropping as well. So there's challenges there. And. Well, 2022, you would have to say it was a good year in milk. Yeah. 2022, uh, is, is taking a very, is turning as fast as, as 22 jumped up. It is. It appears to be jumping down as fast. No, it is. It is. Yeah. So look, it's a project you've survived anyway, and you're coming out the other side and you're nearly there. So. Nearly there. It'll be a big relief to you and we'll probably come back there just before you start or maybe shortly after your start. So, um, it'll be interesting to see that turning with cows. I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll be happy to see you getting dark. You'll enjoy that first couple of days or after the first couple of days anyway. A bit of persuasion made to get cows on, but. Well, I did. You'll suffer that fine. Every person I was speaking to that was coming from all situations said the milking was faster with that trouble than it was in doors. Yeah. True. It's a good way to finish it. Yeah. So, uh, like, uh, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we, we like to have that pressure sooner the better. No, no, no, for sure. All right, Martin. We'll chat again soon. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
