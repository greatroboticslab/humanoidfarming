Howto & Style
 Since most rubber trees are indoor plants, you can begin propagating them in any season. You may see better results when propagating in spring or summer. As rubber trees prefer warm weather, remember to keep your rubber tree cuttings away from drafts. Before you take your cuttings, you should be aware that sap of the rubber tree can be skin irritant. Sterilize your cutting tool with rubbing alcohol or any other disinfectant. Before you make any cuts, ensure that you identify the leaf nodes along the stem. As this is where the new roots will eventually grow. Make you cut just like you can see in the video and watch out for the sap. Now we have these 3 leaves cuttings, we will propagate them separately. Two of them are going in water and one of them in soil. Now we will divide these cuttings and make our cuts like this just like we cut and propagate pothos plant. After making the cuts, this is how they look. You can use rooting hormone to make process faster but it will grow by itself too. It's a hardy plant. Now prepare your medium with water. I am using small glasses. Now put the cuttings one by one in the glass and add water. And propagating in soil will require a well draining soil. Place your cutting roughly 2 to 3 inches deep in the soil and press firmly. And water it until it pours through the drainage holes. Our work is not done here. Now find a spot where they get indirect light. Humidity is very important for the cuttings. You can cover them with plastic bags on the top if humidity percentage is really low in your area. I am leaving it as it is. I have added some stones in the glass to keep them straight. And for humidity, a bigger pot filled with water. As you can see, this is going to maintain the humidity around the cuttings. Remember to keep them away from dust and direct hard sunlight. After 4 to 5 weeks, the cuttings will begin establishing roots. Cuttings rooted in water can take 12 weeks or longer to root. While cuttings rooted in soil take about half as long.
