 The pallets are available at most building suppliers. This particular group came from a plumbing supply outfit nearby here. The back pallet is about 8 feet long, probably used transport bathtubs or something like this. These ones are normal 4 foot by 4 foot. I stand one up on either end and two in the middle and that gives me three bins. You might need someone to help you hold them still while you complete this phase. Plain old bailing wire, readily available at the hardware store. Just loop it through, twist it, and then with a pair of pliers or nippers just tighten it right up. Cut that off, grab a hold of it, pull it tight, and then twist it. Just twist until it won't go anymore. If you keep twisting you'll break it, but if you break it just get another piece of wire. Wire's cheap. Okay? Cut off the loose ends so there's nothing sharp and tap that down. Continue that way through the other four pallets. You can do it top and bottom. And there you have your practically free three bin composter. Composter
