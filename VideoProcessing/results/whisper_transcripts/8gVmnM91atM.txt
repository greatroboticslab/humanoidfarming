 Recently I trained with the US Army for a hundred hours. We started off with a trench crawl This was insanely hard the first time but after having a bunch of soldiers right behind me I became a pro. Next I trained doing monkey bars the military way, but I've been doing this since I was a kid So it was a piece of cake. I even had to crawl under real bullets flying over my head after all that pressure My reflexes became godly. I mean look at me climbing up the massive rope net at basic training was terrifying the first time But I pushed through and even got so comfortable that I can climb a rope to the ceiling now It's safe to say the army got me looking good.
