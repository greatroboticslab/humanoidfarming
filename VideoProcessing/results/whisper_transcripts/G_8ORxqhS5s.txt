 and just a few things to think about when planting forage crops in the rotation first thing to look at is ideally get a soil analysis of the field that you're planning on growing the fodder crops and act upon the findings of that sorting out lime deficiencies and p and k deficiencies and ideally a year before you actually plan to plant the crop and think about the rotation most fodder crops are brassicas so you want at least six years between the brassica crops mainly to think about club roots then when it comes to drilling it there's two main ways of drilling crops for the crops now either using a direct drill to drill it into sprayed off grass sward which has got benefits when it comes to grazing off there's more of a sward to hold the livestock up or there's a traditional plow and drill method we need to roll the seed bed as soon as it's been drilled to conserve any moisture that's there and improve the seed to soil contact i think ideally i would like to plow cultivate and roll it's probably the more guaranteed and you start with a clean weed seed bank however if you're on steeply sloping land or stony rocky land then the direct drill approach would probably be my preferred but if you don't manage to get rolled because of rain in particular then that's not really an issue because you're going to have enough moisture from the rain to germinate the the seedling and once it's emerged there's not really much of an issue so i wouldn't roll beyond crop emergence timings most of these crops are sown in the april to june spell allowing you to utilize grass for an early bite and then once the grass gets ahead of the livestock you can take this field out of grass production and put it into fodder crop production all the compound fertilizer should be applied to the seedbed and at least 50 percent of the nitrogen should be applied to the seedbed but it's often all applied at the seedbed stage just to get the job done if there's farmyard manure available then that can supply some if not all of the the phosphate and potash requirements of a fodder crop and other things to take um and i think about is boron sulfur sodium depending on the crops and that you're growing
