Science & Technology
 Here's an idea for an indoor garden station. I'm building a shelf to set up a growth station for microgreens and microdwarf plants in hydroponics. For this setup I'm using SF-600 74 watt grow lights from Sviter Farmer. They're lightweight and highly efficient but what I really like the most is that they can cover a lot of space. Afterwards I found planters that I then converted into Kratky hydroponics. Mainly I'm using this station to grow microgreens because they grow really fast and I can harvest within seven days. The bottom is being used for seed starting so I can have a continuous supply of microgreens. For the middle shelf I'm growing microdwarf tomatoes and peppers.
