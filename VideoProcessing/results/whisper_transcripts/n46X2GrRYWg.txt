 Well hi, my name is Adi Tidy and welcome back to another edition of Canal Hunter. For this episode we've moved probably two miles as the crow flies and about five miles by canal to the east and we've come to Lord Hayes Branch. Now before I even start to explore the Lord Hayes Branch there's going to be a certain amount of controversy just about the name. If you look on most maps it describes itself as Lord Hayes Branch, Lord Hay apostrophe s. But according to the records there is no Lord Hay involved in this canal. You see when the Whirling and Essington Canal had the extension approved from Sneed Junction through to the Ogley Locks they also had two branch canals approved at the same time. One out to Hay Head, what we now know as Longwood Junction and the other one here behind me. So we believe that the original destination of this canal was to an area of undergrowth or a hedge belonging to a Mr. Lord. Therefore it was always referred to as Lord's Hayes. There's nothing on the map to suggest there is a haze out there now but there are plenty more around in the area if you care to look. So from here on as far as I'm concerned this is Lord's Hayes Canal. When it was actually finished it was just one and a half miles long but this for me really is a should have would have could have kind of canal. Its story isn't so much in what was built but what wasn't built. This could have been a really significant canal junction. This whole area seems to be very functional. Everything is just given a straightforward name. So as the canal left the junction behind me it went through a coal field known as the Fishly Coalfield or the Fishly Colliery and the Fishly Colliery had four pit heads which were unromantically entitled Plant Number One, Plant Number Two, Plant Number Three and Plant Number Four. And similarly the bridges running across this canal are Fishly Number One, Fishly Number Two, Fishly Number Three and then finally one they actually gave a name to at the far end and we're going to go and look for those bridges. But the most dramatic extension plan came about in 1827. In 1827 the Whirley and Essington Company decided they'd really like to make a connection through to the Staffs and Worcester Canal without having to be dependent on the Birmingham Canal navigations and the stranglehold they held over the Wolverhampton locks. So their cunning plan was to extend the Lord's Hayes Branch behind me from Fibbersley Number Two and to strike off to the north. And that was going to make this canal a full six miles long. It was going to reach all the way down to Carfe Heath which is where the old Hatherton Branch comes off today. And that didn't happen because in 1827 the Whirley and Essington Canal was already fully stretched having built the ugly flight of locks. And the trade wasn't blossoming. They were trying to go into a merger with the Birmingham Canal. And I just don't think they had the money or the resources to make this extra connection. But of course following the merger with the Birmingham Canal in 1840 there was a lot of activity going on making the connections through between the Whirley and Essington and the Birmingham Canal. So that took more attention away from the need to make another northern connection. In any case why would the Birmingham Canal navigations want to do that? They already had a perfectly serviceable route through the Wolverhampton locks. There was one final third plan developed to extend this canal in 1854. And this one was to take a slightly different route to get far closer to the Whirleybank collieries. But in the end the decision was taken to extend the Whirleybank branch which is the extension that we looked at in our last episode. So anyhow, I'm sitting here on what is supposed to be a gloriously sunny morning and it's raining like anything. So I think I'm going to stop there. I'm going to go up Lord's Hayes branch, see what we can find, and I'll fill you in on the rest of the story as we go. So let's get cracking. So this is the start of the Lord's Hayes branch. The first section through to Phibsley Bridge number one has all been filled in. Actually it was filled in by British Waterways. It's one of their official dumping grounds for canal spoil for many years. So this is the start of the Lord's Hayes branch. Maybe 100 yards into the course of Lord's Hayes branch you reach Phibsley Bridge. It's Phibsley Bridge number one. The northern parapet is still there. And I do believe that since I last came here it's possible to get around and have a look underneath. Let's get down and have a look. Well since I was last around this area this area has been cleaned out quite a lot. Not that you would get that impression looking at the amount of debris down here. But genuinely believe me this is actually quite clean or at least it's accessible. And we do have the north portal of Phibsley Bridge number one. The bridge has been widened over the years and the back end has been filled in. But the barrel roof construction onto the iron cross members is still all here. I apologize for the poor quality of the light. You are viewing this with the benefit of the light from a phone. But it is absolutely possible to imagine being on a narrowboat and emerging through this tunnel. And immediately beyond the bridge the canal track is in water, albeit at a much reduced level. Well I think that's it for now. What is normally a dry canal bed has suddenly become very wet. I think I'm going to have to take an escape out into the field next to me and jump along a bit. Now I'm making a bit of a detour through the fields. I have to say this is a one-way trip. It's a private land, there are no footpaths. So I'm doing this at my own risk. But right here where we see a slight groove into the meadow, this was the old basin for the Phibsley number one pit. And the pit head was in the trees over there. The last time I explored this canal it was after a very dry autumn. And I remember walking up this section, just a mass of fallen leaves. But you could walk up the saucer shape impression of the canal really easily. But to do that now I'd need waders. So I'm not going to try that. I guess I'm just going to keep following this canal around. I'll insert the old pictures that I took a few years ago. And I'll follow it around on the field boundary. What wasn't so apparent when I walked the line of the canal last time, because I was inside it, was the fact that actually I'm walking on quite a significant embankment. It's probably 10 feet high. Now I've decided to take a bit of a scramble up the embankment. And I found, came across this rabbit hole. And dug out of the rabbit hole, there are chunks of Phibsley coal. So my guess is that, as they undermined this area, the canal went down. And they used the old slag and the slack that came out from the mine and wasn't fit for sale, was used to build up the embankment. So let's go over the embankment and see if there's anything there. We appear to have come out on the top of the embankment at a very interesting point. So he's stepping carefully over the top of all the barbed wire. So I'm just retracing my steps a little bit here, because you can see the end of the water channel. And from there on, the ground is all built up. So instead of looking for a saucer shaped ditch, with probably some water in the bottom, from here it's been filled up with rubble. And we're actually looking at a manned up base. Now I don't know this for sure, but given the proximity to the officially number three plant just over the fields, and the fact that number four plant, which was maybe half a mile or so up near Newtown Bridge, and all traces of those pit heads have gone, it wouldn't surprise me if the rubble from the built remains of the old colliery pit heads in the area was trucked into the canal bed, and they just simply used it as one long linear rubbish dump. Anyhow, that looks a bit impenetrable. The golf course to my left has disappeared, so I think maybe I'll hop out again into the fields, duck around here and see if I can get to number two bridge. So, we've kind of got to somewhere just beyond fishley bridge number two. That was back that way. And we're now standing at the kind of crossroads of where all of those should have, would have, could have canals would have come across the line of this, the Lord's Hayes branch. I'll do my best to explain. We're looking down a hedgeway which now is all that remains of the line of the canal, and you can see the first corner coming up just about there. It was at that point the original 1794 deviation occurs, and the canal would have continued off, going initially straight and then bending around over towards the White House as you can see in the distance. Instead, the 1854 plan also looked to leave just there, but then it headed much more sharply to the north. As you can see, this is all very barren area, and if you are trying to name a canal to run across here, it's very hard to find any distinguishing features on the landscape whatsoever. So I guess a hedge or a clump of trees is about the best you could hope for. And as for the 1827 route, that long one that they planned to run all the way through from the Whirling-Essington out to Carf Heath, bypassing the BCNX section in Wolverhampton, well that would have crossed across just here. Let me just climb up this bank and I'll show you what I mean. The 1827 route would have come across the fields, following the contour at the end of the Blockswitch Golf Course over on the horizon there. It would have come through where we stand, and then would follow the field boundary, going straight out that way. This is all private land across here. As far as I can tell, there are actually no public footpaths crossing this section either. So if you choose to come and have a look around here, you do so at your own risk. And I think I would plead a nerdy interest in canal history, and appalling ability to read maps. And an open offer to escape from the nearest point possible. Oh, and like I'm doing down here, walk on the margins no matter how rough they are. Don't trample the farmer's fields. And then you will track the road from the 500 Fernando Alto丘 antelope hook. With you will be looking at that goal on the facade.45 agreement addition has a deal for for the defense system. And if you is walking towards west side, you'd have to wash your own steps. You will see that there will be staying around for 謝謝 time. When you are looking at one step to the other side, you do? You will see you at businesses in the property. You're looking at people in Anton and Diagram antelope Ils will abandon it. The Banks in the building blocks about 90 ? You can totally ease some real points and teachesряд of things around much time. So that you should be setting up these suggestions in the question. And so I'm feeling thank you, marshmallows could be a book called peak and entry on the safety network withfalians who you've seen the site. So that you do as well. After a paucity of built remains I've come across the mouldering remnants of Fishleigh number three bridge. I think the balustrades have all been dropped down with the water, in the water channel, but the outside wing walls still exist. There's very little left in built remains but here to one side of the channel there appears to be an emergency drain sluice. Stop plank grooves running down the side of it. There is a sluice gate assembly at the bottom and out here at the top there's the very distinctive remains of some BCN paddle gear. Now from here on the channel is again piled high with debris. And this is the last hundred yards leading up to the site of Newtown Bridge. The good news is I seem to have managed to cross the private land without being accosted, although I did seem to come within a hundred yards of a farmer letting off his shotgun. So I kept fairly low and fairly quiet in that section. Of course everything has been wiped away at Newtown Bridge. The road's been widened no end. But we're going to cross over into the park on the other side and have a look and see if we can find a terminus. So I've come into the park on the far side of the new town road. And in it there's a lovely fishing lake. I think it's called the Isaac Walton Lake. It's Isaac something. I don't know. But I'm going to go to the park on the far side of the Newtown Road. And in it there's a lovely fishing lake. I think it's called the Isaac Walton Lake. It's Isaac something. If I get that wrong comments below. Anyhow, if you turn around just to the road side of the lake, there is one final hurrah for the Lord's Hayes Branch Canal. It came in underneath Newtown Road. And I know its course goes directly under the buildings of the old people's home ahead of me. But here in a little trough is a little final remnant of the Branch Canal. And because it's been raining so much, it's even got some water for me. Well that brings us to the end of the Lord's Hayes Branch Canal. And I guess that's the end of this episode of Canal Hunter. It isn't quite the end of the canal. Because frustratingly, the final 200 yards with a two-fingered terminus basin continued on underneath the old people's home, which is behind me. But they've all been built over and they were built on the site of the limestone works, which was the original purpose that the canal was built. But it's impossible to have a look at the Lord's Hayes Branch Canal without considering the symbiotic relationship that went on with its next door neighbours. The Whirly Bank Branch, which was just merely a few hundred yards behind me. That's the Lodge Colliery, the Canuck Lodge Colliery. And the two were connected by a tramway. And of course, the reason that this canal was never pushed further north into the Great Whirly Coalfield was because the other canal went in at a much better angle and on a much better level. And the other canal you have to consider is the Canuck Extension Canal. That is a canal that was built somewhat later, but again driving in to this new coalfield. You see, the next section to be explored fills me with a combination of anticipation and angst. Because so much has been lost, the next phase we're going to explore will take us out from Pelsall Common, out on the Canuck Extension Canal, all the way to Hensford, through the Churchbridge locks and then down the Hatharton Branch Canal and out onto the Staffs and Worcester. The problem is the section out beyond Norton Canes has been opencast and utterly, utterly obliterated. When I did my original research in the area ten years ago, I stopped at Norton Canes because it's a bit like the edge of the map. Beyond here there'd be dragons, actually beyond here there'd be absolutely nothing because of opencast coal mining. Since that time I've been accumulating photos. And I think I've got a photo of nearly every single bridge running out on the Canuck Extension. So it's going to be a bit of a step in the dark and I'm a bit nervous because it's not going to be the usual format of Canal Hunter. So I would invite you to click subscribe and that way you'll get a notification each time a new Canal Hunter video comes out. And I would invite you to come out into the Canuck Coalfield with me and to have a look at this remarkable and very indistinct canal. So anyhow that's enough of the plugs for future episodes. I hope you've enjoyed this exploration of the one and a half mile Lord's Hayes Branch Canal. I'll see you soon. Happy hunting! Thank you. Don't miss anything! You You Thank you.
