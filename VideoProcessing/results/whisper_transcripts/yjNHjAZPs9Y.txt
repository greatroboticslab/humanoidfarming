 Three things you didn't know about cows. Cows like to play. When they feel very happy, many cows will forget how big and heavy they are, and will start to run, jump, and even play with a ball. Cows can swim. Cows may not seem like they are skilled at swimming, but they can actually swim quite well when they need to. Cows are extremely social beings who don't like to be alone. When a loved one is dying, they gather around them to comfort and mourn.
