 My definition of agritourism is fun on the farm. We started Calarix Corning Country the first year in 2008. This is our ninth season. We have a 40-foot slide. We have hay rides, the five-acre corn maze, two kid-friendly zip lines. We have a huge seven-ton corn bin. My daughter calls it a bathtub of corn. Just a lot of fun places for the family to come out and enjoy and make memories together. I've been really excited to see the growth of agritourism across the state of Tennessee. We have to thank the Department of Agriculture for that. Truly there is no way that we could have accomplished everything that we have without the Tennessee Ag Enhancement Program. We've been able to build the barn, our concession stand, the pavilions, our sound system, everything that really has grown our business. It's just been an incredible asset for us as farmers here in Tennessee that maybe weren't quite making it before. It's a great partnership. We are very, very appreciative and thankful for all that the Department of Ag does for us.
