 Ever wondered how much money you can actually make from a lemonade stand? Let me show you. Let's look through the weekend of June 24th through June 26th. I had three events total this weekend, totaling up to $4,437 in sales. For my cost breakdown, I spend about 20 cents per cup and lid, about 30 cents per lemon, roughly 7 cents for each cup of ice. Sugar is about 5 cents per lemonade. Once I figured these costs in with syrups and specialty supplies, added in taxes, event fees, payroll, miscellaneous expenses. Total profit for this weekend came out to be $2,498.08. Woohoo!
