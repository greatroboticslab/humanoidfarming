 Hi, Jason Kreps, RDO Equipment Company, Regional Sales Manager out of Sunnyside. Have our Earl Grape Liner Harvester here and a really exciting product for us. Gives us some great hill climbing ability which we need here in the Yakima Valley. This is going to be more your high quality picking machine here. We have really good picking head, trying to get that fruit zone, catching all your grapes as they kind of hit the bottom of the channel there. There's fans that kind of blow the material other than grapes, kind of blow that out the side. There's a conveyor belt that picks your grapes up and brings them up to the top of the machine. This one's kind of unique. You can either use the side discharge arm or you can put them into a bin. One other really nice feature of this machine, there is a cleaning de-stemming system where you're helping really get a very clean pick. So all your stems, all your leaves, any leaves that maybe made it up there, they're getting knocked out. But all your stems and the rachis are getting knocked out the side. The material that's actually going into your gondola is actually grapes. You're really eliminating a lot of cleaning back at the winery. They look top heavy, but it's actually a very low center of gravity. The engine is down low on the side so it's easy to service. They've been a really good product for us. Contact your local RDO Equipment Company store and find out how we can partner with you.
