 Hey everyone, this is Dorothee, your host of OrganicNation.TV. We're in East Aurora, New York at the Thorpe Family Organic Farm, which is a CSA and that stands for Community Supported Agriculture. So we're going to find out what that is and hopefully I'll get to help and get my hands a little bit dirty. I'm Gail Thorpe. My husband Mike and I have six children. We have an organic farm in Eastern New York. We have a CSA, which is Customer Supported Agriculture. We have about 350 families in that and they get organic berries and vegetables every week all through the season. We also have a small organic Jersey herd. We also grow a lot of organic grains, which get sold to other organic farmers. So you're saying this is a community supported agriculture farm. What does that mean? How does it work with your customers? It means that basically the customer and the farmer have made a bond. We have eliminated the middleman. Our customers for the last several years when we figured it out got two to two and a half times the dollar value of what they paid for just at conventional supermarket prices. If you figured organic, it would have been even more. And so when you say that they pay up front, does that mean that they're kind of investing in the farm, helping you buy seed and really do the work? That's right. And then they get to reap the benefit in the end? Yes, that's correct. Most of the money comes in up front so then you can, like you said, buy your seed, your organic fertilizer, your fuel, just have your expenses to go through the spring. And does that mean that you need to grow a wide variety of different types of crops just because families don't want to eat only tomatoes? Oh, absolutely. Yeah. I have the most fun all winter long, the seed catalogs, growing everything that we can and trying to put it in proper succession so that they don't have just one picking of tomatoes and one picking of string beans that they're ready in succession throughout the season. So you want them to be fresh for the consumer? Yes. Yes. For instance, the string beans are picked the day that they get them. Wow. They haven't been shipped from California and repackaged and dropped off at, you know, several different locations at warehouses and then finally hit the store. Wow. And so that's really different than the typical conventional farm, right? Because they tend to just grow one or two crops. Right. But you have to really diversify them? Yes. It might be something like 58 different crops just in the vegetable end, not including the other grains and stuff like that we do. And so now we're going to teach you how to plant. Oh my gosh. I feel like I'm on a roller coaster. I'm going to have a much more exciting one. So this machine will plant. Okay, as it's going around, we go down here. Okay, every sponge will take a dip. Yep, yep, that one. That will just go off. And then as she squeezes, this little piece makes them, they make them squeeze tight and then as it goes down, it releases them on the finger and it allows this plant to drop off in the dirt. And first it makes kind of like a little crevice. Yeah, when these little things make a crevice in the dirt. Ah. And she also has this V-shaped leg that pushes the dirt away so that the plant will go down. This is really cool. I have no idea that this is how they plant to make this. Families that are low income and high income benefit from this. And you have both types of customers? It's not just really rich people? We have all across the gamut. We have doctors, we have lawyers, we have people that are very wealthy down to the people that are struggling. The customer and the farmer work together on this. And now we get to see them every week. We develop friendships, relationships and it's good all the way around. The customer saves money and the farmer knows that he's got a demand for the crap. The customer saves money on how true to the dinosaur can Närk. So, we build買 commodities. Seriously, we need to sell people and value. Thank you so much how work. Amen.
