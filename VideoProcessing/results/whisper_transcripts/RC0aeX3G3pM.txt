Howto & Style
 Welcome to the Enduring Gardener. I'm stood in front of a new gravel garden and I'm going to be showing you the five steps to creating a gravel garden like this. Now the first thing you need to do when you're building a gravel garden is get it level. Think of it like a plate. It wants to be nice and level if it's tilting one way stuff's gonna fall out of it and that'll be your gravel. You don't want to be doing that. You want easy to maintain and easy to look after so get it level. Next up again like a plate it's gonna need an edge to stop the gravel falling off the edges. So I've built up the edge of this with a brick about an inch or two higher than the rest of the ground. Now the third thing you need to do is put down a weed suppressing membrane. This is called landscape fabric and it will stop the weeds from growing through as well as stopping the gravel from mixing with the soil underneath. Now it's important when you're laying landscape fabric to peg it down and keep it as tight to the ground as possible. You don't want that rucking up and coming up through the gravel. It will spoil the look of things. Now the fourth thing I'm going to be doing is putting the plants in place. Now this is the fun part. You can drag the plants around, step back, take a look with it. Does that look right there? No. Let's move that to the left. Let's move that one to the right. Once you're happy with the position, X marks the spot. You cut an X in the landscape fabric, peel it back, and then you can start digging into the soil beneath knowing no weeds are going to grow around the plant when you've got it in place. That means you can get your gravel all the way up to the plants for that neat look that goes perfectly in a gravel garden. The last thing to do is when it all comes together, when you add the gravel. Now this is an angular gravel which is one to two inches thick. Being angular, it compacts more readily than rounded pebbles so it's easier to walk through. So there's the five simple steps to creating a gravel garden. So don't forget to subscribe below, leave a comment, give us a thumbs up if you found this useful and we'll see you in the next video.
