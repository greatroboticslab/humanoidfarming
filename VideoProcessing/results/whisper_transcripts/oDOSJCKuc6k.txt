 Hello everyone, my name is Sydney. I work with Kijani Mtaani, a community initiative focused on restoring land in dry areas like Kaani. And in places like this, water is everything. It's where restoration begins for us. Without water, even the best ideas won't grow. So we have to start small, making sure the land is ready to support life again. And everyone plays a part, and together the impact builds. The land has seen a lot. Drought, overuse and neglect. But it's also full of potential. The land has seen a lot.

Drought, overuse and neglect. But it's also full of potential. The land has seen a lot. The land has seen a lot. The land has seen a lot. Drought, overuse and neglect. But it's also full of potential. Drought, overuse and neglect. At the will, there will be a lot. At the floods, we'll have to work. When it comes, our homes can work so if we get the farm to ensure that we can grow in the funding the prz tyle, or if we tap in the garden there'll get rid of the support. Drought, overuse and deportation, to support the你好 of the hole kind of lamenting our operated while we are caring. Young people, especially young women, are often left out of decisions about land. But we are showing that we have the skills, the energy and the will to farm differently. And this is our way of taking ownership. We grow different types of indigenous beans, seeds that have been with our people for generations. This is my seed bank where I do some sort of preservation of our indigenous seeds. Bearing in mind that we have climate change which has been contributed by doctored seeds, doctored technologies. Then we have forgotten about our indigenous seeds which were there, passed down by our ancestors, our parents. There is need for them to be in place because some of them are culturally acceptable. As we normally say, Mwachambila ni Mtumu, that who does leave his culture as a slave. So if we leave our indigenous seeds, we become slaves of the hybrid seeds, slaves of doctored seeds. So that's why there is need for us to preserve our indigenous seeds which are culturally acceptable by the community, which are nutritious, high in nutrients and which are adaptable to the local climate ecosystem. Many older women in the community still grow traditional grains like millet and sorghum. And their work keeps this knowledge alive. Restoration isn't just about planting trees. It's about rebuilding our local food systems that work for us. The Dufo Tanai In the heart of Rwanda, the Dufo Tanai organization is leading a powerful movement restoring landscapes and transforming lives. Today, across seven green villages of hope, we are working side by side with over 30 wanting 237 people. Over 2.3 million trees, fruit trees, and fodder trees have been planted. These trees are more than plants. They are food, income, and a shield against climate change. In our green villages of hope, families grow food and kitchen gardens, care for chickens, and receive training in sustainable farming, nurturing both the land and lives. Over 345 children receive chickens and fruit trees, giving them nutrition, responsibility, and hope for tomorrow. At our demonstration organic farm, farmers learn how to farm without chemicals, preserving biodiversity and growing health from the soil. We use a 20 liters pump. So, in 20 liters pump, you only use 100 ml. Make sure that the pesticide mix well. Make sure that the pesticide mix well. After finding that two out of five girls miss school during their periods, we created eco-friendly sanitary pads made from banana fibers. So far, more than 3500 pads have been distributed restoring dignity and education for girls. 15 women are transforming waste into beauty. Through our weed program, plastic bottles, paper, and banana fibers become eco-friendly products that empower and inspire. The youth are the heartbeat of our work, taking action in agriculture, arts, and climate justice. As part of the GLFX global network, our impact reaches beyond Rwanda. From trees to chickens, Path to Hope to Fotanai organization is building a better future. Join us. Support us. Be part of the change. Be part of the change. Follow us. Follow us. Follow us. Hello. I'm Geli Jojo. Founder and author of school food forest initiative. We are here in Namitulunga at Victoria primary school. This is one of the few of the nursery, food nursery beds that we started. started and some of them that we used to grow the food trees that we used to plant in schools to make them school food forests maybe you can show them some of the species we have you can come closer now this is a type a rare type of the overcaddle that we have this is an overcaddle type that goes faster and is resistant to harsh temperatures diseases and droughts this is one of the few that is grown here in Africa that can manage the terrain of Africa especially sub-saharan Africa Eastern Uganda it is first of all drought resistant and also disease resistant then we can walk you through to show you the wider range the wider range of avocado that we can't and work them currently we are in the middle these are the young ones that up to two to six months are to learn they are at this stage those are the other ones that are outgrown that have not yet been planted or transplanted to the main gardens so hello my name is Kamanzi Krodin from Rwanda I'm project lead of Forest for Life so this Forest for Life is made by four young restorists in this video so we'll be talking more about our initiative when it started mission and vision as well as the challenges that we are facing and the impact we also will be also sharing more about how we engage with our local communities hello my name is Adeline I'm a part of Forest for Life project so our initiative is about restoring the dry lands in Kayovi village located in Uugesera district which is one of the driest districts of in Rwanda so we do this by working with local smallholder farmers as well as primary schools by working with farmers we empower them by giving them education about the importance of restoring their lands using indigenous native tree species and then after training them we provide them with some tree seedlings to allow them go apply the knowledge we provided with them and also be able to restore the degraded lands of their agriculture courts we also work with primary school in order to cultivate the spirit of the spirit of environmental conservation and restoration among younger generation at their area age so we also give some some trees seedlings to these schools to give a good example to those kids and and make them get the passion for restoration hello I'm the name of Radu Kundalipons I'm a member of Forest for Life project one of the challenges we are facing is the sourcing of native indigenous seedlings as these trees are a layer in our region so to source them it requires more more money which that's why we need more funds so that we can have a great impact in our region another challenge we are facing is the climatic condition as we are walking in the dry land so sometimes some some species fail to grow so it requires too much attention and also too much monitoring so that we can irrigate those trees so that we can get what we want to address the climatic challenge we have decided to use the simple irrigation technique by using the water bottle where we pour water into that bottle and that bottle is having holes which release water slowly into the seedlings to address these challenges we have decided to establish our own nursery of indigenous trees and this nursery hopefully is going to be full by the by the end of this august and the way we are engaging the local community we are trying to have the frequent visit in their farms and trying to work with the local readers we have decided also to work with the primary schools where we are working closely with the head of the of those schools as you have heard more about Forest for Life project join us Tristole the dry land of Kayovi village for greener future
