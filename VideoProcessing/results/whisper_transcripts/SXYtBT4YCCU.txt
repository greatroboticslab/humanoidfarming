Education
 Good morning, good evening, thank you for listening. This is an agricultural and horticultural gardening show focusing on plant science, soil science and microbiology. Any information is for educational and scientific purposes. It's fact checked. Any of the papers and websites that are discussed will be put in the description below. In today's last week, if the microbes and agricultural course, it's going to be great. And I'm going to go through my latest microbial research that I'm doing at the end, which is quite up to date and interesting for those who know plant science and microbiology, you'll like it. Excuse me. So if you're rewatching this back, fast forward until you see some slides or the screen change. I'm going to give it another 60 seconds to arrive. 40 seconds. 40 seconds. 40 seconds. about 10 seconds. 10 seconds to go. Now I'm starting. Righto, here we go. Microbial. Bio-control. Reproduction is the stuff on today's agenda. Actually, I'll just change the screen. The last four approaches. Last four sections. So traditional approach in bio-control. Pure culture. Microbial. This involves using single well-characterized microbial strains that are isolated and cultivated in controlled environments. The strains are specifically selected for their ability for different pathogens and to promote plant growth. You're selected for different reasons. Example, Bacillus syringensis. Widely used as a bio-insecticide. And it works really, really well for a trichoderma species. These fungi are employed by suppressing fungal diseases in plants, promoting healthy root systems and overall plant resilience. And if you're getting certain members, BT produces oxen, IAA, and trichoderma. Varadi does. And trichoderma haserium does not. There is a person who's wanted to choose a biocontrol because when they live in nutrients, they're in directamente, LRB data netroom.pad Could be targeted for agricultural biomass. Sanitary examples are primarily for agricultural print. auf dasnauva algunas我 Kellск It just takes care of it, you don't have to worry about it. And then it will keep taking care of it if it's going to reproduce like spore form like bacteria, most bacteria. Its limitations are pure cultures. There's a narrow scope of pure cultures that often do not have a limited range of activities and may not address complex pecs and disease interactions. So for overall, actually, no, because there is some ones that do it overall like Montgerenesis is a biocontrol pest to get different types of pests, insects, so it's a bio insecticide. So that does take care of quite a few, but in general they only do one or two things. So that's why you've got to have a few in your belt, a few in your arsenal to get different jobs done. So, yes. So, yes. So, yes. Some, like last week we were going on about how microbe interactions, some are competitors some like lactose for instance, that puts out a heavy biofilm. That's why it's used in preservatives and food. So that one has a lot of competition against a lot of others. That's what that means. Shifting paradigms in biocontrol. So, this approach involves manipulating the entire microbial community associated with plants, including all the microbes as well. It focuses on enhancing or modifying the plant microbiome to improve plant health and resilience against pest and disease. Kind of what I do, because you can take any soil, any substrate which is healthy and improve it. That's what this is talking about. So if you want to get into that, there's the paper down the bottom, the DOI. Put those numbers in. That will be a good read for you. That was written in 2020. Just a slide to save. That's a comparison between individual microorganisms based reduction approach and microbial community based holistic approach. It's hard to read. It's a shame. It's hard to read. Key strategies. Four of them. Inoculation of soil in the rhizosphere. Two. Endophyte and seed microbiome engineering. Three. Host mediated selection. Four. Tissue and wound inoculation. Four ways to get your microbes into your plant and soil. And which one's easy? Inoculation of soil in the rhizosphere is easy because you'll make your, most of the microbes are water soluble. Meaning they will, everything will dilute in the water. There'll be no residue left over. So that's where you pour it in, you make ratio up and inoculate, you know, put it in water and administer it that way. This one, endophyte seed microbiome. I should just read this instead of trying to explain what they're doing. I don't like doing that though. Modifying the microbiome with plant tissue or seeds to enhance resistance to specific pathogens. Endophyte seed microbiome. So what that means is you'll get your right microbe, which is an endophyte, which lives inside of the cells. And that will transfer in the reproductive bits. And then for the seeds, the progeny that is produced, should have those endophytes in there as well. That's why they say you can't import seeds. Host mediated. So that's why also buying seeds or sourcing seeds or from an organic producer is way better for that reason. You're getting your microbes, which work with that species already. Host mediated selection. Host mediated selection. Microbiome communities based on the interactions with specific plants hosts to enhance plant defense mechanisms. Tissue and wound inoculation. Well, it says, pretty much says it. You'll scratch the surface off, expose a bit of the phloem or xylem, the bits that are wet, and inoculate that. And then that should get into the cells and be transported around through the plant. Yes, but the benefits is other things can get in too. That's the only problem about that bad one. So the best one really is this one. Because develop, you'll slowly develop this anyway. And this way is just easy. I should see if there's any questions. There he is. Good. Genetic memory farm says, good morning, good peeps. I hope you're all safe and happy. Good day, mate. I hope you're safe and happy too. It's the last week of this course. So please suggest stuff to go on for next week. So I don't know what you're talking about. I got a Q&A at the moment. Where are I up to? No. You don't want to see how much solar I'm producing. Advantages of microbiome engineering. Holistic management, enhanced resilience, and adaptability. So by doing all these things, by inoculating the soil myososphere, you can get these type of approaches, these type of advantages. It's all around really good. And the challenges of doing it, it's very complex. What can be? Stability and persistence and regulatory and statutory and safety issues. So it's hard to know without your education. Well now you've got this search engine. So I've just been explaining through these last few weeks how to get results by our search engines that we use. Taking photos or putting in the right words. And therefore you'll know what to source. Once you've got that, source it. And that's the hard bit. It's really the challenges. The safety issues. Well, Bacillus cereus is good for food poisoning. What's another one? Bacillus ligniformis. That can do it. So you've just got to be careful using them really. Yeah. Future directions. The shift to microbiome engineering represents a forward thinking approach to biocontrol. Leveraging natural interactions with microbial communities to achieve more sustainable and effective pest and disease management. Optimizing microbiome designs by developing methods to precisely engineer and monitor plant microbiomes for specific agricultural needs. Also interact microbiome engineering with other practices by combining microbiome engineering the traditional IPM and understanding long-term impacts by studying long-term effects of your microbiome modifications on plant health, productivity and ecosystem dynamics. That's pretty important. The first one. This is, of course, was written last year. Excuse me. So this, that sums up the future. So if you can really do a few of those things, you're up there with the leading scientists in what they're doing to try and move forward. So this is the development of the development of bacterial biocontrol agents. So how do you develop them? How can you reproduce them? This is a rad bit. So you can do a selection of antagonistic bacteria. So you can isolate it and screen it out and let's develop it. Okay. This is how they, for instance, you might want to get an azo out of your soil. So that's what you'll do. Isolate it and then screen it, identify it and go through the blast system and it'll be identified. So this is the lab approach. Then once you've got your, the blast will come back and tell you your DNA and it'll match with this number of 97% and then you'll be pretty right. And you've developed it. You know what it's like. Then you just got to reproduce it. That's the bit I was sort of thought this was. Then registering. Okay, good. Development of bacterial biocontrol agents. Isolating and screening. Oh, that's kind of was. Effective sampling for diverse niches and proper selections of sampling media and isolation techniques are crucial. Bacterial antagonists are found in plant environments and bare soil. So that's why I say at the end, I'll be going through my latest research, which is of the psychrotroughs, cold temperature environment. It's going to be pretty rad to hear that. I shouldn't even talk about the start, but oh well. But it's the future. And if you can really do that, you're up there with what everybody's studying or researching at the moment. I was, I've only, I only thought of it coming into this winter and then I've looked into it in the research engine. And I'll talk about that more at the end when it's on describing what the psychotropic bacteria. So developing the strain selection. Characterizing. That's where they'll put it, upload the DNA data. And the final stage is focused on large scale production, formulation and preservation. So this is where you go and buy your stuff off. So I read retail outlet sources them from these places that do this process, which is what I was involved with. Bacteria. Beneficial bacteria. And here's an example, another screenshot for you, because it's got some genome sequences. So the numbers of specific, you'll look up a study and I'll have used FT333 of variety, Strychoderma variety. That's variety, Varunz. I'm never, anyway, possibles out. Osarium. That's about wrong do. But, so examples of why this is important is because you'll read a study and it'll say that they used trichoderma varieties FT333. And then you'll go, wow, how cool. I know what to, what strain number they've used now. How do I get it? Oh, well you get onto your mob and they go, oh, we can't get it. It's not accessible. You'll go, I've got the accession numbers. And then you'll give them that. And then they can source it from their wholesaler. So that's why these things are important. Published in and after 2015. So that's relatively up to date. Well, not to be honest, actually, not many of these studies have done. Look, see there's Bacillus cereus. That gives you food poisoning straight up. Look at all the difference of TILUS. It's one of the most studies around. It's even good for humans. Anyway, let's go on with it. References, that's it. So now it's up to my little bit. So I'll see if there's any questions. No. All right. I'm going to get into it with my latest, what I've been doing. Excuse me. So what's that? 17, 15. This is my latest research that I've been into. So here's a study on cyclophilic bacteria phosphate biofertiliser. So there's cyclophilic is temperatures, say, at freezing level where microbes interact. The next one up from that's mesophilic, which is about 20 degrees room temperature or 65F, 70F. And then you go up to thermophilic, which is what you want in your compost heaps. So in winter, crops don't really function well because of nitrogen assimilation is slow. I'm not going to go into that. You get about 10% at 10 degrees Celsius. So 50F. So it still can happen. So to eliminate cold stress and to make this process happen faster or like as if it's not cold for them, I got into this studies. So this is this is in the description below as well. So I bought it. So pretty much described what it is. So what happens is when the microbe it's these different microbes, they will secrete enzymes that are what's the word I'm looking for here? Cryoprotectin. That makes sense. Where I was up to actually section two. Yeah. No. Further on. The cold regions cover a massive amount of the earth. So this is really good to get into. Let's just say some some notable plant promoting bacteria inhibiting the extreme cold environment. Some genuses, Pseudomonas, Shrachia, anyways, quite a few of them. How do cold active bacteria survive under cold stress? Osmo protection. That's what you're looking for. Because to thrive well under cold extremes and protect themselves from cellular injuries or to reduce the destructive effects of ice crystal formulation. Microbes have developed various structures and functions. So if you can get these microbes, they will do your job for you. And can turn crops that are not frost tolerant into frost tolerant. And all of a sudden you might get your different crops that are growing a more vigorous from these microbes. Or these enzymes, as I'll get to a bit later. Because Osmo protection. Antifreeze proteins. Oh, there it is. Cryoprotectin activity. At cold temperatures, the membrane of cold active bacteria becomes significantly more inflexible, which activates a membrane brown sensor. The sensor up-regulates and different genes are adapted. It up-regulates different genes that assist bacteria to adapt to the cold. So, therefore you think, oh, how cool is that? Well, what? Maybe I don't need these microbes. What about I just get types of cold active plant enzymes? What types are they? Maybe I can source them. Oh, maybe. Because those types or key types of cold active plant enzymes include pectinase, protease, amylase, and lipase, lipases. Which is unique roles in breaking down specific substrates as well. But they're cold active plant enzymes. You want active, not passive. They want to be active and they can actually do jobs for you. And then you'll think, well, is there anything I could read on that? Well, there is. Here's a study that was released a few months ago on cold active microbial enzymes and their biotechnology applications. So, that's what I'm into at the moment. And you can see it's quite, I can't see that anymore. I'll bring up the, uh, I'll bring up the, uh, I'll bring up the demo. Not bad. Why they won't show me the. It's a shame. It's a bit bigger. Cold active enzymes. Here's some study. Remember I was talking before about that sheet. But why would you want that sheet? Because after reading some, for instance, uh, biopoply, bioremediation. Uh, letter and textile. It's hard for me to give an example. Well, if you're reading these studies, you can go through and get the actual one that you want if they're listed in these studies. Here's some important cold enzymes and their microbial source. So I was saying last show that I really would like to go to a snow or glacial environment and just scoop up some of their substrate and rear that. So make a tea out of it, uh, and try and reproduce some of those microbes that are there in there. Because those are the ones that will, uh, there's an example of the cryobacterium. Wow. You know what that is. That's cool. Subgrasio under five Celsius. That's rad. I was looking for a name that might be familiar that I could relate to. Trichoderma gamesy. The trichoderma one, but well, they're actually, it's perfect because in 2023, Wang did this study on biochemical properties of cold active chitinases from marine trichoderma gamesy. This one. And the chitinase produces the enzyme, which works in the cold weather. So for you to source this exact microbe, you want the R1 and you will get this outcome. That's a way better example of how I was trying to get to before. Remember I said I'll wait till later on. Cycrobacter. That's rad because a psychotroph is a microbe that's works around the freezing levels and psychobacter. I just thought they'd name that one and it works in zero. Look at that actually freezing level 37 Fahrenheit. That's great. That's great. I found in Siberia. Now, interesting. This is so fascinating because what happens if we can get a fair bit of these exact ones because the ones you'll find that, you know, it's a good time to talk about that too. So I'm going to try to get a trichoderma gamesy. I can probably get that in Australia and it won't be the R1. So it won't be putting out chitinase and doing the job that it should be as a cryoprotectant, which is what I would like it to do. So by getting sourcing them in these cold environments, they're pretty much developed the strains over years and decades and years and years. The microbes are billions of years old with a bee. So from sitting in those environments over billions of years, they've epigenetics has just slowly developed their genes to adapt. This is a decent list here. I'll be downloading this list. It's still spingless. See, there's an example. I'll use that one. And people would think, oh, rad, I'll use that one. It's going to be putting out, well, actually, it might put out protease, but it mightn't be a cryoprotectant in the sense that I'm looking for. This is cold, dark, dark, and food. Okay, now it's going to break it down a little bit more. This is cool. Yeah, I haven't read through this one. Another one for me to read. Oh, I'm not sharing. Are you joking? I'm not sharing. Did I not share that whole thing? Last 10 minutes I've been talking about this example. Oh, no, I've been talking about this example. Oh, no, no, that's right. I did stop to ask questions, then it was the last little bit that I wasn't sharing for. So that you won't see, you've seen pretty much all of it, except for, well, I assume, except for this list. So if you wanted this list, you can get this paper in the description anyway, and you can go and download the list afterwards. But this is the list I was talking about, how different microbes in these environments have specific strains and that they, those strains are relevant to the bacteria. Cold weather, where the strains that I can get are exactly the same species of microbe, it's more than likely will do another thing. And on the left is all the enzymes that it puts out. And then you can go and download the list afterwards. But this is the list I was talking about, how different microbes in these environments have specific strains and that they, those strains are relevant to the cold weather. And I like this one because it actually mentions the temperature. Zero is freezing, so 37F. Five degrees F is 40 Fahrenheit. So if you live in North America, Canada, States, source, go to your glacial areas, get some of the soil, put it in the soil, put it in the tea and spread it in your garden. And you might get some cryoprotection and some benefits in the wintertime. If you get a sudden frost, it might be frost tolerant. And then you'll go and develop seeds from that, which will change your genes. So you bioengineered a different species on, I suppose it could be species because DNA tests different. But you've gone and altered it to your advantage. That's what this is all about. It's pretty cool. So I'm still showering. Good. Then it goes down. Okay, we'll talk about each enzyme in the cold environment, how it works. Like amylase. It breaks down starch. It's one of the ones in the seeds. Remember that the seed puts out, because most of the seeds starch, so I can use that as energy. Cold active amylase. Antarctic bacterium. It's the first microbe producing cold adapted alpha amylase, which was extensively studied and been magnified, expressed, magnificently expressed in a mesophilic host E. coli. Wow. This is cool. This will all be happening. These will be available probably next decade in the 2030s. You'll see all these microbes will be available and people will be growing in cold weather. It's that easy to do. Mind you, it's easier said than done. I've got no access in Australia where I can go and do it either, unfortunately. We don't have glaciers here. We have cold environments, but there's no real glaciers that would harbor these types of microbes. So I'd have to be looking to import the strain names of this list that was up here of some of these ones, if I was really interested. And then for me to do that, I'd have to go, well, okay, why do I want protease? What's the breaking down actually? So I want more of a cryoprotectin and that might be like, um, the stuff you put in your radiator in your car, the glucan and that stuff. Um, let's just run the off track now. Nitrous oxide reductase. Like, I don't know how that is worked as a cryoprotectin. Or as, Osmo, what is that word again that they, Osmoprotectin. Osmoprotectin. Is that the word? Yeah. Osmoprotectin. So that's how I got to that. Now I found out for this. So you people in the cold environments can get an upper hand in the studies that I'm doing. Look at this one. 22 Celsius. What is this in here? See, that'd be good to read that. Production, purification and characterization of cold active diphase from a cyclotroph pseudomonas species. But yet the temperature of habitat is 20 Celsius. That's pretty interesting. Look at what difference. Oh, look how big they've got it now. I used to do this and just see if you can read it and it's nearly the whole page. You've got no blooming choice. This is why I want figures and references. I like them. There they are. So this one tested. Pseudomonas petita. Do we know? No. It's familiar to me, no? Azote forms. Wow. That's azote suggested it might produce nitrogen. I don't know any of those. Unfortunately. Production, purification practices. Other references is there. I got them. Diphrine. I'm probably studying out loud here doing research. This is how I would look through. Glotting chart. Okay. and the references is there I got them studying out loud here doing research this is how I'd look through the blotting chart okay I really yeah it's just after the names of them and see the strain numbers I think very very important for these types of studies T to MT so for my source I would try and look up the MT 626824 and I might have some luck in cold environments if it's the same condition so see how they've grown it here they've inoculated it and they've reproduced it and the temperature 10 degrees has led to maximum lipase activity and they have 23 micro micro mills microliters per milliliter that's rad 10 degrees celsius that's the best bit it's a cyclotroth that you can grow reproduce and it's even gives you a formula so wow soybean 7.5 soybean oil as the base media that's a fair bit of weight isn't it huh soybean oil it's a new one see all these science just keeps evolving so I love it sleeping cool eyes here's some other similar anyway should see if there's any questions any questions no questions that's unfortunate hope you're enjoying it if you're enjoying it please press the like button and if there's any suggestions for shows next week please add them because I don't know what I'm going to be talking about might have a q&a that's what I've got it down for so if I get no suggestions I'll just have a q&a discover those early news I use pseudomonas florenz so subtilis is always in everything it's probably even on the schedule list where you don't even need an import thing there um um demon extraction culturing of life layers sea cultures life layers activity very good so it's just experimental design about it's not it right purification results seven bacterial isolates capable of growing at 10 celsius or 50f were isolated directly from sea water only a strain named a6 displayed growth at 10 c after all recovered isolates were examined for their best growing temperature the ability of a6 to produce life layers was assessed qualitatively as a result isolate was chosen for future studies so they found one at least they found one a6 and a seven a6 pseudomonas they got it oh wow see down here it shows the pseudomonas a6 and then it shows all of them in a6 which is all these why are we blast revealed that it had a hundred percent similarity to the genus sumonus there you go it's great the stuff i love these things you can solve your own solutions and do results and get results regardless so the carbon source that's why they use soybean oil huh is that a fructose deep frying waste is in here they've even used that as a growth media deep frying waste of course you put it through your autoclave and sterilize it but man that's just amazing all these coconut was one of the first steps how they with tissue culture what have they done there that's great few signs if you don't stay up to date i'm only out of tissue culture for probably 12 18 months at the most let's cool those productive purification okay because once they in the lab by culturing up these secondary metabolites they get nano amounts and then they've got to go and like if you buy a um essential oils bottle it'll come out with very concentrated so you've got to purify it and like all that we fold it over and over anyway that's what they got to do so that's so you don't get much out of these actual productions of secondary metabolites but it's the overall summation of them all and you do it over and over and it keeps working cold adaptive proteins and enzymes are found in psychotropic bacteria which allow them to keep metabolic activity at low temperatures that's the whole that's what i would like to have said at the start actually copy that i can go i'll put that in later on that's exactly why i'm interested in it proteins and enzymes i didn't mention proteins i'll leave that highlighted because i like that recently many publications have been reported so pseudomonas florenz yeah ke 38 let's see what one i use and then they found a6 groove that's right which is about alpine i like the snow similar findings were seen for life-based production in neutral to alkaline media conditions by psychotropic bacteria that were isolated from alpine regions so yeah there's something to do with uh different micro strains up there let's there go and there you go approved it not proved it i've shared it with you so you can do your research as well and that proved and nothing science is just science forever changing okay well i'll put those uh papers in the description i'll give it a bit add some questions if you got any please or discussion topics because the show's going to end in a few minutes i'll give you a chance to come through think of anything there's a couple of people watching and press the like button if you you enjoyed it i love talking about microbes because they're the future make microbes work for us so cool oh yeah that'll do i'll also keep just talking about microbes so next week is going to be a question and answer so i'm going to sit on the screen and probably just uh i don't know but i've got no suggestions to do any topics so i'm going to do that so hopefully there'll be a few q and a's there uh and if it's a short show it's a short show i haven't had a short show for ages it's about all these topics these awesome topics i've enjoyed the slides very cool gmf says if i can think of any for next week i will holla yes thanks mate i messaged you i gave you a message too on zoom um and i'm not sure really but i don't mind the q a for a bit that'll give me a bit of time to think about stuff too because my studies start up in four weeks time and i don't know about you but you folks in north america i hope you're getting into the cricket the uh mlc's on major league cricket and it's been it's cruel as there's heaps of international players playing and six teams six states have got a team now and there's going to be way more it's going to get big too i might even take over mlb oh look out baseball fans people are swearing at me in a moment no it's a it's a um international sport it's very popular gmf says popping seeds soon so it will likely be that oh very good so yes some inoculation questions that'll be all right i can maybe actually yeah that's a good idea ask that gmf and i can um i'll go through some nanotechnology about seeds what you can inoculate them with do your own a b c you know three different strains of your different um seeds one can be with pyro one can be with uh and or something else and zinc i don't know something else but yeah i admit never watch cricket would you watch cricket it just says gmf never watched it they were one bit i like is um i watch it every day it's there's a match on right now when we finish here i'll be watching the match uh texas rangers versus uh i think it's la night riders um goes for three hours it's an hour into it already no it's two hours into it so it's an hour to go but um for today's match and then tomorrow there's two so that's rad but anyway yeah they're interviewing the crowd and the crowd people are just saying differences between baseball and cricket and yeah it's um cricket's more of a joint sport like the teams are very friendly with each other they shake hands they say to talk to each other on the field and they laugh and carry on whether i stand with baseball and other sports at these coliseums it's very one-sided and not as fun not as not fun not as uh well cricket's more funner and i was very happy to hear that because i i really like cricket i watch it all differently i watch a few different leagues around the world you watch a few short um yeah i could watch it message message on zoom and when i watch it i can help you with the instructions because it's it's funny and they interview the crowd a lot which is what i like and you get some funny remarks from the crowd and these little kids want they're going to get into cricket and their favorite players and it's um it's really enjoyable it's it's a good all all-around sport so i just wanted to share that because i know most of the people that watch this stream are in the north america and after the north american league uh the usa league goes the west indies league in barbados down that down below so it's cool and i can't do a live stream on youtube with the cricket because i'll get street i'll get a band thing i'm not allowed to do that because it's you know it's a paid telecast type thing and yeah i've gotten trouble ages ago from doing the surfing which i got a big strike on that i said three of them and your your channel's gone i already had one so i don't want to risk doing another one yep yeah that's the go so next week will be a question and answer possibly a seed thing possibly see how see how he feels see what other people in chat um reckon reckon as well like to help out as many people as possible and thanks today i think that's it for today i'll just be otherwise talking about cricket we are cricket on right now let's go watch it i'll just i'll check it out and tell you actually who is playing i'm not sharing make sure i'm not because i'd get trouble sharing there it is yes texas super kings and the san francisco unicorns you get match finishes in just over an hour i'd love to share the screen and play it but i can't if you don't get the uh you don't need to pay for it either and that's how i don't get it i don't pay for it but there's a lot of ways to get it without paying for it um actually i better not go down that route best thing is if you really want to watch it put in the texas super kings versus the oh willow by crit oh where's this i'm not sharing no there we go that's the um that's what's on right now so if you really were interested you could put that into your search engine and yet that might come up with um suggestions on on how to watch it online for free but yeah that's it for today thanks everyone for watching i hope to see you next week see you brother be safe says gmf thanks for your nice words mate and everyone happy breeding happy growing good health to you all have a fantastic week and weekend bye bye
