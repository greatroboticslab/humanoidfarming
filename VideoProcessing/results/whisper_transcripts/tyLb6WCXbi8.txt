News & Politics
 Sometimes we would critique it to my recollection anyway so I think it would be good if we did. It gives us also a better sense when we come back about the need for extensions and so on even in the chamber as to what responses and things were coming back. Any alternative to that? Are you guys happy then that that's the approach we take would look to getting it prepped but for a response time of mid-October then? Chair and putting it out soon as. So it could be a slightly longer consultation period than because we have that time. Next week we'll bring a draft question for the citizens face and the press adverts and things that you need to agree for. Okay. So agenda item four is the minutes of the meeting on the 19th of June. Refer to page 7 to 20 of the pack for the draft minutes in the meeting. So if you're content members with the minutes please say so. If not let me know if you are content I'll sign them and we'll publish them on the website. Everybody content with the minutes? Yeah. Thank you members. 10th of June matters are rising. Refer to pages 22 to 24 of the pack to the response from the department dated the 8th of June regarding either Belfast Lock Marine Conservation Zone. As you will recall we considered correspondence from the Northern Ireland Marine Task Force at our meeting on the 5th of June and agreed to forward the correspondence to the department request that considers appropriate action to protect the zone. The response states the department has been engaging with stakeholders including the Marine Task Force and with commercial shipping agents to discuss the issue and the development of a bylaw to prohibit anchorage or anchoring. In the zone and there will be a public consultation later this year on that matter. The proposed bylaw will affect international vessels that are waiting to enter Belfast Harbour and therefore consideration needs to be given to international maritime law and relevant duties under the UN Convention on the Law of the Seas. The department will provide updates to the committee in advance of the public consultation and at each subsequent stage in the bylaw making procedure. Are you content to note or have you any comments to make? If you are not content to note thank you guys. For the next item I refer you to pages 26 and 27 of the pack to the response from the department dated the 23rd of June regarding the A5 Western Transport Corridor and the scheme and also the single file payment. As you will recall following our concurrent meeting with the committee for infrastructure on the 3rd of June and our meeting on the 5th of June we agreed to write to the department with a number of queries. Dair's response is that DFI has provided Dair with the outline maps of the A5 route enabling overlay into Dair's farm maps and identify the fields impacted. However as permanent fencing has not yet been completed no over declaration penalties will apply to the impacted land until Dair is able to determine the accurate areas. Dair also states that Dair is not yet in a position to provide the exact area of vested land for the A5 however officials did meet and provide technical assistance to a number of farmers seeking help with their 20-25 claims. Dair's response also states that in the A6 example as the eligible land vested qualified for force majeure no reductions were necessary but members as you are aware the High Court ruling on Monday will no doubt further exacerbate the state of limbo felt by those farmers and their families affected by the scheme and now they face yet further delay. Dair's response is that Dair's response to the minister for infrastructure is briefing the committee next week so I would propose we request that any briefing materials are then shared with this committee and I presume that the session will be covered by Hans Sard. Members that's a very small action off the back of what I've just read out. Firstly are you content that we share this response that we receive with the committee for infrastructure and the UFU? Are there any other further comments in regard to the states members? Well I think chairman now that the vesting is being rescinded according to the minister in the house on Tuesday. We need to be clear in our minds as to what support the minister for agriculture now is going to be given to these farmers. There's a lot of land that's been dug up and has been somewhat left unrecognisable. And again we need to know what support the agriculture minister is going to be given to these farmers for the restoration of this land again. Now I know that a good bit of that lies with the Department for Infrastructure but at the same time I think that the Dair minister and department I think there's some input that they have there as well. So obviously two departments need to be working together on this again to see what can be done for the restoration again of this particular land. Because if it's going to be the vesting is going to be lifted it's going to be going back to the landowner again. But gosh there's a lot of work that needs to be done. Well there's a couple of things on that just because I still haven't got my head around some of it. So the first thing is that off the back of our concurrent meetings with the committee for infrastructure it was evident that there hadn't been any significant level of cross departmental work on this over the project. This is obviously before this has happened so that was evident. What struck me was the minister did respond to say that the land that had been vested would be returned but the minister also said that the A5 is still going to go ahead. So one of the concerns that I also have is that if land that has been vested is returned and then revested like what sort of what sort of a hokey pokey hokey cook like it's it's not even it's it's terrible because there are families that have been seriously affected tragically and a lot of people want the road and everybody wants the improvement. But if the best that departments and government can do is like one leg in one leg out one leg in one leg up without being firm on this and I think it goes back genuinely think it goes back to the lack of inter department work and awareness of the impact and the lack of learning from from from previous. Did you want to come in or just I haven't looked at yourself and then Michelle do you want to come in? I will listen I can't overstate the huge level of disappointment especially amongst the families who've lost loved ones on the road. And this this this this you know literally the serial objecting for the last over a decade is was actually causing this just a serial objecting and using environmental legislation to carry out these objections. This was causing this hokey cokey that you're talking about and the huge amount of pain this is causing families. So I know I was in the court whenever the judgment happened already and then it was it was like a terrible blow and I can't imagine what it would feel like for the families. But I do listen to the minister that they are going through the the judgment of their legal people as well. So important to sort of also with the come of what the department's doing as well when they go through that judgment. You know, you know, on that point is that I think that that's absolutely fair because the judgment is lengthy. The judgment indicates that the Department for Infrastructure did not provide the relevant information in regard to the climate legislation. And they may they may still do that. They may still choose to do that. What I what I what I couldn't understand is that is that is that I suppose that Tom says that the minister indicated that the land would be returned. And I am not sure as to how accurate that is. I'm going to be honest. I'm not sure that that would be the process that they will follow if the Department for Infrastructure actually do provide some certainty around, you know, the credentials and around the time. And actually, I think we do need to get to the bottom of that. I suppose. Michelle. Michelle. Yeah, just a comment with regards to that. I think that the Department DFI were actually quite arrogant in dismissing the the courts and the fact that this was a further J.R. and they had been unsuccessful in the past and that they probably should have held back before doing the extensive work that they and preparatory work that they've done. Because I understand that there are essentially service roads have now been built in around the area. What if we are to follow from what the minister said in her response to questions earlier in the week, the vesting orders have been quashed as a consequence of the judgment, which should mean then obviously the land then goes back into the ownership of the land, the original landowner. That has an immediate effect on obviously sort of payment schemes and so on as well. So I suppose really from our perspective, we would need to find out from the Department whether or not any amendment to applications can be made in order to allow for land to be considered. Now, obviously, it may not be in a state that can be used for agricultural purposes. And that becomes another issue in relation to any compensation that may be required for them to get from DFI. But this is obviously hugely complex. But at the same time, I think there needs to be information sent immediately from DERA to those landowners who are affected for them to understand what the current circumstances are around future payments and what actions they need to take and within what time scale they need to do that. Yeah, that's the study from the minister and the judgment so far. And I think this is where the departments are going to have to absolutely collaborate. Because the uncertainty that has existed is now, it's magnified, I think. And so they need that further information. William? Yes, I think it's very unfair for the farmers. The land was vested. No compensation, no agreement on valuations, nothing. Weren't allowed to claim the land for a single basic farm payment this year. And now we're in the dilemma. The farmer has been wronged in this all. So I think we need clear guidance from the department of what they're going to do and the minister to... Because some farmers have lost sizable amounts of ground. So they couldn't claim that on their basic farm payment, even though they had got no compensation or not even a valuation. So I think we'll need some clear direction. I just wanted to let the clerk catch up here because there's a number of issues there. So initially I would agree that we were going to share the information that we got with the Committee for Infrastructure and the FU. And I imagine that one of the things that we're going to have to do from both perspectives here, because we need to see those improvements, we also need to see the restoration and fairness for farmers there, and a clear pathway. And that collaboration is going to need to happen between the two departments, which was so evidently missing previously. I think it's absolutely appalling that there wasn't collaboration, and it's not as though this hasn't been raised on numerous occasions within this Committee. At a very late stage, actually, because this has been going on for quite some time, as we all know. But even at a late stage, there wasn't those discussions. Clerk, could you give us just a wee recap just there of what has been suggested as further action? Yes, we alluded to, yes, we share the correspondence with the Committee for Infrastructure. And we also ask that they share the papers, etc., that they get from their briefing next week with us. Yeah. And then, presuming you wish to write to the Minister? Well, I suppose it's a point that Tom, William and Michelle made in regard to the full understanding and the departmental readout of the judgment, and what steps they're going to take to rectify the payments and the land on the restoration, if and so is required. Obviously, this is subject to the review of the full judgment by all concerned. This is the Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Committee. So, that will be, yes? Just finally, it's vital that the department contact those farmers who are affected and communicate with them very clearly as to what steps and actions they need to take. Yeah. And that was evidence in the session that we had from the farmer who came up in part of that representation to explain what that's been like. Okay. Mm-hmm. That's all right. Yeah, yeah, I have it. Okay, Member State. Yeah, and it's quite likely when this land goes back to the farmer that the farmer will not be allowed to claim it for single farm payment again until it's fully restored again. And that's the problem. That's where the difficulty lies. So, you know, there needs to be some discussion around that as to will there be some flexibility in allowing the farmer to claim the land even if it's not fully restored? Because that's going to take some time to do that. Yeah, it would occur to me that there's significant issues at hand outside the control of the farmer that has led to this. So, therefore, it would be probably forced to measure or something like that if it's applicable. Okay. Thank you, Members. Okay. Agenda Item 6, then, has been taken off the papers. That was to be the briefing from the Department on the Third Cycle River Basin Management Plan. So, it's been postponed. We're now moving on to Agenda Item 7. Which is the Department of Oral Evidence Session from the Forest Service on the Business Plan and Post-Storm Eoin Review. Members, I'm going to refer you to the briefing paper starting at page 102 of the park. Also, I'm going to refer you to a copy of the plan starting at page 106 of the park. I'm now going to welcome the following officials to the meeting and invite them to brief the committee. We have Mr John Joe O'Boyle, the Chief Executive of Forestry Service, and Mr John Joe Cassidy, Head of Forest Management and Inspection. So, gentlemen, thank you very much for your attendance. And if you would like to brief the committee, we appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And Chair, members of the committee, I thank you for the opportunity to present the Forest Service Business Plan 2526 and Post-Storm Eoin Review to the committee. Forest Service delivers forestry and plant health functions on behalf of the department and operates as an agency since 1 April 1998. So, we take on the role of delivering those functions that are in the business plan and clearing up of the storm loan issue there. In our plan, we have an income generating, you'll see that in the plan, we have an income generating potential and also we hold some reserves there based on our classification as a non-financial public corporation. And that is the basis on which we are able to take forward the plan that we have presented in the papers. We operate a multidisciplinary workforce, just less than 200 people from forestry, agriculture, industrial and administrative disciplines. So, that's just a wee bit on the background side. In terms of the business plan, just take the opportunity to provide an overview of the business plan for the forthcoming financial year. You'll have an opportunity to see from your briefing papers a bit more detail in the plan. So, I'll give a quick overview. The business plan was approved by the Minister on 16 June. It will deliver a programme of forestry and plant health activities which contribute to delivering the agency's key responsibilities, including creating forests and managing sustainable and resilient forests. In the course of the 25-26 plan, they will align with the Northern Ireland Executive Programme for Government. Our plan is doing what matters most and contribute to the year of corporate plan 25-27 and the dearest lead role in managing the climate change agenda. The performance targets that we have in the plan are carefully considered against how best the outcomes can be delivered against those priorities and also within the resources that we can assign to that. The plan has proposed 11 targets, six of which reflect key performance targets as it delivers directly against ministerial priorities. Targets in the plan contribute to the Northern Ireland Priority Climate Actions through creating new woodland and supporting future forestry grant schemes, as well as carrying out peatland restoration and assessing the potential for renewable energy generation within the forest estate. The agency, over the plan, the agency will continue to provide environmental, economic, social and health and wellbeing benefits, ensuring that the departments for us provide access to outdoor space, recreational activities for Northern Ireland citizens, and in addition to supplying commercial timber to the wood processing sector and supporting economic growth. The plan also contains targets relating to plant health activities. The implementation of effective plant health legislation and official controls as required under the Windsor Framework falls within the responsibility of the Secretary of State. That work and other work relating to protecting Northern Ireland's high plant health status and the environment remains at the core of Forest Service's work. The targets ensure that the official controls continue to be undertaken as well as completing draft legislation to consolidate a regulatory framework. I mentioned staff earlier a little bit. The targets also include additional work that we're taking on as an agency in order to strengthen our capability and capacity in order to take on new and emerging work coming our way from, as a result of, work around the climate change agenda and indeed things like the renewable energy, supporting the renewable energy issue as well. So we have a couple of targets in the plan that are specifically related to increasing our capacity and also making sure that we can bring on the correct level of professional and technical support that we need to deliver on plans for the future. I can pause there or I can move on and deal with the Storm Owen. If you want to crack on and take that as well please. That's fine. So I'll move on in a review of the Storm Owen. You're already aware that Friday the 24th, 25 there, Storm Owen caused significant damage to trees and forests across Northern Ireland. As a result of Storm Owen and recent storms, around 4,000 hectares of woodland not already scheduled for harvesting, but it now requires to be cleared and replanted as a result of that storm. Information on the extent of the storm damage was gathered initially and quickly using a whole combination of digital satellite data, aerial surveys, on the ground inspection by Forest Service staff and indeed in the immediate aftermath of the storm, we also received very helpful and useful information and details from members of the public councils, neighbouring landowners, government agencies and other public bodies in order to give us a scale of the damage that we were dealing with. Forest Service staff and the contractors work with both DFI roads and NIE in clearing trees from the public road network and utility infrastructure and prioritised clearances to residences, to people's property, business premises, etc. and then commenced restoring public access to woodlands, all in the very immediate aftermath of the storm. Initially the works involved minimum clearances to access roads and premises to facilitate NIE's work, for example, to restore the electricity networks, but then of course follow-up operations were needed to provide more substantial clearances that were required for the longer term. So that work, we were going back on that. Forest Service has been continually engaged in this follow-up work since the storm, right until the present and it remains ongoing. We also focused on clear access and public access to forest recreation areas, which was incrementally restored during the February and March, with access and availability to all forests by early April. The work was completed in conjunction with the local councils, some of whom manage facilities in our forests and are in some cases the lead recreational provider for services from forests. Some recreational provisions still remain partially closed due to extensive storm damage on trees and public safety concerns, including certain sections of trails in Dava, North Trevor, Castle Wellen and Gorchon. However, most of the trails, most of the access to the forest and to all forests is available to people, but not in every corner of the forest at this stage. Forest Service had deployed and still has a full direct harvesting resource to the tree clearance work. Timber customers, contractors who work for the timber customers and contractors who work to the forest service, and other specialist contractors are all involved in clearing the tree clearance works prioritised in the public interests. All forest service management plans have also had to be reviewed to accommodate both the harvesting, the bringing forward and harvesting of trees that weren't scheduled for sale at this time. So the plans have to change to bring that all forward and also to defer and park the previously scheduled sales of timber and harvesting operations. So all of that review has all been going on right from that time and is still going on at this stage. And of course the plans are required and the operations are required to continue to meet the UK forestry standards as we make the adjustments in relation to the storm damage. So significant harvesting operations, some people will be already aware in the local areas, that have already been undertaken and remain ongoing in the very worst affected areas. And these include forests that you will be familiar with, and Bally Sal and Mount Stewart, Gostford Forest, Dromanna Forest, Favour Royal Forest, East Fermanagh, Loch Navaire Forest, Gordnamoia, Caisse, Springvale and Grange Park. And that's, there's damage in many forests. These are ones that are significantly, significantly affected. The re-establishment of the woodlands following the storm and the tree clearance operations will follow along behind the clearance. And there are opportunities in there, it's not all doom and gloom, there are a lot of opportunities in there to regenerate the forests that have been blown down with perhaps a greater diversity of tree species than there originally was there, including native trees. There's also opportunities to regenerate some of those areas through natural regeneration as well. And where appropriate then, supplementary planting to fill in areas that don't actually regenerate with native species for an example. So there's opportunities in there. It's brought forward the opportunity to change, in effect, the landscape around the forests that have been blown down. And that's all part of the planning point that I made just previously there. And it's also consistent with the longer term objectives and providing opportunities to increase that diversity of species. The forest resilience across the departments of state, increasing the range of species, increasing the diversity of these species across our forests, is a key issue in terms of the adaption to forthcoming climate change issues and the resilience to tree diseases that may find themselves more easily to establish in a different climate change situation. So the more diversity of forests that we have and the more diversity of those species, the better we are prepared for those kind of events. So back to the clearance of the areas adjacent to utility infrastructure, will be re-established in line with best practice, which include provision for increasing setback distances of conifer crops and opportunities to introduce smaller stature broadleaf trees to mitigate against risks of future outage due to trees being blown down in the storm. So really what I'm saying there is that where we've had to clear trees and are clearing trees close to power lines, we can re-establish the trees in and around that with different types of trees that don't grow as high and are more resilient to perhaps storm damage in the future. We administer woodland grant schemes which provide grants aid for replanting woodlands following felling as well, including those that need to be cleared due to storm damage. So there is a grant support for private woodlands that have been affected by storm damage there. The impact of the storm damage across the forest estate has understandably attracted a very high level of public and media interest. The minister of the minister has visited Mount Stewart, the Cumanagh Forest and indeed other forests as part of other visits. To look at the scale of the damage and appreciate the scale of the damage and the nature of the clearance works involved going forward. In addition to that the departmental board members visited Fermanagh a number of weeks ago, four or five weeks ago as part of the board meeting and undertook a visit to Favour Royal Forest to see damage and clearance operations ongoing there. That is me as far as a presentation of the business plan and storm loan chair. Thank you. I am happy to take any questions. I have been looking forward to meeting you Jonzo because when I took the hand over from the last chair and then had different briefings from people your name came up a number of times. So I was looking forward to meeting you. I was told that it would be, I have not, my apologies if I have not reached in. Oh, natural. So it is an area that I am very interested in. I have tabled a number of questions over a period of time there, probably from before Stormy Owen, just trying to monitor, not the department's ambition for planting trees because I think the ambition is fine, but the rate at which planting is actually happening and to see if the rate of planting matches the prescribed ambition. I have received some answers and it looks okay but I am not so sure that the rate of planting is matching the ambition. Given the scale of the destruction that was caused by the storm, have those figures for planting been adjusted to take into consideration the restoration of the damage and not minus it off the previous departmental ambition that existed? Okay, there is a couple of points in there. So if we take the ambitions to plant more trees, to have more woodlands in Northern Ireland for an example, that is very much about planting new land, you know, planting land that is not already in woodland. And those ambitions, those targets that we have set in the plan at 600 hectares for this year, we had a target of 600 hectares last year which we did not quite meet, so we fell short of that last year. We have a similar target this year. Those targets are actually set in line with the draft climate action plan at this point in time. But also, you know, looking forward, your point about possibly longer term objectives, looking forward, it is clear that the rate of planting that we are currently achieving, even at 600 hectares, is set to increase much higher than that in subsequent climate action plan budget periods. So, two targets that we have in our business plan this year. One is about doing the necessary work to strive to achieve the 600 hectares in the plan. And a second target in there, which is about preparing for a further increase then in future years to come. In relation to the storm damage trees, the figures about the number of trees we plant, etc., don't actually include, you know, they don't actually include the replanting of areas that are felled because that's about managing a sustainable forest. So, where trees are removed from the forest, they are going to be replanted there. You know, it almost goes without saying, if they are going to be managed sustainably, they are going to be managed sustainably. So, they will be in addition to anything we plant in the forest that's been damaged, will be in addition to the new woodland that we are trying to create. So, it is a separate measurement. It is not used in the carbon target? It is not, no, because they are actually replacing trees that were already there. So, it is a fiscal one over here, and over here is the carbon budget. So, the gap then, just for clarity, missing the target last year will be added on to future targets to ensure that we get to that point? It is not just… We still aim to get to a certain point by 2030. Yeah. So, you know, the shortfall in last year will have to be picked up between now and 2030. Okay. Thank you. I told you that the Forest Service recently conducted a wind energy market engagement exercise to assess the commercial appetite for the development of renewables and forest service land. Can you tell us what the next steps are and what the timeline might look like in terms of achieving something like that for renewable development on forest service land? Yeah. We have received useful information back from the market engagement exercise, and that is analysing that at the minute. It points to certain forests that perhaps are, I suppose, more likely to be sites that can be developed for renewable energy when you take into account all the wider things like where the good connections are, things like that there. So, some forests are more likely than others in that regard and more likely in a different timescale than others potentially. So, that is the sort of information we have got back from the market engagement exercise that we ran. The step that is ongoing at the minute is that we are analysing that against our sustainable forestry management obligations. We obviously have to make sure that the forest remains sustainably managed. So, we are analysing that information that we received back from the engagement exercise against the sustainable management issue. And, as soon as we get that completed, then, I suppose, the next steps beyond that are then looking towards business case issues in terms of, I suppose, the difference between removing some trees to accommodate wind turbines in forest. So, that is a business case issue. So, that is a business case issue. And, that will inform, then, a go-to-market, you know, a formal go-to-market for the, to the wind energy when we have that analysis completed. So, in terms of a timeframe for that, we have a target in our business plan this year that we expect to be, by the 31st of March, we expect to be at a position where we are able to have the analysis done and able to commence a open market procurement at that time. And, just a final one on that, then, that is an internal analysis, that is an internal departmental analysis on that report, I imagine. And then, have you got the resource to do that? Would you be confident? Yeah, well, we do. I mean, it is done within our current, you know, our forestry planning teams. You know, so, it is just, it is a forestry technical type analysis that needs done in terms of what age are the trees, what, you know, if we take those out, which trees do we need to leave back in lieu of that to continue to make it. Our obligations under the Forestry Act is to continue to manage the forest sustainably. So, that's, that comes, that comes with developing the forest for renewable energy. Okay. So, we have both those things to, to, to merge. Okay. Listen, I, I just got to take one more question and then I'm going to move out to other members. So, the committee visited peat bogs near Roma on the 12th of June, which is only a couple of weeks ago, and we were accompanied by staff from Ulster Wildlife Trust, and we heard that to restore peatland trees often need to be removed in order for the land to become wet again. Could you outline any work that you guys have undertaken with Ulster Wildlife Trust in this regard? And I note in your papers there is a section on wetlands as well, and it was, from my perspective, it was very interesting. I mean, it was just that realisation of, we know that trees have a role to play, but also our bogs and wetlands have a significant role to play, and like the juxtaposition of cutting trees down to achieve this was, was, was an interesting concept. Yeah. We, we do a lot of our work with, with other partners. Wildland Trust is one, is, is, is one of the partners, and obviously with very, very similar objectives in relation to peatland restoration works. It's both similar to councils in relation to providing recreation. So we do a lot of work in, in, in that kind of partnership. And yes, we have, again, we have targets here to, to, to restore peatland areas, 400 hectares in our, in our, in our, in our targets this year here. And, and again, we, some of those, yes, are trees, trees that are crops that are being felled from, and not going to be planted again. But of course there's additional work that can be done there, like, perhaps stump removal or stump burying and, and wetting the forest up again, because, in terms of creating the conditions for, for peatland restoration, we, we need to wet the site more than it would be currently in a, in a forest form. So that, those works are, are follow-on works and they take, I suppose they take a sequence, you know, they harvest the trees first, and, and then do the ground preparation work, and the blocking of the drains and other things thereafter in, in those areas. Some areas, some areas of peatland, we, in, in the Forest Service Estate are not actually planted with trees, and there will be restoration works going on there as well, including removal of, uh, invasive species that, that over time would actually, uh, I suppose, extend right across the, the peatland area, and, uh, and render it no longer, uh, no longer, uh, We could see, we could see that up in the bog that we were on, you could see, because there's, there's a forest across from it, which is Forest Service, I believe, and you could see that, the, all the little saplings and, yeah, just naturally. Yeah, they, they, they, they will seed, uh, trees will seed out onto, uh, in a natural way, and it is important to remove those trees. And, when, uh, you, you asked about capacity and a different question there, but, uh, you know, when, when we have, uh, not as many of them to remove, uh, that's the time to do it, as opposed to when you've actually got a, uh, an undesirable, perhaps, woodland started there, you know, so we do it early, uh, try to do it early. And so we have, uh, a significant part of the work that's in this plan this year will include removal of those, uh, uh, and naturally regenerated trees out on, on, uh, let's say, open peatland bogs, as opposed to, uh, ones that already have a planted forest on it. But we are also, we're also taking forward work on the planted forest as well. Thank you, John. Um, Jacqueline? Thank you very much. And thanks for the presentation. Um, uh, you mentioned, uh, John Joe there, that the, um, the forest service has did a market engagement exercise, and you are looking at an open market procurement in March 2026. When do you think it would be likely that the first renewables would become operational on forest service land? Yeah, I suppose that's a little bit out of my, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm not a wind energy developer. I suppose I'm, I'm, I'm a land owner from that point of view, but I'm, I'm, I have got insights to those things because it's part of our, the program. But, but there is, you know, the, the, and again, that's some of the information that we've got from the market engagement, uh, side, which does guide us on that. Uh, you know, they, they have given us indications of, for an example, uh, lead in times around doing things like the bird surveys that are necessary, the environmental impact assessments, and then the, the procurement of the equipment and the, and the installation. So there is a timeframe, uh, there's a lead in time to getting the, to getting some of those. In some areas, the lead in times would be longer than others, uh, because of work perhaps already done. It may be, uh, it may be, uh, that there's already, for argument's sake, uh, hypothetically, uh, a bird survey or bird information, uh, if it's close enough or adjacent to existing wind farms, things like that there. And, and that might shorten the timeframes for some of those things. So it's those, those, those kinds of things that we are now, uh, including in our analysis of, of, of, of which sites, uh, are, I suppose, the quicker winds, I suppose, is, is, is, is, is, is the way to put it. And, and, and which sites are still, still, we still want to pursue, but it might take a, a, a longer timeframe. I can't give you a, a clear number of years on that, but, uh, starting from scratch, there's, there's, there's, I know that there's a two year, uh, study required on birds. It's certainly before, you know, as a starting point to inform the environmental impact assessment. And then of course, uh, the, the, the, the proposals need to go through planning, planning, uh, they have to go through the planning process, uh, before there would be any, uh, sort of construction going on there. But the procurement that, that we're talking about here, just to be clear on the, uh, on the business plan here is very much about opening that door to the wind energy, energy developers, to know that, uh, you know, that if they take these steps through the, through these processes, that, that they have a site on offer to them, as opposed to, you know, so it's, it, they need to know they have a site on offer to them. And that's what they, that's what they, the launch of a procurement exercise is in March year. But some, a lot of the lead in work will happen after that. Yeah. And forest service, I understand has long term reasons with NI water for some of their lands, which themselves could also be suitable for renewables. Have you been engaging with NI water in terms of, um, you know, sussing that out or assessing that there, potential to move forward? Yeah, well, the market engagement exercise included those forests as well. Uh, so NI water work, we're quite content for ourselves to take that information from the, so where, where wind developers, wind energy developers have, uh, pointed to forests that are in the ownership of, uh, or, sorry, in the ownership of NI water. But trees managed by ourselves on those sites, then, uh, those are still candidates for, uh, an open market exercise. But we will have to develop arrangements between ourselves on NI water, uh, uh, in parallel to that. Have you been engaging with NI water? We have been, we have indeed, yeah. Yeah. And, sorry, Jared, the one last thing I want to mention is, your, your KPT and your plan, KPT 1, is to, uh, increase to 600 hectares, uh, increasing wood land per year. And the current average is 425 hectares. Um, and just thinking the, in terms of the farmers, I know the farming with nature scheme is currently open. Um, but it's, the, the small woodland grant scheme isn't open for applications. Uh, you know, would it not be, would it be prudent to have the small woodland grant scheme open, uh, for farmers till, and landowners to work, to try and help meet this target? Yeah, absolutely. No, absolutely. And, uh, it'll be the, uh, it'll be certainly the plan. Part of the plan will be that the small woodland grant scheme will open ahead of the planting season, uh, in the next, the planting season coming up in the autumn year. The planting season tends to be from, sort of, December through to February and March. So the small woodland grant scheme will open in time for that plan. So it will open for 20 seconds. It will open. Thank you very much. Thank you, Chair. Thank you, Dachlan. Um, Michelle. Um, thank you, um, thank you very much for your presentation. Um, some of the questions have been answered in respect of the renewables piece of work that's been carried out. But I do understand that the, that the market engagement exercise was carried out in 2009 and 2016. So I'm curious as to what the barriers are in order to progress this. Are they policy barriers? Are they legislative barriers? And how can those be overcome in order to move this on? Because clearly there's a, a massive revenue opportunity for the executive, um, with regards to, um, using these sites. Sure. Uh, I suppose the, the things have, you know, things have changed between the different, uh, exercise that were, that were done, uh, previously. You know, we now have, uh, an energy strategy in, uh, here that we didn't, we wouldn't have had back in, in, in 16, for an example. So the, in effect, what we're, I suppose the, the strategic context now for developing the sites are, it's different now. And I'm, I'm very much, I'm, I'm very, very supportive of, uh, creating the renewable energy. Indeed the cap as well is the other thing that, uh, is, uh, the, that has, uh, uh, brought, uh, very much to, to lay focus as well. Uh, and, uh, not, not least because of the, uh, the, uh, electricity, the renewable electricity targets of 80% renewables by 2030 as well. So it is very much brought up to the fores. So things have moved on, uh, in, in, in sort of policy terms, uh, that has, uh, uh, changed the emphasis, uh, than, than would have been the case back, back in 2014 and the earlier, the earlier, the earlier look, look, look, see options that we, we looked at at that time. Will there, will there be a requirement for legislation around any aspects of this? The, the, uh, the Forestry Act 2010, when we, when we, when the, when this department took through the Forestry Act 2010, uh, we created a provision in there, uh, for the forests to be used for other than land, for other than forestry purposes, which gives us the basis for creating the, so we don't need legislation to put, uh, wind farms on forests, but we do need to make sure that we're going to be able to make sure that we're going to be able to make sure that we're going to be able to do that. And that was a point I was making to the Chair, uh, in relation to his question. We do need to make sure that in doing so, we give due regard to the primary duty, which is managing sustainable forests. And that's where the analysis and that's where the, the merging of those two, uh, policy objectives, uh, comes together. And is it too early to think about what, um, that development will look like as to whether that is taken forward internally or whether it's taken in partnership with renewable energy? Yeah. You know, I suppose really it's a bit, it is, it is a bit early. I did refer earlier there that, you know, there's business case work to do on that. So there'll be, there'll be a business case to be prepared looking at, you know, the very sort of scenarios you, you present. Do we do it directly? Do we do it in partnership? Uh, and the business case will look, will look up, I suppose, uh, relative costs around that relative revenue returns around that, and I suppose, risk and reward, uh, around that. So the business case will, the business case process to determine which way, uh, Northern Ireland government, uh, land is, is, is going to be used for, for that. Okay. And just finally, um, Chair, if you don't mind, just in regards to, um, to the storm and obviously the devastation within Mount Stewart, which is within my own constituency, and it'd be remiss of me not to, to mention that. Can I just ask specifically in relation to Mount Stewart, um, how work is progressing? Yeah. And Joe, do you want to maybe pick that one up? Yeah, work, work is progressing, uh, progressing fairly well. The felling of the trees has been completed. We're now extracting the produce. Um, we have two of the main areas cleared. Um, at this point, um, I would expect probably another five to six weeks that the vast majority of the timber extraction will be there. Then it'll be hollage after that. Um, so hopefully by the end of the summer, the, the, the, the, most of the produce will have been gone from the estate. And then just in relation then to, um, replanting into one, when will that commence? We're, we're, we're currently liaising with, and I'm having discussions with the National Trust in relation to, to the future use of, of Mount Stewart. Um, that, it will be replanted. Um, the plans will be predominantly a broadleafed type. Woodland, you know, um, that's directly traveled where, where, where we're at with Mount Stewart. Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you, Michelle. Uh, Patsy. Yep. Thanks very much. And apologies for being delayed slightly there. Um, two or three wee questions. Um, I'm looking here at target one to create 600 hectares of new woodland by the 31st of March, 2026. Um, how do you incentivize people by grant date? If the grant date target date is the same date as that, which your target for 600 hectares of new woodland is? I suppose, uh, yeah. Thanks for the question, Patsy. I suppose, uh, uh, uh, apologies if, if, if, if, if, if it could have been even clearer. Um, I suppose the bring forward proposals are for, are for a later period, you know, they're for the next period beyond that. Uh, the proposals aren't for this, this, for this plan. So the proposals are, the proposals are there for this. As I'm reading it, it says create 600 hectares of new woodland by, that's just 31st of March, 2026. That's correct. And then the grant date period, the target for it's just 31st of March, 2026 as well. Um, I'm just trying to square that in my head, how that could happen. Right. But the, the, the bring forward proposal ones, uh, is, is proposals of how the, how the forestry grant schemes are going to be, uh, how the support through the forestry grant schemes are going to be in place for 26 to 32. You know, it's for that later period. But if your target is create 600 hectares new woodland by 31st of March. Yes. And you're trying to incentivize people. Yes. How do you do that if the grant date isn't in place? Grant date will be, is in place. This is existing grant date. And then, and then what we're looking at and target to is different grant date for a long, for a later period. No, why, why I'm asking all this is none of your, your grant. I'm just, this is why I'm here. So, um, uh, I hope I'm not fuzzy on it, but I don't think so. No, no, no. The, um, a number of people that, that I know, um, that have been, have planted trees previously. Yeah. And some of them, unfortunately planted ash. Yeah. And the whole thing has just been a disaster. They've told me that they're not going to go for anything again. Right. So, my point is on that. Will the grant scheme that's likely to come forward be sufficiently incentivized to encourage people to plant more trees? Or is it just going to be more of the same? No, no, that, it, it, it, it'll be more of the same for the 600 hectares this year. But it, but, but, but the proposals that go to the minister will be to look at how we can better incentivize that. Yes, that's what I'm talking about. No, that's exactly right. That's it. Oh, no, that's grant. That's okay. No, no, it's not. The next one is then, um, to supply at least 400,000 cubic metres of timber from sustainably managed deer-a-forest to customers. Right? Now, and there's dates and all associated with that, but I'm not, it's not the dates that I'm concerned about. Um, you have a pile of timber laying there as a result of the storm. And what was it? 4,000 hectares. Yeah. Right. Um, so, this is maybe a, a bit of a different way of doing things than civil service would be. If you have a pile of timber laying there that you need to get rid of, it's laying in the forest. Is there not some sort of maybe a commercial aspect of this where you could say, not all of this timber will be good timber, like some of it will be, but the trees that were taken down were, in many instances, good trees. Right? And you'll know that, you're, you're more, especially as nationality than me. Is there not some sort of a commercial scheme you could say, well, right, go to somebody that uses this, this timber for sustainable, good reasons, whatever those are, and say to them, look, save us money from having to get contractors in to tidy up the place, and then try and sell it. You guys enter into a contract where they sell it. And it's win-win. So, has there ever been any thinking around that to do it? Yeah, well, I suppose, I suppose the, fundamentally behind that, the 4,000 tonnes of timber that will be being supplied this year, in the course of this business plan, will largely be timber from those clearance operations. So, it will be coming from those clearance operations. We won't be felling 400,000 tonnes of timber that is still standing in the forest. Sorry, but I was just doing some calculations there on that. That 400,000 cubic metres, well, if you're, if you're sitting with four, 4,000 hectares of trees down, you guys can do the calculations a lot better than me. And among that, probably about a third of a success rate of good, good quality timber should come out of that. About a third. That's my calculation, anyway. So, in order, I'm just saying, is there a better way of doing this, rather than yourselves having to employ contractors to come in, tidy the place up, or indeed your own people, spend a lot of money on that, whereas, where that resource could not be spent elsewhere, actively planting trees. And, if, all I'm talking about is making the best of the commercial sector, the best of the public sector, come up with a deal, and it's a win-win. Well, no, it's a valid question, so it is, absolutely. And, I suppose, just to, just to, the starting point being that the timber that we will supply this year will be timber that's already blown down. And, as you rightly say, a lot of that timber is all good timber. Right. So, it'll be going to the normal timber processing facilities for processing through sawmills and all the rest. It'll be their contractors that'll likely come in and harvest that, that'll not be our work that'll do that. So, I can't figure off the top of my head, probably 85% of that will be harvested by the timber customers' capacity. Sorry, if you could just ask John-Joe, do you have to pay, do you have to pay them currently to do that, or is there a commercial aspect of this whereby they get the timber, they do the work, and it's not pro bono, but some sort of a commercial? Oh, there's already contracts in place where, where they, they, they bid for the price of the timber, which includes them, which includes them actually harvesting it from the forest. So, we're not paying, we're not paying the timber contractors to harvest this. Right, so you get rid of it. We get rid of it. It, it, obviously, if we were doing all the harvesting, we couldn't do that. No. So, we need, we need their capacity, we need to bring forward that sector capacity. And that's what I'm saying is there's a commercial benefit to the department and that. Oh, yes, there is absolutely. Right. That's grand. It's good to hear that. Just maybe if you could direct some of them in the direction of Dava and Drum Manor. It would be very helpful. I had a conversation with a few people about that just yesterday and they were complaining about trees being down all over the place. Yeah. The final thing is, Chair, with your forbearance again, this is sort of where this all came from. The storm did highlight, as you know, for those of us that live in rural areas, many of the breakdowns were because, breakdown in the peruse place, because trees fell down. From the point of view of the department, in future tree planting schemes that you would have, can you write in a pervasal there to ensure that tree planting, well, there's all this going on in the Nutrients Action Programme but in a different vein, that tree planting does not take place within, say, a buffer zone of, say, 10 metres of power lanes, because that's the contributory factor of a lot of our power going off in rural areas was not, of course, in all forestry areas, but the contributory factor was trees falling down on lanes, not only just with the per, but also with internet and all that. Yeah, well, I mean, a couple of aspects to that question as well, and valid stuff. I suppose what we're seeing and what we're dealing with is what was in place, you know, the forest the way they were with the lines already in there, etc. In terms of new planting of areas, we already will keep back a buffer zone, you know, from that. And I was just mentioning earlier there, maybe in relation to the sort of the broader presentation, we've got opportunities in here now to, let's say, along power lines to not plant faster growing, taller trees, closer to, we have an option to plant, let's say, smaller, lower trees, and perhaps native woodlands, such as birch and other things like that, that won't grow high enough to even interface with power lines. So there's an opportunity to create the buffer zone, and then the trees that are closest to the tree, to the power lines, then can be a different kind of, it can actually tail off to a very low canopy type scenario. And that's part of what we build into our forest management plans here. In relation to the woodlands that are created in, and your question wasn't properly related to this, but in relation to woodlands that are created in the private sector, on private sector land, part of the grant schemes will require the landowner who proposes to put the grant in there to have the permission from the utility provider or the electricity supplier to make sure that they're content with how close the trees are going to that. So our grant schemes already regulate that on the ones that are being put in the private sector. You mentioned that there was an existing buffer zone. What is it at the minute we're just getting nosy at this point? Aye, well, it depends on the category of the line. It changes, you know, it depends on the category of the line. The most extreme is, it's largely designed to, the most extreme one is the 110 kV lines. The 110 kV lines. And that is, say, 20 metres either side of the cables. The lesser lines have a lesser distance, but then they're all under a way-leave agreement with the supplier. So the way-leave agreement allows the electricity companies to prune back to the trees. I know. At our risk as well. They seem to be. Well, we found out that that wasn't adequate. Well, I think the experience is clearly that. And I think that that's very much a reflection on, I suppose, the severity of the storm as well, you know, in this particular case. But going forward, I mean, your point of it going forward is that we do have, in terms of the planting on our own estate or the replanting on our own estate, we do have that option. And we do have that within our plans to create the buffers and to create the, not only the buffers, but create a different kind of edge to the forest at the power lines. Both from a stability point of view, as well as stability of the forest point of view as well. So you don't have a tall, stark edge. You know, you've got a tailed off edge and that helps in terms of the wind flows. In on, John Joe, thanks very much. Thank you. That's it. And William. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, you're very welcome. A wee bit of the coals from a bit hoarse. All right. In relation to the damage in the 4,000 hectares has to be cleared and replaced, replanted. I do see at Gosford Forest Park, for instance, a big area of this forest is unscathed, but there's a larger area at the back, totally flattened. Is there a difference? Is the lessons to be learned about the type of tree that is more able to stand wind? It's strange that there's one big area, and I'm sure you know all about this, but it's totally flattened where the rest of the forest seems okay. Yeah. And, you know, that's what we see across. There's an awful lot of factors come in there, William. And that is, you know, depends on the height of the trees. If they're, you know, trees, if they're 30 years old, they may well be able to withstand a certain degree of storm. But if they're, let's say, 40 years old, they might not, because they're taller and they create more, they catch more wind and things like that there. So there's a whole lot of factors that come into that. Also, even things like, well, it's the soil type as well, you know, how well they can be rooted in the soil. And also other things then in terms of even weather. Although, you know, if you've got, you know, a heavy, wet winter, for an example, then the soil is more sodden. And any movement in the trees then will be exaggerated and will be, it'll be less resistance to the trees blowing over. The larger, the larger area is flattened in Gosford. It's actually to the back of the forest and you would have thought it would have been more sheltered. Aye. It still is flattened. Yeah. Have you, have you got a timeframe for the, for the clearing and the replacement? Of Gosford? Yeah. Aye. Gosford, they're actually, um, similar to Mount Stewart. The work's ongoing. Um, slightly bigger scale than Mount Stewart. We, in Gosford, there's probably 20, 25% of the area has, will require clearance. Yeah. Of one degree or, or a major degree. Um, we expect again, time scales in that. The end of the summer, we should be fairly well through it because, um, progress has been good there. And we got, we, we, we, we were, started clearing in Gosford probably the week after the storm. Yeah. So we, we've got out, we've, Gosford was an area, an area where we got in fairly early, but I would expect end of the summer, September time, and then we'll be starting the regeneration of the area, um, replanting. Will there be an issue attaining all the trees necessary, 4,000 hectares or a lot of trees? There, there'll not be, um, 4,000 hectares will not be replanted in the one year. So it's, it'll be over a rolling period of time. We have contracts in place for tree supply. Um, so the supply of the trees shouldn't be an issue. What may be an issue is the diversity that we may be looking at, because the plans have been brought forward because of the, the one damage. So we may be looking for certain types of trees that aren't maybe available just, just yet. Um, and the quantities that we require. In relation to, in relation to the forestry grant scheme, I have had several people in with me in my office this last six weeks, planted trees 18, 20 years ago, full of ice day back. We're told that they have a cash grant now, they're practically down. Is there any chance of any compensation or help for those people? The, uh, where the ash trees have to be cleared out, uh, you know, and replanted again, there is a reestablishment grant there, uh, available, uh, to reestablish the, the woodlands. Um, I suppose where, where there are ash trees in a woodland along with other tree species, uh, it might, even though the ash trees have failed, it, it, it may well still not be the right thing to do to clear the, the rest of the woodland out, uh, and replant it. So, uh, it, it, it depends, I suppose, on the density of the ash trees or diseased trees within the woodland what the right solution is. But certainly, at the, at the extreme where the ash trees have to be removed, uh, then there is, uh, there is a, a reestablishment grant available. Is there, is there anyone to give them advice? These people seem to be a bit of loose end. They don't know what to do. I, well, uh, I mean, the forestry, the, the, we have, we have a forestry grants, a grant scheme, uh, a forestry grant, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, a reestablishment, uh, what are you called? Uh, account, uh, email account. We have, uh, so they could, they could email the forestry grant team at, uh, at, uh, uh, I think that some of them have done that, but they didn't get much satisfaction, I think. I don't know. Uh, well, they happy to, I'll say this, the targets are 600 hectares, this next to 2027. Uh, do you reckon, do you reckon most of that will be in public land or private land? In 20, the, the, the, well. 600 hectares. It'll be, it'll be, I would imagine most of it will be in public land, or sorry, on private land, but I, but it doesn't mean to say that, that we, the forest service aren't looking actively at, at acquiring land as well. You know, where it's important for ourselves to perhaps acquire a piece of land that, uh, perhaps joins up to forests, you know, creates a, brings a continuity in for, for, uh, wildlife reasons, for access reasons, for all of those sort of reasons. So we will, we will be still looking to acquire land that is strategically, uh, valuable to, to acquire, uh, ourselves up to our state, to forest service estate, uh, and, uh, then the, the, I suppose the combination of that, and the, and the private land, uh, we, uh, we, uh, will be relying on considerable amount of, uh, applications from private landowners for the plantings. We will. And Joe, I don't want to sound too negative, but, uh, my experience from these people, there were a lot of people that have been in the scheme in the past, and that have a, land values, as you know, in Northern Ireland, even for renting, has increased dramatically these last three or four years. So any new scheme needs to be very attractive to get people to participate. Yeah, we are aware of that. And, I mean, uh, against, uh, against, uh, the other questions here, we were, you know, the incentive schemes that we have going forward needs to be at least able to compete with that. Uh, we understand that. Yeah. That'll be part of, that'll be part of the thing. I think you, you know, you have a big task to reach those targets of you to expect them to be done on private land. They are challenging. Yeah. They are challenging. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. You're with it. Okay. Uh, members, thank you very much. Uh, Thomas. Sorry, Thomas. You didn't get my eye. Okay. Uh, you talk about the 600 hectares that you're looking planted. And yet, if you look at the, uh, the forestry ground where renewables are planned for, and I look at my own constituency, Western Rhone, and from recollection, there's maybe five areas there that have been earmarked that may be suitable for this type of renewables. And then there's going to have to be quite a substantial removal of forestry trees, is there, for that, uh, to allow for a development such as that to go forward. Is any concern about that with regards to maybe in areas where trees haven't reached their full growth potential, and therefore they're going to be taken out at a, you know, a much younger stage, a lot lower down, uh, and, um, has that any implications? There are some implications there, absolutely. Uh, and, uh, that's where part of that analysis that I spoke about earlier, you know, what is the impact on the sustainable forestry management side that we, that we, that we, that our, I suppose our obligations are to, to make sure that we manage the forest state sustainably. I suppose the, the, the, the one thing I would say is that, uh, with the technology that has now happened in, in the development of wind turbines and they, they can be, uh, uh, a less number of turbines in a, in a woodland with higher, with higher generating capacity. So the number of trees that you would perhaps need to take away now, uh, as opposed to five or 10 years ago would be a lot less because you would need a lot less turbines in the forest, but they would be generating more electricity. So that's a technology, a technological development within the, the sort of the wind energy sector. And as I say, I'm not professed to be an expert in that area, but I do know that that, that, that is the case. Uh, and I suppose the other thing is then, uh, we, we, we, we're not, we're not considering, you know, the removal of a forest area to change it to putting wind turbines in there. It's about integrating wind turbines within, let's say, open spaces that are already in the forest and, and, and, and using existing perhaps, uh, road infrastructure. Yes, it might have to be strengthened a bit or something like that there. So, I think that's a, so it, it, it will be aimed at certainly minimizing any, any amount of tree removal and there's a scope to minimize it, uh, quite, quite, quite a lot. Uh, and more scope now in today's world than there would have been, uh, you know, let's say five or 10 years ago. Well, uh, I'm, I'm fairly much in favor of it because it's putting it into an area where, uh, the trees and the, and the turbines are going to sort of help to integrate them a bit rather than have them sitting on top of a mountain. And so, uh, it was just with regards to the clearance of the trees and that type of stuff. Okay. That's right. Okay. The other benefit, sorry, just the other benefit of, of having them in the forest area is, is, is also the fact that, you know, the forest, it tends to be a little bit more removed from other people's properties and houses and, you know, it's a bit more remote. So that's another benefit. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Thomas. Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you very much for your presentation. I'm sure we'll be in touch. Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. Okay. Members. Very welcome. I'm going to track on here. Um, cause we have a, uh, a tight enough agenda. Agenda item eight is the departmental oral evidence session on farm sustainability payments, FSP. Members, I refer you to the briefing paper starting on page one, two, two of your pack, providing details of the FSP, which forms part of the sustainable agriculture program. I'm going to replace the current farm sustainability transition payment, as you will know, FSP. Um, so the going to welcome the following officials to meeting and then ask them to brief the committee. That is Mr. George Moffat, who is the acting director of agriculture policy division. And we have Ms. Lorna, Ms. Lorna Christie, head of branch farm sustainability development policy branch. And Mr. Aidan McEvoy, head of branch controls and assurance development. Just, uh, make yourselves comfortable. Thank you. No problem at all. Thank you for 10. Uh, just, uh, to let members know, uh, just for a very short period of time there, we lost connectivity. Oh, nine there. Just, um, hopefully it's sorted and we're back up and going. Chair Broadcasting has come back to say that they haven't seen any problems. All right. Looking back at me just be where someone was watching. Okay. So there was a report of an outage, but, um, Broadcasting have said that they can't, there was any problems. So they're looking into it. Looking into it. All right. Because we do have viewers every week, just so you know, so you just behave yourselves. Um, okay. Um, thank you very much. We do have your briefing paper in the patch, but we would encourage you to give us a highlight of the brief. No, that's okay. Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you and good morning everyone. Um, and thank you chairman for the opportunity to present our policy proposals for the farm sustainability payment. As you mentioned earlier in your introductions, I'm joined by Lorna Christie, Head of Farm Sustainability and Development Policy Branch, and Nathan McEvoy, Head of Controls and Assurance Development Branch. You have your briefing paper and you know from that that the farm sustainability payment is a key element of the sustainable agriculture program. Uh, and you've previously received briefing on FSP as part of the farm sustainability transitional provisions regulations earlier this year. Um, by way of signalling a move to the new FSP, the farm sustainability transition payment was introduced in 2025 this year, and signalling a move away from basic payment. Um, FSP will provide a resilience payment and will act as a balance between providing a safety net which will help a farm business with stanced shocks that are beyond its ability to manage effectively, and encouraging farm businesses to become more environmentally sustainable, efficient and resilient, and is expected to attract approximately 22,000 applications per year. Um, FSP will operate in a similar manner to the basic payment scheme. Um, for example, to claim FSP when it opens in 2026, a farm business will be required to submit an eligible application form by the closure window and activate three entitlements on three hectares of eligible land, or at least three entitlements on at least three hectares of eligible land. Uh, along with the introduction of the farm sustainability payment, there are a number of elements being included within it. Uh, those are the implementation of the historic years exercise, introduction of progressive capping, new land eligibility rules, uh, farm sustainability standards to replace cross compliance, and the introduction of conditionalities. And again, you have details on each of those in your written briefing. Um, but just to give you a short overview of each one. The historic years exercise aims to help ensure that FSP is directed towards those farm businesses undertaking agricultural activity. Uh, the exercise requires farm businesses in operation prior to 1 January 22 to have undertaken at least one of the defined list of activities that are included in the legislation during the period 2020 and or 2021. And legislative cover to implement historic years is included in the farm sustainability transitional provision regulations, which were laid earlier this year. Um, on progressive capping currently under FSTP payments are capped at 190,000. However, for FSP, it is planned that progressive capping of payments will be introduced over a two year period, with capping levels increasing in stages based on the size of payment. Um, and again, you've got worked examples in your written pack on how that will apply. Um, and again, you've got worked examples in your written pack on how that will apply. New land eligibility rules will come in. Um, and really the objective there is to establish rules for FSP that complement the scheme's objective, and can be easily understood and controlled. The farm sustainability standards replace cross-compliance and come in together with a revised penalty matrix. Um, again, you've had a couple of briefings on this from our officials, um, and along with worked examples. Um, but again, we can pick up any questions on those later on. Um, and then included within FSP is the proposal to introduce, uh, conditionalities. These are there to encourage uptake and participation by farm businesses in three data platforms within the Sustainable Agriculture Programme. The Soil Unit and Health Scheme, Bovine Genetics Project and the Carbon Food Printing Project. To meet these conditionalities, farm businesses will be required to register for the projects and complete training when it's offered. And again, the briefing contains details of those conditionalities along with the timeline for their introduction. An affirmative statutory rule is required to provide the Department with the legal powers to implement FSP and the various elements that I've outlined. And really in terms of bringing that legislation forward, we really want here today to give you the overview of FSP and then follow that in the September-October time with the SL1 to progress the legislation through the Assembly. A negative SR is also required to provide the Department with legal powers to implement the new Farm Sustainability Standards. And again, that will come forward in the autumn. In closing, Mr Chairman, it's recognised that the investment the executive making in SFP is considerable. And in receiving that investment, farm businesses through the various actions within the scheme will be making substantial improvements to environmental and addressing climate change challenges. Chairman, that's a short briefing and I'm happy now to open to questions. Thank you so much. I know there's a lot of work that's been done on this and we have heard some of the detail previously. One of the things that strikes me is in terms of the, and you did allude to it, was in the first instance that around 1900 farm business may be impacted by the historic years exercise. But I can't see the analysis of the type of farm that that alludes to. My brain goes to a small farm possibly, but there's no detail to suggest that. Is there a mix of sizes or is it predominantly in that aspect? Will it be the smaller farm that is potentially precluded? No, there's a mix of sizes. So essentially the historic years is based on activity on the farm business. So again, within the regulations, there are a number of activities set out that farm businesses need to meet to be eligible. So we've looked through NYFIS data, we've looked through SAF data and businesses in that historic reference period, for example, with no cattle or sheep showing, no poultry, no pigs, crops or arable crops. Those are the businesses that are impacted. So those are the 1900 that are not showing any of those defined activities. It's also stated in the briefing paper that a balance needs to be struck between providing a safety net, which helps a farm business withstand shocks, but not so large that it reduces the incentive to be efficient, to be competitive and to manage risk proactively. What evidence have you gathered that would lead you to believe that farm businesses are not managing their own risk? I picked that out probably in the bit where it's in there's around 295. It's probably in the next stage there's 295 farms that are probably potentially going to be effective. Is there any evidence to suggest that this will work to make them more robust and proactive? It's probably more fair to say, Chair, that we've looked right across the board at all farm businesses. They are managing risk, but there are those where receipt of the payment can distort their development and opportunity to maybe take on more innovation, grow their business better and rely more on the payment. So it's to try and get that balance going forward. This was a win and the department did change from us because obviously one of the previous proposals was to have a five hectare, which is now reduced to three. Was there any quantification done of the amount of farms that that would have impacted? I know it's not going to impact, however, it was there as an option. Was there an analysis done on that? There was an analysis done and we published some of that at the time of the consultation back in 2020. Sorry, back in 2021-22. But really, since that, just from the consultation itself, further communication with stakeholders, the Minister decided to hold the limit at three hectares. Okay. It is a comment and you don't have to comment on this, but obviously we liaise with farmers quite regularly. Given the other pressures that farms and family farms are under in Northern Ireland, whether it's the family farm tax, the NAP proposals or the climate action plan program that has recently come out, there's a growing sense that they're being pressed on all sides and some of this will feel, I think, like a pressure to some of the farmers. Is there a risk, I suppose I'm asking a question, is there a risk that even with some incentive that some farmers may decide to walk away from a scheme such as this and therefore we reduce the ambition for making climate, because it seems to be that at every quarter farmers are finding the same kind of pressures on them. And from the SAP itself and really why we're bringing forward the SAP is to try and develop that sustainable enterprise. The schemes within it are voluntary and really it is down to individual farm business choice. But we want to try and make the schemes as attractive as possible to be as easy to apply to. Yes, there are some more controls built around it and some new requirements within it. But really our sense is that farm businesses can apply with those and comply with those and the benefit will be in the long term around the development of the business. Okay, thank you very much for that. Thank you. And Deputy Chair Declan. Thank you. Thanks very much for your presentation. You mentioned there that the, well, one of the good things here is that we have ring-fenced the budget that we see on the 29 million, so that at least gives a wee bit of certainty in a very uncertain climate for agriculture and rural communities. But I suppose the question I want to ask is, farmers obviously are going through this transition period now, and they want to know, will their entitlement rate remain the same? Will there be a minimum floor? Because if there isn't a minimum floor for them to be able to, for them, it leaves very, very difficult for them to plan ahead, be innovative and make decisions. And Declan, we're very much, I suppose, in the early stages of bringing forward the schemes within the SAP. There's been some redirection of budget to fund the Beef Sustainability Package, and that has impacted the entitlement values. The Minister has said that over time, as the schemes come on board within SAP, more of the budget will move to support that. As we work to see what that budget will be, we'll be looking at what that sweet spot is, for want of a better word. But that's work we still have to take forward. Is this something that will be coming forward in the SL1 when we're looking at this, in terms of giving that minimum floor security for our farmers? Not as part of this SL1, because essentially it's just bringing in FSP, but it's work we would be taking forward in the policy space going forward. Thank you. And one of the conditionalities you mentioned there was the genetics scheme. Now, we've been looking at this in the south of Ireland as well, because obviously we operate across the island and might be dealing with the McHarder part down there as well. And we've noted that there has been issues down south for experience by farmers in terms of rigid reference years, strict genotyping targets and penalties that hit particularly the smallest farmers. For example, if there's herd changes that happened, for example, for illnesses and other things beyond their control. So, what is the scheme, what shape is the scheme going to be taken here? Because there's the inflexible rules down south that have resulted in farmers losing payments has caused problems. Yeah, and the scheme up here is very much looked at, the scheme in the south, and the provider that has been appointed to help deliver the bovine genetics is the ICBF, which works across, or will be working across the island here. There is a number of points and a number of elements of it still to be developed, but the plan is that certainly it will be available to all breeding herds to build the database, genotypes and DNA analysis of cows and bulls and young stock as needed. And so, within the scheme itself, there are proposals brought forward or being brought forward to how that will be delivered. But the aim again is to try and make it as simple and accessible for farm businesses and to avoid some of the challenges that have occurred in the south. I know officials working on that particular scheme plan to come forward in September with a fuller briefing on bovine genetics, and hopefully that will give a greater flavour of what's included. So, the scheme that we've implemented here needs to look at the learning from down south and the impact it has particularly on smaller farmers. And one of the other things, just to just to follow on from that, is that some of the concerns that have been raised by farmers down in the south is about private companies controlling genetic data, and they need control over their herd genetic data. Will there be guarantees here that that will be the case that won't be shared with third parties without clear consent and oversight of the farmers? Again, for all the data platforms in the south, there are privacy notices either in place or being developed, which will set out exactly what the data collected will be used for and who it will be shared for. And, you know, if there's requests for data outside of what's in those privacy notices, then that can only be given with consent of the farmer. So, there's good, tight requirements built in there. That's okay. Thank you, George. Thank you, Chair. Thank you very much. Declan and Michelle? Thank you, Chair, and thank you for your presentation this morning. Can I just ask from the outset, is this still policy and development, or are these the final proposals? The final proposals at this stage, but obviously we still have to bring them through the legislative process. And I suppose why we're bringing forward now is to give that time for consideration as we bring it forward then in September. Okay. So, part of that probably does concern me a little bit in so much as what we have here today. I'm a bit concerned in relation to the comments with regards to what the Chair said around the capping. It nearly sounded to me as if you felt that you were doing farmers a favour by reducing their payments, because by doing that actually you're going to incentivise them to be more innovative and so on and so forth. But essentially you've also said within the paper that large farms can receive very large amounts of direct payments, which arguably are not justified, and these farms can obviously utilise economies of scale. So I suppose I would contend that in many respects it's large farms who probably have a greater risk, in so much that they're full time, they don't have other incomes coming to the farm business. They'll also employ numbers of people, they'll also be very much susceptible to having larger debts, so therefore as a consequence of interest rate rises, changes in prices and so on, that there is a greater risk. So I'm not really sure where the thinking is around that, in that you're essentially giving them a protection. Yeah, and it was something we consulted on back in 21-22, and certainly the strong response coming through that was that the proposals outlined at that time were the right way to go. And again, where the progressive capping is there, there's a lot of other support provided for those businesses through SAP, through knowledge interventions, through investment schemes and so on, that give them the opportunity then to further develop their businesses and grow and be sustainable. Then I suppose then going alongside that then of course are the conditionalities which you've outlined in the paper, and I suppose in some ways there could be issues with some of that in regards to accessibility, particularly maybe in around completing training, there'll be farms, maybe smaller farms who, there won't be the capacity within the farm business in order to be able to do some of the work that you're asking them to do. Yeah, and you note from the paper that for the conditionalities there's really two elements to it, as you've mentioned Michelle, there's the participation in the scheme itself, so be it getting the soil analysis, getting the results, and that information will be provided to farmers. The second part is the training, and I think that's maybe the point you're picking on. Certainly the training is being developed by CAFRA, and we're cognisant, you know, that it needs to be accessible and understandable by everybody across the board, and that's being taken into account in the development of the training. It's available in a number of formats, so primarily online, but face-to-face is there for those who prefer that route. But I suppose the key thing is, it's not being developed to be arduous or onerous, you know, it's short videos, maybe no more than an hour, which can be dipped in and out on, and, you know, where people have creation questions afterwards, they can either follow that up through CAFRA. So we're hoping that farming businesses will find this easy to get on board with and be easy to follow. And just in terms of the genetics project, obviously something's been driven by industry for a long period of time, even during my time, which was a very long time ago, but the project isn't yet up and running. Is it fair to include it at this point as a conditional...? It's up and running from the point of view that the service provider is appointed to build a database of genetic information, and that database can only be built by getting the genetic data from the animals. So later this year, the first benchmark reports are hoping to come out and then to be available for farmers. But really, the timescale for introduction, while we're signalling that farmers and registration will be open from next year, the timescale to get the registration done and the training is through to 28. So there's a bit of a lead in time there, but it's really signalling the intention going forward. Is industry in agreement? We're working through that with industry across the board. It's fair to say there's mixed views, and it's something we still have to fully bottom out with them. Okay, and just with regards to the carbon footprint project, I understand there might be some issues with tender. Where are you in securing someone to deliver that? So for the carbon footprint project, it's a three-way delivery. There's our sales in the department, there's the LMC as the delivery partner on the ground to collect the data, and then the third key element is the carbon calculator. We did go out to tender last year for a calculator. We had a legal challenge, and as a result of that, the tender was terminated. But we're committed to it, the Minister's committed to it, and we're reinitiating another tender now to go out shortly. Okay, thank you. And just very finally, the very last question. You may have missed the discussion at the start of our committee, and obviously you're the right people, I think, maybe in place with regards to the payments for those who were affected by the A5, and obviously the mess that's been created as a consequence of what's happened in the last week. Have you any information at this stage with regards to vesting orders being coerced? What that may then mean for those who weren't able to claim parcels of land because of the vesting order? I have no information, but it's something I know the department's looking at. Ian, are you aware of anything? No. Because obviously we came to try to clear communication as soon as possible to those. Thank you. I think you'll be receiving a letter probably off the back of our earlier. Okay, thank you. And next we have William. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In relation to the 2026 sustainability payment, I'm sorry, I'm not a better to clear an interest in partnering and farm business. I have to keep myself right on that one. In relation to the new area coming in, there will be an extra, I think it's 40,000 hectares somewhere right? What's the extra area eligible for payment? In terms of the changes to land eligibility rules? Yes. In relation to soft features, that will bring in an additional 35,000 hectares of eligible land. 35,000 hectares? Where's the entitlements going to come from for that? There are no new entitlements under the programme. How is that going to be claimed on then? Well, existing entitlements again from the start… There's not so much land in there and you'll have to make more entitlements or you're bringing more land in. No, there are no more entitlements. The same entitlements will carry forward from BPS and the FSB. How is that going to be claimed then? Farmers will still claim on the entitlements they hold. They may not have more eligible land in, but they still will claim on the same entitlements. The logic in my eyes is there's 35,000 extra hectares. You need entitlements for each hectare. Where's those entitlements going to come from? You can't claim it right. One of the driving forces of this was, and George has already alluded to, the consultation that took place in 2021. The overwhelming responses to that was a change to the rules for eligible land to make all land eligible apart from hard features. And there was the benefits of that. I have no issue with that. I have no issue with that. But to claim on land you must have entitlements. There's no extra entitlements been issued. So where are the entitlements going to come from to claim on that land? Just reiterate, there are no additional entitlements. Well then, this land wasn't claimed on in the past, 35,000 hectares. Hasn't been claimed on this year's. Because it was ineligible. If it comes back in, where's the entitlements going to come from for it? How is it going to be claimed on if there's no entitlements? Farm businesses bringing in extra land would have the option if entitlements are available for sale or lease to draw in additional entitlements, but there are no new entitlements being brought forward. Well, I don't know how that rationale works out. Because where are they going to come from, the farmer can't get them. They're not there. The drive was to disincentify farmers from removing scrub, from removing hedges, facing hedges back, controlling rush. So there was environmental side of that because we, you know, the policy intent, we didn't want to go the route of, you know, that the payments were based on farmers having to take actions to control rush to secure their payments. If the soft features are now eligible, farmers don't have to take actions against those issues. So that makes the land eligible for payment then. There's no entitlement if you have no entitlement. You have to have an entitlement to claim on each hectare of land. Where does entitlement come from for that 35,000 hectares? I think as Aidan said, but from the consultation back in 21-22, we were clear that the purpose for the new land eligibility rules was to make it simpler for farmers. More land would come in, but there were no more entitlements and they would just carry forward into existing entitlements would carry forward. But normal arrangements for sale or lease would still continue to apply. Yes, but there was 35,000 extra hectares in Northern Ireland coming into play. And there's no entitlements for them. No. How are you going to claim it? Again, that would be, I suppose, a choice for the foreign business to determine what land he claims, he or she claims their entitlements on. But there are no new entitlements unless they buy or lease something. Then a lot of this land can't be claimed on then. Unless there's entitlements on it. There's only so much land in Northern Ireland, so the entitlements have all been used at the moment. And some land. So there's 35,000 hectares actually coming in. It's not hard to book out. There's no entitlements for that. I think I'm right in saying we've more land at the minute than we have entitlements under the existing rules. There's more land coming in than there's entitlements for, in you? No, no. There is more eligible land presently than there are entitlements currently, is my understanding. That makes it worse, then. There's 35,000 extra hectares coming in. You say there's not enough entitlements for the land that is there at the moment. So that makes it even worse. It's something I think needs nailed down. I don't know how you expect 35,000 hectares to be brought, eligible land, new eligible land were brought in, but no entitlements more available to claim on that land that it can't be claimed on. I think again... I understand where I'm coming from. I'd like to get my head around this a wee bit too, just because I know Declan's going to come in, but could you just, from my perspective, William knows an awful lot more about this because obviously from the farming background, the additional 35,000 hectares that William's referring to, is the department bringing that into play? Or is that through applications? Is that direct new farming land or farming land that has been set aside previously? So if I could just get a picture of how that comes into the jigsaw, where the ownership lies. Because I understand William's point. It was ineligible. Yeah. That land's currently on the department's mapping system, Lippus. Okay? Field parcels, that's how land is recorded. So while you have the field size, you also have the MEA, the maximum eligible area. So under the current rules, ineligible features had to be deducted. So you may have a field that was one hectare, but the MEA is 0.8. So under these proposals, it was, the land's already there, it's already captured, on the department's mapping system. The only difference is the MEA changes the eligible area within the field. So you don't now have to make a deduction for scrub within a field, a deduction for rub, sorry, for rush. Offer strips. You can, you can, yes. So it's a, I've tried to work the example here, so the, part of the, part of the, part of the proposal is to, say, increase buffer strips and make them bigger if you're beside a watercourse. But if a part of your land has been set aside previously as not applicable, it can now become potentially applicable. So it's like, because it's not necessarily new land as such. It's not that have been set aside previously. But there's been some quantitative assessment to map those out as areas that previously hadn't been able to be claimed under, but can be claimed under. So it's not new land. But does this compensate then for things like buffer strips and hedgerows? Is that the purpose of this? No, but buffer strips are eligible for a penalty. No, no, but this is, but it's part of the, it's part of the other plans from DERA to encourage more sustainable farming. So everything, nothing happens without an impact on other. So if a farmer wants to put in three or seven metre buffer strips, they lose arable land. Ultimately, they get a payment or a subsidy for that. But this is a, I know this is a different one. Bottom line is, 35,000 hectares that hasn't been eligible this number of years is now becoming eligible, which I welcome. I have no issue with that. What I'm saying is, there's no more entitlements. How is that going to be claimed on? I don't know, because I haven't got an answer today. Do you mind if I bring Daglin on this one, just at this point? This is interesting. And I know exactly where William has come from, because I couldn't get my head around this one either. And this was one of the reasons why we argued against the closure of the regional reserve. You know, because, you know, only the way the region, that was the point I made that, we were specifically talking about young new entrants that time, but this is it. Like, each farmer has a finite number of entitlements per hectare. And you only can use them for whatever land there is. So if new land becomes eligible, you don't have the entitlements to claim on it. So, the point, William, is that 35,000 new hectares coming in. And my honest opinion, I think, you know, farmers, farmers then, like, they can't apply to the regional reserve for new entitlements for this new land. So, this is almost like a conversation that we've already had whenever we were debating about the closure of the regional reserve. The department didn't listen to this, and it was brought in, it was brought in, in an SR, in such a way where our hands were tied, where we couldn't play against it. Have you had any, George, any sort of, for the pleasure to come? On that one, really, you know, the Young Farmers Regional Reserve were legacy EU schemes. We had no cover for them going forward. The facility to buy and sell entitlements remains. And that will allow for the movement of entitlements around foreign businesses. But, you know, from the outset, from the consultation that we did on future agricultural policy, we were clear that there were no new entitlements. There'd be no rebasing of entitlements going forward at that time. Anything else on this one, William, at this point? I just don't know how the land's going to... There's 35,000 hectares who are eligible land coming into eligibility, which I have no issue with. But I'm just... I'm mesmerizing as, hey, that's going to be claimed on if there's no entitlements to claim on. By bringing that in, William, it does bring the audit, as Eden has said, around the environment and protecting that land from the environment that is not... That's all fine, but there's still no entitlements. If a farmer has 20 hectares, and he has 20 entitlements, and he claims on that, and he's not... If any hectares coming into play, where's he going to get the entitlements for it? And again, as I've said, I suppose the option is there for him to lease or buy entitlements for that? And then somewhere else, somebody else, some small farm, we're going to price out of the market and not regular. So, is there a risk? Is there been some sort of mapping done in terms of the... Were this 35,000 hectares actually in which farms or any quantitative analysis of how many farms it affects, either negatively or positively? No analysis per se, but it is within the existing land pool, the fields that farmers claim. So, you have an area of trees in the corner of the field, those area trees now become eligible. You have an area of scrub in the field, now becomes eligible. The farmer doesn't have to take the measures to make... To remove that scrub in order to maximise their payments. They don't have to control rush, be that mechanical, be that with herbicides, pesticides or whatever, you know. So, you... They're not being driven down that road of having to control issues in the farm in order to maximise their payments under the programme. OK, so, a picture I can get in here is, you draw me a field and it's just one hectare. And there's a payment on that, but the payment's for... Say there's three hectares and the payment's on it for three hectares. If the entitlements are there. If the entitlements are there. But actually, on the previous, the legacy one was, it could actually be 3.5 hectares because there's a part of that field is... Rashes. Rashes and trees. So, potentially... Is it a paper exercise, really, then? Because you still will only be able to get the payments, because the payments only exist for the three hectares, but the eligibility would be 3.5, because the rules now pertain, but you can't actually get a payment for it. But the paper says, if the payments existed, you could. But you don't need to farm it, that .5 that previously was a paper exercise. A farm business can activate their payment on more land than they have entitlements for. Okay. Okay, and they could always do that. You could always submit your application, and you could activate your payments on more land than you have in titlements. As long as you have it in your... Yes, as long as you have it in your thing. Okay. So, part of the drive for this was, in order of pushing farmers down the road to make the rules simpler, to reduce the errors that were arising, with farmers claiming ineligible land. Okay, I'm being penalised for that in terms of an over-declaration. So that, you know, by having... bringing in these new eligibility features and making them eligible, we reduce the likelihood of that happening. Well, then, in fact, they're not going to get an extra for it. The farmers are not going to give effort, because there's no entitlement to claim it. But you can't... Those areas that's... The bottom line, there's no other way around it. We have no more entitlements, and there's 35,000 hectare-tracts coming in. There's no entitlements for it, you can't get payments. The other issue I see is... Excuse me, of course. Entitlement. Entitlement window for transfer of entitlements next year is still very tight. With all those changes, the window never needed to allow longer to allow for entitlement and trading. The report's in. Do you want to pick that one up, Lauren? Yeah. Entitlements can be traded throughout the year, but they are actually recorded during that period of time, from the 2nd, usually from the 2nd to March the 15th of May. But they actually can do that as a process throughout the year. You can't do it online throughout the year, can you? But they can't do it online until the 2nd. That's what they mean. There's only about a 6-week period, isn't there? 2nd to March the 15th of May. At the risk of just standing on this one nearly too long, but I think it's important, the 35,000 hectares, is all of it subject to condition and rule like brushes, trees? Or you used an acronym earlier on to describe what would be a blockage to a farming activity, maybe in that space. But certainly the analogy of trees and rashes and stuff, that 35,000, if you said, it's not new land. No. It's within the portfolios and within the curtilage of existing farms at the moment. But farmers haven't been able to access a payment for it. They weren't able to get payments for that land. Because of rashes, trees or whatever, but those conditions are now set aside. There's no entitlements issued for that land because it was ineligible. Now it's going to be eligible and still no entitlements for it. Entitlement, as far as you're saying, the entitlement exists, but the rules didn't permit you to get the money for it? No, no, no. Entitlements don't exist. If entitlements existed, the department had them there would be a variation, and now that was the case. I'm not sure what you're asking, Robert. I was getting a picture from Aidan. I understand now where you're coming from. They can claim it as eligible for land, but they're not going to get a payment under an asset entitlements. Yes. They're not going to get a payment. There's no big advantage of claiming it. But they'll have to claim it, I suppose. But there is an advantage in claiming it because people are being penalised with over-declarations. So the farm businesses now don't have to take measures to control the rush. Not too many people would have been penalised for over-declarations. Maybe not now, but there was previously. No, I wouldn't have thought so. Now listen, I haven't got a satisfactory answer, but I'll leave it at that. Can I just ask one? Yeah. Let's go ahead. I'm just trying to get my head around. Is this then a factory to disincentivise farmers to engage in, I don't know what it's called, but it's called tap-tapping, where you would mow rushes, for example. Has this changed to disincentivise that? It's disincentivised for mowing rushes, spraying rushes, particularly spraying rushes, and the recent issues with water quality. Yeah. You know, removing scrub, because, as she said, you have a certain number of entitlements. Yes. To activate payment in that, you need one eligible hectare. Okay. And sometimes farmers fail foul of that, because they didn't have sufficient eligible hectares, because of those ineligible features. The farm businesses then had to take measures to counteract that or remove them, so by bringing more land in, they don't have to do that, because the rush is eligible, scrub is eligible. And they can use that area, which was previously ineligible now, to activate it. Yes. Yes. It brings possibly some of the smaller farmers, smaller farm scales into play. Probably would have been more applicable with the five hectare, but with the three hectares, even a small farm, would have fell foil. I think I'm getting a bit clearer. Entitlements at all were used in Northern Anglia. If you didn't use your entitlements for two years, they were confiscated. So entitlements at the moment have been used. Okay. So all entitlements in Northern Anglia have been used, or they're also confiscated. So it has to leave a shortage of entitlements. There's 35,000 hectares coming into play. I would have thought. You want to come in there, Hayden? Well, just on the point, as George said, there was no basin of entitlements from the very start. There was a finite number of entitlements. That hasn't changed. The farmers that claim this 35,000 hectares now, I asked her. There's no benefit to them. Unless they have an entitlement, they can't get money on. What happens if a farmer has very first? If there comes a few more hectares in, it is on the system, but he only still applies for the number of hectares that he has entitlements for, and doesn't claim solar on the thing? Is there any penalty there? doesn't claim the solar on the thing. Is there any penalty there? Well, the foreign business has declared all land associated with the business, you know, and all the land would be subject to previously gross compliance or going forward foreign sustainability payments. Sorry, foreign sustainability. He's going to have to put all his ground on, whether or not he's got entitlements for them or not. He's going to have to put all the ground. If he doesn't put all the ground on, then is he going to be penalised because he didn't put all the ground on? You asked the question of penalised, you know, the farmer can put all the land on, so you can activate your entitlements on more eligible land than you have entitlements for, and that gives you a safety net. Should you be subject to inspection? Should there be an over-declaration? Or should some other issue arise? Yeah, but that's still not answering the question. If the man, if there comes more ground in that's now entitled to be claimed for, but he doesn't put that on because he only has entitlements for, say, for example, 20 hectares, but he has another five that come in, and he doesn't put that on. He just claims for the 20 hectares and just puts on the 20 hectares of land on the thing. Is he penalised for what he doesn't put on? We can only go with what's on the claim. We don't hold records of land ownership. Okay. What the farm business declares in their application, they're declaring that's the land associated with their farm business. We don't have any other information. In the interest of just keeping this on, not necessarily this subject, could I ask and bring this part to a conclusion, if members are minded, that we, on a specific topic at issue, could we get a bit of a written briefing just in terms of response to this, just taking on board some of the queries and questions, and I would love to get a much, I think I've got a clearer picture, but I want confidence that the picture that I've got going on up here is the accurate one going forward, because I think it is a very important matter and something that apparently needs to be understood, because there is a change in the scheme here. Williams raised legitimate concerns, I think, but I am getting a picture that it actually might be, I don't want to get too excited, that it might be a decent change, it might be a good one. They'll be making habit of it, the department, like making good changes, but be keen if it was. We could be able to evidence that, and if it's not, obviously, you'll get some pushback from the committee and just to value yourself what it is. I have no issue with the changes. Yeah. I mean, that's not my issue. It's one of an excellent issues. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, thank you. Patsy. Thanks very much for this. So, the main thrust of this is that people, the main outcome of this, or maybe the sole outcome of this, is that people will not be penalised for claiming, we'll call them a scrog of ground or rushes that they might have done before. There's no financial benefit in this, right, for the farmer to, it's just not going to work out. In other words, the claim he can put it in and he's just not going to be penalised anymore. That's essentially it. That's right. And it's protecting that habitat. You will accept that anybody's penalised a second time after that is pretty much not in charge of their business. But could I just ask then, so we'll take the example of, say, a landowner who has a field down there in rushes, right, and it's in rushes because there's a drainage problem. It may well be a drainage problem for the landowner themselves or it may well be for somebody whose land abuts it or whatever. There isn't any financial incentive for that person to go in and improve that piece of ground because it's not going to be eligible for payment. Is that what I'm getting? Aye. It is. Or it may not be eligible for payment. Well, just let me take that forward a wee bit because that's interesting. So currently it may not be eligible for payment. And under what circumstances would or could it be eligible for payment because if there's extra ground being brought in or could fit the bill here? I would be interested to hear if there are circumstances where ground would then become eligible for payment, what are those circumstances? What we've outlined is that soft features will become eligible. So rush will become eligible, scrub will become eligible. No, no, but it's not going to get any extra money from what you have explained. Yeah, but take another scenario. You have your entitlements. You're using the field to activate those on. That field now becomes encroached with an eligible rush or an eligible scrub. Yes. You're in a situation that you can no longer activate your existing payment using that land. Yes. So you either have to go out and take additional land or you have to take measures to control the ineligible features that are within those fields. Right. So what's your point then? The point is that you have no longer to control those ineligible features because they're eligible and you can receive your maximum payment. Without having to take adverse actions that are detrimental to the environment. That's what I'm trying to get to. Is if there are instances, which I seem to think that you're hinting at, where people could be financially better off. What I mean financially better off and gain more income from this scheme as a consequence of what your rationale seems to be taking me. What are those circumstances and have you any examples you could show us of where that might be the case? I don't follow the question. I'm following your rationale. What you're saying is that there could be instances where a field which was priorly ineligible that may be then eligible for payment. That's my point. No, no, no. The point that I made, the land that you were farming was part of your farm business and you were activating your entitlement. Yes. If part of that land become overgrown and scrub, you have to make a deduction from your claim. And what we found was farmers weren't necessarily making those deductions on their claims. So when we completed our checks, the farm business were penalised. What we're saying now is that area scrub within the field is now eligible and is eligible to activate your existing payments. Yes, to activate your existing payment. But back to the original point there. If it previously was ineligible, is that farmer then entitled to get anything more financially for it? That's my point. No, no. The answer to that is no because you need one... That's exactly my point. That's my question. You need one hectare of eligible land to activate one entitled. And there's no change to that. I get that. But I just wanted to establish what's the incentive for the farmer then other than to avoid a penalty if that person was stupid enough to make a repeated mistake in his claim. The incentive for the farmer is the farmer doesn't have to go out and know the rush, control the rush by mechanical means, control their heather, burn their heather, spray their rushes. So there's no incentive for them to go out to do that so that they maximize their payments. Because you can only activate on your payments on eligible land. Oh, no. So within that farm business, if you have pockets now of areas of scrub and rush which were previously ineligible, ask those in croach. The farmer doesn't have to take any action to mitigate against that, they will... To my original point, my original point is, as a consequence of this, do you see any landowner being financially better off? No. Unless they buy or lease in more entitlements with the same holding that they have. Yes, the benefit is they'll not be at the expense of taking those mitigation actions to destroy payment. Should it be specific? Financially better off by way of income via DART or via DERA. The RFSP will remain the same. No, that's all we're going to do. We got there. So, okay, thank you. I'm going to permit because he's so cute when he smiles at me and he has promised me it's going to be a little one. I'll make a comment. There's 35,000 extra hackers coming in. It will distort the price of entitlements. It will drive entitlements through the roof and those are fit to buy them and they'll buy them and those are not. That's what will happen. There's always been trading and entitlements. I think some better way of doing it from the department would have been. I think what George has said there is right. There's always been trading of entitlements and that has been driven by market prices. There's 35,000 extra hackers coming in and there's not entitlements for those. Who could... Did I just encourage just a bit of a written brief in general to get a better picture because, yeah, yeah. It's getting clear and that's got to be a bit muddy for me again. There's 35,000 entitlements that have been used every year. It would have to be because that was the case. Don't have that figure. It wouldn't be. The campus get it from the farmer. We didn't use them there. Oh, Robbie. There's campus get it from. Isn't that right? Go on ahead. Well, I don't know. That's it. I was just going to say, just out of curiosity, and I get what you're saying about this new idea disincentivizes farmers to engage in the mowing of rushes, for example. So I suppose financially it would avoid the cost of mowing or paying somebody to do the mowing. But does the part of any analysis of the 35,000 hectares is, you know, how many of those hectares were hectares that were already claimed, that were already claimed, but which were mowed to make the land eligible, if you know what I mean? You know, there's some of that, there's some of that 35,000 hectares completely brand new land that was never claimed on. And there's bound to be some of it that has been claimed on, but was mowed and kept in good agriculture, very mental conditions for the purpose of claiming the Singaporean payment. There may be fields that were never claimed before, but the majority of this will be within the population of fields that farmers are farming and claiming. Yeah. OK. And that's where the vast majority of these soft features will be located. It's within existing fields. And you have a diverse range, you know, when you go from west to east, of the knowledgeable features that you find within land. I ask for one thing just on the response, then if we get a bit of a written response, is looking at the 35,000 hectares, what is the department's anticipated activity on that 35,000 hectares? If it is, nothing. Increased farm activity or environmental, because obviously it's been brought in into the portfolio for a purpose. I kind of get, I think I understand that. What's the anticipated activity on that 35,000 hectares if it's not farming, for instance? If it's just leaving it as it is, but that it's a paper exercise for the claims to make it easier and to decrease the unneeded activity that some farmers may undertake. And the benefits it brings from a biodiversity point of view. Absolutely. That's fair. OK, members, I'm going to genuinely draw the line under that one. If that's right, because we are going to get a written brief in terms of a specific answer. Maybe just make a final point. You were being so good. That with so many conditions being placed, there may be plenty of entitlements going around at the end of all of this process. But, yeah, thanks for it. This is one of the best committees for people that have been around this place for a long time. Be all right if it was just me and I'm only here for eight months. These guys know this inside out. So I'm grateful for it. I'm genuinely grateful for the members in this. That was a good interrogation. Members, have you any other questions while you've got them here? It's ready for another round. OK. Thank you so much. That was really enjoyable. Thank you. If you could get just as quickly as you can, it would be useful for the committee. Thank you so much. Thank you. OK, members. So, yeah. OK. Next thing is agenda item nine, which is the LCM and animal welfare import of dogs, cats, ferrets, bill. So I'm going to refer you to the LCM report, which starts page eight of table papers, legislative consent memorandum, animal welfare, import of cats, dogs and ferrets bill, page 139, animal welfare bill explanatory note, starts at page 144. You will recall that we wrote to some stakeholders and we have received a couple of responses. So we're going to look at those. But in the meantime, members, we had an oral briefing, you remember, from the department last week. So if you're content, we're now going to go into private session to consider the draft report and then we'll return to public session to note any decisions on the public record. So, members, are you agreed to go into private session now to discuss the LCM and the committee report? Thank you, members. Committee room 21, signed. Committee room 21, signed.

Okay, thank you members for that detailed and in-depth discussion about the LCM. So I'm going to note that with the limited time constraints that the committee had, we are content to publish the report, we'll go through it stage by stage, but the committee hasn't come to a consensus, and members are going to take the next few days to consider the report and the details of the LCM further. And the debate will be next week in the chamber. Okay members, so we've considered the committee's draft report in private session, but for the record we're going to go through the report section by section, and we're going to take those, and the first one that comes up is powers and membership. Are members agreed with that section, are there any points of clarification or accuracy? Content? Thank you members. And the next one is a list of abbreviations and acronyms used in this report. Are members agreed with that action? Are there any matters that anybody wants to draw my attention to and accuracy? Okay, thank you members. The next section is the background paragraphs, which is paragraphs 1 to 8. Are members agreed with that, the background, in terms of accuracy or any points of clarity they need? Okay, content? Thank you. Next stage is the committee consideration of legislative consent motion, and the first part of that is the committee meeting on the 12th of June, which is paragraphs 9 to 18. Are members content that this is an accurate reflection? Okay, thank you members. The next one is the committee meeting that was held on 19th of June, paragraphs 19 to 45. Are members content that the summary captures that meeting accurately? Are members content? Thank you. Then the position in other jurisdictions, which is detailed at paragraphs 46 to 48. Members content that they have seen that? Thank you. Then we reported on the committee meeting on the 26th of June, paragraphs 49 to 60. It's a summary of that meeting on the 26th, which is today, yeah, actually. Can you remember that far back? So I'm hoping that yous are content with the discussions today and how that's being captured. Okay. In terms of the conclusion, are members agreed that that section is included? Or would you like to add or look at any changes for that? But I've detailed at the start of this session what the committee's position is on that. Okay. Thank you. Okay, the links to appendices is the final part of the report. Are members agreed with the section? Yeah. Okay. Okay. There were no changes noted there, but the clerk and the team will do a final read-through. And if there is any inaccuracies, whether that's grammar or spelling or not, those will be reported to you guys. And the report will be led with the business committee by close of play tomorrow, 27th of June 2025. Do you wish to see the report again by email before tomorrow for final approval? Members? Yep. Content? Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Chair, the only additional thing I will add just is that what you stated at the start there, I'll add that to the conclusion regarding the lack of consensus. Yeah, lack of consensus, but that was really due to time constraints and there are a number of anomalies within the LCM and its applicability. Okay. And we'll hear more about that in the debate next week. Okay, members, thank you very much for your help, your endurance with that. Okay, we're going to move through the next items on the agenda, which is agenda item 10, the Agriculture Student Fee Amendment Regulations. I'll follow you to page 171 of the PAC for the SL5 letter, the SR, and the Explanatory Memorandum. We received an oral briefing on the SL1 at our meeting on the 5th of June and heard that the Department intends to make this SR to amend the Agriculture Student Fee Regulations 2023, which sets out the level of fees payable for undergraduate and postgraduate higher education courses delivered by Dira at Caffrey. The Department states that there have been no changes to the SR since the SL1 submitted to the Committee. The SR will be led before the Assembly under the negative resolution procedure and subject to executive approval. It is anticipated that it will come into operation on the 1st of September. Members, we agreed that the Department proceeds to make the SR, so I now put the question on the SR that the Committee for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs has considered 2025 112, the Agriculture Student Fee Amendment Regulations, Northern Ireland 2025, and there's no objection to the rules subject to the report of the Examiner of Statute Rules. Are you agreed? Thank you. Agenda 11, Departmental Written Briefing Consultation and Plastic Pollution Plan for Northern Ireland. It's on page 189 of the pack for the briefing paper. There's also a copy of the draft public consultation on page 194, which at this stage is not for wider circulation as the consultation does not actually launch until July. Members, the PP&I, which contributes to Strategic Outcome 17, which is the Reduction of Single-Use Plastics in the Environmental Improvement Plan, will launch for a 12-week public consultation in July. The consultation seeks to gather views to be considered in the development of the final plan, which aims to collate the targets incorporating the existing policies and strategies identified in the actions and activities that will contribute to reducing unnecessary plastic in Northern Ireland. The Plan's 15 actions, ranging from behaviour-changing projects, reuse and repair initiatives, the carrier bag levy, and the introduction of new legislation, such as the Environmental Protection and Single-Use Regulations, following the consultation, the committee will be provided with a summary of the responses. Any comments? Are you content to know? Thank you, Members. OK. Correspondence, Agenda, Item 12. To a correspondence, Member, page 222-225 of the pack, correspondence from the Department, date 16th June, regarding the launch of the Noise Map Viewer. The Environmental Noise Regulations 2006 requires strategic noise maps for road, rail, airport, and industry noise are published in the Department's website to improve accessibility and usability of the maps there now on an interactive Noise Map Viewer and improvement on the previous model. If you have any comments, you can tend to note. Thank you, Members. Page 226-230 of the pack, the correspondence from the Department to the Committee for the Economy, regarding overgrown trees and liability. I'm sure your inboxes actually get hammered with us sometimes. Following our current meeting with the Economy Committee on the 4th of June, the Committee wrote to the Department requesting further information in respect to landowners' liability and preventative action, measures that there is to allow intervention by landowners. The response states that the filling of trees are regulated under the Forest Tree Act 2010. However, this does not apply to tree filling carried out by an electricity undertaker, and that's what they're called, because the tree is so close to proximity to an electric line or electric plant which is kept installed by the electricity undertaker. The response also states that the way-leave agreement between the utility provider and the landowner will define maintenance and liability responses for both parties. Members, have you any comments or content to note? Thank you. Next item, pages 231-233 of the pack, the correspondence from the Department dated the 19th of June, regarding the update on the co-design process to develop a new, evidence-based rural policy on the independent review of TRIPSY. The Rural Policy Co-Design Oversight Group objectives and membership that propose vision, keys, principles, values and behaviours adopted for the remainder of the co-design process, and the objectives and membership for working groups can be found starting page 234. You recall at the meeting on the 14th of November, we received an oral briefing from officials of the Rural Affairs Division outlining the Minister's commitment to develop a new rural policy through co-design. The formal co-design process began with the Rural Policy Co-Design Oversight Group's first meeting on the 6th of May. The members of Supporting Rural Communities, Understanding Rural Communities and Championing Rural Communities Working Group will work throughout the summer to draft rural policy proposals to be presented to the Rural Policy Co-Design Oversight Group, and officials will update the committee on progress following the summer recess. Members, regarding the TRIPSI framework, the Strategic Investment Board has been asked to undertake their independent review. Officials are continuing to engage with the SIP consultant to ensure that the department receives the final report as soon as possible. And following completion, the committee will be provided with a written briefing. Are there any comments to make? You can tend to note. I'm sure we'll be keen to hear from those co-design partners. Page 241 of the Park, Clerk's Memo from the Clerk of the Committee for Infrastructure, day 22, regarding issues of the Wastewater and Belvis Log. Also on pages 242-243 of the Park Correspondents from the Minister for Infrastructure to Chair of the Committee for Infrastructure. The response states that the FI works closely with DERA, in particular through Living with Water and Belfast Plan, which aims to address the issues with relation to the waste water network in Belfast. Hopefully they're working more closely with them than that, than they did in the A5. The plan estimated that 1.4 billion investment would be required over 12 years to deliver it. The majority, 1.2 billion, required for upgrades in non-land water infrastructure around 200 million, identified for blue-green drainage infrastructure. However, NI Water has confirmed that its project costs increased by over 50% to 1.9 billion, which is, seeing the overall plan cost rise to 2.1 billion, which is eye-watering. An affordability review carried out in late 2024 and concluded that the Belfast plan still needs to be delivered, but that the original 12-year delivery time frame is no longer viable. That's one of Patsy's grapes, because that always happens. Members, DFI have secured 15 million of transformation funding over the next four years to progress a pilot project on nature-based drainage solutions and to address the challenges that are facing NI Water, including wastewater investment, the consult and options for developer contributions and to reduce the water, flooding and sustainable drainage bill. Any comments you intend to note? We will almost certainly return to that, guys, I'm sure. A fairly page 244 of the Pact, a copy of correspondence to the Minister from the Chair of the Committee for Infrastructure regarding Water Quality in Northern Land, Rivers and Lakes. The Committee has requested the Minister's assessment of the recent published water quality reports for Northern Land, Rivers and Lakes and testing whether or not Northern Land Water is a contributor to the pollution levels as outlined in the reports. Members, any comments you intend to note? Thank you, Members. Pages 245, 247 of the PAG, correspondence with the Department on the 20th of June regarding the Public Consultation Shaping Sustainable Places Programme, SSP, which launched on the 23rd of June for a nine-week period. I refer you to a copy of the Public Consultation document including the Rural Needs and Impact Assessment starting on page 242. SSP programme is a collaborative regeneration programme led by the Department of Communities involving the Department for Infrastructure in the area and is a vital major investment programme with a coordinated focus on village, towns and city centres. The programme will have DFC, DFI and Diera each contributing a minimum of £50 million over 10 years for regeneration and defences with an additional £15 million contributed by local councils. Are you content to note? Any comments? End item 13 is your forward work plan. Members, it's at page 318 of your pack and it also provides a map to Blackstone Houston Estates for a visit after the meeting today. Do you agree that the forward work plan is published? Does anyone have any other business? No? Okay. The date and time of next meeting is the 3rd of July at 10am and we will be meeting at Caffery Hill Farm at Glenwery in the Antrim Hills at 10am. Hopefully a map will be provided. Thank you, members. My adjourned. Committee Room 21. Sound. Sound. Sound. Sound. Sound. Sound. Sound. Sound. Sound. Sound. Sound. Sound. Sound. Sound. Sound. Sound.
