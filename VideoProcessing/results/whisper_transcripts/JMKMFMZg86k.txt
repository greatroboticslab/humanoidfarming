 Hello and welcome to Gearock Farms. Today we're in the shop working on the 1650 Oliver. Dad noticed what maybe half a week ago or a week ago that it doesn't want to go into reverse anymore so we're thinking there's a piece of linkage broke. What I think it is is the forks that move the gear that could be starting to break off because if I fiddle around long enough it seems to go in and then it stays in until you take it back out and go forward and you try to go back to reverse again you're in trouble now. I took off what I could just to see down in there where the stick goes through and everything appears to be fine. We've had this open before. I'm actually kind of lucky because it had to be 10 years ago we had fifth gear lock up on this tractor. I don't know why it had oil in it we had the picker on it then. We took this whole thing apart and I ended up getting a rear end with the transmission from a used to be an Oliver dealer. They used to sell white and all that stuff over at Hickston. So this guy sold me a whole rear end without the wheels and everything of course but I got axles and the whole transmission so we had that all tore apart so then I got that all and a half barrel up on the shelf there and I'm looking in there and every component that's in here is in that barrel so we're going to take it apart and see what's wrong. We got to take off seat this whole hydraulic assembly along with our platform stuff and underneath the hydraulics it's pretty much gets you access to your transmission rear end stuff and there's another interesting thing about these tractors compared to like international some other brands there's what did I figure out is there seven different reservoirs in here so you got your you got 80 90 in your rear end that's where your axles go through your differential you got your hydropower drive that's automatic transmission fluid in there there's maybe a gallon or so in there with this dipstick that's separate got your motor oil separate got your antifreeze separate you got your fuel and then you got your hydraulic system which is just on top of the transmission which is separate what does that make one two three four five they count right six six different reservoirs so that makes it a little more complicated like compared to that 686 hydraulic system in the whole rear end that's all what they call high trend it's just a hydraulic fluid and then of course our torque amp fluid which would be kind of does the same thing as this hydropower drive which they call it so that's all one and then another thing we noticed after investigating into this so I got this half barrel cut off in the other shed up on the shelf with all those transmission parts in just wanted to look and and see what I had there but then I found the brake assembly so if you remember a few videos back we were doing the brakes on 686 and I said that this rod needed to be heavier and I found this along with the brakes so I got this whole thing with the rear end now this is out of a super mta I'll have to take that apart again to see what size this is bigger everything's exactly the same except it's heavier this pin is bigger so in case we are smaller in there I think I'm just going to drill that out put this heavier pin through you notice it is bent a little bit which I think they just bend through time and that's why those brake and I think the first one broke and then this nut's very similar except it's just bigger there so you got half inch instead of what is that three-eighths that tractor's got more horsepower than this one wheels are maybe similar for our size and stuff but no one to brake so we're going to adapt this assembly and I don't ever remember breaking one on the 680s or on this Oliver I don't remember breaking these those with the mta and and that tractor I broke several through the years so we're going to switch that up someday too this isn't going to be anything I don't think too complicated what's wrong in there is what I think is wrong it's just a matter of taking it apart switching up that piece and getting everything back together I think the reason is that these tractors always shifted hard seems like you got to pull your hydro power which was kind of releases everything because everything is binding against you know when you go from forward to reverse so when we're spreading silage on the trench that back and forth you know you've got a pretty long stick here and we got almost like three foot pro bar really to shift with you know as long as it is that's a lot of pressure to put on everything down in there oh and another question somebody asked the question if we ever got rid of a tractor that we wish we would do that we've never sold any tractors I did but well I don't regret that one well that that one yeah you the temporary deal with startless I mean it wasn't all it had its little issues I mean I think it was a good thing I mean you didn't lose any money on the deal or nothing like that so it kind of kind of worked out but you learned a lot too and I grew up this way too my dad's never sold any tractors after he bought them you know where I grew up and my brother still got them all yet and then some you know you purchase more but you got to realize these things are 50 60 80 year old stuff they're kind of ready for the what would you call it that the showroom just just for the parades or all that stuff already and then I don't think you should get rid of them as long as everything's pretty sound on them yeah yeah you gotta make sure they're paid for so you gotta keep using them get our value out of them they're only becoming worth more every day and I know this one we could probably just sell it as is just wash it up a little bit and sell it as is and I'm sure it would bring several thousand more than it was worth brand new but then again the dollar isn't worth anything so you don't really I don't believe you'd ever lose the penny anyway it would still be what a dollar was worth back then so guys want to keep that seat from tipping over when I run her onto the back catch up could you do that for me I'm gonna put them back in so I don't lose them I know where everything went I don't think we need those to stay out hope you guys are paying attention so we know how everything goes back together it shouldn't be too bad we should be able to figure it out okay I'm gonna try starting the tractor dad's got everything unhooked run with the hydraulic remotes hopefully we're able to drain it real fast and not make a mess yummy okay okay I've been slowly plugging away at it got both the platforms off on both sides it got the battery out of there got the seat off got it drained or at least this top hydraulic reservoir I believe we got it drained it stopped pumping out of that line we had cracked and I've been kind of scraping around all of these bolts and it goes around this entire case here I'm going to take the air hose try to blow as much of this crud and dust off and then I believe we just got to remove all these work their way around the perimeter undo these lines there's one here one here this linkage this linkage here just take these off maybe keep this whole thing with that I wish I could shove this entire thing in like a parts cleaner or something maybe should have pressure washed it before I pulled it in here but none of this would have been exposed very well to clean I'm gonna blow it off the best I can and then start uh pulling some of them lines off or some of the brackets off so I just got everything cleaned off dad's back now there's a glimpse into what we're about to get into yeah I had to go because uh my state inspector showed up for the milk so yeah you always want to be there when they and everything was good he was wasn't too picky no well you know you know there's always those little things you don't even realize are an issue he passed we can keep we can keep doing over again I can milk another year yep at least according to the state you can milk another year and that this is kind of funny but this has something to do with that high load see on the MTAs this part here went off it's a little too bad hopefully our problem is down in there otherwise we're taking everything apart for nothing but I can't figure it out any other way so we're not gonna we're gonna get her open now you're gonna keep track all these bolts where everything goes right these guys will have to keep track there you go you guys get your pen and paper out number them all you should find that container then that'll be all the case well we shouldn't mix these up with our platform brackets this thing be sufficient it'd be the prime spot for one of those uh engine jacks we have a skid steer uh Are we let it go? No, we're good. We're good. So our burrs was on this side, so that means it's this arm here. Oh, we got the housing off. Now we're trying to diagnose what's going on in there. So it reverses that way, then it's this arm right here. Can you see what's going on over there? This must be high low range here. That didn't have nothing to do with that. And that's attached to the center bar. This fork right there. Yeah, that's for sure cracked off. It's just some fatigue. Some time of just jamming and jamming and jamming. Well, Ollie said that I've had it. Now, Dad's going to pull a cover off up front there. I think we got to get these bolts out, pull that guy out, and see if we can sneak them out of there. We might have to take all three out. It's amazing how new everything looks in here. Look at that. Here's your differential, which basically means so one wheel can be turning faster than the other. This whole mechanism right down in here. You always call your bull wheels. Once attached to each axle. And what's down in here is 80-90 weight oil. And then this shaft here, that goes back to your PTO, which makes live power. And that goes right through all these gears. It goes right into the hydropower and goes directly into the motor. So there's some different splines though. So if you take the whole PTO off, this shaft here comes out of this here spline here. That would go out with it out the back. I think you have that piece. Unless it broke before. No, I'm thinking I got that. I know we broke one of these. One of these shifting. I don't know what they call these. There's two of them shafts in there. One was broke. And then the guy at the shop, he worked on these down in Womity. He told me he bit me a can of pop. He said I'd have to take this whole cover off to get that out of there. So I could get the two halves out. And because we pull that cover off back there. And I think the one part, I don't remember how I did it, but I got them out. And then, but to get the new piece back in, because then it's all one chunk. He thought I would have to take the whole top off. We were able to get it in, but then to get these little bolts on, my wife went in there with her little fingers. And was able to get them started. So I did get one free can of pop for figuring that out. Container there that's in there. Oh, that cover is only big enough for the shafts. Yeah. Okay, I see. Well, I was concerned, actually I was concerned that we would maybe found something simpler than, you know, after we pulled this all apart. You know that quick getting dirt in there? Geez. It's just lean in there. Alright, let's get to work. Okay, we got everything loosened up. Dad's got his cap off. I got them bolts out. Now we're going to try to... There we go. He's sliding out the end. Maybe you don't have to go out all the way. Might have to take these two bolts out to get that to give way. Keep going. Where's this ratchet? Seven Up sponsorship. Yes. Well, somebody's got to sponsor us. Actually, the Seven Up is remnants of this guy's wedding. It's either that or start drinking beer. And we don't mix beer and heavy machinery. I think the big thing is here, just don't drop anything down into that boil. It'll be fishing around in there with a magnet. You can imagine what it looks like inside those new transmissions and those newer tractors. Make this look pretty simple. Can it lay down in there? Yep. There we go. Now we bottomed out someplace that we did something. Well, wait now. We might be able to... Can we drop this guy down? So we were able to finally fish it out of there. And yeah, that's the culprit. Looking at it from a square view. You can see that it's kind of bent back. So that was preventing you from going in reverse. And there's a crack right along that weld there. See, so actually a person could weld this. But I got one. You know, it almost looks like it may have been welded. You know, it may have been fixed. Wouldn't surprise me if 30 years ago somebody did that. Seen a look in here. Oh, the goodies. There's a whole transmission down in here. That's one of them. Here's one. That's the one that we were fighting. It's in the middle. The one's upside down. Here's the little middle one. That's the one. Here it is. Who knew? How would we be so lucky to have all that? I think the guy that put this one together was... He was probably on the job a lot longer than the guy that put this one together. There's not my real much weld in there. And they put it through that slot. All the diehard Oliver guys that was before the big merger. That was, yeah. I must have been. His head of the. Yeah. I had that sitting on the shelf. It's very loose. I'm going to put this back in this peg because I broke one of these ones too. You have to remember that because maybe in 30 years I'll be gone and you'll be digging through that same thing. Yeah. Then I'll put it back in and then realize that there's a crack in it and it doesn't work quite right. Maybe a little dust and it may not even work as well. Yeah. I'll have to pull it back apart. But see, I won't be here to remember for you. I wonder if we can take, how about if we got this guy out of here? I think I can get this guy out of here. We got him in but I'll split this tractor. I know that one of these sides we did. So we can slide him ahead. That would give you more room there. Update. We know exactly what we're doing and we slid it right back into where it was supposed to be. We didn't fight with it for 15 minutes. But this guy bolts to this so that means this has got to get turned up. Which that's what I was doing wrong over here. But we got that fork back in there which took a while. There we go. Okay, we roughly got everything lined back up. We got them shafts back in there. Dad's starting to... What we need now is some girly fingers to get down in there. Okay, we believe we have everything back together before we have to slide that cover on, right? I don't think we're missing anything. We didn't drop anything in there, did we? Okay. Try to line everything up again. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Pick it up a little bit. sweet. Oh cool. Oh Oh, oh, oh, oh Pick it up a little bit Pretty well Yeah, I think that's the one underneath it. Yeah, that's the issue The main one is okay Yeah, our backpack was popped up Now just to remember where everything goes Okay, last update for the day Got the big casing back on top there got some bolts in place According to dad it all feels right at all Yeah, it feels like I think we definitely it's great to know that we found a crack Pretty obvious And now it's a matter of everything fitting back into place But what we need to do which is extremely important It's mother's birthday today, so we need to go up and have birthday cake before she has to go to work because Can't miss that That this can always wait over that So tomorrow we'll keep putting things back together and maybe one last update of it driving around and shifting right Hopefully we're driving around tomorrow, which I feel pretty confident So See you tomorrow
