Howto & Style
 It's cucumber season so let's talk about it. If your cucumbers are just getting started here's some tips to help you grow them. A lot of cucumbers are monoecious which means they have both male and female reproductive parts. But they're separate so they need help pollinating. Here is the female part of a cucumber. You can tell because it's a flower attached to a little baby cucumber. You can tell the male reproductive part from the other because it looks like a flower attached to a little baby stem. Early on if you see cucumbers really small and falling off the plant don't worry that just means they didn't get pollinated. 99% of the time insects are going to eventually do this for you. But if you really want to maximize your yield you can take the male flower and rub it against the female flower to ensure pollination. As long as you keep them well watered you're going to have tons of cucumbers by the end of your season.
