The Difference Between Trellising Beans and Peas

 Beans and peas are both very capable climbers, but one critical difference between their trellising needs can make or break your season. Peas perform best with a horizontal element. Without this, many of their tendrils will miss their mark and the whole wall of peas will come crashing down. Pole beans could climb this netting easily by wrapping their vines around the vertical elements, but removing beans from any type of netting is a b****. Those same horizontal elements that were so essential for the peas prevent you from easily stripping the bean vines. The cleanup task becomes so tedious that the value of your time spent growing those beans drops to almost nothing. So for beans we start with the same trellis frame, but instead of the netting we tie lengths of twine from the top bar and pin them into the soil. When we plant beans at the base of each twine the vines still have no trouble winding their way up to the top, but now cleanup is a breeze. I can simply untie the twine at the base, slide the vines off the end, and all of these materials can be reused many times over. Put these two strategies to work for you in your garden and you'll be set up for many years of easy and effective trellising.
