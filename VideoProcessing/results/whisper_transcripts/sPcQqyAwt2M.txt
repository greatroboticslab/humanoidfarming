 Food has certainly become a more common topic. It's more and more people know more and more about food and I think that people have seen the value or the meaning of food is something that bring people together in communities. It's much more on everyone's lips so to speak and is a common focal point for people to talk a lot about. Clearly Austin got on the map with its food truck. People think about Austin. They think, ah that scrappy city is so weird and it has these food trucks and sort of leading the charge now. And I think Austin has got a good legacy to build on but it has some real challenges. And one of the challenges has to do with the fact that it's in a state that has a dwindling amount of water which challenges the whole state and the city in terms of being a focal point of food production. So how to do that will be going forward what what is Austin's role going to be in the food culture. It's also a scrappy culture in terms of getting it done, figuring out solutions, having a culture that people really work together to solve problems. It's not Silicon Valley, it's not Brooklyn, so Austin has to really turn on its own resources to get things done. My name is Brian Kauser. I work for the Sustainable Food Center here in Austin, Texas. Ultimately sustainable food everywhere comes down to access to, for a sustainable food center, organic practices and sustainable practices that allow the land to be used in its best long term sustainable manner. Organic is important because we need to think about how we're using land and water. We need to think five generations ahead and not just next year's election, not just the next set of suburbs. And you know, do we have enough water for the next set of suburbs in Austin? That's really not important. We might or we might not, but ten years from now if we keep adding suburbs, then where are we? After we've already built the city and we've lived in it. In terms of what it means to have the smaller farms, you've got a multiplicity of voices in the community instead of one voice that is deciding how land gets used. And there are a lot of different ways to do farming and there should be a lot of different ways. And they should all be supported and they should all be allowed to happen in different ways in different places. There are also a lot of different kinds of communities and farms pretty much come down to communities and being supported by communities. So the more small farmers we have, the more small communities we support. So once we let it get to a certain scale with the farms, the smaller communities don't have a relationship with them anymore. Economically, socially, culturally, those things break down. So being able to look your farmer in the eye and shake his hand and say, thank you for being my farmer is a really important something that we've got to hang on to. And if we don't hang on to them, we will lose them. So the small farm is really the core of the whole idea for us. Making sure those guys are still here. And it's not necessarily a question of, you know, how do we make it possible to have more water? Or how can we put the soil back that was eroded over time? It might be, how do we reinvent the way we produce food? How can we reinvent food that's not as reliant on as much water? So you would work at the equation from the other end as opposed to just trying to go and put things back the way they were. How can we make it possible to make it possible to make it possible to make it possible? What do we do? Food forests are an ancient practice and they're built in a way that is open on the edges and is designed to allow nature to work better on our own. So it's a cultivated space, but it's using ecological principles to be able to have mutually beneficial relationships between the different plants that are there, as well as the mutually beneficial relationships between the plants and the people. So everything is working to sustain another part of the system. So there's an art to it, but the beauty of it is with some upfront planning and some intelligent organization of that system early on, then the maintenance long term is very low. I think we're making good progress. We're going in the right direction. I think you can't get rid of technology and the solution. It's out there. It's being utilized. I think in fact it will connect humanity. It won't separate them. And I think that these problems such as water, food safety, food health, quality of our land, can actually be addressed and solved by optimistic, youthful, this generation that's coming through UT right now. I really believe they can get it done. I really believe they can get it done. I really believe they can get it done. See you next time. We are going to get comes doing useful In the end, you will see the protection of Memorial 2021. Please take care, and it will be only a bit more effective if not it doesn't do without any further in surprise. I really believe that the protection of Facebook people originally has generated at that time. So hopefully we'll see if overlooked that um,
