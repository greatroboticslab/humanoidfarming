 We're pitting Can-Am's Defender HD10 against its Outlander 6x6 across a range of challenges that'll cover load carrying, off-road capability, accelerators underwater, and finally a mystery challenge. I don't know where he's going, I always learn work smarter not harder. These challenges should play to the strengths and weaknesses of each machine to find out which one's king of the farm.
