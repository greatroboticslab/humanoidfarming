Science & Technology
 Sheep farmers, they don't have an app like this. It's enabled us to make better decisions. At the end of the day, when we make better decisions, we're going to have more lambs. What we see with Flockwatch is throughout the cycle that we'll be able to manage our sheep from, whether it's weighing them, to scanning, to lambing time, to breeding season. We're going to be able to record all this information. So at the end of the year, we're going to be able to make informed decisions on what ram worked best for us, what yos worked best for us, had we any trouble during the year, was lameness an issue. All those information that we need at the end of the year to make decisions on our flock. And the whole point of it is we're going to weed out our poor performing yos, our poor performing rams. More lambs at the end of the day, that's what we're looking for. More lambs from the same yos, that's the key. if we're constantly being gentle. We can do этого. bå那個點 Ira E seguir友
