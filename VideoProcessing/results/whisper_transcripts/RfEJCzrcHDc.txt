 You can invest in agriculture with your self-directed IRA and grow your retirement fund with no work. With a self-directed IRA, you can use your retirement funds to invest in horses, cows, farms, fields, orchards, and the list goes on. These are all things that aren't going out of business any time soon. Owning a farm is a good investment, and you can skip the hard work of farming. Your IRA can own the farm and lease it out to an operator who will pay rent to your self-directed IRA every year. Investing in agriculture assets is something that must be done with diligence. Research properly, care for your investment, and we can help it grow. Diversify your portfolio, even if you don't have a green thumb. What are you waiting for? Here at First Western Federal Savings Bank, we're here to help. How can we get your agriculture investment journey started? Give us a call. Interest Slow finance www.info.edu.eduuchasso.com
