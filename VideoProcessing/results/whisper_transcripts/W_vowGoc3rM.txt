 We're always doing something at the most inopportune time, right? We had a little disagreement. Well, I'm not sure y'all. I'm not sure what we've got today. I think there's still a, there's a chance. That's right. I got one of those little warnings. There's a chance of severe storms today. Hopefully not. It rained more last night. I don't even know where we're at now other than just really wet, really muddy. Got totally soaked by the silly mule this morning. I was sitting in the seat. I should have waited. Anyway, first world problems. It's warm. It's humid. It's a summer. That's what it is. Claire, are you the happiest girl? Where's Bonnie? Bonnie jumped out. Bonnie jumped out. Oh, y'all. This is really gross. It's really gross. Duke thought that looked like a good breakfast. So that's nasty. Okay. Well, today has been, I don't know, we've got a few projects going on. So we went to town and I got the sign. It's in the back of my truck. And I will say this. I've never been really good at math. Well, like proportions, like being able to get a lot of math. Being able to like understand sizes. Like anyway, the sign is really big. It's bigger than I thought it was going to be. That's fine. It's gonna, it's gonna, it's gonna stand out. So, um, and it's going at the end of the drive for the RV park. So, um, anyway, but we need a, um, something to hang it from. So I wanted rustic and we had some cedar. So, um, cedar post. So he's got one out here. He's gonna cut a flat spot across it. So we have something to hang from and to put across the top of the two other poles. And I don't know that that's gonna get to done today. It's looks like it's gonna storm again. And there's also tornado watch in the area. So that's lovely. Um, hopefully we don't see anything like that, but the sun has not really been out very much. There has been no drying to speak of. So this is our rustic top pole. Open, open, open, open, open, open of doors. I don't know the word for it. The lid off of that thing. I don't know. It's big and round. It's round and black and silver. That's not the carburetor, is it? You know me. I don't know anything when it comes to these trucks. So, this is a 78. I should have got you cranking it. They would have really liked to hear it being cranked. I didn't do that. I'm sorry. He and the kids worked on it a few weeks ago and got it going. What's that round thing in the back there? It's an air breather. Air breather. The top of the air breather came off. It sounds like it's very powerful. She's bad. She's bad. Okay. Well, it's a good year. We'll say that. 78, baby. He likes 78 models. Right? What? You like 78 models. Some of them. Some of them. What is that? Yeah. Yeah. You're cruising for a bruising. I don't know if I just... It would be a bad day if I ever had to try to start one of those. I would never get that thing started. Rocket. Rocket. Why are you so... I know. How about? Okay. Take two. Okay. Take two. All right.1000 Okay.40 wh號 Why went away? Bro Pf now! fly张 Hi! No buggy. Dad! You're gonna be okay? No buggy, I'm not zien. That was awesome. We go to Budah and bad couldn't stop. Lil Show. That's pretty. Pretty cedar. Smells good, too. Okay. Alright. Y'all, I am so excited. I just realized that with all this rain we've had, that plant under here is not getting any rain. And so it's literally dying and I had to water it. But y'all, I just noticed my gardenia is blooming and I am so excited. I wish you could smell it. It is literally, it is one, it's probably my favorite smell. My favorite flower. It's so, oh my gosh. Come on, little buddy. I think this, I think this one might actually do good right here. It's got a lot of blooms. It's got a lot of new growth. I haven't been able to grow them in the past. I just haven't put it in the right spot. So, anyway. It's making me very happy. Okay. We're always doing something at the most inopportune time, right? So there's definitely storms coming. There's definitely tornado watches all around. But we're going to try to get this done. So, Lawrence has gone down there to get the backhoe. Sissy's in the truck with the logs. And wait for it, y'all. Just wait for it. It fills up my entire truck. Oh, gosh. Okay. Hopefully it's not. Well, I mean, it's gone right there. It's not. It's in a wide open space. So. Hmm. So, originally I was going to do four by three. And I probably should have stuck with a four by three. But then I started looking and I was like, I think we could go better. So, we went five by four. Got good help. Peyton and Wesley, I wish there was a before and after it. They worked on our tack room. And it looks amazing. I can't believe how they were able to rearrange things. So, they've been busy today. Getting ready to be busier. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You are so funny. I thought we were going more back this way. Well, you can, but you're going to have to set that coast this way and that way. You sign a beat where they can see it from the road. But that coast is going to have to sit back over yonder. So, it'll be square with the road like this. I'm prepping dickles through the road so they can see it from both sides. You got me? Mm-mm. All right. I just didn't want... You don't think this is too close to the road pulling in? What if we pull it back to right here? I mean, we... We'll take a climb. Okay. Is that road sign not going to be in the way? Can we move it over there? Yeah, we will. We had a little disagreement about where it was going, but I'm trusting him. He knows best. I think this is going to look good, actually. I do. Now, I wish we had one for Bernard Farm. Happy joy. That is some hard wood. Oh, my gosh. You want me to hold the sign? You got that at once? Got one. Oh, it's perfect. It's not too big. It's just right. I mean, it's big, but... Look at there. I love it. Right? It looks good, doesn't it? You're glad I do. Lauren said, I think you should have done it like red and yellow. What? No. No. I think it looks great. Thank you, boys. Thank you. I'll be on the side. Oh, it's going to fly. Thank you. Thank you.
