Science & Technology
 We do research to provide farmers with good solutions for the major challenges facing agriculture. We champion good food and a healthy environment. In the laboratory, in the livestock shed, out in the field, in the mountains, in wind and rain, in scorching heat, when sowing, harvesting, feeding, milking, modeling, and cultivating. Throughout Switzerland, to help policymakers and practitioners make informed decisions, together with our many research partners around the globe. We also do research where our food is produced, which means rolling up our sleeves and getting stuck in. For example, we breed robust plants that can withstand the effects of climate change, are pest-resistant, and produce reliable yields. Here's the super croquant variety, Fred. We selected it for that. But we're not just interested in plants and animals. We look at molecules, microbiomes, models, and viruses, too. Here we get stuck in and identify. When plant protection products are required and how much. It's a question of sustainability and our health. But it's also about real people earning real money. To us, they are not just farmers. We know them as... Annick. Arlie. Freddy. Alexandre. Yana. And many more besides. Here, it's about nutrients. Some of what goes in at the front comes out again at the back. Ay-yi-yi. That's important for plants, but can pollute the environment. Switzerland is a grassland country. And it is thanks to grazing animals that we are able to utilize grass. In the form of meat and milk, for example. We do research to ensure that cheese not only tastes good, but is healthy as well. Researchers look ahead into the future. We examine what could actually have a future. We do whole system research with and for farmers. And for everyone in Switzerland. So we can reduce trade-offs. So we can use sustainable cultivation methods to protect our natural resources. We bridge the gap between scientists, practitioners, researchers, and consumers. We are agroscope. We champion good food and a healthy environment. We champion good food and a healthy environment. We change the erosion. We've become a healthier behavior.
