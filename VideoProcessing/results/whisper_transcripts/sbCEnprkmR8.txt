 Back at the end of August, I decided to do a little experiment and plant some pinto beans from a dollar bag of pinto beans from HUB. Definitely got these in a little bit too late in the season, so I really didn't know how they were going to do or how much I was even going to harvest. But as you can see here, they did grow and they actually produced quite a bit of bean pods. Key to getting them dried is you just leave them on the vine until they basically dry out. Here are some that started to turn white, but they weren't quite ready. And this is what you're looking for right here. They're fully dried out and actually you can kind of hear the beans rattling around in there. Basically what I would do is once a day I would go out there and check them and pick any of the ones that were ready to be harvested. Then finally came the point that we were going to get an overnight freeze, so I picked as many as I could. For any that weren't fully dried after I got them shelled, I would just lay them out on a paper towel and let them dry out. This process only took a few days and you would know when they were ready because they would definitely shrivel up. I had some already drying on this paper towel, so here you can see the size difference. In total, I got about half a cup of dried pinto beans, which I really don't think is bad for my first harvest.
