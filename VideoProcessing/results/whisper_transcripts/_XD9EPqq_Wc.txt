 The African Union says it needs member states to make a sizable investment in their country's agriculture sector. The continental body is investing more into its comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme. Under the program, the AU has launched a continental framework for agribusiness development in the continent. This aims to attract funds and create jobs for the youth. At the department level, what we intend is to see how many countries. We have a roadmap of countries to domesticate Kadeb. Today, for this year, 2017, our intention is to have 15 countries to really domesticate Malabo into the Naibs. And in 2018, we want to have 30 countries. So by the end of 2018, we have at least 45 countries in Africa who have domesticated their Kadeb because we need to have a compact Kadeb plan in their national agriculture investment plan. We believe that agribusiness development is a way forward that can attract the young to invest in agriculture. So do you want to make that research and culture?
