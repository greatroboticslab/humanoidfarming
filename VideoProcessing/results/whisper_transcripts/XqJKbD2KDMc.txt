Howto & Style
 Did you know if you grab a rose cutting that's at least 6 inches long and has at least 3 sets of leaves, then trim off the bottom sets of leaves and cut the tops off. Cut the stem on a 45 degree angle and a slice in the middle of it. Then grab some honey, dip the stem in the honey and plant it in some soil. It'll grow into a whole new rose bush. Honey acts as a natural rooting hormone so don't buy those chemical rooting powders. Just do this instead.
