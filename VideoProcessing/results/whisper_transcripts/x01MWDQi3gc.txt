 Harvest time! I'm excited because I actually have quite a bit to harvest today. And I'm going to start with strawberries. Let's put those two right on top. I'm also going to harvest some broccoli today. Number two. And number three. And I'm going to harvest a couple of garlic scapes. I only harvest garlic scapes that are curling. The golden peas look so beautiful. They're not quite ready yet, but there are a few of these snap peas that are ready. They're rubbing on their DNA cor Universally. They're moreounded but Deixa areaus lekker. Thank you.
