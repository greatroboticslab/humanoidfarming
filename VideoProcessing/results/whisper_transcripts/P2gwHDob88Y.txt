 When I mount a horse from the ground, I want to make sure it's going to be safe for me and comfortable for my horse. So before I even mount the horse, I want to make sure that the horse's legs are underneath them, they're square. I don't want the horse getting unbalanced while I'm trying to get on. So still, she actually looks pretty good there. I'll see if she wants to readjust. I want to push and pull, push and pull. Yeah, that actually looks pretty good. So the next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to stand by the shoulder. And the reason you want to stand by the shoulder, and not back here trying to get on, is you're going to get kicked. That's the kick zone. So you stay up here by the shoulder, okay? Next thing I'm going to do, I'm going to tip the horse's nose to me. And I'm going to put some mane and rein in the same hand, okay? Next thing I'm going to do, and the reason you want the horse's nose tipped towards you, is in case, you know, you're trying to get on and the horse says that it wants to walk off, or if the horse boots and is going to bolt, well all it can do is a small circle. So that's why you want the horse's nose tipped to you. Next thing I'm going to do, let me try to stir up to me. I'm going to put the ball of my foot in. Just the ball of my foot. You do not want to put the whole foot in. Because if something happens to where you need to get down, get that foot out really fast, well if your foot's all the way in there, you can get stuck. And you do not want that. You'll never forget it. So you just want the ball of your foot in there, okay? So, since Stella's a tall horse, I'm going to have to do some hopping. If she was a shorter horse, I would grab the cannel. But since she's tall, I'm going to have to hop and then grab the cannel. So, let me show you. So with just the ball of my foot in the stirrup, I'm going to hop, hop, hop, grab the cannel, pull myself up. I'm going to lay over the top of her. I don't want to be over here because I don't want to be wrenching on her back with a saddle. So if she's standing still and being light, which she is, I'm going to wait for a second. There she goes. I'll put my leg over. I'm going to sit down nice. Put my stirrup on my other foot. Get myself comfortable. Sit on my seat bones. So when I feel good, and she feels good, and standing still, which she is, then I'll let go. Just like that. So, this is how I mount a horse from the ground. A very tall horse. And I hope that helped. So until next time, Stella and I thank you for watching. Bye-bye.
