 A Dia profit so rise and shine value farm family welcome back to another episode of the farm if you're new here you are most welcome please consider subscribing if you haven't already and also turn your notification bells not to miss out on any episode of the channel and of course to all our returning subscribers thank you so much we really appreciate you guys so much thank you for being part of the family loving the content loving the shopping of the doppers i'm really super excited today it is a very hot day as you can see we are still in the masai land we are still in insinia still buying the ship and it's amazing we are now coming to the final stages of buying the ship and we are now doing the judging we have of course our guest i have my co-director of course nearby we are now making preparations for the best ship that we are going to bring at value farm and an amazing thing is guys we are bringing for you the best that's why we are doing all these precautions we are doing all our best to make sure all the ship that we are bringing to value farm are going to be of standard and they're going to make it to our breeding program as well so guys i also have my co-director right here who is going to say hello to you guys and also tell you guys what we are up to today hello everybody this is grafton um well today we're actually finalizing the purchases i'm sure my partner this is right with you guys already but before making all the final decision we actually have the premier judge for this whole district who's traveled all over whatever 30 plus years of experience handling and dealing with dopper he's inspecting he's checking he's literally or is actually going through grading the stock to see whether or not we have any foundational stock do we have pure breeds here what level they are so that way we have a better um roadmap to actually start building our flock and uh in uganda so that we can bring you guys the best yes we can find and of course bookkeeping record keeping so that when you come you can be able to trace we can be able to tell you guys which one is which exactly pewers and also the pedigree so i'm really super excited for this because at least you guys should really have the trust when you come to value farm you're going to definitely get the best from us and of course coming here it is just a blessing as well because you know people in kenya already have the association the dopper association they are really well organized so if we can have such in uganda that is going to be really beneficial to all farmers who are opting to start the performing tricky thing about the condition of the animals now do not pass judgment we know they're not looking their best because as you can see this place has been going through a severe drought yeah the animals are literally or barely getting enough to eat their feeds are being supplemented that is true water here is a finite resource food is a finite resource the rains were supposed to start on the 15th of this month they still have not yet arrived so you literally could be walking within the herd and animals are dropping dead all over the place because the food resources are not here so if you're in the congo uganda burundi you know other parts of tz where it's not this dry or this dire you should count your stars and be grateful that is so true after being on the ground here i'm never going to complain about us getting too much water in uganda ever again you should be happy for what we really have and this is a lesson to ugandans guys we have all the grass so you should really start farming because you're blessed with good climate so people here actually with the hot sun they really value their animals with all these weather conditions they struggle too much they rent they rent lorries to actually take the animals from this side of the country to a different section they spend real money trying to protect their flock and there's a lot of folks where we are that don't appreciate anything that is true that we have to offer yeah mother nature offers that is so true like the water guys if you don't have your own dam it is really sad most of them have really lost animals but they are waiting for the rains so count yourself lucky and of course we are here of course through the final stages let's wait for our judge so that you can also educate us tell us more about the dopers so that you can also get something to learn from it lesson one that i hope you guys take away from this is to try to buy your flock as young as possible that is true and be patient let them grow um under your under your supervision we always tell you guys about that but every once in a while because of of of selection you might see one that you want to have a project yes and we went to a farm that didn't have the youngest but the the composition was so great we actually went against our rule and actually purchased animals that was approaching the two-year mark but we feel they can at least give us two to three lambs you know that way you know we think you it'll be you know worth the purchase we're not recommending anybody else do this it's just so that we had to have this particular composition for the rams that we're bringing from south africa we feel that they'll give us a final a better final product down the line yeah yeah we'll wait for the judge you'll see a few words yeah tell us more yeah see you guys in a bit so guys we are here with judge jeremiah and we are really super excited that he's here to judge all the animals that we're taking to uganda we are taking to value farm it's just an amazing experience so far well i mean it's definitely been an eye-opening experience it's one thing to think you know how to select your animals but then you get a real judge with the eye and the experience to come in to tell you close but no cigar that is so true so there are a lot of other critical factors when it comes to selecting and that's why we actually have the expert here so mr jeremiah when you're selecting or when you for those people out there who don't know anything about selection what are the the standard should somebody be looking for when they wanting to get into the whole doper breeding process good um there are some parameters that you have to look into when you are judging at the dopest when we are on the farm we say we are inspecting yeah so that's inspection but when you are competing for the shows we are judging okay but all are the same thing because you you still use the same parameters to judge an animal or to inspect an animal okay and the five important parameters the sixth one is a type okay the last one will be a type but the sixth one but the first three which is a body confirmation you're looking at the whole animal from the head uh the whole body the barrel of the animal the legs you look at the other if it is a male you look at the testicles because we need the functionality and we are looking for production so you look at all those things and those that area is is called body confirmation okay and you're looking at the body confirmation you can give points from one to five and then another critical area is the fat distribution the fat distribution is the and the doper is a meat animal so you are looking for matter you are not looking for fat so fat yes so when you see a black a head passion the fat is concentrated on the tail and the head also so you also look at those areas is there fat in that animal so if there is a lot of fat you can you can downgrade that animal that animal and the third parameter that we look is the size the size is important when you are looking at the animals of the same age we look at the the growth of the animal how big it is uh do you have some so big animals which cannot carry their bodies this one we call them there's very small animals then you call also those animals the other thing is the color the color the color of the doper sheep is a black head and white body yeah you can you can have permit some uh white spots but not so much in some areas so that's another area that you look and also the covering of the animal whether the covering is uh how is it distributed because the we this is a ram which has wool and you which has to hair yeah so it is a mixture of hair and wool we are looking for the animal that can shed itself so we are looking for that loose and animals those are the best that you can keep but then for the color and and the and the and the and the and the and the hair uh we don't penalize okay because you you can improve on that but what if uh the fat contribution body uh uh body the size and the body uh confirmation those are the critical areas that you have to look at it now can you dispel a myth for some people don't lose your train of thought yeah a lot of people think just because a doper is not a hundred percent pure black head yeah and face yeah because they have some brown around the neck yeah that it can't be a doper no the dopers you allow the the head of the black to go up to the shoulder not beyond the shoulder but on the shoulder and on the knees of the animal and the front other areas they should not be so big black spots but we also have a doper which is completely white a white doper but that one is in kenya we have only one farmer who has imported from south africa or otherwise the rest are keeping the black and white we don't want a white ear we don't want a continuous bliss we don't we don't need those ones those colors okay yeah it depends even the the the the feeding of the animal the condition now it is so dry yeah so even the color you cannot see well sometimes it is dull and you see it's brown but we we have the brown which is a brown of another foreign color you can see the foreign color if it is a foreign color you'd be away with it yeah okay yeah i saw you checking the teeth yeah you can maybe tell other people out there yes aging of the animal the animals just like us they have baby teeth milk teeth and they break the at the one year from one year and a half they start to break the two the gray yeah at one and a half to two years yeah then the second pair will come at four the another one at five another pair until the eight eight teeth are complete so that's how we age okay and when they start again to break then that animal is old so when you see your animals starting starting to break you curl them you sell them for meat okay because it's easier for them to die when they cannot feed well wow yeah how about how you can be able to grade the doppers because you talked about the pures then you talked about the pedagrees as well how will someone get to know about that yes we have a breed standard yes where we follow the breed standard we we drew it from the south african one we grade into three areas in three yes the first one is foundation you have to come to have a foundation and then when it is registered with the kenya study both when you the offspring of those foundation foundation you get a pure breed and then you cross a pure bread and a pure bread you get a pedigree a pedigree and a pure bread you get a pedigree so that's how we grade we grade up to but what you see you look at the animal you an animal can go to this stage of pedigree but because of those faults it can even be a curl wow it can be reduced to zero yeah and what causes that was cases yes you were we we say the ram is the half of your flock always true so when you when you when you are going to select rams you must be very careful translation guys you cannot wear an armani suit with a pair of sneakers so if you're going to spend the money to get quality use you need to be smart you need to save your money you need to have a quality ram or else you're just wasting your time yes because you can have the best use with the with a suspect ram and you're going backwards instead of moving forward i agree on that even the the animals you can upgrade animals even from local yes yeah and then you get a better a better average yeah so you always when you are selecting be very very uh careful on the ram ram is half of your flock wow and the lamp is your money oh all right a really good drum okay ah you know if we had a ram around i could have told you but uh like a man if you look at man um the the chest is bigger yeah so even the big chest the ram has to have a chest and the lower on that on that side and the ewe is the opposite it's just like a woman the woman has the hips and this side is a little smaller so those are the features when you see physical okay physically physical but also uh when at the ram you look at the testicles and you look how that how they drop and you can feel it if they are pulpy it's good you and that's you have good good good good uh off springs there okay so you take care of the ram oh wow yeah wow that is really amazing that's great and of course for people who go outsourcing for this ship in the market it's not advisable it's better for you to go to their to the reputable farm so that you can get animals with with records yeah that is the best thing and you as a buyer you have to have some basics you need to know like i've shown you undershot yeah yeah animal here don't take undershot animals don't take animals with weak legs uh they have to have strong legs and the mouth also they have to be proportional so there are some areas that you can even not miss out for yourself but you can also see good animals very good animals look at the eye and even the judge when he looks at it but if there's no production there's no need to keep it sell it for meat wow yes a farmer let us be honest even people when they come to buy from you sell animals that are good that is true yes not you are selling the rejects you are the rejects you go to the market for me but if you are selling to a farmer who is going to breed please please please farmers look the best and that is you you that is that is your name but if you if you if you sell bad animals you tarnish your name and no one will come and your family wow that is that is truly the gospel guys when it comes to being honest having integrity because let me tell you if you've been following this channel we always preach that you know your brand is what people say about you you're not in the room you don't want to be that person i think oh you know i fooled this farmer because because of that's quick money you get that quick money it could be a lot of money but by the same time when that person gets to their farm and they test the animal and they find out the animal is sick or they find out the animal is not performing or you tell them oh this is a 75 pure and it turns out to just be a 50 50 basic breed you are tarnishing your reputation and in the world of business you can never put a premium on your name on a good brand that is truly priceless so again thank you so much i don't want to add something please very important uh aspect in farming okay keep records yes because records will tell you even when you are selling you know what you're selling yeah and you can show even your farmers this is this is what i'm selling this is from this animal you can show and you can show them because that's what you do you can show them and even weighing them and they know that they are getting getting weight they are they are they survive they're spinning in the family so that that one will just sell it yeah so the records are very important yeah yeah wow that is amazing i know you've been really doing sheep farming for a long time how profitable is it maybe it is profitable how for us now rams we are selling the cheapest ram is 40 000 k and that's about 1.1.2 million shillings roughly yeah and when you go to the market and when you go to the market with animals like this you get this animal sells very fast at good prices even maybe 8 000 10 000 12 000 15 000 when you go with your local breed you are going to get 5 000 4 000 wow so that is you you're you're making money with these animals yeah they really sell because they grow fast and they you get return wow and they weigh more they weigh more yeah that is really so true guys i really appreciate the judge coming here is also going to issue us the certificate so just mind you're going to get only the ones that make the grapes of course the ones some of them we shall also take them for commercial but at least we shall have them for meat since they really grow faster but we shall definitely share with you guys our records in case you come and buy from value farm you're going to get really the best of the best because we are the we are here with the best people in kenya on ground who have been doing this for a long long time we really appreciate you so much and we hope you can come to uganda one time when our training center is open you'll come and train the farmers out there you will teach them more you shall have shows like they do in kenya because they have shows here for the for the dopers for the sheep so that we can also you know step up our game in in uganda that's what we need for all our farmers out there this is the first step we've taken as value farm but we definitely hope for the best and of course with all your support if you haven't already please go and check out our social
