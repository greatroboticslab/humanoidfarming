Growing Tobacco Pt. 1: Germinating Tobacco Seeds

Howto & Style
 Welcome back! This week I got something cool. Something that I haven't been able to find since I moved here. Something called tobacco seeds. Check these out. Those are tobacco seeds. As you can see they're very tiny. They're like dust. There are these pods and then inside of the pods there are all these tiny tiny tiny seeds. So today I'm going to show you how I plant tobacco seeds and get them to germinate because the tricky part about growing tobacco is actually getting it to start. It's not growing it. As a plant it's easy to grow. It grows like a weed once it gets to a certain size. It's the first bit when you plant them and the care required there that takes all the work. Later on it's not hard at all. So I have my seed tray here and the seed tray has already been soaked. The thing about tobacco seeds is that they like some light to germinate. You can't just bury them in the ground and expect that they're going to come up. They're kind of a surface germinator. So you don't want your tobacco seeds to get planted in deeply. But the problem is they'll dry out if they're right on the surface. I'm going to show you how to get around that. What I do is I just sprinkle these little seeds carefully like you're putting spices on a cake. I've never put spices on a cake but this is how I would do it if I was going to put spices on a cake. I would just sprinkle it like I'm sprinkling tobacco seeds right now. You just sprinkle them over. You really can't even see them falling on the ground here. Probably even if I zoomed in you could see it. So I'm not going to bother. But you just dust it across the surface of the seed tray. And I'm getting probably many more seeds in here. And there's probably like almost enough seeds here to plant an acre if you got every seed going. It's ridiculous how many seeds are in one of these little pods. But I'll sprinkle the seeds all across the surface here. And so I've got some in every little section. kind of pat them in. You don't really need to do that. But maybe I'm a little neurotic. Maybe I like to always get my hands dirty. Then I'm going to take plastic wrap and put it over the top to keep it moist. This will just help kind of create a little greenhouse effect. If I had a big clear plastic bag I would use that. Probably instead it might be even better. But this will just kind of help keep the surface from drying out and killing my plants quite so quickly. And you don't want to do this in the sun. I'm in the shade here. But this will help keep it a little more moist inside. I'm just going to set a couple of little things on top. We want the sunlight to come through. But we also want the water to stay in. So there we go. When these germinate I'll bring you back for an update. Once they germinate they put their roots down in. Then they're fine. You just take this plastic wrap off. You don't want to leave this because you'll kill them. But this will keep it moist for now. When they start to germinate then we can take this off and we have to water them very carefully. Because any little bit of water we could dislodge them and hurt them. But they'll put their roots down into there rapidly when they germinate. And they're going to be fine moisture wise. You just have to do this for now. It's going to take two weeks or so for them to come up. Maybe 10 to 14 days technically. So we'll just kind of watch and wait. Germination temperatures usually in the 80s will get you there quicker. And we're in the 80s every day here. So they ought to be coming up pretty quickly. And of course I'll follow that. Now you might say, David the good, why are you growing tobacco? Well, I kind of like tobacco. I mean, I don't smoke a lot but I like some good tobacco. And I don't think the tobacco that is sold commercially is really any good for you. If I want to smoke a pipe, I don't want it filled with all kinds of toxins. I think tobacco is well enough on its own without you throwing in 3,000 different commercial ingredients or whatever horrible things they put in it. So even if you don't smoke, it's not a bad idea to grow tobacco because if civilization collapses and you have tobacco, you can get the addicts to work for you. I mean, you could just like make them your slaves. You're the tobacco king? Yes, they'll all be your slaves. You ever see somebody who's trying to quit smoking? Yep. Yep. You can give them a little bit of tobacco. Hey, dig that fence for me. A little bit of tobacco. Hey, compost my enemies for me. You know, it works. I wrote a little booklet on growing tobacco because I used to grow tobacco back in Florida. And if you're interested in the booklet, it's like a buck or two for the download. I can't remember, but I'll put a link to it in the description and you can check that out. It's a, it's a booklet from beginning to end on growing tobacco at home. And it's the survival gardener's guide to growing your own tobacco. I think you'll dig it. Anyhow, thanks for watching. We'll come back for updates, as I said, and we'll see how this experiment comes to pass. Until next time, may your thumbs always be green. Warning, this product may cause mouth cancer.
