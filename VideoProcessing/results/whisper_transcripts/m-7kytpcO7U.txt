 this mower is just bloody brilliant i love this thing it is fantastic it just works you know other than when you break off a rock guard and start taking stuff apart and have no idea what you're doing because you never changed a sickle section before today it just plain works i have mode oh i suck at math almost exactly 100 acres by the time i get this hay down and i'm not going to try to guesstimate how much of this field i've done uh but we're i don't know a third of the way through this property if i had to guess maybe not quite there'll be about 100 acres almost exactly 100 acres knocked down with this thing and so far so good i really haven't had any problems with it i've plugged it occasionally going through uh that wire grass i talked about that um the reel stopped turning on it yesterday because the tension was too loose so you know big deal five ten minute repair but generally speaking the son of a gun just plain works and that's amazing that is the single most valuable thing in a piece of farm equipment in my opinion and it's also the hardest to find because if you especially if you're buying used stuff no one takes care of anything there are no exceptions it just doesn't happen so you're kind of always buying problems to some extent but this there weren't that many problems with it just a bunch of little stuff and hopefully saying my prayers here that this thing keeps going hopefully it just keeps going but you know i can cut it almost five miles an hour with this and honestly a lot of those guards are kind of questionable to get wallered out by the sickles going back and forth a bazillion times a lot of those are pretty questionable and other than the i don't know maybe five now that earlier mechanic steve and today i put on this thing all those sickle sections are pretty old and still to push almost five miles an hour like 540 rpms on the tractor pto is like 4.7 miles an hour in the gear that i'm in and it seems like a really good speed i got no complaints man this thing is awesome i'm probably gonna regret saying that i hope i get through the rest of this but since i've spent basically five hours running around and jacking with this thing i'm going to uh eat some dinner as i'm mowing i was planning to stop i was planning to stop and eat but you know in light of the aforementioned i think i'll just drop a gear or two and attempt to eat this could be kind of messy but i'm already a mess so whatever you you you you you you you Thank you.
