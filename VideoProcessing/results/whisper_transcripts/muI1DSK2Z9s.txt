 Often referred to as the cultural hub of commerce for modern society, the Fortnite item shop has been a roadmap for minting totally impractical symbols of status into cold hard cash. Backed by the only stable cryptocurrency that is V-Bucks, this beacon of online exchange has been the best thing to happen for traders since the invention of Benedict Arnold. But just how does this gaming e-commerce store owe a great deal of its success to the farming practices of the Iraqi based ancient Mesopotamian society? As soon as early civilization figured out which plants they could eat without dying, it changed everything. Societies could now settle in small towns and cities instead of following around animals aimlessly. As the Mesopotamians were the first to figure this out, they quickly began to refine their farming practices, developing tools and irrigation practices that created excess food for their populations. This made urban lifestyles sustainable and the city itself a permanent fixture of civilization. This was of course reflected into Epic Games Fortnite in the form of the urban behemoth that is and was Tilted Towers. When Tilted Towers was introduced in 2018, many players flocked to the city for its higher concentration of good items and its promise of combat opportunity. This created a demand for Fortnite skins, as greater player interactions in urbanized warfare settings drove players to purchase skins in order to show others that they weren't a noob. This consistent voluntary urbanization in Fortnite created the golden age of Tilted Towers from 2018 to 2019, where Epic Games saw its highest item shop purchases. When Epic Games removed Tilted Towers in 2019, the revenue saw a decline, as without their cultural capital, the players were too spread out and there was no method to quickly spread ideas. Therefore, Fortnite itself began to decline. Without the successful farming practices of the Mesopotamians, it's very likely humanity would not have been able to urbanize and the Fortnite item shop would not have had a bump in revenue from the creation of Tilted Towers.
