 Grow shelling peas in a container from seed to harvest. I'm sowing progress number nine, which don't get very tall, making them ideal for containers. Space them about an inch apart, then simply poke them down into the soil. To make sure we have good germination, water deeply, bury with more soil, and then mulch it all over to seal all that moisture in. Once they emerge, add some sort of trellis like the standard tomato cage so that the pea tendrils have something to hold onto, which helps keep them upright. Soon you'll get flowers which turn to peas, which will quickly thicken up nicely. Once sufficiently plump, it's time to harvest. Simply peel the shell back and reveal the perfect row of peas in a pod. That's how easy it is to grow peas in containers.
