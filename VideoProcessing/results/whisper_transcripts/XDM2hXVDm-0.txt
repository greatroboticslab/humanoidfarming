 I firmly believe there's a very good reason people are so deficient in magnesium nowadays. When you have food that is growing in soils that are so depleted, then of course the produce is going to be lower in vitamins and minerals. Soils are so depleted nowadays because farmers are now practicing monoculture along with all the heavy chemical use on the land. So when your soil is rich in organic matter, only then is your food going to be rich in nutrients.
