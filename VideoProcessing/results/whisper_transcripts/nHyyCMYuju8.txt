 I'm Lisa Norton, I'm from the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. I'm working on sustainable grazing systems. Grass is our most common habitat in the UK and there are farmers who've realised that they need to do something differently because current systems are not sustainable. We need a much more diverse system that can withstand drought, can withstand extreme rainfall and keep producing food in a sustainable way into the future. So I'm working with the Pasture-Fed Livestock Organisation and I was interested in whether or not aspects of their practice actually result in much healthier ecosystems. And if we find evidence that what they're doing is really beneficial and sustainable then we can look at how we can translate that for other farmers so that they can take up similar practices. So actually home growing cattle on grass and systems that are rich and diverse may well be a very good answer to some of the issues that we have around intensive cattle management. and make cows find the allường for could造una androller will find out that as well. As you can hear Einstein is your first importation garden and another economy is a laboratory a very sustainable way intoundy. Yeah so thank you. Quite a bit. Thank you. That's the Mark's dad for me it's very effective. Okay for me. Let's forget to learn how we eat well and relax. Oh yeah I'm walking! First we're walking! I'm walking! Bye! See you! See you!
