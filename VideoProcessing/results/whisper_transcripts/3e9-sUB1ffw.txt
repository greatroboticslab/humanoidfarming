 Doing something different just for difference sake is not my idea of smart gardening. But doing something different that actually benefits my soil and benefits my garden, well, that's a different story. Crop rotation is on a lot of gardeners' minds at this time of the year and for good reason. For starters, it's the time to do it. If not, at least start thinking about it. As well, right now is when we hear about it the most and how good it is for our garden. Hi, I'm Jeff from the Ripe Tomato Farms. Welcome back to another episode of the Garden Quickie, the show where in two minutes or less, we're all about being good for your garden. And today's episode is all about that crop rotation. Specifically, what is it and why should we be doing it? What are the benefits? Hey, time short as you know what is, so let's dive in. So what exactly is crop rotation then? Well, think of it as a revolving door of new plantings. By definition, crop rotation is a gardening practice whereby different crops are planted in succession in the same area over several seasons. More simply, crops, once they're harvested, are rotated out for new ones instead of planting the same ones over and over. Great, that's an easy enough concept to understand. But why do we do it? How does rotating crops benefit our garden? Although the pluses are many, the advantages of crop rotation can be broken down into five main benefits. It enhances the structure of your soil, boosts its fertility, prevents the concentration of unwanted pests, reduces weed growth, and finally, it can increase your yields. Pretty good reasons to rotate your crops, right? Because different plants have different root systems, at different depths, with different nutrient requirements, the soil is never put through the same rigors during a crop's life cycle. The heterogeneous nature of rotating your crops lessens the chance of erosion and washing the nutrients from your soil, improving it with every planting. A small amount of effort for potentially huge gains. Much like checking out the next episode of the Garden Quickie. Thanks for watching guys.
