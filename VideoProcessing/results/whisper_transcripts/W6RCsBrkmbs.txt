 June is a dairy month in Northeast Wisconsin. While the industry evolves with the changing times, the heart of dairy farming remains the same. The pride of being able to carry it on in the future is a big thing, and I think that we're all proud of that, to have been here for six generations and to see it move forward, hopefully. Elna Farms in Algoma is a six-generation family farm. It's just blowing up. I mean, I started out with 18 cows, then it went to 40, then 300, and it's getting bigger and bigger. 25 years ago, Elias handed off the operation to his three sons. Now with 2,500 cows, the owners say the key to advancement is moving with the times. Technology, I mean, in all aspects. I mean, all the different things, you know, like the stuff with the cows, the collars, you know, like the Fitbit, the technology in the field, using the GPS and all of that. How far it's come is unbelievable. We have a holding area, and they come into the holding area, and they'll funnel themselves in one by one because they want to get milked. And then they'll come in, and there's a chip reader on their ear, and then there's a board that reads what cow is going on which stall, so we can track how much they're milking and what every cow is doing. Fairview Pastures in Denmark says you can taste the difference. I really like the grazing, so I drink my own milk, and it's cool to taste the differences, whether they're coming off a pasture or whether they're being fed inside. It's interesting to kind of get that unique side of a small dairy farm, where a large dairy farm is hard to be able to graze and do those other practices. Wavernick tells me it's getting harder and harder to keep up. If you're not willing to either catch on in niche markets or just improve the efficiency of the animals as far as, like, genetic-wise, taking care of them, it's going to be a really struggle to keep up in the current markets. It's part of life, right? No different than cell phones coming and computers coming. It's going to happen, and we need to go with it and grow with it and adopt it.
