 I feed the horses. I help with the cows. I pay showers. These siblings work together on their family farm in South Georgia. Everyone is involved from the oldest member of the family to the youngest. It takes everyone to make a farm go round. You'll find 10 year old Addison, the oldest of the long children, taking care of the family's horses and working the produce stand. I restock the vegetables and stuff that we have up at the barn. She feeds her horse peanut hay, which despite its name, isn't actually made from peanuts at all. It's actually like a different plant, but they just call it peanut hay because the plants in the peanut family. Her tasks don't stop at just feeding the horses. She has to groom them too, especially before like it rains because sometimes if you there's like dirt and it rains, you can get rain rot on your horse and sometimes it gets infected and it can be really serious and like cause a really bad infection. And before you saddle them, you also have to groom them so the saddle and the south had doesn't rub with the dirt because that could be really uncomfortable. There's something called the hoof pick where you have to pick up their feet and pick inside so that like they don't get any stone bruises or anything when you ride. We feed them in the morning about seven o'clock and in the evening around four or five. Scratch it over there, the gray and brown one. Eight-year-old Wyatt spends his time with this outspoken herd. The cows are more afraid of you, especially the calves, but they are actually pretty cute though. You can't resist their smiles. I need help. While they do graze on the grass in their fields, Wyatt also feeds them mineral. Because healthier and more nutritious than the grass. Now I can tell a boy cow from a girl cow. You see how the girl cow shaped are? And the bulls have a lump under her head like that and then like a fur coat like that. Kind of like a lion. Somehow I wonder why they move. There's a bunch of big softies. I'll bark no bite. I will keep my shoulders up berries. Five-year-old Warren loves to pick red berries on the farm. But they're green too. But that means they're not ready. With over 15,000 plants per acre, Warren has his work cut out for him. Strawberry loose. It's important for them to be involved so they can have a respect and understanding of the day-to-day runnings of a farm if they choose to do it themselves one day. Their mother, Kelly Long, says there's so much to learn on the farm. But the most important thing she hopes to teach is from manufacturing the seeds to the trucker that brought the bags of seed to the farmer, to the farmer who looked after it, to the harvest crew, to the trucker again that got it to the grocery store. It's a whole network of people. Stuff doesn't just come from the grocery store. It comes from farms. And it's very important to know where your food came from to know that someone grew it for them. It just didn't come out of the grocery store.
