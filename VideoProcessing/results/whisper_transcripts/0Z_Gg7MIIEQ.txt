 This is why you need to try layering for mango trees. It's simple, fun, and anyone can do it. Ready to grow your own mango grove? Let's dive in. Layering is a clever technique where you encourage a branch to sprout roots while it's still attached to the mother tree. First, pick a healthy, flexible branch about as thick as your finger. Gently remove a small ring of bark about 2 inches wide. Wrap moist sphagnum moss around the exposed section, then cover it with plastic wrap to lock in moisture. Secure both ends with twist ties. Check it weekly, make sure it stays damp. In a couple months, you'll spot roots poking through. When there are plenty, snip the branch below the roots and plant your brand new mango tree in a pot or straight into the ground. That's it. Easy, rewarding, and soon you'll have more mangoes than you can eat. And then you'll have more mangoes than you can eat. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it.
