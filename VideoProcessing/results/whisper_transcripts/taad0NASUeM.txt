 Hello and welcome or welcome back to the channel. In my last few videos I've offered a bit of backstory about the places I've lived and how three years ago I wound up here in Ireland but I still haven't talked about what it's actually like to live here so that's what we'll look at today. Now originally I was gonna do this as a list of pros and cons but you know life isn't always so cut and dried so instead I'm gonna share my observations on 12 different aspects of life and I will time stamp them if I can figure out how to do that and remember these are just my opinions based on my personal experiences mostly from living in the Connaught region of Ireland or the West and I share them in good faith and with a bit of good humour so please don't take anything too much to heart I mean no disrespect to anyone and of course everything's relative so do bear in mind that I'm thinking mostly in comparison to the UK although I'm sure these things will ring true compared to many other countries too and one final thing to bear in mind I live out in the sticks and like any country rural life is often a world away from big towns and especially a capital city as always I will try to be as fair honest and objective as I possibly can but perspective is everything so please bear those things in mind throughout the video okay let's start with a big one housing and let's go outside because it's a beautiful day when we moved here back in 2021 finding an affordable countryside home was a major pro for us our dream of rural living was far more attainable here than in the UK I think the gap may have closed somewhat since then but there are still some rural bargains to be found if you want to live in the countryside what I've noticed is that it's almost like there are two different housing markets there's a very genuine housing crisis here with an acute shortage in the towns and cities and from what I can tell that's down to a number of factors converging to mean supply can't meet demand and it's especially sad when you see so many empty properties for example there's a town I sometimes drive through on the way to work and on the outskirts there are lots of these half-built properties and housing estates I believe they were started in the early 2000s during Ireland's Celtic Tiger era and then basically abandoned after the financial crisis and in the town centre lots of closed down businesses again multiple factors I think then in rural Ireland you see lots of older buildings unoccupied for years and slowly crumbling some with amazing potential just sitting there waiting for someone to give them some love our house had been on the market for well over 10 years before we came along and I don't know why there's nothing horribly wrong with it I guess no one else wanted to live out here so based on what I've seen I'm honestly not sure if I would recommend Ireland if you're wanting city life and apart from anything if you're after that big city buzz there are plenty of better options out there in the world no offense Ireland take it as a compliment however if you're looking for a slower quieter pace of life in the countryside and you have enough capital to buy somewhere and do some renovations on an empty unloved house and make it your home then Ireland could be a good choice for you okay so what about the cost of living it's all very well buying a house but how much does it cost to actually live here well this is where I would say things pretty much balance out between Ireland and the UK with some things being noticeably more expensive and other things a lot cheaper so the good news for Brits is that there is no council tax in Ireland and there are a few other costs that work in you favor too water it's free yep you heard me right no water bills here there are occasional murmurings of charging people for water but it seems the Irish people won't stand for that and parking is usually free or cheap so what about the more expensive stuff well that's pretty much everything else so groceries tend to be more expensive here because most things are imported Ireland has one of the highest alcohol taxes in Europe so be prepared to pay more for your booze if you like a drink and electricity and petrol prices are all generally higher than in the UK things like car and house insurance tend to be more expensive in Ireland then you've got things like international postage that can be quite pricey and there can be unexpected custom charges too now that's a lot of stuff and it does add up taking everything into consideration we find our monthly living costs balance out to pretty much the same as the UK maybe slightly cheaper for us here in Ireland but remember lots of this depends on your own specific habits and lifestyle I came here to be a social hermit I have zero social life by design and that saves me a lot of money just where we fees are armor essentially last year extraordinarily cash it's a handful of more junk I had to use from buying because most of my products and links I tend to be more谢谢 and 해�unts as well maybe like just gas contra rome howola who leaks and texts give them this information even really sales In fact, I'd say there's less consumer choice in general. Of course, that's always the case when you're living in the countryside, but the thing is, most of Ireland is rural, and it's kind of difficult to explain, but somehow rural Ireland feels a lot more rural than rural England. New drinking game. Take a swig every time I say rural. It just feels like in England, you can pretty much get anything you could possibly want, and in Ireland you can get most of what you want, but maybe not quite so much. Let me give you a few small examples. The UK has 22 full-size IKEA stores. Ireland has one. It's in Dublin, and it's nearly a three-hour drive from here. These weights and kettlebells? Couldn't find them over here. I do try to buy local, but my nearest sports shop is nearly an hour's drive away, and they just never had these in stock. So eventually, I had to order a delivery from Decathlon, and there are only two Decathlons in Ireland, one in Dublin, one in Limerick, as opposed to the UK, which has 50 Decathlon stores. So these are just quite silly, trivial examples, but just something to be aware of. If you're heavy into shopping and consumerism, Ireland probably isn't the best fit for you. Oh, and don't expect every business to have a website. And if they do have a website, don't expect it to be up to date. It seems to be all about Facebook pages over here. And when it comes to local businesses and services, many of them close for up to an hour for a lunch break at midday. So again, these aren't necessarily complaints. They're just observations on their part and parcel of living a slightly slower and less consumer saturated life, which in my book is a good thing. But if you do move here, be prepared for a few months of paperwork hell. Now, this seems to have sparked some contradictory conversation on previous videos, with some people saying they know the struggle all too well, while others insisting that Ireland's a breeze compared to fill in the blank. Obviously, I can only speak from my own experience, having lived in England and a few different countries in Asia, which is a pretty mixed bag in terms of bureaucracy and infrastructure. And I honestly thought having lived in some, shall we say, underdeveloped countries, I thought after that, I'd seen it all. But honestly, those first few months in Ireland, I've never known anything like it. Just simple things like setting up a bank account and utilities turned into a way bigger headache than expected. Maybe we were just unlucky. It often felt like the left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing. Call centre staff, as friendly as they were, seemed unsure on how to actually process things like they'd not been adequately trained in how to do their job. More than once, application forms mysteriously disappeared. More than once, our names and details were misspelled, rendering documents invalid. And at least once, letters got lost in the post. And we'd end up going round and round in circles, trying to navigate glitchy websites and conflicting information. Now it all got sorted in the end, and it's been fine since then. But that initial setup was quite stressful. If you've ever read any Franz Kafka or seen that film Brazil, you'll know what I mean. But you know, maybe you'll be luckier than we were. Okay, there's another big one we need to talk about healthcare. Ireland works differently from the UK. It has a two tier system, public and private. And public healthcare is available to everyone who is a legal resident of Ireland. That's through the HSE, Health Service Executive. But unlike the NHS, it's not always free. Healthcare is means tested, considering factors like income, savings, dependents, financial commitments. And there are slightly different laws for people over 70. So if you fall below a certain threshold, you'll get free healthcare, but you might wait a lot longer for medical appointments. A lot of people in Ireland opt for private health insurance, which comes in various levels to suit different budgets. And this gives people flexibility. And from what I understand, Ireland places quite a strong emphasis on preventative medicine with free screening programs for things like cancer and heart disease. So hopefully, you know, issues can be caught early and lives can be saved. Okay, let's talk about all things to do with cars and driving. Oh God, that's a bit wobbly, isn't it? Oh, dear. I've just bought this, I've just bought this new holder. That's, that's really bad. I'm sorry. Bloody flimsy piece of sh- Okay, let's talk about all things to do with roads and driving. Generally speaking, road quality in Ireland is pretty good from what I've seen. I believe the government's invested quite heavily in infrastructure over the past decade. So you find these lovely long stretches of smooth, modern motorway. But then you get these narrow little country lanes where there isn't enough room for two cars to pass. I know a lot of people hate driving these roads, but in a strange sort of way, I much prefer them. And as long as everyone's looking out for each other, you'll almost always find a little space to tuck in to let someone else pass. And as for traffic lights and roundabouts, I couldn't tell you where the nearest one is. 10 miles away? 30 miles away? I don't know. I hardly see any. The towns, of course, do get horribly congested. But remember, these towns are separated by many miles of countryside and the roads are noticeably much quieter than in England. And that's lovely. But do bear in mind that because so much of Ireland is rural, everything is more spread out. And we do love the open spaces. But you know, it can be inconvenient. Public transport isn't great here. So you pretty much have to drive everywhere. You'll be really stuck without a car. That's been a challenge because I'm actually in the process of overcoming a driving phobia, which is a whole other video. And I'm sorry to say, Ireland, but this is my cue to have a bit of a grumble. And it's about the driving. It's way too fast. Slow down. I promise you I'm no slowpoke crawling along at 10 miles an hour. I tend to keep just under the speed limit and yes, a little slower to adapt to road conditions. But please, for the love of God, stop with the tailgating. It makes me fear for my life and yours and can send me into a panic attack. And it's weird because behind the wheel of a car, everyone seems to be in a mad dash. And yet in every other respect, the pace of life is much slower here. And I'm going to use that to segue into another... I was going to say grumble, but it's not. It's more of an observation from the perspective of an uptight Brit who's been brainwashed to place a high value on punctuality. It wasn't until I moved to Asia that I realised that our attitude to time is really cultural. And anyone who spends more than a few months in Asia comes to know about Asia time. And guess what? It turns out there's an Irish time too. So people do tend to be more relaxed about time here. And mostly I love it. I think that's a good thing. However, if you're from a culture that values punctuality, be prepared to feel frustrated on those days where you just want to get stuff done. You're going to have to let that go if you want to keep your sanity. And another thing, the Irish are great communicators face to face, but don't expect a call or a text message from your workman to tell you he's running an hour late. Speaking of tradesmen, they are in short supply, but they are out there. You just have to hunt for them. Don't expect to find them listed online. It's all about word of mouth. So you're best asking your neighbours or even in a local hardware shop. People here are really helpful and friendly. So don't be shy about asking. And if you yourself are a skilled tradesperson and you're looking for a nice quiet life in the countryside, Ireland could be a great choice for you because there's a high demand over here. A few people have asked about employment opportunities out here. And of course, that's a really tricky one. It depends on you, your industry, your experience, your location. So I can only speak in very broad generalisations. And I would say to anyone moving anywhere, unless you have a nice chunk of savings in the bank, don't move without a job to go to. Now, what I can tell you is in Ireland, there are some major skills shortages such as trades, construction, engineering, IT and healthcare. So if you're in any of those fields, you might have an easy time finding work. But those jobs will probably be located in the bigger towns and cities where housing is a challenge for financial and arguably ethical reasons. And if you're entrepreneurial, then great. Just bear in mind that the lower population density means lower footfall. You might just have to try a bit harder to promote yourself and put yourself out there. And that's best done through local integration, which is no bad thing. And on that note, let's talk about the people because really, it's the people that are the heart and soul of any place. So, you know all those stereotypes about the Irish being really friendly and warm and chatty and down to earth? It's all true. It's absolutely true. Of course, you always get a random bellend knocking around wherever you go. But by and large, in my experience, the people are fantastic. Very down to earth, very easy to talk to. In fact, stopping for a chat when you bump into someone you know, takes absolute priority above and beyond anything else. Which is lovely, but can circle back to that thing I was saying about valuing time. And finally, let's talk a bit about the weather. Because do you know what? The grass really is greener over here. Literally, they don't call it the Emerald Isle for nothing. And that, of course, is a result of the climate. Which goes something like this. Rain, wind and rain, rain, sun, wind and sun. Rainbows. Rain, rain. Rain. Rain. And that's all in one day. Fairly accurate description. Am I right? Especially for West Ireland. It's notoriously changeable and unpredictable. So yes, we get this beautiful, lush, green, green grass and ferns and moss and ivy and algae and mould and damp. And before anyone tells me again the Irish climate's the same as England, tell me this, why did all of our tools start rusting within a week of getting here? Tools that are decades old, older than me, never shown any sign of rust before. We're here one week and that humidity is killing them. But you know there are things you can do to limit the damage and you can make sure you wear the right clothes and as I always say life's about compromise and trade-offs and whilst personally I would prefer a warmer drier climate, for us the pros of living in Ireland still outweigh the cons. So to wrap things up, Ireland is beautiful and welcoming and like anywhere it has its ups and downs. The cost of living can be higher in some areas but a bit cheaper in others. It's a slower pace of life with space to breathe and time to chat. Some aspects of life might test you patience from time to time, it's not all pots of gold and rainbows, but if you are looking for a slower rhythm, Ireland might be a great fit for you. Especially if you fancy breathing new life into an old, unloved property and making it your home and if you feel you have something of value to add to your local community. So I hope this gives you a clearer picture of what life's like in certain parts of Ireland.
