 This is a mobile chicken coop that doesn't have a floor and moves automatically to a new location every day, powered by solar energy. This way the chickens always have access to fresh grass and insects to feed on. It also prevents the accumulation of manure and gives the chickens some extra exercise. Small farmers have also adopted this method with homemade mobile chicken coops. These chickens must have a great life.
