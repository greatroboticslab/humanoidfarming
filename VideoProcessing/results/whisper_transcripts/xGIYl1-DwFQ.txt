 How much corn have you eaten the past couple weeks? 1,219,000. We've got a special Mr. Beast Burger corn. A pickle. This corn just looks a bit messed up. I don't like this type. Alright, we finally found corn that he didn't like. You've been doing all this trying to get me to not like a single corn. You got me, I don't like it. This is not corn-tastic. No, it is not!
