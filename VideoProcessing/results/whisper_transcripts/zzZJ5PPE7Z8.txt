 Hello happy gardeners. I'm in my shed right now because it's raining. It's wet. I'm all wet as well. I didn't take my hat which I regret. I'll probably get ill again but I did manage to find some potatoes, beetroots, radish ready to eat, something fresh to help my immune system obviously and my wife's. My wife is a bit ill right now so I just want her to get some nutrients. I just want to talk about that because everyone is just oh yeah let's plant vegetables but what vegetables should they plant and you can plant anything you can obviously but I would recommend like root veggies which are beetroots, onions, potatoes. Those are vegetables with long shelf life that you can sow over winter, over months in a cold dry place and they are packed with like iron, potassium, vitamin c, other minerals that you need daily. Obviously you can buy this in shops as well but the thing is after seven days of vegetables being out of the ground you lose 40% of nutrients which is a lot. So I encourage everyone who can to grow their own veggies in the garden in the pots or on allotment. If you don't know where to get allotment there is like council sites as well. I don't know you can pay 50 pounds for a year and you have your plot and on one plot you can grow loads of them loads of vegetables. I've got right now peas, beetroots, radish, uh, korsets are growing, I've got loads of strawberries, uh, what else? I've got lots of herbs as well like lemon balm, rosemary, um, oregano, uh, normal oregano and portuguese oregano, um, what else? I've got lavender as well. I've had a flu for the last week or two. I had juice from a red cabbage, lots of juice and I felt so much better. So when you can go and look for like allotments or other places and now literally I can help you out with growing, with planning your plot, what and when to grow. I've got uh, pdf files on my website that I will put link down below. Uh, they cost only five or eight pounds depends which one you buy. I'll make more of them. Uh, there's calendar, there is a place you can take notes. They are so cheap right now so buy them now. Please do that for yourself, for your family, for your kids, uh, make yourself healthy, get those nutrients that you need. I hope you have a good day and let's grow. I'm gonna make some more videos on how and what to grow, what nutrients are in which vegetable or fruit. Stay healthy, stay in tune, even though the weather is bad, you can still do a lot. So see you then, bye. And this is what I managed to harvest today. A bowl of potatoes, three beetroots, radish. I'm gonna have good dinner today. It's raining, it's wet, I am still here. I'm having fun. There's always something to smile about, everything is growing. As you can see, look. Potatoes, courgettes are way bigger now. There's more here. The courgettes, sunflowers, radish. Broad beans. I had already half of the leaves for my juice. Beetroots, loads of peas in there. And strawberries. And this is my big composter. That's... I think it's over a year worth of compost. So I'm gonna put that in two months or three. Just to refresh the soil so the vegetables can have some more minerals, nutrients. I'm not wasting anything. I'm not buying compost. It's easy to make it yourself. Like... The other day I was cleaning, clearing all that up. So I've just crushed it. Throwed it in the composter. At least five, no, six wheelbarrows. That was a lot. Jump on it, water it, or you don't even have to water it because today's raining. It's wet. For a minute it's dry but it's gonna rain probably again. I'm gonna have to go home in a minute. If you need any ideas on what and how to grow, let me know. I'll put link down below to my guides. They are worth a lot more than I price them for right now. So get them now and have fun. See ya.
