 Plant Life Cycle. All living things have a life cycle. Life cycle is the stages of development and growth living things go through. This is a life cycle of a plant. Soil Seed. The seed gets planted in the soil. It needs sun and water. Germination. The seed grows a little sprout. Roots and stem. The roots grow steep and the stem pushes its way through the soil. Siddling. The plant grows leaves and grows towards the sun. The sun helps it produce food. Pollination. The full growth plant produces flowers that will be pollinated by animals or wind. These flowers will produce more seeds. The sun is essential for all living things and plays a role in each step of the life cycle. Thank you! Like and subscribe for more videos!
