 One of the key things to be able to have an effective forage program is you need to have a good stand of your forage crop. If you have a good stand that's going to help you minimize weed pressure, it's going to help you improve yield, it's going to have less soil erosion, that kind of thing. And so it's good to have that really strong stand. And so with most of our forage crops, things like tall fescue, orchard grass, alfalfa, the stand that you get at the beginning when you plant it is going to be the best the stand is ever going to be. It's not going to thicken up really over time. And so I thought we would talk a little bit about just steps to having successful establishment. So I am going to share the screen with you a little bit and we are just going to talk about principles of forage establishment. Okay and so here's the first thing I think that's important to do is to plan ahead. You can't just decide on the spur of the moment, hey I think I'm going to plant something that can lead you to some problems. So for instance, you know if you're going to plant something make sure ahead of time you're killing all the perennial weeds because it sure is a lot easier to kill a lot of the weeds out there if you're not having to try to save some of the grass. The other thing too is you need to make sure you take a soil test and particularly pay attention to your pH because we can't correct pH overnight. So it may take you six months to a year to raise the pH if you have a pH that's a little bit low. So we want to make sure that we have a pH that's approaching 6.5 at least above 6 prior to planting. So that's the first thing to do is to make sure that you plan ahead. Okay the second thing is to make sure that you plant into a good seed bed. We want prior to planting to remove all of the existing vegetation so that when we when that seed begins to germinate and emerge through that soil we we have no competition for it. And so it might be that you know you work the ground up so you plant it conventionally. Use a disc and everything, work the ground up, kill the vegetation that way, you know, cultipack, get to firm that seed bed back up and then plant into that so you could do it conventionally. Or you might do it through a chemical means, you know, spray with a herbicide something like you know glyphosate which is going to kill everything, remove that vegetation, and then no-till drill into that. But this is the type of situation we want to seed planting into. Something where there's no competition for many sort of weeds. The third thing that's going to be important is to make sure you plant the proper amount of seed. And as simple as this sounds, you know, when it comes time to plant you need to make sure that whatever seeding machinery you're using, whether it's a broadcast seeder or a drill, whatever it is that you calibrate it to make sure you're putting the right amount of seed on. You don't want to, you know, seed really heavy on the first half of the field and then when you check and see how much seed you have left, all of a sudden the second half of the field you're putting a light seeding rate on. It'll mean that that one into the field is not going to have maybe as good of a stand. So make sure that you calibrate the drill or whatever seeder you're using to make sure that you're putting on that exact amount of seed per acre that you need to be putting on. Here's the fourth thing, is to make sure that you plant at the proper depth. Because the thing you got to understand is that when you put the seed in the soil and it begins to germinate, from the moment that it germinates until it breaks through that soil surface with a leaf so that it can start to, you know, capture sunlight and begin to photosynthesize, it's depending on stored energy inside that seed. So the smaller that seed is, the less of that stored energy that it has. And so if you take some of our small seeded, you know, species like the clovers and if you put them too deep, they may germinate and begin to grow, but they run out of stored energy before they break through the soil surface. If that happens, they're not going to, you know, to be able to emerge. This is just some work done a lot of years ago, 1939, that showed these different forage species and what happened to the emergence of these plants when they were planted at different depths. And what I want you to notice is some of these really small seeded plants, you know, white clover, alfalfa, if you plant them an inch deep, maybe only 40 or 50 percent of that seed is going to be able to emerge. If you plant them two inches, none of them come up. So it's very important to pay attention to your seeding depth. Most of our forage crops need to be planted somewhere, you know, about a quarter of an inch deep. That should really be what you're looking for is just barely under the soil surface, getting good soil to seed contacts, but that way when they germinate, they can emerge through that soil very quickly and begin to get established. And then the fifth thing that we have listed here is make sure that you plant at the proper time. There are appropriate times to plant every forage species and if you plant them, you know, too early, you may be planting them into dry conditions, you know, conditions where it's too hot for those things, and establishment may not, you know, be very successful. Or you could plant them too late, so there's not enough of a growing season left for them to get established before they get into, you know, to the dry part of the summer or maybe into the winter. And so if you have any questions about that, we have a publication that's called our Forage and Field Crop Seeding Guide. It's PB378. You can find this on utbeef.com or you can just google this, you know, and you can find it. It lists all our forage crops and it has what the seeding depth should be, the seeding rate, the seeding date, and it helps you be able to know kind of what you can do for a proper establishment. And so these are the things that we have listed. It's something terribly complicated, but here's what happens is if you pay attention to every one of these points, you increase your chances of having successful establishment. But if you start cutting corners and maybe you don't plan ahead or maybe you plant, you know, a little bit late, something like that, what that's doing, it doesn't mean that it won't be successful, but it's increasing the chances of having some sort of a problem. And anytime that we get ready to plant something, we want as good of a stand as we can possibly get right there at the beginning. And so it means paying attention to details.
