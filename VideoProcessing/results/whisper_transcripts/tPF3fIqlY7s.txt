Education
 Biological and Agricultural Technology Management is one of our newest curriculums that focuses our students on the technology needed in the agriculture industry. With this four-year degree, the student will be a technician that will be capable of taking a business approach, a practical approach, and a technical approach to problem-solving in not only agriculture but all the related industries of food production, fiber, clothing, all other support industries. The Batman majors bridge the gap between an engineer and a technology user like a farmer or a machine operator. I chose this major because I wanted a hands-on experience and I wanted to be in a major that I felt like I could make a difference in the agricultural world. I think this is the one that I felt I could make the biggest difference in and get the most hand-on learning. One of the great things I would say about this major and the faculty is that they're so willing to help you. Coming from a small high school, big classes can be overwhelming and can seem scary but your Batman classes they're so small. It's so nice because you get to have that one-on-one with your students and your professors. Biological and agricultural technology management really creates a family-oriented environment and it feels like all the professors really want to help each individual student.
