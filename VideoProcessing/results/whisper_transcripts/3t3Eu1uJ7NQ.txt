 welcome to Pigeon River farm doing farming right I'm Robert Brown the owner of Pigeon River Farm thank you for viewing good evening in tonight's episode we're going to discuss pastures pasture damage and how to solve that problem reconditioning a pasture that's been damaged is a real challenge a lot of different ways to go about it we've had challenging years one of our pastures it's about 15 almost 20 acres we have had multiple years of very heavy rain in our region last year was extreme flooding doing significant damage to this low ground the fact last year we were limited on how many days we could actually put the cattle out on that area of pasture and even a limited amount that we had them out there over the last two years and few events that happened like the frost coming out of the ground early and so on caused significant damage in certain areas so I had to figure out how to reconcile it I was able to get in last August and use a deep tooth ripper to get some drainage going then we ended up having to approach it this spring while the deep tooth ripper project worked extremely well them areas actually where the lowest areas were drained the best and the higher areas end up being the surrounding areas end up being less trained so that technique now we are not tiled and I have a concern about tiling and dumping nitrates even though we produce very little nitrates but dumping the nitrates into the beautiful pigeon River so it's one of my concerns so deep tooth ripping into the soil at approximately 30 inches does not allow the water to infiltrate into the rivers I have two rivers on the property one on the far east and one basically just touching on the north so the methodology that we've applied here is using a deep tooth ripper to bust up and it's interesting it's not only a tool to break up a hard pan that's formed from the cattle but it does another thing I can know exactly where the pasture is compacted based on the load of the tractor it's incredibly obvious how if the tractor is pulling hard I can actually hear the engine labor I know I'm pulling into something very heavy it's it's interesting how quickly you can pull out of that and there is virtually no compaction at all there's other methodologies for soil density testing and so on but this works very efficient once I have the pass dug anywhere from five foot on center all the way up to about 30 foot depending on the concern I have then I've taken in actually a relatively old implement it's basically just like a compactor it it has spiked wheels on it and I pull a drag behind it and it breaks up the soil on top without doing any significant disruption to the soil just the areas that I ripped that cleans them up makes a a nice bed for seeding but not like a normal one where you would plow up and condition so I've done none of that I've just simply really we're just kind of getting rid of the moisture allowing it to get down to the ground deeper in turn we ultimately bring in a no-till drill so I bring in a no-till drill to plant in a nice literally there's around 20 different species of plants that I'm putting in there most of them are more set up to grow you know a wetter wetter environment so we no-till in you'll notice I use on a relatively big tractor and it almost looks like a little toy behind but believe it or not it pulls very hard the the cutters on you're really baking that you're pre conditioning the soil and make it a trench for the seeds to be dropped in and then filling it in behind and that's without doing any kind of eros erodible damage to the pasture so this methodology works really well and real pleased with the method here the drill is actually provided by the county the county of Wapaka Wisconsin makes it available to farmers and ranchers in in the county here for a very reasonable cost it's a kind of a cost share type product so again we don't have that forty fifty thousand dollar investment in purchasing it but yet we have access to a excellent piece of equipment as you can see the the drill works really well and then shortly I'll hopefully the one of the upcoming episodes I can show you the all this effort we put in see how it benefits the cattle so thank you and have a wonderful evening hear from thearparp ak-show
