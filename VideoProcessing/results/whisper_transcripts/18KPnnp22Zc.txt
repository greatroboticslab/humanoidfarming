 Hi, I'm Margaret, Margaret Smith-Aker-Pearl, the manager of the Lockford Plant Materials Centre. The Plant Materials Program is really involved in developing technology to support resource concerns for NRCS in California. Soil health, of course, is a huge one because soil health is so important. When we add organic matter to soils to build them up, we're increasing the structure of the soil, we're increasing the nutrients in the soil, and we're increasing the water holding capacity of the soil. This is field six of the Lockford Plant Materials Centre. We actually have eight fields. We have 100 out of 106 acres. In this field right behind me, you'll see a demonstration planting of different cover crops that would actually potentially be used for forage for dairy producers. So this includes annual rye, some oats, some clover, and some pea in different combinations. And then right behind me where you see all those little signs and the water moving that we're using is an adaptation cover crop trial. And in there we're testing 37 different cover crop cultivars and we'll be tracking their biomass, their growth, and the time in which they mature in this location. So we can suggest different mixes for the farmers. And this particular adaptation trial is being carried out by, I believe, eight different plant material centres around the United States. When it comes to soil health, you know, the results you come up with have to be local results. So we can do work here. We're in the middle of the Central Valley. That's very helpful for our farmers. You're on the other hand. Let's see. Let's see. Let's go along. Let's see. Let's see. So let's see. I oops. Let's see. Okay.
