 I want a lot of you to let you know that we do practice a lot of soil conservation practices. That by meaning we're trying to make sure our water runs clean off our farm when we have heavy rains. We had two inches of rain overnight. It came pretty fast here earlier this morning. And you can see now our water is running very clear down our grass waterways. We do have recycled concrete grates that we purchased from a company that we can cross over even if it is raining if we have to get through the farm. And it doesn't disturb our roadways and holds everything stable. Just kind of one of those things we're always trying to do is keep our topsoil here. We have everything planted now. All of our cover crops are in wheat or rye. We have also planted some radish. So we're trying to figure out a lot of these things here. And it's just really nice to have the whole farm nice and green here in early January. GAS
