 Did you know we use 99% of a cow, but only 60% of that is meat? First off, they'll use the hooves and horns and shampoos and conditioners. Their hair is used in plaster, insulation, brushes, and air filters. Their blood is used in cake mixes, dyes, and medicine. If you like anti-aging cream, play tennis or an instrument. Cow organs are used in those too. They'll even use the bones to make charcoal, glass, and refined sugar. And finally, things like baseballs, footballs, and candles are all made from the skin of a cow.
