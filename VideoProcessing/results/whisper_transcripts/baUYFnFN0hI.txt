 These are the five things you need to know if you're starting seeds this year. Whether it's store-bought or home-mixed, you definitely don't want to skip out on your seed starting mix. This is your little seedling's home for the first few weeks of life. We want to moisten the mix just enough that it clumps together, but not so wet that it's dripping with water. And those roots will need some wiggle room to grow, so let's only pack the soil in with just a few tamps of the pot. And as a rule of thumb, most seedlings should be planted twice as deep as they are big and then covered back up with soil. To increase our chance of germination, I like to plant two seeds per pot, and if they both germinate, they can be thinned out later by cutting the less desirable or carefully transplanting one to a new pot. And for those teeny tiny seeds, I place them right on top and cover them with a light layer of seed starting mix. Most seedlings like to be nice and warm to germinate. Placing them on a heat mat will help keep them nice and cozy. We want to start off by watering from the top and then covering with a humidity dome, but just until germination when we'll switch to watering from the bottom tray from here on out. And once those seedlings pop, time to get them under some grow light. Now I've tried all kinds of lights, and you really cannot beat the simplicity of a good shop light with some adjustable chains. So let's get a jump start in our growing season, and don't miss the caption, I've got a few more tips.
