Howto & Style
 Grab a fresh corn and peel it. Then throw it on top of a pot with salt. Boom, like this. In about a week, this thing will become... Yeah! How crazy is this? Boom! At this point, you can just pick out each sprouted seed carefully. Plant this gently in its own pot. Water it. Let this grow a little bit longer. Then plant it outside and grow some corn.
