I wish we could give some of this rain to the folks out in the Midwest and all the way out west with the forest fires. But today I am going to pick up an item that I've been wanting to get but not actively searching for. But my buddy who also works for me here and there when I need him sent me a text and was like hey do you want to buy this item? And I looked at it and it's kind of exactly what I wanted and it's not very expensive so I'm going to pick it up and tow it home. I'll show you what it is here in a few minutes. Music Music Down here in Kennerdale, Pennsylvania. In the Allegheny River. It's a good river for kayaking, canoeing, floating. Music Music Music Music Music If you can see these elk on this farm down the road. There are some monsters in there. There is a cow running. Look at this guy right there. right there. Huge. Look at all those racks. Beautiful. They got some monster elk there. It's right down the road from us. All right, so here's what I picked up. A little hay wagon. I don't know. It appears to be like a 12-footer. Nice little running gear. Toed real nice. 30 miles an hour on the way home and wasn't swaying real bad. Seemed pretty good. It's got rough cut lumber on here. It's pretty sturdy. Benches. It'll seat about 15 people. I'm going to power wash it up and put some either cedar water sealer or just regular Thompson's water sealer on here. Just look it over and make sure it doesn't need anything. Clean it up and get it ready. So when we have a party or have people over, we can do hay rides. So it's set up perfectly for that. I've wanted to get one for a while. Just wasn't wanting to spend a lot of money and wasn't actively looking. So when my buddy was like, hey, do you want this for 500 bucks? I was like, sure, sure thing. It's like exactly what I was looking for. All the wood's pretty solid on it. Nothing's, uh, it's all pretty secure. I like it with the walls on it too. So you don't have to worry about the kids as much. So yeah. We'll power washer up. Painter. Good to go. Corn's coming in good. Uh, birds and that are, are hammering on the outside rows, but some of the ears are kind of small here and still growing. We got about another month left. Thanks for watching. Uh, please subscribe and, uh, see what's going on. We got the, uh, equipment sheds going to be getting built soon and we'll be harvesting here in a couple months. I got, uh, another big equipment purchase coming up. I think it's going to be, uh, a brand new skid steer. So stay tuned. We're building a bridge, all kinds of little projects around the homestead. Till they feel turn those roads, let the sea, let's go. We got a plan to the end of the road.
