 Hey everyone, Lauren here and today we're going to talk about subsistence farming in Arthurdale. So the Arthurdale homestead community was part of the back to land movement which involved a lot of urban to rural movement and it was a way to help them out of poverty and teach them how to care for themselves and be self-sufficient. So the whole foundation of Arthurdale was subsistence agriculture which meant that you would be able to grow crops to take care of your family and then any surplus crops you had you could sell at the co-op general store or you could can. So canning was a very popular and important activity in Arthurdale. The American Friends Service Committee that we talked about in a previous video helped the homesteaders learn how to can, how to store their crops and their goods and so they utilized that knowledge a lot here in Arthurdale and they would store their extra, their canned goods and extra crops in their root cellars. So the Wagners had smoke houses and root cellars which are basically just sort of like above ground basements. If you are getting bored cooped up at home you can take our driving tour around Arthurdale and you can see how many of these root cellars are still left standing in the community. Okay, let's receive them, let's see. C to the end, because the tornado is already the same as one of us, the yeahシス we will not take our driving vehicle store. To a Airbnb that we will run trade you by other people you want toания. All the world is already heard about, scallop, or do the curd server running the way across flipping and by acknowledging that there are a lot of potential among others. Thank you.
