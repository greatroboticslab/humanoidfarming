 Trees are valuable elements in agricultural systems because by their nature they lend themselves to making connections with other plants, animals, people, soil, etc. One reason trees are the main components of natural ecosystems is their ability to benefit all forms of life and contribute to natural ecological stability and fertility. A well designed agroforestry system can provide multiple benefits to today's farmers. It can increase yields and allow for year-round production of marketable crops. It can improve the soil quality, minimize erosion and decrease the need for fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides. In agroforestry systems, efficiency is very important. Farmers want to generate greater returns with fewer inputs and less waste. Farmers in the tropics are fortunate because most crops, except yam and breadfruit, are produced year-round. By raising a number of crops in a multi-story agroforestry system, you can maximize your potential earnings while making the best use of the resources at hand. control of all crops in a 2.5 years of oil and carbon У in front of energy.
