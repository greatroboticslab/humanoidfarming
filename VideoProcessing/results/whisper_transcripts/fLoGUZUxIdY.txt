 Hi, my name is John C. My name is James. I'm an agronomist and a home gardener. Today I will talk about how to keep soil healthy for plants and the environment. Just like you and me, plant roots need to have air, water, and nutrients to support a normal life. We think of soil as being solid, but it can be compacted under foot or vehicle traffic. Plant roots grow poorly when soils are compacted. Air, water, and nutrients can be difficult to get when the open pore spaces roots would grow into are closed. The best way to protect against compaction is prevention. In a garden, making a dedicated footpath is an ideal way to minimize compaction where plants grow. Here, garden boxes provide a convenient way to work the soil, prepare the soil for planting seeds or transplants, remove weeds, and harvest the produce without ever having to step on the soil. This footpath helps direct traffic through the garden area around raised beds and helps people know where to step and keeps them from walking where plants are growing. If designated footpaths around raised beds aren't an option, you can use a longboard to walk on and distribute your weight while you're taking care of the garden. Plants that are raised for crops and fields respond the same to compaction as plants that are raised in a garden. You'd probably never think about driving heavy equipment over your garden soil, but this happens in crop fields all the time. Crop producers need to use heavy equipment to efficiently prepare the soil, plant seeds, remove weeds, and harvest their crops. Each time equipment is used on a soil, a soil can become a little more compact. In many cases, farmers use tillage to loosen the soil to increase the amount of air and water a soil can hold for the plants. Just like we saw with the garden, crop producers can take important steps to prevent or limit the amount of compaction taking place. One way to reduce compaction is to select a designated wheel track in a field to follow when driving through a field. This limits compaction to a small area of the soil. Another is to make sure to use the right type of tire. Add more tires or use track treads to distribute the weight of equipment over a greater area. An important point to remember is to stay off the soil with equipment when soil conditions are not right for supporting them. Soils with a lot of moisture are more likely to be compressed than when they are drier. Once a soil is damaged from compaction, deep tillage may be needed to open up the soil for plant roots to move through. Often, a hard compact layer can be found in gardens and in fields beneath the zone of soil where shallow tillage is used. The compact layer is sometimes called a plow pan. If the pan is too compacted, plant roots will not be able to move through it and cannot get access to the moisture and nutrients deep within the soil that can sustain the plants during the growing season. Just like the signs that remind us to stay on the trails and parks and public gardens, for the health of the soil and the plants growing in them, staying on the path is important to garden vegetables and crops in the field as well. So remember, healthy plants come from healthy soils.
