 This spring I bought a 50 acre farm located in central Iowa. Now it needs a lot of work to get back into full production. So first things first I bought a John Deere 4020 and disc. Now of the 50 acres only half is currently being farmed and so I brought my excavator and Brother Skizier down to help clean it up. For the next two weeks I'll be burning, clearing, and disking to get the farm to grow new life. The goal is to reclaim as much ground as possible and grow corn this year. We'll see how it goes.
