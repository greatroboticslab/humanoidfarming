 Well hello YouTube. Grandpa's been raking today. He's got that field and part of this field done today. He's going to get majority of not quite all of it raked today. I'm here delivering him a drink as he asked. He's using the wheel rake on 1066. I think the original plan was going to be wheel this rotary rake. I think the original plan was supposed to be rake on the 806 but he wanted to drive the 1066. So that's what it'll be I guess. So the hay is right here is a thin spot. It's crunchy. It'll bale. That's what we're going to do. It's going to get bailed today because it's got crunch and it don't glisten when you twist it. I mean I've only got one hand right here but it don't glisten. It's dry. It's thin enough to see that it'll be ready to dry. Bale. So that's the thin spot. That stuff right there is thicker. All the other fields are thicker. Thickest field is actually either the hill right there or across the train tracks. But is your bale good tonight? I don't know if I'll get any more raking video. I know I might get a bailing video. I'm not sure. I might not be here. I might have other places to be at that time but we'll see. Just go watch a tractor. It's what I like to call tractor therapy. Sit there. Watch them drive across the field. I wonder what gear he's running in. Probably low 4 I bet. Seems slower than high. Getting sunburned. Well I got sunburned yesterday then on the end but getting more sunburned. It's good. Well hello YouTube again. I think I was holding some raking yesterday. We're in the driver's seat now and we're on the 30 acre field. Dad bailed some of it yesterday. We didn't do all of it. It's kind of difficult to drive a whole phone over my shoulder. Basically my sight picture right here. Middle of the tractor area on that windrow. On the right side of that windrow. And so that it's flipping that windrow also along with this stuff. So that's the idea. I don't know how well it's working. Working just fine right now actually but yep. Trying to look at the V-Rank. That'd be the easiest but I don't. So. That old blender just purr. Purring. That old blender. We got y'all some backwards footage there. I don't know how well that works. But. Here we encounter the round bail. Before we hit the neighbors please. There we go. Around the bail. We're driving. And right here. Pretty much that wheel right there area. Gets me. The bold wind. All right. We would be doing this with the 806. But PTO clutch is either out of adjustment or going out on it. So. Whenever you're like going down the road or PTO disengaged. It's still turning at an idle. So. That's why we're using 1066. And. Kind of like it. Giving me a canopy. Because it's going to be almost 90 today. Feel like we'll probably get up there. And today is Tuesday. Tuesday. We cut on Saturday. We cut Saturday. We cut Saturday. Ted Sunday. Rakes and baled a little bit yesterday. Moved bales. Now we're raking and baling the rest today. Which is Tuesday. And grandpa. It's just a two-man show today. It's just me and dad. Grandpa's out. Replanting 200 acres of beans. And dad found another 15 acres. And needs replanted. Dad tried to spray today. But the wind got pretty fast. Can't do that no more. Tomorrow. Might be more planting time. But we're looking Thursday. By rain. And right now. We're talking about possibly two and a half inches Friday. That would be bad. Especially if I have a tractor show. That I'm going to be sitting at. On Friday and Saturday. Thank you. You may call me the dial in 2020. No way to go. Solomon the market! We don't have anything to go.好啦! À勝負! I possibly can... Somebody was going to pit이라 still. I can't wait. I can't wait. I'll put the mini zoom on. To me, byeни Thank you. Thank you. Come around, come around, go straight, wheel on the windrow, middle of the tractor on the right side. Doing what it's supposed to do. So I might get some more footage here in a minute and I might get some baling footage. Folks, you can tell it's hay season. I'm moving hay. One neighbor is moving hay and another neighbor, you can't see his tractor right now, he's also moving hay. So it's in the air, it's in the moon. So I'm moving hay. So I'm moving hay. So I'm moving hay.
