 All right, come on down. Come on down. Let's get together. Let's get close. Let's get this thing started. Let me see here. I got my notes right here in front of me. A little bit of housekeeping. You all ready for this? Oh, yeah, you are coming. The last guy offered $20 for everyone that would come down. But I just got a $100 bill if you want to split it. If anybody has change. All the way. If you come all the way, that's a bonus. You get a bonus. I'm hoping that we can have a little conversation and have time for questions. And we'll get through this in about 40 minutes, hopefully. I'm just here to tell a story. This is story time. I'm Will Crombie. I'm a farmer and a filmmaker. And a father. And all sorts of other F words that we don't need to get into. Maybe we will. Maybe not. So I'm just here to tell a story about this journey to a regenerative system on my family's land. And honestly, I'm just lucky to be here. And I'm sure as all of you are. Yes. Let's move the mic. Just right here on the soul patch. Just right there. Direct live into you. How's that sound? Yeah. What's going on with this feedback? Check. Check. Check. Is it... The other microphone is off. Alright. Here we go. Things are interesting already. You came to the right session. We're shaking it up. That was B4. Now this is B3. You have to promise to laugh when that slide comes up. How are we doing now? We got feedback? Much better? Okay, sorry about that. It happens. Alright, let's get back on track. So who was here for that last session? Was anybody here for that last session? That was really exciting, huh? Isn't that great to have an elder in the room that just has so much wisdom to share and is so connected to the land? I don't think I can top that. So let's see where we can go with this. Alright, so I'm not the greatest farmer in the world. What's with this mouse picking my nose here? Hang on. But I got a story to tell. I'm really passionate about the soil. I'm really passionate about the earth. This is a story of family lineage. This is a story of discipline and just community building and just building a relationship with the earth. And to be honest with you, the real reason I'm here is because my mentor and business partner wasn't available today. So you're stuck with me. This is Reynaldo Hazlip Marroquin. He's the CEO and co-founder of Tree Range Farms and kind of our guru in this world of regenerative poultry production. He's indigenous from Guatemala. He's got a lot to share his wisdom from the jungle all the way to Minnesota and to today. And we're the crazy chicken people. Chickens and trees returning chickens to the forest because they're originally a jungle fowl. So that's a big part of my story. And here's I put this picture here because, you know, here's Rehy explaining something to me. I just wanted to illustrate that he is he is a great mentor to all of us. And we got a team here of people that have helped build this. So Tree Range Farms is what we call the company. Tree Range Chicken is is what we're creating. And we're just trying to do something better, trying to put the livestock back on the land, you know, get tree crops incorporated in farms. And, you know, we use that word regenerative. This is silvopasture, if anybody's familiar with with silvopasture. And we the four of us built this company. That's me there. That's Jim Kleinschmidt and Tony Wells. And there's Rehy there. The four of us pooled our family's money and and we started this company. I'm just lucky that I had land and some skills in media and marketing. And we came together and and this goofy guy got to stand in the back for that photo. So we've also worked together to create Regenerative Agriculture Alliance. That's a nonprofit that we formed in support of of this mission to to grow regenerative poultry production in the Midwest and beyond. And some of the team is here. Mare A. So we have a booth actually just right at the top of the staircase to the right. Right. So that's perfect. I don't know. Why don't you guys stand up and and turn around and give us a wave? So there's other crazy chicken people in the room with me. I don't feel alone. Is anybody anybody raising chickens? We got chicken farmers. OK, great. Cool. Let's see. Where are we going from here? So this is my wife, Carly Crombie, my daughter, Hazel Rose Crombie. And that's my baby boy, Arrow, on the left there. We are our family that is blessed to live on the land at the organic compound. So, like I said, this is a story of of community and that's the secret. So if you wanted to maybe if you're looking for a more practical talk, you can you can go now because that's the end of the story. Right. Building community and building culture. We couldn't we couldn't have. Farming without culture. That's agriculture for a reason. So I'm I really believe in, you know, community and the family farm and collectivizing ourselves and and working together to to grow this regenerative movement. So this is a picture of our garden. You can see two of our chicken barns back there. We've planted thousands of hazelnut and oak and sugar maple. And we've been gardening and experimenting with permaculture for many years. And. And as you know, agriculture, you know, this is this is far removed from a lot of people's lives. It took me a long time to to to find the garden and then to find tree crops and to find permaculture and agroforestry and all of that. I wasn't interested in it as a young man. And luckily, in my early 20s, I started to grow that passion and we started to get together on the land, bringing friends and family out there. And thus was born the organic compound. And a part of this story is also acknowledging where we came from. That's why I really appreciated that last talk. This guy from Montana. What was his name? Mike. Was it Mike? Anybody know? Remember his name? It's like Durango or something. But anyways, he came from Montana and was talking about the importance of indigenous people and the use of fire and how that has influenced land. So. Duraglow. All right. Yeah. Mike Duraglow. It was great. It was an inspiring talk. And. And he did a land acknowledgment as well. I think we listed off a lot of peoples that used to live in this in this on this Turtle Island. I'm from southern Minnesota. So the folks that were in my region were the Wapakute. And I live in a town called Faribault near Faribault. Our farm is near Faribault. So I just thought that this was important. This whole this whole land acknowledgment is really important because the story of of regenerating and the story of of the organic compound isn't isn't about me. It's about, you know, it's it's about this the seven generations. And the way that I look at that is, you know, the the folks that came from came before me and the folks that are coming after me and the ways that we manage land and the ways that we have changed land and the direction that we're going is really important that we consider that. And we look at that as we talk about as we use this term regenerative and as we think about the future of farming. So. So. I just want to I just want to say thank you to the Wapakuta people and thank you to the people of this land and thank you to to my family and my ancestors and all of your ancestors and for the work that all of you are doing, too, and for you being in your seats here. And it just feels good. And it just feels good. Feels good to be here right now. What is it? 2023 already? It just feels so good to be here, to be in this room, to to be sharing this story and to be a part of history. And and I like to remember that our ancestors prayers, their thoughts, their actions, you know, good intention, bad intention, whatever it was. It was it was it was it was a thought that they had that brought us here that got us to where we are today. And and I think that it's important to acknowledge that. Think about that and and pave pave a way forward for the future generation. So there's a little little little dip into my ancestry. This is my grandmother right here. And I just love this photo because she's drinking that pure fresh water right out of the right out of the spigot. That's my great grandmother. That beautiful woman right there is my great grandmother. And these are like my great great grandparents on my grandmother's side. So that's Colleen Coyne was her name. And look at them. They got horses. They got wagons. That is not that long ago. You know, when you think about it, it's not that long ago. So the the farming and the agriculture scene that we look at today was just, you know, drastically different. 100, 200 years ago, and it's going to be drastically different. Tomorrow and the next day in the next day, and it's it's really dependent on the choices that we make today. So there's grandma sitting on the cow. There's grandma sitting in a pile of what is that? Does anybody know what that is? Yeah, pile of wool. You don't see that very often. Just hanging out in the dirt. Whoops. Hanging out in the dirt pile of wool. We got some sheep farmers in the audience, right? We got some sheep farmers. Isn't that just so great to see that pile of wool and just to think about how how folks used to manage land and how we used to we used to we used to do our thing. So there's another little bit of nostalgia for you. That's so it's Terrence Crombie and Colleen Cummins. They're the Crombie side of the family. And the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. That's Grandpa Terry and his daughter. That's me and my daughter. Just another photo to really illustrate and send home that we're all just people. Right. And and Terry was a guard and avid gardener and he started this greenhouse manufacturing company and he's a beautiful guy. And my mother's side of the family, the Bowers, you know, so German farmers, I guess it literally translates to farmer. They were settling, I guess there's a thing called the the German triangle and folks just really gravitated towards this area in the Midwest. And I guess my family. We're one of those. You remember phone books? Does anybody remember a phone book? So if you open the phone book in my county, the B section goes on forever because there's just copious amounts of Bowers. And they were settling in this area. Apparently that's a truck. That's what a truck used to look like. And that's my great grandfather. He was born in like 1876. Here he is dead in 1963. I was hoping you would laugh, but maybe it's too morbid. It's just just further illustrating, you know, where we are and where we've come from. Hang on one second. I got the dates here for these these aerial photos. I just got to pull them up. Here we go. 1938. This is this is my family's land in 1938. This is one of the original homesteads right there. This is what we call our upper field. This is our pasture. And this is the lower field. This is Prairie Creek. So there's a little waterway there. And it's really fascinating to me to to look at these aerial photos. This is the oldest one that I could find and just sort of wonder what they were doing and even wonder what was going on even before then. So this is this looks like maybe it's fall. They were tilling and and they were hanging down here. I was told that this is a peat bog. This was a peat bog originally. Here we have a picture from 1954. And if we keep progressing along 1964, you can see the lines got straighter. Look at that. The fence post got straighter. Mechanization came on a lot stronger. And it looks like they converted that lower field to to corn, which is really wet down there. So I know why they resisted it for so many years and we're just hanging it because that shouldn't that right next to that waterway that shouldn't be in an annual tillage and production. But machines got bigger and the times were a changing. So here we are in 2013. Fast forward 50 years. Look at that wood woodland now. All of a sudden the cows have been removed and the forest grew in its wake. And you can see that we continued year after year to do annual production on here. And here we are in 2016. That's our homestead and that's still in corn production. But this is the year that we took it over. We started the tree range farms business, you know, and we started implementing this this concept of regenerative poultry up here. We built our first barn. We started building our first barn. We have this line, this whole sequence where we have have had the plan to build these barns. So we planted thousands of hazelnuts on contour on this upper field and just straight lines here for the poultry production. And we were experimenting with, you know, deep mulch gardening and permaculture in this area. And the story goes on. This is a picture from 2021. You can see. Now we have tree crops. And if you contrast that with the 1938 photo. You can only imagine what this is going to look like in another 50 years. This this is going to be thick, a thick forest. And you can only imagine what it used to be. And to me, that's very exciting. I just love that culture. I love that history. I love dreaming forward into the future of farming. So fast forward to me and my family in the 80s, 90s and early 2000s when I was raised. Here's me with my socks and sandals and my frosted tips. There's grandpa. He was a dairy farmer. And mom and dad, they bought that land from from from Helen and Wilford Bauer. And clearly I didn't want anything to do with farming. You can tell by my attire. And and I was lucky to be raised on this site. And I was really lucky in my early 20s to get to rent it. And years later to purchase it and to now be part of that generally racial story stewarding the land. Here's some pictures of us building the homestead. Here's here's, you know, me thinking about slam dunks and Michael Jordan and, you know, riding my bicycle. You can't tell. But there's Tupac is on the back screen there. I got a little little bling in my earring. I wasn't I was a country boy. So, you know, we went mushroom hunting and me and my brother horsed around in the fields. But I wasn't raised as a farmer. But luckily, I made my way back to it in the form of a lot of black plastic wrap. But my my knowledge and the community continued to gather out there. And we continued to co-create and transition this land. We took on more more acreage. This is like three point one four acres. We called it our slice of pie. And this is where we started experimenting with permaculture. And you can see us planting like a three sisters garden and doing like these hugelkultur mounds on contour. And just, you know, keeping bees and planting tree nurseries and just gathering as a community on the land. And it's a beautiful thing. These are some pictures of us transitioning the land in 2016 to agroforestry. And here we are building our first regenerative poultry production production unit, this chicken barn. And this is when the trees were so tiny that we needed artificial shade. And this is our first barn where we're, you know, rotating the chickens under the tree crops or under the developing canopy that is. But we always had Rehi as an example, his history in the jungle and his his test site on his homestead where he already had a full canopy where this vision came from. Right. In the alleys, we're experimenting with garlic and we planted 2000 asparagus in between some of these tree rows. I think for like three years we were doing the garlic and really the biggest garlic farm in Minnesota. And we had just I don't know how we had no idea what we were doing. You know, like I said, I'm not a farmer, but we just did it. And I think that's the most important part of my story is, you know, community and just the collective power to work together and just move forward and progress. And we're married to the land. My wife and I got married on the land. Here we are. And what was that pasture is now forested thick with honeysuckle and buckthorn, of course, because from generation to generation, grandpa had his beef cows out there. Mom and dad were homesteaders, not farmers, you know, hunting and fishing. And their idea was to rip out all the fence posts and let nature take it back. But you know what happens when you just let nature take things back? A lot of the invasives come in. So now it's our job to bring goats out there. We've been bringing goats out there for the last two years. We've been we have a dream of working with the Dorper sheep with Wilbur here and, you know, bringing this back into a silvopasture kind of environment and helping to eliminate these invasives. So next generation, new new concepts come on like holistic grazing and land, you know, different concepts of land management, new invasives come in. And it's just interesting that generational perspective and it happens so quickly. And I'm really lucky to have witnessed this growth in my lifetime to have that understanding, to be able to pass down that wisdom to the next generation. So we're moving ahead. We're, you know, we're continuing to plant tree crops. We're continuing to raise chickens. We're continuing to bring on more farmers into the brand. Ray, he got his own farm. I think he's got 100 acres. He bought 100 acres, but I think it's he's since sold off some parts. How many farmers do we have in the network? 13? 13 farms? Somewhere around 13 farms raising, you know, regenerative poultry production, raising tree range. So we're making waves, you know, in this in our region to work towards something different. And we're building this brand and we're bringing people out there and we're talking about it. And here we are in the grocery store and in the restaurants and in the farmers markets. And here's some scientists coming out to do research. People are starting to get interested. And we're building this movement with the brand, with the nonprofit, you know, on my family's land. This summer we had a TV show come out. Zoe Bakes, she baked some cookies for her TV show on the Magnolia Network, which is really cool. And we're really blessed and honored to continue to have folks come out for, you know, concerts in the lawn and our garden gatherings. And we're really blessed to have folks come to our community garden and share this story. And look at, you know, this is 2016 we planted it. Now all of a sudden these hazelnuts are beasts and we're getting a yield. I brought some with me. If you want to sample some, come down here at the end and I'll let you try some of these hazelnuts. We're hand harvesting, throwing the best parties of your life, you know, the best time you could ever have. Get together and just grow food and harvest together and sing songs around the fire. I think we need to get back to that and get back to working with our families. And here's, here's little Hazel, my daughter. She's the next generation. What is going to be her story? You know, she's going to school me somehow. There's mistakes that I'm making for sure. There's mistakes that we're all making and there's improvements that we're all making. And, you know, we're just really lucky to be here. And I'm really lucky to have Hazel and to have this family land and have this team and have this vision. I'm lucky to have met, you know, a mentor like Rahi and other mentors in my life and to, to be sharing this story with, with all of you. And with that, I want to say organiccompound.org is our website. You can learn more about the regenerative poultry production at regenpoultry.com. You can also go to regenagalliance.org, learn about how you can plug into the nonprofit. And I encourage you to follow us on social and to ask your questions. How are we doing on time? How are we doing? We're doing so good on time, even with the mic snafu and everything. So we, how much time do we have? I nailed it, didn't I? No, I'm seven minutes fast. Maybe a little nervous and talking a little fast. I was trying to leave 20 minutes because I got a couple of videos that we could play. We could open it up to questions. We could line up and sample some hazelnuts. The video's ready to rock. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So let's play, let's, all right. So let's play this. There's a clip. There's a nine minute video. It's kind of a recap of what I just went through. But it's from the Savannah Institute. The Savannah Institute features, featured us in this partnering for agroforestry series. And it'll dive a little bit deeper into, and you'll be able to see it. And yeah, rock on. Let's do it. Hi, I'm Will Crombie. And I'm Carly Crombie. And this is the organic compound in Faribault, Minnesota. And we're partnering for agroforestry. We're really lucky to have family land that we're here farming on. We have 42 acres of mixed agroforestry. One of our primary crops is tree range chicken. So that's the brand that we raise regenerative poultry for. And we also have hazelnuts, oak, sugar maple, elderberry, and a bunch of other woody crops on the land. So our parents helped us overcome the, one of the biggest challenges to even implement agroforestry is land access. We were able to partner with our family and get the support to, you know, plant our dreams out here with these trees from the gift of land access and from Will's parents wanting to be able to work with us and to regenerate this little parcel of earth with us in those ways. And the other layer of our partnership is the fact that we have three other business partners that co-founded tree range chicken with us. So start up capital is huge to be able to not just be coming from one family's income, but those four partners really becoming pillars for the company and not having to be too much weight on just one individual. It was the first farm to scale up this concept of regenerative poultry production, which our business partner, Reynaldo Haslett-Marroquin has been developing and studying throughout his lifetime. And we've been a part of that journey of bringing about regenerative poultry production brand. So basis of our farm partnership story, our partnering for agroforestry is the fact that we had business partners that helped us get the startup capital. We had family land. And from there we planted it out, started building the brand and increasing the production and the agroforestry on our land. The food brand wasn't going to have vested interest in this land forever. Eventually the transition needed to happen to Carly and Will. So now we're taking over that lease and we're taking over the farm as as individuals, as farmers. Farmer owned instead of like business owned. So now we're going to be paying back the infrastructure. We're going to be paying back for the barns and the well, but at a much lower cost. It's a really good deal for us. So I don't know if there, if that's a model that other people could follow. If there's a way that farmers can partner up front with brands and with food businesses like we did. I think it's a really interesting partnership model. And I think that those are two key elements that hold a lot of people back is the startup capital or operating loans or, you know, a lot of people have to go through banks and then having land. So those two things have been such a blessing and a gift to even make this possible. Mm hmm. And we we weren't farmers like before all this. We education is another huge piece is like having the the wisdom and the education to implement some of these practices. And maybe part of it when we started off, we would have done different now, you know, being like five years in and learning as we go. But we've planted thousands of trees and sometimes now is better than later. So one thing that makes our partnership successful is that we had also done the work to to build a strong community found like our foundational community that helps support us in getting the trees planted when we did the tree planting and all throughout this journey over the last six or seven years. Especially during harvest time is like our biggest community event. And we really invite everyone out here to see the farm in full fruition and to help us harvest nuts. We're not mechanically harvesting yet. It's all by hand right now. So to have the community support support to even make this work is huge. Having a strong alliance with your local community and creating those experiences for other people to come out onto your farm and be a part of those harvest days and to get their hands on the land. I think it's really empowering for people to see themselves as part of the solution. They're very much like making a physical impact by the way that they're showing up. They're out in the field. They're feeling very included in, you know, the regeneration. They're very much part of like direct action. People feel good about that when they can actually be out there making a difference. And then you see the harvest and it only brings the community in closer each harvest. And some people are coming out here because they want to own a farm like this too. So they're getting that education. They're getting that experience. They're seeing the hands on aspects of the farm. So education is a big component of our farm. We're hosting the harvest days and garden gatherings and getting people out here on the land doing farm tours. Right. Working with like local organizations like the SFA and, you know, sharing our roots and just like organizations within our community that are doing the same things. And that's another like unspoken partnership, I guess, too, to talk about is just like all the other little hubs of people that are in your same community and with the same little niche of being like, oh, like, yeah, we're taking care of chickens or we're doing perennials. So just like connect with them and see which ways you can support, whether it's like sharing equipment or sharing field dates and things like that. Savannah Institute sharing our story. Regenerative Agriculture Alliance really fully supporting the regenerative poultry production by purchasing a processing facility. That's a huge barrier is the access to processing and access to the equipment and the machinery is a real gatekeeper for these kind of industries to flourish. So I think that that's like one of the biggest partnerships is like within for all of the little nuances of how to actually keep things functioning is shared resources between organizations or those kind of partnerships that really like nourish and help save capital and help save labor costs and everything. Like like like the elderberry de-stemmer. Not every farmer needs elderberry de-stemmer. It's like a one time harvest and you come out to our farm and use ours. Which we got through a grant from Kiss the Ground and then also the Midwest Elderberry Cooperative is was another layer of that grant was was the reason why we got the elderberry de-stemmer. So like the nonprofit partnerships are huge and not only just telling our story but equipping us and empowering and educating people. So there's that capacity to partner with the institutions and then the brands and to increase the production and to increase the diversity on the land because agroforestry really allows for so much diversity. So many different layers of enterprises can be established on a land like there's two women that keep bees on our property. We've rented an alley out for herb growing. We've rented our property out to other livestock owners and I just love to continue to create space for more diversity of partnerships on our land. Somebody could build there's space for two more barns and somebody could be managing that production or we could take that on ourselves. There's just with agroforestry there's just an infinite it seems amount of ways that people can partner on land to make a profit and to work together and I think it's really important that people do that. Especially the people that have the land access like people like us it feels like part of my responsibility and my duty to open that up and get get it at its full potential like I don't we don't have the carrying capacity to monitor or to care to steward every single square inch of this property but there's so much potential for our farming friends or for like our land stewarding friends or our herbalist friends to come and use these resources here you like utilize the community that's here. The space that's here the physical land that's here and available to be able to share the resources that we have is a really powerful partnership on our end to be able to be the ones offering something you know like your parents have been so generous to take care to take care of the land in the way that they are caring for it by letting us be their stewards and then for us to extend that opportunity to people is only going to benefit our community and our soil. And as as the agroforestry further establish itself the land only gets richer and the abundance only compounds and multiplies. самыйSome reason for becoming part of our culturalасть it shall not纏LAW, in mind  Farge Boat flipping Vilandos, I was the individual, ofNothing All right. Yeah. So how do we work together? How do we do this? How do we find a mic so we can ask some questions? All right, let's do it. So I can run around and pass the mic. So raise your hand if you have a question. Hi there. I just had to ask, given that you've leaned so heavily into hazelnuts, including the dedication of naming your daughter, what kind of genetics and plant varieties did you choose for the hazelnut? These are the varieties that are coming from Mark Shepherd. So they're the hybrid hazelnuts that he's growing. I have to ask if I've ordered from Mark, are these the controlled cross or the select cross? We have a variety of both, actually. Do you have any predation problems in the hazelnuts? Somebody eating them besides you and your harvesters? So, so just being in in the middle of corn country, I wondered that, too, you know, and I actually I hope that more animals show up and take their share. But the deer haven't been an issue with the hazelnuts. The the squirrels haven't been an issue. They're starting to show up. The squirrels are starting to show up. It's almost like barely any squirrels on my property, it seemed like. But the Blue Jays are they got wings. So they, you know, they they they found out real quick that these were some hazelnuts growing out there. And that has that can be remedied through a little bit of an earlier harvest. They're going to wait until it's brown and they're almost falling out there. But they're there, you know, they're waiting for that naturally. If we can just get ahead of them by a week, then that's not an issue. I may missed earlier because I didn't come in at the beginning. But what where do you sell your elderberries and how do you sell your elderberries? The elderberry production is just coming on. So we've we've been using it for a lot of home use. But if we were to sell it, we would bottle it and sell it locally, sell it direct for ourselves. And that's what we have been doing on a small scale. And I've been waiting for irrigation to really ramp up the elderberry production out there. The hazelnuts, we were really lucky. 2016 was crazy wet and they established themselves pretty well. The gopher population was was the biggest threat to establishment there. And the the elderberries. Yeah, like I said, I want to wait before I really scale that up to get some irrigation. So that's really successful. Maybe some bird netting. I've seen some issues. What's that? Sell it as a syrup? Yeah. Yeah. Bottle it as like a raw juice or or put it into some sort of remedy. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Where do you sell your hazelnuts and can you talk about the economics of it? The economics of hazelnuts. Yeah. Yeah. So as so we went all in with these sort of earlier breeds. Right. And we don't have mechanized harvesting. So we're kind of on that, the one of the crazy ones line. Right. But that's why we pair this with a diversity of of crops. That's why we have the chickens incorporated, because you can start to have that diversity of income from the elderberries and the hazelnuts and the chickens. And you can start to have it make sense. Now, my wife is a massage therapist and I'm a filmmaker and a marketer. We have our income stream. If we were to look if we were to look at hazelnuts as like just being like a sole hazelnut farmer, that math doesn't work today. In in in the Midwest, it's coming on. The development of these varieties is coming on. The equipment is coming on and we're sort of some of the the pioneers. But this is, you know, 50 volunteers out there just having a good time, having an experience. So we're in like the eco egg or eco egg in the what's the word? Eco tourism. We're in like the eco tourism, the educational realm with a lot of what we're doing on the farm. And I think that we could get there with value added. We've been we've been making hazelnut milk and then using the leftovers to create a hazelnut flower and and baking cookies with it. So my brother in law has a coffee company and and he's starting a coffee shop in town. So we've been doing the math like, OK, how many nuts do we need to produce to produce enough gallons of milk to start to supply like a like a cold brew with like local maple syrup and and are not milk in it for his establishment. And and the more we sort of explore that, it does start to make sense, especially if like our family was if if we still relied on this sort of free labor to harvest it, we could make we could make some money that supplements the rest of the money that we're making on the farm. If that if that helps you sort of think about that. But I wouldn't I wouldn't go all in on on hazelnut production without the diversity of having the chickens, other livestock and other crops and products. And it and and and I wouldn't recommend selling any of it necessarily just like wholesale. You got a value add and to value add, just like you're seeing in in in the mechanization of the farm. The value add relies on the community kitchen space and the equipment as well. So farming is such a big investment, right? And and to have and to make it viable is is really hard. And and and that's why we need each other. That's why we need my brother in law, who has the commercial kitchen, who can maybe and and has the coffee brand, who can maybe offset some of that investment. That's why we need grants that we can get the equipment and really build this industry. So I don't want to go too deep into numbers, but I would and I don't want to leave anybody unhopeful about hazelnuts because I'm one of the most hopeful about hazelnut production and value adding that. Yes, so when I've had chickens in a confined fenced in area, it seems like they just the soil that all the vegetation that just turns into, you know, dirt. Tell tell us how you manage that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So where's my laser? So we have a two part to two paddock system that we're using. And the birds that we're raising are around 10 weeks. It's it's it's broilers, you know, it's meat production that we're doing. So in any given year, we can run. I like to say three flocks, three or four flocks. We have 1500 birds in each of these barns, right there. They're actually on the land for six weeks because those first few weeks there, they're little chicks and they're still in the barn. So during those six weeks, let's say they spend three acre or three acres, three weeks on on. It's it's it's an acre and a half, right? So point seven, five acres, three weeks over here and three weeks over here or maybe four weeks over here and two weeks over here. Two weeks over here, however, it works out. The key is to pay attention to the regenerative factors of the land. It depends on your climate. It depends on how well established you are. And and if you're getting into trouble, you can always lay straw, spread some grain to sprout and you can always shift them over to the other side, move them quicker. What we do is we move the feed. We move the feed. So every morning I'm moving that feed to the next row. I'm not leaving the feed in the same spot every day. I'm shifting it. And it's like it's like chicken Tetris. You know, you're just do do do do do do do do do over that week or two. Over that week or two. Never had a problem personally with degeneration of the land. Never had a problem personally with being like, wow, this is we're burning this place out because we got too much heavy chickens. And we're lucky to be in Minnesota. We're lucky to have, you know, that climate and that rain. I mean, you could after the chickens are gone during that break period while the next ones are are just coming out. You could go out there a couple of days later. It's like you can't even find chicken poop, you know, so it's it works. You got to be a smart, crafty farmer. You got to you got to pay attention to the land, pay attention to the chickens and do the work to to mediate all of that, though. Yep. Hey, my question was about the if you have predator issues with the chickens. And I think now seeing the paddocks like I can see that as a fairly controlled environment rather than just a large forested free for all. So in that being a smaller paddock, do you struggle with any predator issues? So we so our farm is one example. Right. There are farmers that are are renovating. I guess that's the word or retrofitting current forested environments, not transitioning 100 years of monoculture like the way that we did. And and the whole goal and the key here is to create that overstory, that forested environment, because that is that is how chickens protect themselves and evade the hawks. Right. And it's kind of like my answer about like the squirrels and the blue jays. We haven't had a significant loss of chickens in our region. And as you can see, we're still establishing that canopy. We do have shade shade structures. The feeders have like a structure over it. So and we and we encourage people to plant like corn or sunflowers to to create an annual version of a natural canopy. I have witnessed once with my eyes. A hawk out there eating a chicken. And I have witnessed many times with my eyes an owl feather out there at night. But that's because I left a few chickens out. Like when I went up there to close the barns, there's a few that got into a habit of like sleeping under a bush or something. And so sometimes you walk out there and you go clap your hands, you know, and make sure everybody's in. And if you make sure everybody's in, you're not going to have an owl problem. You're not going to have many of the predators aren't going to be an issue because they're in that safe, confined barn at night. And when they're out there during the day, the one the fence protects them from the four legged. And if you have like a nice lush cover, they can duck and hide from those aerial predators. That's the concept. Right. And that's how they evolved with these, you know, this this jungle fowl, this forested creature. So they they got their eye on the sky and they duck and cover. Yeah. Yeah. So we have five minutes. I think we have time for maybe two more questions. OK, great, great. No, you can't shout it. We got it. There's people on the live stream that want to hear your beautiful voice. Are there opportunities to learn the chicken systems? Are these like dialed in systems or kind of more adapted to each environment? Yeah. How can people learn these this way? Mm hmm. Yeah. So RegenPoultry.com RegenEggAlliance.org We have we have folks in Guatemala and Mexico and British Columbia and South Dakota and Minnesota raising chickens in this way. And so we have like satellite farms and especially if you reach out to the Regenerative Agriculture Alliance, we can connect you with maybe people in your region. And if you take the training on RegenPoultry.com, I'll see you. I'll see you on there because I got I see everybody who signs up for that. And I'm you know, I'm like Santa Claus. I can I know if you've been actually taking the training or not. So it will connect with you. What's that? In person we do we gather on on farm. Salvatierra farms and at organic compound and maybe some other farms as we grow. And what do we got here? What do we got? Yes. Oh, gosh, you're you're trying to draw it out of me. Regenerative poultry convergence March 22nd through the 24th. 23rd and 4th. At Carleton College, you know, just eight miles from this place. We're going to have that in March and the in person wintertime training. If you're if you're not all PFI'd out, come on up there and and we'll we'll we'll do something similar, but really just focused on the economics of the chickens and the logistics of becoming a regenerative poultry farmer. And, you know, for Iowa people, Stacyville is where RAA has a poultry processing facility. So we're really looking for more Iowa farmers for sure. We still got time for one more. Yes. Is there no fencing around the paddocks? There is. Yes. And also what governs your choice of elderberries versus other fruit? Bob Gordon's my my my special special place in my heart for the Bob Gordon. variety. I've had the most success with that variety. I guess we've tried four or five different varieties on our farm. Oh. I am taking the cues of my mentors and the elders and the people who have come before me that are saying, you know, I work with Terry Durham and and grow elderberries dot com. And he's a big mentor of mine on the elderberry front. And Savannah is to just preach in the elderberry wisdom as well. So I'm just doing doing what I've been told is a good direction to go. I do. I would love to do cider apples. I would, you know, black currants and raspberries and strawberries and things like that. It's all interesting to me. And I have a lifetime to form those relationships with those plants as well. So we'll see. Yes. What ground covered are you using between your hazelnut plantings and what's what's been effective? What do you like? What would you recommend? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess I didn't I didn't go too deep into the establishment of the farm. But if I had, I would have told you that that first year we did just a barley clover and then we established the tree crops. And then the next year the clover was thick. We didn't do anything. The year after that, we did like a 17 species, really diverse mix, some annual, some perennial. I would say, you know, an orchard grass, a clover, anything that is is sort of common to your region or what other perennial farmers are doing. Obviously, establishment is a factor. You want to have a method of of keeping the weeds back from from that proximity of the tree crops. And there's many different ways to do that. Go to Savannah Institute dot org and learn more about tree crops. And and yeah, it just depends. We've had luck with clover and we've also sort of stepped back from that. And now it's just doing what it does. Mm hmm. I think we have two more minutes if there is one last question. OK. I just thought your contours were beautiful and wondered how you establish those. All right. The contour story. Oh, they're gone. Can we get a beautiful contours? No, it's OK. We don't have to look at them. So. We had a design done by Dan Halsey, permaculture designer. We had our reference of like the Beaconschneider County maps of the elevation. And we had our eyes and we looked at those maps and maybe. All right. Let's cruise. Let's let's go back there. We looked at those maps and we chose a key line. Which was like this one. And we established it and then we measured 20 feet, 50 feet. With our eyes, we didn't use a laser. We referenced the map and we said good enough. And we also thought about, you know, we thought about how we wanted the farm laid out. We wanted it to all sort of piggyback to this where we knew the road was going to be, where we knew the water was going to be, where we knew the power was going to be, where the where the barns were to be established for the poultry production. So it was really convenient that that was sort of already how the contours were speaking to us. And we just we just sort of picked a line and made it and went from there. And if you you maybe look at some of our other aerial photos, I don't know. I guess I got to go backwards. Backwards in time. This is totally not on contour. Like that hill slopes like crazy. These should be going this way. But we just continued to replicate that pattern. Just because it just kept it consistent. And, you know, we'll see what happens in the future. Those those hazelnuts are doing great. They're not on contour. Probably build a pond at the bottom of it. It's going to flow fast to it. There's a pond here that grandpa established. When we built this barn, we mined for clay there. So there ended up being a pond here. We're establishing a pond here. There's potential maybe we'll as we build more barns, maybe we'll end up putting another pond there. So if we're starting to move livestock through here, we've got this pattern that we can send them to. And maybe at the end of the year, we, you know, send them in into this silvopasture. Maybe we end up fencing the whole thing. We'll see. Sky's the limit. Sky's the limit. Awesome. Well, thank you, Will. And thank you, everyone, for a great question. Yeah. youtuber 시작. Yeah. So. And finally, thank you. Same, you know, Joe. Seriously? Hello? Whoa. home. No, no, no, no. When we go... Thank you.
