 Greetings to all our farmers. This is Joyce from Grow Mo Technologies Limited. As Grow Mo Technologies Limited, we are a dealer of agricultural processing equipment, irrigation systems, and as well as farm truck tractors. Grow Mo Technologies Limited has three branches. Currently we hope to grow more. We have a branch in Lusaka, we have a branch in Mumbwa, we also have a branch in Mokushi. As Grow Mo Technologies Limited, we offer very, very affordable equipment with very good quality. That can be bought on cash basis and also credit basis with the companies that we are currently working with. Which is Aglisco, which is a leasing company that allows farmers who want to get equipment but are unable to afford on cash basis. Their only condition is that you have to pay 25% upfront with a certain interest that is awarded to it and then you get to collect the implement afterwards. Apart from that, for civil servants, I would also like to venture into agriculture but don't have the running capital for it. Public Service Microfinance is also there for you. For civil servants, you are also able to get a loan at a very good interest. Apart from that, we are also working with companies like Agora, CEC. So for all of these facilities that I have mentioned, it holds for all farmers at small scale, medium scale as also commercial farmers. Because for this loan, you are also able to get for an implement as low as 1,500 all the way up to a tractor. So the conditions for all of these listed facilities are all different. But all farmers are welcome to inquire so that we see how we can work each other and help each other to grow as in the name, Grow More Technologies. Thank you. Thank you.
