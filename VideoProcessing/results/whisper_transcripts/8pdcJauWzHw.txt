Howto & Style
 Happy Memorial Day from the gravel gardens. You see here a close-up of our wheatgrass. You know they use this to make wheatgrass shots. Look just how much it is. We got a pretty good bush of wheatgrass. All still very green. This has been up now almost a month so imagine having a whole area of this wheatgrass for yourself. Some of our mustard greens coming along. We have lettuce. Our beans are we checked on our seeds and our beans over there they'll be up soon. Beans are looking the seeds are opening up. Lettuce right here. Pea shoots the superfood growing very strong very well very yummy and tasty. You juice those daily now. Pea shoots in the wheatgrass. You are the top juicers. Regular peas here growing at about the same rate as the pea shoots. Regular peas both up the trellis. We have some squash back here. Some trellising protection and then that mysterious plant. I forgot what that one was. And then over here we've got our cherry tomato volunteers that have returned coming along. And then our zinnias that came back from last year as well although it says sunflowers over there. And then a little bitty cucumber coming in. So these are our gravel garden Memorial Day Edition 2018. Get the books Riverstones Grow Plants by me Richard Campbell to show you how to have a permanent garden like this that you can use for the rest of your life. No soil no fertilizer.
