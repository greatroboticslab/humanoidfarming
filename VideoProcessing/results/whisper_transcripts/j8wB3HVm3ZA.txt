 Jim Booker with BoopTVguy.com, and I don't have to tell you folks, if it's Halloween time, that means it's time for Brimstone Pawn. Does that look scary or what? Oh my gosh! Gentlemen, how are you today? Good to see you. Good. Hey, we got Skittles the Clown and Skittles, so Brimstone Haunt, two attractions, correct? All for one price. All for one price. And all you have to do is go to brimstonehaunt.com, and it gives you all the information, and you can get a discount there. All right, for folks coming down here, what are they going to experience? Pure fear. Pure fear. Yeah. Anything to add there? Oh, I can't wait for the buffet to come through. Me and my eye can't do this. That's an eyeball for crying out loud, but it's a lot of fun, and for every member of the family, correct? We're here all month long, just for you guys, all the way to the 27th. 27th, that's right, Fridays and Saturday nights, and of course, we're right next to the Renaissance Festival here in Waynesville, so you can't miss it. All right, now, before we go, guys, does this guy have anything to say? No. All right, brimstonehaunt.com. Come see us at the Brimstone Haunt, and by the way, happy Halloween, right, guys?
