 Hi, my name is Sean Smith from Clan William, Manitoba. My family's been farming on this land for a hundred years under Clan Man jerseys. We milk 55 purebred Jersey cows with a robotic milking system, utilize pasture in the summer with our dairy herd as well as pasture all our young stock and drag house. Our dairy farm is a little unique in that we really focus on regenerative agriculture, trying to work more in sync with nature and trying to figure out more of a holistic way of doing things. We feel that grazing cattle is the most efficient way to create milk. Our bedding program on our farm is unique for Manitoba because we use a compost bedding pack. We use wood shavings from a local sawmill. It's a cow's urine, and manure gets mixed in with it. We cultivate it twice a day to create a compost bedding pack. It keeps cows clean and it actually heats up so much that it kills any bacteria that could cause mastitis for the cows. We have completely gone off synthetic fertilizers in the last five years and we're still seeing great results in the field. By cutting fertilizer out of the business, our input costs have been lowered, but also we have noticed that it has improved our soil. This spring we did some soil tests for organic matter and we were able to look back at a 2015 test and see that we've raised over 2% organic matter. It will increase the amount of water we can hold in our soil. We view water as the most important nutrient to being a thriving farm. Taking multiple steps to try to keep as much water on our farm as possible. Whether that's building small dams or just increasing our water infiltration rates, as well as our water holding capacity in our fields. Regenerative farming is good business practice because you are making your farm more resilient to the swings. Whether that's market or weather swings, you are going to be less dependent on outside forces to make sure that your farm has a better bottom line.
