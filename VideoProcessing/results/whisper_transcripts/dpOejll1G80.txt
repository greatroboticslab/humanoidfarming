 Tonight California may have one of the worst unemployment rates in the country, but in one industry there is more work than there are people to do it. The 19th Danielle Lee explores why cherry growers and farmers can't find enough workers. You don't want to detach the stem and the cherry. There's a lot more to picking the perfect cherry than just ripping it off the tree. You're wanting to pick each cherry with the stem on it. Lodi grower Joe Valenti says this year finding not just expert pickers, but any workers at all has been especially difficult. You have to have an adequate supply of employees to pick the fruit. If not, it just gets overripe. The San Joaquin County Farm Bureau says labor is down about 20 to 30 percent. To understand the shortage of cherry pickers this year, the Pew Hispanic Center says you may need to look toward Mexico. They say in recent years the number of people leaving the country has dropped by more than 60 percent and Joe says those people make up the majority of people working in his orchard. The nonprofit research center says the reduction in migrant workers is largely related to increasing immigration crackdowns and border drug wars making travel unsafe. Agriculture is really starting to hurt right now because of this. Without enough workers, Brad Gehring says he's having to decide what vineyards to just let go. And now he says he's worried what the future will hold if this trend continues. If it exacerbates at the same rate it did from last year to this year, we're in deep trouble. And Lodi, Danielle Lee, KCRA 319. And farmers say considering the shortage, they hope Congress will create a guest worker program to hire to help more people get in and out of the country for seasonal work safely.
