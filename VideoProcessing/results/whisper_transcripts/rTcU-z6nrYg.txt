 At TNC, we love to soil our undies. Underwear can be a quick and easy way to assess the soil health in a farmer's field. We place the cotton underwear into the soil and leave it for the growing season and then unearth it again and we see the amount of decomposition in those cotton underwear. A pair of underwear that has been more degraded, more chewed up, is actually going to be an indicator of healthier soil.
