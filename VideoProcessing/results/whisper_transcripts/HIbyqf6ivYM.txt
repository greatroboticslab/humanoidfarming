 Corn planting has its tricks. Learn this method to double your corn yield with no pests or diseases. It's simple, effective, and low cost. The trick involves using common household vinegar, mixed with water to spray your corn. This helps the leaves stay green, makes the plant stronger, and increases both the size of the ears and the overall yield. Vinegar contains acetic acid, which helps control certain bacteria and pests, reducing issues and promoting longer corners. Mix 100 ml of vinegar with 30 liters of water and use a sprayer to apply it to the corn leaves. Timing is crucial. Spray only during the early to mid-growing stages and avoid spraying during late growth when the corn is starting to mature. Additionally, spray in the morning. To prevent damage from high afternoon temperatures, spray once a week for three weeks when the corn is growing and the tassels are emerging. Got it? Follow me for more agricultural tips and knowledge.
