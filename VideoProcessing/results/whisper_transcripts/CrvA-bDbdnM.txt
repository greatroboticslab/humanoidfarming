 I get a 44 gallon drum and I cut these triangles at the bottom, right? And that's my main fire. That's the main burner. And I have to fill that full of wood at the bottom. And then I fill this, just a garbage bin. I fill it up with the material that I want to turn into biochar and I literally fill it. Now the trouble with this method is, this central garbage bin is under a lot of fire. So it gets burnt out. So this one's already finished. But for this demonstration, I can show you what happens. I fill that full of my biochar material and I put it inside of this drum. That's sitting on top of a lot of wood that's going to burn. And I stack the outside with wood as well. And I stack the top with wood. So it's not sitting that low. It's sitting on top of the wood down there and wood all the way around it.
