 Music G'day, my name's Simone and these are my mates George and Ben. G'day. Today we're investigating what it takes to grow wheat. Let's find farmer Lachie and see what we can discover. Hi guys, my name's Lachie, this is my farm Boondaroo, South Australia. On our farm we grow sheep, cattle and crops. One of the crops we grow is wheat which you can see behind me here. The variety wheat here is Trojan. It'll be used to make flour which we can make bread, biscuits or pizza dough. Hang on Simone, did you hear that? Bread, biscuits or pizza dough. So wheat is turned into flour and flour is used to make pizza dough. I wonder how long it takes to get this crop from the paddock to the plate. We'll cultivate our paddocks and then after we've cultivated them we'll sow them with an air seeder. The little seeds are blown down air hoses and are sown about 3cm into the soil. The tractor drives in long straight rows up and down our paddock using auto steer. Which means that tractor drives itself and we don't have to use our hands to steer it. After sowing we'll actually get our sprayer out and we'll spray the weeds that grow as well. To make that crop nice and clean. The wheat is sown in May or June and Lachie says lots of sunshine and rainfall is needed to help it grow over the next 8 months. Around December or January it's harvest time. We know the crop is ready to harvest when the heads bend over and we grab a handful of wheat and rub it in our hands and it's nice and dry. When the summer sun starts beating down it's time to take a good look around. Feel that grain between your hands. Let's start harvesting this land. Do the harvest hop. Yeah no time to stop. We gotta get this crop off before it drops. The harvester has a big white comb. The knife cuts the grain to give a new home. Way up in that big full box. Crikey mate watch out for that fox. Do the harvest hop. Luckily Lachie doesn't have to pick it all by hand. That's the combine harvester's job. A cutter bar inside the header cuts the crop and then it's fed into a large sifter that separates the grain from the plant. The grain is fed into the harvester's storage tank and the stalks are all left behind. It's amazing to think that the harvester is steering itself using GPS technology. There's no farmer holding the steering wheel. Just look how straight all of those rows are. Cereal crops are great to eat. Barley oats and all the yummy wheat. Mill em, crack em or eat em whole. You know it's all wheat in your big bread roll. Do the harvest hop. You know it's time to stop. We gotta get this crop off before it drops. Do the harvest hop. You know it's time to stop. We gotta get this crop off before it drops. Do the harvest hop. You know it's time to stop. We gotta get this crop off before it drops. Do the harvest hop. You know it's time to stop. We gotta get this crop off before it drops. When the harvester is full, the grain is emptied out into a field bin, a truck or a chaser bin like Lockie has. Then it's poured into even bigger bins called silos, ready for delivery to a flour mill or packaging plant. The final stop is the kitchen. Woah, well George, that was certainly hot and dusty work on Lockie's farm harvesting all that delicious wheat. And I don't know about you mate, but I am starving. Lucy, what do you suggest that we cook? Well Ben and George, after a busy day my favourite thing to make is homemade pizza. Homemade pizza with freshly milled flour is going to be delicious. Lucy, you do not know how much George and I love pizza. We are so pumped! So in goes the wheat. Our blender on high for one minute. How awesome is that George? So our next step is to add our ingredients. We already have flour in our blender, so we're going to add water, yeast, salt and olive oil. Wow George, it is so easy to make pizza dough. We just know those ingredients and we've got it. And if we haven't got a blender at home, we can knead it by hand. Okie dokie George, now our dough is finished. We need to put this aside, let it rest for the next 20 minutes until it doubles in size. Make sure you add loads of veggies to your tomato sauce base. Ok George, we now have our beautifully risen dough. So when applying your tomato sauce, be careful to keep your edges clear. We want that nice crispy crust that we all love. That's fantastic. Hey George, I reckon you can pass Lucy that mozzarella cheese there. Thank you George. So our mozzarella cheese is that nice stretchy cheese that you see when you have a pizza. That is awesome. It's also a great dairy food. Alrighty, so now we have some salty ham. And Ben would you mind getting the boccancini for me? Reckon I can do that Lucy. We're just going to apply this and then it's going to be time to go in the oven for a further 15 minutes. That looks fantastic. I tell you what, the guys on Locky's Farm are going to love this. Awesome, let's pop it in. Cool. Oh George, my mouth is watering. Well here we go guys, my gift to you. Hey Presto Pizza. That looks fantastic Lucy. Nutritious and delicious. George, we better get back to Locky's Farm. I bet everyone's starving by now. Do the harvest hop. You know time to stop. We gotta get this crop off before it drops.
