 The Wapsi Valley corn in our three sisters mounds is finally tall enough for us to start planting beans and pumpkins. We like to plant about two of these climbing beans for every one corn plant in the mound. The corn will provide a trellis for the beans and in return the beans will feed it nitrogen. This ingenious method of growing staple crops was developed by indigenous people in the Americas over thousands of years. The last element of the trio is pumpkin or winter squash which acts as a living mulch. We like to put one in the center of each mound. I can't wait to watch these take off.
