Saves me. Saves me. Saves me. Saves me. Saves me. Saves me. Saves me. Saves me. Saves you. Lenaio. Because you love to pull out in front of me all the time. And you're afraid I'm going to try to get payback on you. Don't worry, I'm not going to. I wish I could collect the straw off of this, but... All right. Harvesting sunflowers. Up to $175.88 and we need $208, probably about $250 for that new baler. Because the new baler will be able to drop three bales at once and just have three bales in one location instead of bale by bale by bale. Making it a lot easier when we go to pick up. A lot of wrath. Double yet, or neither. Look at all the sunflower seeds. You can make oil out of them. You can dry them and salt them and sell them. Oh, there's a lot of things you can do with sunflower. You can turn sunflower into flower. Sunflower seeds into flower. I don't know how good it would taste, but hey, you can do it. I'm only at 16% and we're at 35% full, so I think we're going to end up taking two loads. I'm invisible. Or I have x-ray vision. I don't know. I'm going to end up. So we'll continue on. We'll continue on. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, we're 50% full. And this is the second head row. Okay, pipes on this side. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I didn't turn it off. That's why I wasn't going so fast. Actually, I tell you what. Let's do it up here. Let's do it up here. Let's do it up here. You want to be able to keep the pipe on the harvested side. That's why I'm doing it like this. Let's do it in sections. Turn it back on. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. of the contract done. Now, I have put out some... I am making a new series called Lumberjack Dynasty 2025. So far, it's been doing pretty good. I am going through the complete game. We are going to start it from the beginning. There are two endings, so we are going to go one way, and then we will come back and go the other way. There are two paths you can pick. When we get to there, I am going to save that section, then we will come back and play it, and then come back and play it the other way. See which ending you all like. So this will be a complete series. of the game. It's completely... Game is completely updated. When you are harvesting, you always want your pipe side on the harvested stuff, not on the stuff you are harvesting. So that way, when you get full, you can bring the tractor up, boom, it's not driving over. It's not driving over. It's not driving over. It's not driving over. It's not driving over crops. It's driving over stuff you have already harvested. That's the way... That's the way... That's why I am doing it this way. Trying to get into the habit. Even though I have crop destruction turned off, I am doing it this way. Even though I have crop destruction turned off, Oh yeah, that's um... Oh yeah, that's um... 8. That's the way... That's the way I am doing it this way. That's the way I am doing it this way. Trying to get into the habit. Even though I have crop destruction turned off... Oh yeah, that's um... 8. 8. There we go. We are back to the tree. There we go. We are up at real time now. We were at half time. I don't know how that happened, but... I screwed up somewhere. And I sat down. I hold this scales down now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, we're 80% full and 38% done. Okay. Let's do this. Let's do this. Get that weird corner off so we can now just get this and work on this. Harvesting sunflowers. Doing a contract. Now, we've earned all the money that we have. We started with zero. Four episodes ago. And now we're just continuing on. Now, I do apologize. I was sick yesterday. I was supposed to start live streaming yesterday. I do apologize for that, but I got sick. Just before I was getting ready to live stream, boom. Everything in my stomach decided it didn't want to be there no more. So, I didn't live stream. And last week what happened, I was in the middle of my live stream. I went to go take a bathroom break. And, um, power went out. It was interesting. Power went out. That's the end of the live stream. No problem. But then, um, went to bed. Woke up the next day. The power was still out. Called the power company. And they said it was going to be out for a little bit. There was an accident and, um, we got a lot of repairs we gotta do before we can get power to your section. I'm like, okay. So, I called my buddy, who's on the sheriff's department, to find out what happened. Find out what this big accident was. And, um, I called him up. Asked him what's going on. He said, where you live? He said, your power shouldn't be out. You live in Gransom. I said, no, I moved to Salson. Oh, then your power's out. And he said, I'm like, why? He said, this truck driver, truck driver, ran off the road and completely demolished the substation by my house. And I'm like, you, what? Was it sabotage? Was it intentional? What? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Highway Patrol is investigating. The FBI is looking into it. To see if it was a terrorist attack. And find out what's going on. And he said, well, I was called. Highway Patrol is doing the, um, oops, I screwed up. Highway Patrol is doing the accident investigation. And I was called in to do an arson investigation. And detect any, um, and I screwed up. This is why you make sure it's on that side, buddy. So, I was curious what was, I'm like, so you're doing an investigation? Yeah, I'm just waiting for the results to come back. And they gotta get an autopsy on, on this guy. They, they put a rush on the autopsy on this guy to find out what's going, how he died. And they carefully checked the body. Just to make sure there was no, um, bombs attached to him that didn't explode. They, I mean, they didn't move the body until I got there. Cause I'm, I'm the bomb expert for, for the county. And they called me out to do the arson investigation. Cause the place was caught on fire. The substation caught on fire. And they didn't, and the whole truck burned up. So they didn't know what he, if he had the whole truck full of gasoline or something. So they did, they did that. And I'm waiting for my results to come back. And the waiting, the highway patrol is waiting. They did the investigation and they're tracking. They did find the GPS on his truck. So they're tracking it. The FBI is actually taking the GPS data. And seeing where this guy started from and all that. Cause there was, there's no, I mean, this truck burnt up. So there was no identification mark. They couldn't find any of the, um, They couldn't find any of the bins or anything like that. They're trying to recover some of the bins to find out on the trailer and the tractor to see where he came from. And see if he's, and see what kind of a, uh, the doing DNA scene. Try to identify the guy. See if he's a terrorist. See who he is and find out if he's a terrorist, terrorist or not. I'm like, okay, well, keep me up to date. Let me know what's going on. And let me know when you think the power is going to come back on. Well, it's going to be a little bit because the substation, they got to replace the substation. It's completely gone. So they got to completely replace it with brand new equipment and all that. And it caused a fire at the power plant. When he hit it, it caused a power surge all the way back to the power plant and caught a section of the power plant that powered that section, that turbo, that, um, substation. So they got to repair that also. It's not all the powers out in the county. This is your, this is basically the noisy side of the county is out, out of power. And they were, they're working on it as much as possible. They got, um, other electric, electrical companies come sending their techs and equipment to help get this power ripped back up. I said, okay, well, let me know what's going on. Keep me informed. So we were at power for days. Power finally comes back on. Luckily, we had a generator keep, ran our refrigerators, our refrigerator and freezers on the generator and some lights. Couldn't run the air conditioning. Of course, it was the hottest part of June. So we had all the windows open. We did hook up some fans, get some air flow. And power came back on. Great. Okay. Well, I was so far behind on my recordings, my videos. Power came back on on Friday, I think. Yeah, Friday during the day. Internet was on. I mean, we hooked up the cable and we hooked up the TV and the cable. And couldn't get any pictures because they called the cable company to find out if the cable was out. And they said, yeah, due to the power outage, we can't power. Our boxes are out of power, so we can't transmit to your house at this time. We've got to wait for the power to come back on. I'm like, oh, okay. Oh, power came back on. Got the TV working. Had to reset the internet, my internet. My internet is separate from the house. I got my own separate internet. So I went ahead and got everything set up. And my buddy called. He said, I got some information for you. I want you to know this before it gets in the news. He said, the FBI tracked him down. He started his trip in New York City. They find out who he was. He was a long haul trucker. He was a teamster. So they got his complete background. And they sifted through the ashes. I sifted through the ashes. There was no... Only thing I found was diesel fuel from the diesel tanks that exploded. I didn t find any traces of bomb materials or any other accelerant that might have been used. I said, oh, okay. They tracked him. He was on his way to Jacksonville, Florida, New York City, taking a load of computers. Uh, computer parts. Some type of computer parts. And all these computer parts had lithium batteries. I m like... So basically he was taking a load of lithium batteries. He said, yeah, basically that s what he was carrying. Lithium batteries designed for computers. He was taking them to a factory, uh, to a warehouse in Jacksonville, Florida. And they followed him. They... They tracked him. He left New York City at 1 a.m. With his load. He made a stop in Maryland. He stopped at the trucks... He stopped in Frederick, Maryland. He was taking the 95. He stopped in a truck stop outside of Baltimore. Slept. Got there around 8 o'clock in the morning. They don't know why it took him so long. But he got there around 8 o'clock in the morning. He slept. And then he was back on the road around 3 a.m. Uh, 3 p.m. Uh, 3 p.m. I m like... Then he... Got off at 95. In Nash County. And got on to 795. And headed towards Goldsboro. A little... Trying to figure out why he went to Goldsboro. Pulled into the city. Stopped at a house. Stayed there for about 4 hours. Then he stopped at a liquor store. They found out that he... Got... He bought like 4 bottles of whiskey. I m like... Oh, okay. Well... Find out who owns the house. He said... Well... Um... The house... Is a known drug house. I m like... A known drug house. I m like... Ah... Okay. So they re searching the ashes to see if he was carrying any drugs. And they did find some drugs. He was carrying methamphetamines. He had... They estimated about... 500 pounds of methamphetamines. He had stashed in the trailer. And he was also taking that... They busted the house and found out... What he was carrying. And where they were taking it to. He was gonna drop it off in... Somewhere in Georgia. Off of 95. They found out... They... Looked at the... Um... Video at the... Liquor store. And found out he bought 4 bottles of whiskey. And then... Instead of heading back towards 795. He... Headed north... On... North... Got out of Goldforum. Went through South. They don t know why. And then... Instead of heading back towards 795... He... Headed north... On... North... Got out of Goldforum. Went through South. They don t know why. And then he... He... He's like... Going the complete opposite way. Of... Get back on... Onto 95. And this is about 1 o'clock in the evening. In the morning. So they were like, okay. Oh, they got the autopsy report. Oops, I'm going the wrong way. They got the autopsy report done. The guy was four times the legal limit in alcohol. He's four times over the legal limit in alcohol. He was also high on methamphetamines. Oops. He was also high on methamphetamines, so they think he got totally confused. He was just totally plastered. And they were trying to figure out how he made it that far. Because when he was at the liquor store, he was there for a couple hours. He slept there for a little bit. And he was totally plastered. So they think that he drank a bottle of whiskey. And then started driving. And he was so high on meth, so he was so wired up on meth, the alcohol didn't affect him that much, supposedly. And come to find out, this guy has a history of alcohol. The company he worked for. And he worked for that company for, he worked at that company for 12 years. And like I said, he was a teamster. But he came to work. There was four incidences where he came to work drunk. And they sent him home. And they sent him home. No. There was three incidences where he came to work drunk. And they sent him home. And there was, they did a, and he failed a random drug test for methamphetamines. But because he's a teamster union, and he was also the shop steward for that company, the teamsters basically made the company forget about the drug test. And the company never reported the incidents to the local, to the authorities that they were supposed to. They tracked his CDLs and all that. So they never did that. So the guy got away with murder. He was involved in two wrecks in that 12 years he worked for the company. And both of them were found he was not at fault. After the investigation. The guy did go to rehab once in the 12 years. I think one of the, when he got busted for meth, he had to go to rehab. And they won't, wouldn't say anything. And keep him employed. I think that was the agreement that they had. So now they invest, the FBI is investigating the company. To find out if, um, anything illegal. What else illegal that they didn't do. I mean, they were, when the FBI showed up, he said when the FBI showed up at that place. Because he, because he, because he's talking to the, um, FBI who's in charge. He told them when they showed up to that place and found out who, that he crashed and all that. They were wondering why he didn't show up. They thought, well, maybe he just stole the product. And stuff like that. And his runs basically were from New York to Florida. That was his runs. He always took the New York to Florida job, so. And he had a company truck. And they were always trying to figure out why did it take, they always took him an extra day than when anybody else who took the trip. They did it a lot quicker. They did it a day quicker. And they were trying to figure out why. And they couldn't figure out why. They looked, they never checked their GPS to find out what was going on. And all that. So they think what happened was. Guy got drunk. Fellas took a nap. Woke up. Found out what time it was. Took some meth to wake his ass up. Got on the road. Got confused. And he just lost control of the truck. And crashed. That's what they think has happened. At least that's what the North Carolina Highway Patrol thinks what happened. They haven't. They had not. Sent a. Final release. They haven't. Done their final. They're still investigating some other stuff. About this. So they haven't. Released their final findings. But that's what they told them. They think he was just. Drunk and high. And. Lost control. Because the way the. He. The way he went off the road. What. It wasn't like he was. Aiming. For. The. The. Substation. And. They didn't think it was a terrorist attack. But. They had to contact the FBI. For some reason. Because. What's going on with Iran. And. They just wanted. Clarification. So. But now the FBI. In the. In. NTSB. Is doing. Investigation. On the company. So. They're all. Ticked off. And. The FBI. Guy. Told. Told the deputy. He said. Yeah. The only reason. Why he. He had a job. Was because. He was a teamster. And he was. The shop steward. So he was an officer. In the teamster union. That's the only reason. Why he kept his job. But they. This hired. Regular drivers. And they weren't unionized. They weren't teamsters. They would have. Got away with the. They wouldn't. They would have fired his butt. That's what they say. They said the teamsters. Forced them. So. At least that's. Their statement. So the FBI. Is investigating. The company. The N. N. T. B. The national. Ones that do. Accident investigations. For airplanes. And ships. They're also doing this. Invest. They're involved in this. Investigation. Because of the statement. Of the. Company. That he was driving. So. This field is harvested. Where are we supposed to go with the product? Oh. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. So. They're. They're investigating it. You see. It's going to take a while. Before they figure out. What they're going to do with it. Oh. We're going to the same place. Okay. It's cool. And. It's doing it. Again. So. Let me save. Quit. Yes. See. Yeah. It's. Screwed up again. There we go. Nope. I want that. On. In task. Task. Okay. Close that. That one mod. Is. Maybe that's what's causing. This. Screw up.

We're going to do a couple more contracts before we can buy the new baler. This is how you make money in survival games. By doing contracts. That's the field. I think we need to go down the road first, buddy. You go down this road. Get access to the field. Yes. Okay. And this is the field we are going to work on. Let's get so we can... Come down here. Uh... Yes, that will work. I'm going to start down here. Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... It's... Uh... Okay. Uh... Get that. Uh... And B. There we go. Start cultivating. There we go. Actually, this tractor is doing a good job. And cultivator pretty good. So we're going to get all the money because we're using our equipment, not borrowing equipment, which is a lot better. It means more money. And this is a pretty good wide cultivator, so it shouldn't take us this long, that long to go ahead and do. Appreciate the likes, guys.

You all supported me and. I really do appreciate it. You people. Gave me, sent me messages. And it helped me out a lot mentally. And I really do appreciate it. So. We'll do a live stream on it. Should've planned ahead. I might have been able to get toplets. To at least give me some, um, keys to give away. But I just thought of it. And tomorrow's anniversary. So we gotta take care of that. Hey. Princess. What the hell is wrong with you? My dog's not being a good girl. I harvested this. This. Field. Or started to harvest it. The equipment that they gave me. Wasn't working.

Train missed the train. And we're going to take the farmer's shortcut. One good thing about having a tractor. Field 12. This is the field we need to do. Okay. Oops. Ah! Lost control of my tractor. There we go. We got it out of control now. Now. We're going to try to stack all the bales together. Okay. At least close together. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Why? Because I want to. That's why. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. That way they're easier to stack on the flatbed. To the ground with a TEP sheet. Oh.

That's why I'm buying all this equipment. Field 35, so yeah, I need to turn here. Sorry, I was checking my GPS. Here, pass me. They start passing you, then they stop. Okay, do the same thing here. Only three bales. Okay, that's not too bad. Oh, those are round bales. I'm glad this does both. Okay. I want it. Okay. Okay. Okay. and the last bail then we'll see if we can pick this up with a trailer and if we can we'll store it and for silage silage let's trace your tracks buddy let's trace your tracks there you go and y and x and back home large silo now we'll go home drop this off and pick up the trailer probably would have been quicker if I took the ferry who knows never know back to the farm we're out of storage spaces look at all my sheep I'm just going to drop this off here go hoş and sj the pool Thinking about, let's check on the sheep. We got 250 sheep, health is good, reproduction is at 20% food. Yeah, we're gonna need some more grass. What am I feeding them, by the way? What am I feeding them? Hay and grass. Okay, we got grass. Okay. We need hay. So there's a mowing contract. Do that mowing contract. And we'll make hay out of that mowing contract and collect bales. And give it to the sheep. And we can keep these bales. Let it turn into silage. Silage. Take the farmer's shortcut. Let's cut through the fields. That's grass, so we really don't have to worry about that. Let's see if it'll let me collect these bales. It's letting me collect these bales. Yay! Strap. Now we're gonna collect the other bales. Let me just double check. Make sure we're not supposed to be delivering anywhere. Oh. Let's wrap the bales. Eventually we'll get cows, so we can save this. For the cows. Or we can just sell it. Because it's gonna be wild before we get cows. I got 250 sheep. I'm gonna let them breed. And give me babies. I'm all over the road. See if I can collect bales. These bales. With this. Or do I have to empty this first? It might. It will. Cool. Okay, we're gonna take the ferry this time. If we're at the right ferry. I'm telling you to turn. Why are you not turning? All right, and the ferry's on this side. Yay. This might be the wrong ferry, but I don't care. I don't care. Yeah, this is the wrong ferry, but it still didn't get me across. So we'll take the ferry across. So we'll take the ferry across. Okay. And then we'll take the ferry's on the ferry. And we'll take the ferry our fly at water. I know we came. And it was soon to be the ferry that the ferry at the ferry out here. First for the ferry, go around the ferry this nest. What are we going to get here? So I saw a ferry on the ferry? Can we get the ferry? For the ferry, come back. which way is the ferry on to Thursday? And the ferry on, coming back. And notice which is Can we get we're processing in the ferry? Can we get the ferry. You need to keep the prairie on this side any which way? Spin your tires. There we go. And now we're going across. I hope it's this field. That's a good field to cut. It's lots of bales. But we want to empty the trailer. Because we want grass. No, we want hay. UPS. UPS drivers think they're on the road. They're as bad as the mail people. It was pulled right out in front of you. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Appreciate the likes, guys. Maybe like pushes the stream out a little bit more on YouTube, which helps the stream out, and I really do appreciate it. Okay, we got the bails.
