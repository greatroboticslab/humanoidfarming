Howto & Style
 Welcome to the Rustic Garden Homestead. Today's video is all about 25 plants that you can grow in partial shade. Most important is to understand the definition. Partial sun, partial shade, what's the difference? Nothing. It's pretty much the same term. Four to six hours is what I consider and most people consider partial sun, partial shade. Anything less than four hours, it's really hard to grow any kind of food crop. So you get four to six hours. It has to be direct sun. That means the sun and the plants have to kind of see eye to eye. The sunlight has to hit that plant. Behind me, now my garden gets six to 12 hours depending on the time of year. Behind me are some of those plants that can tolerate the shade. They can do pretty well in four to six hours. The plants are going to do better closer to six hours. We're going to go over all 25. I have growth examples to show you. To figure out how much sun you get in a space, you pretty much have to wake up hopefully. And then from seven o'clock to seven at night, that's like midsummer, you're just going to check a box for an hour's worth of sunlight. And if that space is getting four to six hours, it doesn't have to be continuous. It can be broken up over the day. You'll be able to plant some of these shade crops. So let's get started with the list of 25. Earlier in the spring, the nectarine tree here didn't have any leaves. So more sun was coming in here. There is a strategy you can use with shade. For instance, most of the crops that I'm talking about enjoy the cooler weather. And when it gets too hot, when the sun is beating down, warming the soil, these plants tend to bolt. They send up flower stalks and they're just not tasty. So you grow a lot of these in the spring. You can grow them again in the fall. However, if you have trees that leaf out or you end up getting more shade in the garden, you can do a second and third round of these crops under the shadier area of your garden and they will continue to produce for you later into the summer. So you can use shade as a benefit. So in this space, all these crops can really deal with four to six hours of sun. One of them is celery. You may not get beautiful stalks, but with five or six hours, you're going to get a lot of the green. You're going to get some stalk. Celery is a great crop to grow in partial shade. The loose leaf lettuces, this is romaine. This is, you know, semi-heading. You don't want like the iceberg lettuce, but romaine lettuce, oak leaf lettuces, bib lettuces do extremely well in partial shade or partial sun. So lettuces, they can really deal with three to five hours. You can get something out of there. But again, I just want to stress, we're trying to get as close as we can to six hours. But I will make some notes on plants that can do a little bit better on that lower end. And one of them is lettuces. In the back, those are my carrots. Carrots do really well in four to six hours worth of sun. Peas can handle the shade, partial shade. That's my first round of peas. Collard greens, there's some collards. They do really well with five or six hours worth of sun. Same thing with kale. So kale and collards are great to grow. And you might notice a little bit of a pattern here. The plants that are more leafy greens tend to do better in less sun. You know, plants like tomatoes and peppers and zucchini, cucumbers, they tend to want more sun. We'll talk a little bit about them towards the end of the video. But right now, we've got celery, the looser leaf lettuces, loose heading lettuces, carrots, peas. Right there is the collards. In the back, all the way over there is the kale. Kale does really well. These are great crops for a partial shade garden. This part of my garden gets full sun. It's almost going to get 12 hours, you know, come the high point of summer. So again, this is kale. This is kale that overwintered. Tucked in here, I have radishes. They do really well in that four to six hour range. And it's going to get too hot soon. So all the crops that are planted in here are going to start to bolt. The radishes are going to become woody, get that spicy, you know, flavor to them that sometimes people don't like. Also mixed in here, we have some turnips. These are purple top turnips. Turnips do really well in partial shade. And the whole idea is to kind of learn what your garden is. So making a kind of a, not really a checklist, but a table of what parts of the garden get X amount of sun will help you kind of plan out how you grow. Because all this space here is going to be transitioned into the warm weather crops. The space that we were just in will get another round of the cool weather crops and the crops that do better with some of that shade. Another great crop to grow that can take the four to six hours worth of sun and do pretty well, that's Swiss chard. It's a beautiful leafy green. This might be a bright lights variety. But chard is a great crop to grow if you don't have that optimal eight plus hours of sun. Other crops for partial shade, spinach does really well. That is a self-seeded bok choy or bok choy. Chinese cabbages do really well. Over here I have some carrots. This part of the garden is going to be getting eight hours, ten hours of sun. I just want to be clear. Just because, you know, I'm saying these crops grow well in four to six hours doesn't mean you're not going to do better with more sun. The heat coming down and beating on the spinach is going to send us up to flower. So it's not going to really have any benefit. Carrots do okay with, you know, that eight plus hours of sun also. But there is, again, that strategy that if I come out today, you know, May 1st, put spinach down where the soil is going to get baked by the sun, it's going to grow, maybe get this size, and then it's going to send up a big flower, and it's done with. So these cool weather crops often get planted beginning of spring, beginning of fall, because they just want cooler soil temperatures. And the cooler roots mean you get nice leafy greens and you get a better harvest. So please subscribe and follow me. I'll teach you, you know, how to plant all this and talk more in depth about that. But again, spinach, bok choy, bok choy, perfect for four to six hours. You might be sensing a bit of a theme here. The leafy greens and the root crops tend to be able to handle less sun. These are potatoes. A lot of people think potatoes have to be grown in eight plus hours of sun, and they do best in that condition. But if you get a full six hours of sunshine, you could do potatoes. They may not be as large, but you're going to get a nice crop of potatoes in that, you know, partial shade area of about six hours. Here's a corner of the garden we were just in. Full sun's going to be coming in here. This is getting transitioned over. That spinach that's starting to bolt, you can see that it's getting tall. Flower head's starting to form. Got a tomato in right over there. I don't know if you can see it right down there. And have some cucumbers in. In the back, you can see how the shade is starting to fall. Again, that's going to be the second, maybe third round of these crops that can do better in the partial shade. As we transition from spring, late spring, early summer, as the soil heats up, it changes how your different crops can grow. So again, shade can be a friend if your area heats up, you know, to higher temperatures pretty early, like we do here in Maryland. And you can grow in the shade by, you know, selecting those root crops and those leafy green type crops. Beets can grow in that four to six hour range. Most of your root crops, generally speaking, five, six hours, they're going to do okay. The leafy greens can handle a little bit less. Three hours even, maybe four hours of sun. They're still going to develop. But again, if we can stay at that six hours, that's best. So beets do really well. In the back there is cilantro. Cilantro does well in, you know, four to six hours worth of sun. Spinning around this way. Another leafy green is endive. I really like this. This does well in that partial range of sun, four to six hours. I really encourage people to experiment. I'm trying to kind of put a range up there, four to six hours, and then tagging the plants that might do better closer to four, other plants that might need that six. The other thing to keep in mind is sun intensity varies throughout the day. So where maybe you only get four or five hours of sun, but you get sun from 12 to five, that could be better than more sun from like 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. So the intensity of the sun does make a difference. So again, I really encourage you to plant different shade tolerant crops in different parts of your garden and just see how they do. Take notes. And then each year you can kind of revise your plan and you'll get a better plan for growing those shade tolerant crops. Here's another part of my garden. We talked about kale, spinach, broccoli, and cauliflower do pretty well with six hours worth of sun. They may be able to get by with a little bit less. When that soil warms for broccoli and cauliflower here in Maryland, and sometimes our springs just don't stay cool enough, you know, this nice tight head of broccoli you want to get, it doesn't form here. It begins to loosen up like this and flower. So the shade can really help your cauliflower and your broccoli. In this space, I'll be using this trellis that I built to grow cantaloupe up there, and it's going to provide shade for the carrots that are down here. Again, I'm going to be using shade in different ways over late spring and summer to help keep the soil cooler for some of these cool crops. And carrots, yeah, they can survive more sun, eight plus hours, but they just taste sweeter, I find, with a little bit less sun. So when I have the late spring, early summer sun rolling in, I like to try and keep the soil cooler for a lot of these crops that I'm talking about. Now, I don't want to fool you. So the crops in this space and over here, they're getting eight hours or more of sun, and they're a good size. We've already talked about the issues with the broccoli and how that's beginning to bolt. The lettuce is beginning to bolt. With six hours of sun, you may not get crops this big or a little bit less than six hours, but you're going to get good production. Even if they come out to be half this size, it's going to be a success for you. So, again, four to six hours, your leafy greens, your kale, your endive, these are collards back over here, may not get this large, but you're still going to get production out of them. These are last year's bunching onions or spring onions. They don't develop full onion bulbs. I'm letting these, you know, turn to seed so I can collect it. But bunching onions, spring onions, do really well in six hours worth of sun, so you can scatter them just about wherever you want. Also, chives and herb does pretty well in four to six hours of sun. Please subscribe and follow me. I'll teach you how to grow food, save money, and have some fun. And I'll show you really, in real time, how everything in my garden is progressing. If you're near Maryland Zone 7, you can kind of just follow along. I do want to stress that I am saying four to six hours over and over again in each of these videos. Number one, everybody doesn't watch the whole, you know, 20, 30 minute video, so they jump around. But four to six hours is going to help you have a partial shade garden. Anything less is really, really difficult. Here's a good example of how some of the crops I'm showing you do well in that four to six hours worth of sun. This is the northeast side of my vertical tower. Greenstalk Garden, by the way, wonderful vertical tower. I'm affiliated with them. They're having a Mother's Day sale now through the 15th of March. Check out the video description for links and a discount code. So leafy greens on this side, Swiss chard, arugula, parsley is another great crop that does well in four to six hours. This side gets less sun and, you know, pretty good size leaves. You know, they're doing okay. Come around this way. This is the west and southern side of the tower. The crops here aren't too much bigger. A little bit more beat up, actually, because of the heat. But you get the idea that the same crop, sure, can take eight plus hours, but can also deal with four to six hours like on the other side. Let me show you that side again. Nothing wrong with the plants here that have been sitting in the sunshine. This is an area of my garden that's going to get more shade. So I've put in a second wave of, and maybe even third wave. I've got a third wave of carrots right in there. Third wave of these crops that can do better in less sun. So I've got carrots I just put in there. More peas. Bush beans, they're not up yet, but bush beans do well in that four to six hours worth of sun. You can add that to the list. More radishes back there. Celery. Mints. It's peppermint down there. Peppermint, mint, anything in the mint family does well in that four to six hours. If you have less than four hours. Yeah. If you have less than four hours of sun, that's my mushroom garden. I'll be doing a video on that soon. If you want to, again, subscribe. That's a mushroom garden there. There's another mushroom garden put in there. They do well in four hours or less of sun. I'm growing wine caps and oysters, so you can grow food crops, just not the standard ones you typically think of. But if you have less sun, under four hours, you can definitely do wine caps and you can do oyster mushrooms. You can add oregano, two herbs, oregano and time to that list of crops it can manage with less than eight hours worth of sun. Oregano, time come back year after year, so they're a great perennial to grow. And again, perfect for less than eight hours worth of sun. If you can, you know, get any of these crops that we're talking about closer to six hours, they're going to do really well. You might not even notice a difference between those crops getting six hours and crops getting eight or more hours worth of sun. Here's another bed. Beets, radishes, spinach, lettuce, kale. And the other one you can add to the list is arugula. That's arugula that's a little bit older. It's beginning to bolt, but I just put seeds down. Arugula is a great crop that can handle less sun. A couple other crops that I'm not growing this year are mustard greens and tat soy. They do well in that four to six hour sun range. A lot of people have questions about tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers and zucchini. And I feel like if you're getting a solid six hours, especially 12 to 6 p.m. when the sun is at its highest and strongest, you can definitely give peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, zucchini a try. And I think they're going to do pretty well. If you're getting under six hours or it's broken up or it's morning sun, it's going to be tough if you're really, you know, getting sun under six hours. Again, I would give it a try. I've talked about, you know, kind of experimenting, putting up plants in different places. But you're really going to want a full six hours of sun focused on that 12 to 6 p.m. range for tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, squash, zucchini. You're not going to know what you can really grow unless you experiment and give it a try. I do, again, really recommend mapping out the hours of sun that you're getting where you want to plant certain plants. So, you know, you just come out, look at 7, 8, 9, 10 o'clock, you know, through the whole day. Check if it's getting direct sun. If it totals six, go ahead and give crops a try. For the tomatoes and peppers, they're going to want more intense sun. Still try it out. For tomato plants, if, you know, maybe you don't quite have that six hours, you're not sure, try a cherry tomato plant. They tend to ripen a little bit more quickly. You don't have big fruits sitting on there. So give cherry tomatoes a shot if you have less than optimal sun. And you can also grow the determinate variety tomatoes, the ones that get to a set height, set flowers and fruit over a short period, and they tend to do a little bit better. But if you're growing the big indeterminate varieties that get like 12 ounce, one pound fruit, they're going to struggle without really having that eight plus hours worth of sun. This is another one of my gardens, and this is more of the shade garden. And just over here to the left, you know, not even six feet away, that gets about eight hours. If we come over here to the right side, I'm growing some potatoes in there because of the tree line, that gets a little bit less than six hours, depending on the time of year. So just in a small space, it can vary greatly. So you definitely want to go and map out from that seven o'clock to 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. timeframe and just see how many hours of sun falls into the space that you want to grow. And that will help you decide, you know, where you're going to grow plants. Generally speaking, the leafy greens, anything with a leaf can really do okay in that three, four hours worth of sun. Not great, but good enough that you can try and grow it. The root crops like that five to six hours, but again, we're talking four to six hours is pretty good amount of sun for the crops that we talked about today. Thanks so much for watching. Please subscribe. The next video coming out is going to be on how to set up mushroom beds. So the side that I just showed you gets about the eight hours I was just talking about. And then this space in here gets about six hours once the tree line is filled out and all that kind of stuff. But I'm also growing mushrooms. I have more shade over there for the mushrooms. Brought the mushroom garden out to here. Those are wood pellets that are all broken up on that surface. Mushrooms are a great crop to grow in anything less than four hours worth of sun. Tucked in there are potatoes. Again, they can get by with six hours. Thanks so much for watching. Please check out my seed shop at therustedgarden.com. We sell tomato and pepper seeds for $1.75 a pack. All other vegetables, seeds, and herbs, flowers are $1.50 a pack. Again, thanks so much for watching.
