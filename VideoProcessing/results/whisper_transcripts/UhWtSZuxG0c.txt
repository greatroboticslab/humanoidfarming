 See how farmers in China are using 100% of their brains? They release baby squirrels into their cornfields to control pests that could damage the crops. The squirrels grow by eating these insects, and this method saves money by reducing the need for pesticides. Once the squirrels mature, they're removed from the fields and raised on a farm. Finally, they're caught using nets and sold in markets, generating significant income.
