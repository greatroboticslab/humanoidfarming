 Music For the last 75 years we have implemented industrial farming practices. In that goal and quest to create cheap food, we have totally lost sight of the health of the land. At the expense of the humane treatment of the animals. And fair wage at the farm level. Gotta have a new system of food farming and land use that people believe in. Regenerative agriculture is biomimicry. It is emulating nature. Regenerative organic agriculture is treating your farm as an ecosystem. The earth evolved with animals and plants and soil co-evolving together. Regenerative organic ag practices include... No use of toxic chemicals or GMOs. Low-till, no-till. Things like cover cropping. Using animal impact instead of pesticides. We're talking about busting the animals out of the animal factories and getting them back on the land. Nature wants a smorgasbord of many, many different animals and plants and microbes operating. Together to create a harmony which restores the health of your land. We have to have regenerative food farming and land use if we hope to survive. I mean climate scientists are literally saying we've got 25 years left before the point of no return. The healthier the soil, the more carbon the plants sequester in the soil. The regenerative organic standard is a three pillar standard. So it takes all the attributes of the fair trade movement, the animal welfare movement, the climate movement and pushes us to the next stage. There are customers there waiting for people to be farming in this way. Farmers as entrepreneurial business people will move their production model to a model that pleases that consumer. We need to be uncompromising in the quest for the best. If the standard is compromised, the consumer will lose that confidence and the whole transaction will break down. Regenerating is the lens through which we have to look at everything we do on the planet in the future. Ones increases the best!
