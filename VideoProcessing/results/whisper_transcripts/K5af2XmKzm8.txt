And today we are super excited because we have a treat for you. Now, you all helped us with our prep, our live prep. But today is the day that we have all been waiting for. And today we will be launching the very first episode of our RFB B3 podcast. And the B3 stands for Bulldogs, Breeders, and Business. So today don't hold anything back, Breeders. I have some controversy questions and a hot seat room for you guys. This will be a very structured professional live stream. So you are definitely welcome to ask your questions. And also come on the screen to share your input if y'all want to challenge, if y'all want to debate. Today is your special day. I don't like to say lucky. But let's see. Let's get to some intros. Let's get to some call-outs. Let's see who we have in the place today. Okay, so what's the vibes? What's the vibes? All right. So we have Slay Lay Lay. We have Peyton, Bagel, Michelle. Shout out to Michelle, you guys. I have to tell y'all something very exciting about Michelle and where her business is going. I won't share too much. It is, you know, definitely up to her how much of her journey she wants to share with you guys. But I'm really, really, really excited for Michelle and where she is going in her journey. So if this is you guys' first time tuning in to the Rochelle Frenchie Breeders, you guys, we love putting our educational content on dog breeding, dog whelping, and dog care. So today we're going to be talking about all of the above. We are a family of four and we have eight Frenchies. And currently we have five little beautiful puppies. Mama Dream just gave birth to her second litter of her first fluffy big rope line. So we're super excited about that. We have four beautiful females and one... No, correction. We have four beautiful males and one beautiful female. But if you guys have litters on the ground, definitely let us know. I am waiting on some more people to come in, but that's not going to stop the show. Y'all know I'm a rapper, right? I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. Let me stop playing. Okay. So I had this take to the camera, but I actually want to hold it so that I can read it very quick. Well, more efficiently and be better with Tommy. But y'all, we have about what? We have like a minute for you guys to introduce yourselves. If you don't mind, let me see. Let me see who we got. I'm going to chat. Michelle, if you don't mind, I want to give a little teaser about what you have going on and what your plans are. But I won't share too much, but just a little teaser. If you don't mind me bigging you up, let me know. Okay, you guys. So we're going to get into why you guys are catching up with the chat because I know it's a slight delay and then sometimes ads will play. So I might be repeating myself tonight, but that's okay. But let's get into the first controversy, right? We talk about this a lot on our channel, on our pre-recorded content. But the first controversy tonight is should all Frenchies be DNA tested? And when I say DNA tested, I do mean DNA tested in terms of like color and coat, but also health DNA tested. So what do you guys think? Should all Frenchies be DNA tested for health and color and coat? What do you think? Let me put it in the chat. Okay, so controversy number one. And I will be putting the invite link in the chat as well in maybe 20 more minutes. Okay, so let me put the question in the chat. Should all Frenchies, Slay Lele said yes. Should all Frenchies be DNA tested? Okay. I'm going to put it in the chat and I'm also going to put it in the live stream. Okay, let's see. Let's see what the people are saying. Slay Lele. Can't be the only question. I mean, the only respondent. Yeah, I'm multitasking today. Okay, so y'all just be patient with your girl. Okay. All right. Got it up on the screen. Uh-oh, y'all. Michelle is interested in her shout out. Okay, okay, okay. Slay Lele said yes. Okay. Okay. So let's pause for a second and get to Michelle. But I don't want that to, um, let me just hide it. If I hide it, will it go away? I hope not. Okay, it didn't. That's great. Okay, Michelle said, hello, everyone. I'm getting into show quality cane corsos. I will be, um, an owner slash handler. And I'm very excited to start my journey. Um, we are so excited for Michelle. I don't know how delayed the stream is, um, with the ads. But I wanted to definitely shout out Michelle at the beginning of the live stream. Um, for those of you who might be watching the playback. But I offered to design a logo for Michelle. And y'all, she blew it out of the park. Like, blew it out of the water. I'm so, so, so thankful that we have this platform to showcase talent like Michelle. And all of the rest of the breeders and aspiring breeders. Because this is what we do it for. Um, of course, we could be at home resting, relaxing with our two boys. Or out, you know, somewhere just enjoying life. But we would much rather spend it with you guys. Because y'all have afforded us the opportunity to breed full time. And share our journey with you guys. Y'all are so supportive. That's why any chance we get, we like to big you guys up. We like to either give things away or bless you guys with, um, things that we have been blessed with. Or afforded the opportunity to acquire. Because that is our way of saying thank you. Y'all don't have to be here. Y'all could so be doing something else with your time. But, um, we appreciate you guys so much. So, definitely shout out to Michelle K, you guys. Definitely, um, congratulate her on starting her journey of being a cane corso handler. If you don't know what a cane corso looks like, let's go. Let, let's go. Y'all. I, you know what, for the, is it cane with a C? Yes, it is. For the longest time, I thought it was cane with a K. Y'all, cane corsos are absolutely beautiful dogs. They are huge. They're massive. Um, not to be confused with mastiffs. But they are gorgeous dogs. Um, I've seen, this one actually looks like a little puppy. But I've seen some actually, um, in person that are way bigger than this. But this is, um, the type of breed that Michelle will be handling. And we are so proud of her. Okay, so, let's see where we are with time. All right, so we have four minutes. And I'm gonna go back to controversy number one. Let me put it back on the chat. And it sounds like, um, the boys just woke up. And my husband is manning them now. But, y'all already know. If your girl gotta go, your girl gots to go. But, okay. So, this is my opinion. Y'all let me know if, if y'all agree or disagree. Should all Frenchies be DNA tested, um, to include health testing? In my opinion, yes. And here's why. When we first started our journey, we did not know a lot of the things that we know now. We did not know the importance of health DNA testing. We thought that taking your dogs and your puppies to the vet would, you know, be sufficient. And it's simply not. Your vet will not, I'm not even sure if they have the equipment to do it. And it's no shade. You know, we definitely respect veterinarians. They have acquired a lot of knowledge. They went to school for a number of years. And they specialize in veterinarian care. However, just taking your puppy or your dog to the vet for a checkup is not the same thing as doing DNA health testing, right? So, your vet will probably, you know, look on the outside. Um, or the external surface of your dog or your puppy. And not really, um, check for, um, things that could be, um, genetically passed down to that puppy or to that dog. So, uh, sometimes we don't talk about a lot of the things that we have gone through, but we have lost thousands of dollars, um, due to, you know, our ignorance, you know, being great behind the ears, not knowing what we didn't know when we needed to know it. And that costed us a lot of money. So, yes, it is important and it should be required, honestly, um, for you to be health testing dogs, especially the parents, you know, at least help test the parents of the dogs that you're breeding. That way, you know, you're not selling people, um, genetically, um, mutated puppies or dogs or even dogs with disorders. That's very important. Okay. Um, is DNA testing overrated or non-negotiable? Let me know what you guys think. I don't think DNA testing is overrated. I don't think, um, you know, it's something that should be minimized or looked over. And I think, in my opinion, it's non-negotiable. Now, is DNA testing expensive? Yes, it is. It's very, very, very expensive, but we have health, health DNA tested every dog on our yard. We know all of the genetics. We know, um, all of, you know, the health or, um, however you want to classify it, baby. We know everything that is going on with, I don't want to say everything. I don't want to say everything because that's subjective. Um, our dogs, uh, we did a six panel health DNA test on all of our dogs. Let me say that because there are, um, extensive panels out there. But as you guys know, we choose to DNA test with animal genetics because they have a quick turnaround. Okay. So next question, you guys, structure versus color and which one rules? What do you guys think? Structure versus color. And I see we have 12 people in the chat. To be honest, y'all, that's really, that was the goal tonight. What is up, Faith? Michelle said non-negotiable must be done before breeding to better. Yeah. To better the breed. Yes. Yes. I agree with Michelle. I so agree. Yeah. We want a better to breed. We don't want to make it worse. But what do y'all think about, oh, nice. Oh, hold on. Y'all. We got, we have another, um, controversy, um, answer. And then we're going to move on to our second controversy. Okay. So if you're just tuning in, I asked structure versus color. And which one rules. So Nas said structure. And Michelle agreed with Nas and said structure. Y'all, I agree. I agree. Because once you have structure, you can breed in color. But a lot of times, you know, as breeders, and I'm going to put, I'm going to classify, you know, us, um, in this conversation as well. In this controversy as well. Because when we first started, we was all, I'm not going to say all. Because we started with structured dogs. Charm is very structured. In my opinion, he is one of the best structured Frenchies I've ever seen, like, in life. He's very, very, very structured. We have a fine male. We love him. He was our first Frenchie. When we got him as a puppy, we had no idea Charm was going to turn out to be such an amazing stud. Although he's retired now. But he turned out to be an amazing stud. We saw his dad. We saw his, um, his mom. We saw his mom in person. But we also asked for pictures of his dad. We wanted to see the litter announcement. We wanted to know how many previous litters his mom had had. And Charm turned out amazing. Y'all, at year two, Charm kind of morphed into this, like, muscle beam. Literally, like, once he hit two, he just, he started to feel out more. His muscles popped. His head rounded out. He was a completely different dog. So, I agree with you. Um, both Nas and Michelle. Structure over color. Okay. We have made the mistake. A very expensive mistake. A $4,500 mistake. Um, chasing color. And that backfired on us. Needless to say, that dog is no longer here with us. So, yes. Um, health. Health DNA. All day, every day. Then structure. Then color. Okay. Let's move on to controversy number two. And I'm going to put it in the chat for you guys. Um, let me type it up. Type it up. Start it up. Okay. So, controversy number two. Is. Oh, the money debate. The money debate. Okay. Okay. All right. So, y'all know we are. There was Sharon Frenchie Readers. Home of the 3K pup. And not everybody agrees that French Bulldogs should cost $3,000. Not everybody agrees. So, now let's move on to the second controversy. I'm going to put it in the chat right now. All right. All right. All right. How much do you think healthy, structured, well-colored French Bulldogs should cost? Should they be $3,000 and up or not? And tell me why. Actually, I'm going to put the link to the chat on, um, well, the guest link to the chat, um, in the comments. Because I actually want a breeder or an aspiring breeder to come on and debate me on this. Because, y'all, we get a lot of flack. We really do. We get a lot of flack. And I think we're on the more affordable end of things. But people, um, say our prices are too high. Some people say our prices are too high. And I say majority of us breeders like color. Yeah, we do. We like a variety of things. But, y'all, if that dog is affected with something, not infected, but affected with something, or even is a carrier of something, you just got to be mindful, y'all. You just got to be mindful. But, Nas, since you are a breeder, and I think this is our first time, um, talking to you. Actually, not sure how you find our channel, but welcome, welcome, welcome. I would love to chat it up with you if you want to debate, um, prices. And give the people, uh, a deeper look. Okay, so, y'all, back to controversy number two. Okay, so, is $3,000 too expensive for a standard Frenchie? And when I mean standard, when I say standard, I mean not a fluffy carrier. Um, you know, clean genetics, no disorders of any sort. And it's just a beautiful dog. Um, not a big rope, not a fluffy, not a merle, just a standard, colored, and structured Frenchie. It's $3,000 too much. Let me know. Let me know. And, um, if it is too much, how much should a standard Frenchie be? Um, I want to know. Um, and just for a little background, y'all, we are based in Houston, Texas. Texas has a lot of breeders. You know, we are surrounded by Dallas and all standing San Antonio and cities like that. Even, uh, the bordering states of Louisiana, y'all, they selling dogs for about 10K, 20K out there. So, is 3K too much or, you know, um, is what people are saying off of? Let me know. Let me know. Um, I will give you guys my opinion as you are catching up in the chat in the stream. So, while we price our dogs at 3K, um, and when I say 3K, that's not to say that all of them are 3K. Let me, let me make that, let me make that clear, right? So, that's our bottom line, 3K. And I respect, um, YouTube's guidelines. You know, we don't really talk about prices or, um, anything like that over the channel. We did, we did before. But, um, social media guidelines are changing literally every day and we want to respect YouTube. So, I'll just be very general with my, um, answers and my responses. But, Nas is saying, no, it's not you. You are in the right ballpark. It should be 3K and up. Okay. Yeah, we are, we are not crazy. And I'm actually going to explain why we have priced our dogs at 3K, um, and up. Okay. Michelle said, I know it's a little small, but I'm going to read it for you guys. Michelle said, good bred dogs are going to cost more. Frenchies are expensive to breed and the breeder put so much time into raising the litter. They show quality, what, the show, excuse me, the show quality cane corso is going to cost me $4,000. So, Michelle and Nas, thank you so much for your input. And that is also what I wanted to hone in on. You guys, a lot of people who don't, um, breed dogs who are only buyers or who are only dog lovers, they might not know how much really, like, how much money, how much time, how much sacrifice goes into breeding dogs. That's why we show y'all behind the scenes. We go live often and we really show you guys what it takes to, um, get a litter on the ground and off the ground into their new homes. Now we don't talk about money often, but here's why we price our pups starting at three, right? If you have to purchase a mama dog, if you have to purchase a stud, even if you have to purchase stud feet, like, uh, like inquire the cost of, um, purchasing a stud session or, um, or shipping semen, right? Yeah. All of that costs, all of that costs. People don't understand. It costs a lot of money to have semen sipped. Um, y'all get, get me together. It costs a lot of money to have semen shipped to you, right? It costs a lot of money. If you don't have a stud in house to actually like inquire a stud service. And then nine times out of 10, you might not just breed your dog once, right? So if you don't have a stud in house, you are going to be acquiring a lot of fees just to breed your mama dog. That's why we encourage you guys to have your own studs, right? So, um, a lot of people chase different colors, different structures and things like things like that. So they might have to go outside of their house, but that's why we encourage you guys to be so sufficient because it is, it can be so costly when you're chasing trains. Um, and nothing's wrong with trains. Um, nothing is wrong with, you know, uh, breeding big ropes. Nothing is wrong with you breeding for color. Nothing is wrong with you breeding for structure. All of that is great. We do that. But at the end of the day, if you are going to be breeding to break even, is it really worth it? Right? Um, a lot of times us as breeders, we don't talk about the behind the scenes, um, like the financial piece of it. I have a spreadsheet that I can show you guys right now, and it will literally blow your mind. How much we actually spend on breeding necessities alone. So when you are talking to clients and when you are negotiating your prices, yeah, let your price be your price. I even hate to say negotiating prices, but let your price be your price. If that customer does not believe in you and your program, then, you know, still maintain your professionalism. Wish them well, but move on to the next potential client, um, or our customer. Because if you're just breaking even or you're actually losing money, it's not worth it, y'all. Because we're running a business here. Like, yes, we love our dogs. We love our puppies. We hate to see our puppies leave. But at the end of the day, we are not just breeding just to say we have puppies. We're breeding for profit, right? And profit is what you have left over after the expenses are paid. So, um, and that's not even to talk about the software that you might be using for your business. Whether it is accounting software, whether it is streaming software, like the software that I'm using now. Whether, um, you are paying for ads on Instagram. Whether you are paying for ads on YouTube. Y'all, there are so many expenses that goes into breeding. But let me know if y'all agree. I ain't gonna spend too long, um, on that topic. Because it's, um, almost time to move on. But let me get to some comments. Thank you, Slaylele. I love your name, by the way. But Michelle K said, you get what you pay for. A cheaper and she's going to have health issues, most likely. I didn't even have to say it. I didn't want to say it, actually. I didn't want to say it. But, y'all, we have seen dogs being sold in our community for $200. I'm not, y'all. I kid you not. $200. Like, y'all. Six, six months from now, nine months from now, that dog is going to tell your house up. Because, like, there's no way that dog has good temperament. It's no way. Um, and I won't, I won't, you know, speak too much on the mix of the breed of, of those particular, uh, puppies for sale. But it's no way that those little puppies would have good temperament. And, um, Brainwire says, sure does. So, I'm not sure at what point you are agreeing. But if you can, um, when you guys leave comments, try to give some context. Um, so, even, even people joining late might understand, um, what you're commenting on. Now, I said, by the way, Fetty G from SSK told me about you. Shout out to Fetty, y'all. Fetty literally, um, we've been watching Fetty for a while. But Fetty shouted us out a while back and it literally, um, kind of jump-started our YouTube growth. And now, you know, with a lot of hard work and dedication, we are monetized. But shout out to Fetty. Thank you so much, Nas, for being here. Okay. Y'all, we got two minutes. Um, and I'm going to round out controversy number two. So, let me put it back on the screen for those of you who may have just joined us. And we're talking about, um, the price debate. What you should price your puppies at. So, why we choose to price our puppies, um, and what others say about it. So, our puppies start at three, um, for standards. For standards. And what people have said about our pricing and our program is that they are, what is up, Mac? What is up, Mac? Thank you so much for joining us. We're talking about money right now. And we're getting ready to move on to controversy, um, three. But people have said that our prices are too high. And then, y'all, believe it or not, some veterans, some veteran clients that we have, they said our prices are too low. Now, you know you are breeding quality when someone looks at your puppies. Like, I, when I say someone, I mean like a buyer. When a buyer looks at your puppies and they're like, oh no, like I was ready to pay more. Like, I have cash right now. I was ready to pay more. I was expecting you to say much more than the price that, like, you're offering. That's when you know, like, quality over everything. And although we do have those conversations, you know, with people, we entertain the, um, the thoughtful conversations of us going up on our prices right now. We're, we're in a soft spot. I feel like we have very competitive prices. And, you know, with more time, more experience and more specialty looks of our litters, you know, in the future, we probably will go up on our pricing. But right now we feel very confident in what we're offering. And I don't feel, um, like we're in like at any disadvantage with our pricing. And my husband doesn't feel that, um, as well. So all I say is be patient when you have litters, mark it beforehand. Don't wait until your mom has the puppies. Start announcing your litters, you know, have great marketing and, um, people will chase you down. The puppies will be out before they even hit the ground. All right. So y'all it's 3 30. We are moving on to our unfiltered Q and a, um, segment. You can literally access anything, um, for 10 minutes. Well, nine minutes now, and then we will get back to the controversy. Okay. So what, uh, what is up Mac boss? What is up Mac boss? Y'all Mac is so funny. Listen, listen. Okay. So, um, as I am waiting on you guys to put your comments and questions in the chat, I'm going to read Mac's comment. Mac said, y'all prices are just fine. However, your prices aren't prices. If you choose to go up, it is what it is. Exactly. So let's spend, let's spend a little minute on this. Um, my husband has the boys y'all. So, you know, I'm out playing today. Do y'all like my little Frenchy mug? I know we got some Cane Corso lovers on the chat. We got some bully lovers on the chat, but y'all know we all about the Frenchies. Okay. So let me, um, attend to Mac's comment. Y'all your prices are your prices. No, I never hear anybody complaining about Amazon's prices. I never hear anybody, um, going, you know, call up the CEO or the owner of Walmart and complaining about Walmart's prices. I never hear someone in Verizon's store complaining about the prices of Apple products or iPhones, anything like that. Because you know, when you buy an iPhone, you know what you're going to get. Like, you know, it's quality. So even though the prices are expensive, you don't really complain about it because you know what you're getting. Now on the flip side of that, if you don't know what you're getting, I understand why you might complain. I do. If you haven't done your research or your proper due diligence, I can understand why you might complain. But if you really knew the cost that it, it takes to even get puppies on the ground, right? C-sections are expensive. Vitamins are expensive. And I'm not talking about just folic acid because we give, um, multivitamins along with folic acid to our pregnant mamas. The moment they, um, step into heat the moment. And those, uh, little pill bottles are like $60 for 60 pills. So, so that y'all, and we have five mamas. We don't show all of our dogs. We like our dogs to stand out. You know, it's dream and Burberry's time. So that's why you see a lot of dream and you see a little, you know, you see a little bit of a Burberry. Um, but the mama is the star. We learned that along the way of our journey. Um, quick segue into that too. I know Michelle has a question. Michelle has a question, but quick segue into why the mama is the star. I never understood this. So look y'all, um, when we first started doing like our little promotions, I put the dad ex-mom, like when we first started and, um, nobody corrected me on that. No breeders corrected me on that. And as I was doing some, um, research and, you know, just like getting down into the nitty gritty of how you present yourself as a breeder and how you properly announce the litter. I learned that the mom's name goes first. So it's dream times Burberry. Y'all let me know if y'all agree with it or let me know if y'all knew that. But that is why when you announce a litter, you announce the mom's name first, right? Cause she is carrying this litter. She's doing all the heavy lifting, right? So you celebrate the mom and then you just add at the end, you know, he, he did his little work, but the mom is doing all the work. But let me know if y'all agree with that. Okay. So let's see, we have, we have five more minutes and then we're going to move into our controversy number three, but let me get to Michelle K's question. And then Mike's Michelle said, do you recommend DNA testing the puppy? So the new owners know what they're buying? Absolutely. But, but look, Michelle, um, DNA testing can be really, really, really expensive. We have reached the point in our business where we DNA test for coat and color. Um, we DNA test all the puppies for coat and color. That helps us price them appropriately. When we first got started and we had already invested $45,000 into starting our dog breeding program before we saw a puppy or a penny back, baby, we weren't DNA testing all of the puppies. We would only DNA test our keepers. Um, but now we're at a point in our program where we've learned more. We want to be more competitive and we want to know what we're selling. And we also want to know what we could possibly keep. So you never want to be in a situation where you sell a puppy and then like six months, nine months down the line, or even a year down the line, you like you, you having heart pains, like you having heart palpitations because you should not have sold that puppy because now this puppy has matured into this beautiful, you know, little mama or this wonderful stud. And you're like, Oh my God, I just sold this puppy for three, four, 5,000, but I could have made 20, 40, 60, 80, a hundred K, you know, um, from this one little puppy. But, um, yes, we have stepped into the new phase of our business where we DNA test all of the puppies. We've already DNA tested for coat and color. All of our, um, working dogs are all of the dogs in our yard. And we have also, um, health tested them too for, um, any potential disorders. Okay. Yeah. I didn't know my husband was in the chair. Him and the boys were taking a nap, but I guess he is up and he is ready for the, for the smoke baby. Okay. So we have three minutes and then we'll move on to controversy. Number three. Hopefully you guys are enjoying this type of content. If you are, please like the live. Um, if you don't know how to like the live, all you have to do is click the three little, um, like parallel buttons at the top, right of your screen. And, um, or I think it's easier than that. You just scroll down a little bit and like a lot. I think it's very easy. Yeah. Yeah. If you. Okay. We back in action. Yeah. I gotta, I gotta chill. Okay. Let me move on. Mom, Michelle, I hope I answered your question. Let's see. Max said, I just sold a Pomeranian this morning for AK when I was trying to get it off for 2,500 folks said it was too cheap. It's all about who you're dealing with. Congratulations, Mac. Mac, you're keeping secrets from us. You, you are keeping secrets from us. You never told us that, uh, you had Pomeranians, sir. Okay. That's why we need to, um, go live more and get to know y'all because y'all be keeping secrets. We, we just got it all out there for y'all to see all the business and y'all just, y'all ain't right. But anyway, moving on to, um, to Nas. Nas said, always announce the mom first. That's right. We learn, Nas. We learn. We learn. Okay. So Mac really want the smoke today, y'all. And I have one minute, one minute to address Mac. Mac said, would you sell Barry? What, but how much? I'm just playing. No, y'all. Um, Barry is our foundational stud right now. Although he is a fluffy big rope. Um, we are using Barry as our foundation until our standard muscular creamy fine, um, stud is up and ready to go. So he is seven months now. He's not quite ready, but in five months, your boy will be looking like a charm. And when I say charm, I say that intentionally because that is actually charms sun. So I will pull up a picture of charm really quickly. Y'all know any, any chance you girl get, baby, she going to talk about charm, baby. She going to talk about charm. Any, any chance I get, baby, I will talk about charm. So this is charm. And we actually kept alpha off of charms first and only litter with mama blue who y'all seen last night. I think, yeah, I grew in blue last night. Um, but y'all charmers retired now. His son said batter up, batter up, batter up. Oh, y'all we are so excited. Now let us get into controversy number three. Let me know if you like charm y'all. Oh, that's my baby. That's my baby. Y'all love some charm and I love dream and I love blue and I love blossom and I love nostalgia and daydream and Barry. Of course we love all of our dogs, but you know, your first and then your first two, they just, they just hold a very, um, special place in your heart, but, um, no problem about it. Frenchies. We know you love us. We know. And Michelle said, yes, she did answer my question. Okay. You guys. So, um, we are moving right along. I'm sure my husband is proud of me because I'm actually staying on, um, task today and he has the boys and, um, and the baby. So I definitely want to be mindful of the time. Um, okay. So now I actually want to move on to controversy number three. If y'all want to come on the chat, definitely let me know. Uh, I don't think I pinned, uh, I don't think I pinned the, um, let me pin it now. Uh, oh, wrong one. Okay. Let me pin the, um, guest link you guys. So y'all can come on the chat and I'm going to get into controversy number three. All right. So let's do it. Controversy number three is repeat breeding. Is it smart or is it lazy? Should you repeat a litter? If it hit, if it hit, should you repeat a litter? What, what y'all think? Let me know. Let me know. Um, y'all we're only going to be live for maybe another hour. Hmm. No, 45 minutes, another 45 minutes. Um, we are planning to end this live chat at 4 30 PM central standard time today. So I'm definitely, um, striving to be intentional with the conversation today. Okay. So controversy number two, is it smart or is it, I mean three, is it smart or is it lazy to repeat a breeding? Which I think we've never done this actually. Um, we've never repeated a breeding, but let me know what y'all think. Wait, Michelle, are you saying, are you saying it's smart or lazy? What are you saying? I think yes. What are you saying? Yes. What are you saying? Yes. What Michelle said? I think yes. If you got some really good pups with the pairing. Okay. Let's see. I will tell y'all, um, my opinion. Okay. So let me go back to the question. Okay. Should you repeat a breeding if it hit and is it smart or is it lazy? Y'all I'm not going to lie to you. Okay. Michelle saying it's smart. I think it's smart. I think it's smart to repeat a breeding if it hit y'all, if we could have, uh, bred blue with charm again, like, I don't even have to say it. I don't even have to say it. If we could have bred a muscle bound female, a beautiful muscle bound female, that is a fluffy carrier and has 10 points, covers cream is lilac coverage, like with a muscular bound male. Of course we would have done it. Yeah. Those puppies sold themselves. She had six. We lost two, but those puppies sold themselves. We, I mean, for the love of marketing and for the love of photography and videography, we marketed those puppies, but the moment those puppies, like we announced those puppies, y'all done, done. Like people were crying and I'm not saying this to boast or brag and y'all know my heart, but my husband, um, can tell y'all the people were crying because they could not get the puppy that they wanted to because they sold so fast. So, um, it's a blessing. I'm trying to, um, go back to Instagram. Let me show y'all. I'm trying to go back to Instagram and show y'all, um, of 2025 earlier this year. You guys look, look at how beautiful, like, look at this, look at how beautiful this is alpha. By the way, this is charm son. I wasn't going to show y'all, but that's look where he little no more, but that's little alpha. Um, look at how beautiful this litter was. You guys, she had five boys and one, um, female little miss legacy right here with the white blaze. Y'all that puppy went so fast. Uh, a husband was actually trying to surprise his wife, um, with legacy. We, I'm saying names, but y'all don't know what we named them. Um, but this was the legacy litter. So all of them had like very, um, like strong, um, legacy names, but we named our only female legacy. So we had alpha legacy, legend, omega, ultra who passed away and deuce, um, who also passed away, but Oh my goodness. Y'all look at how beautiful the photos. Like I didn't even have to do much y'all beautiful little puppies. Absolutely gorgeous. Look at this female. Like, what are we seeing right now? She sold herself like what, like what y'all if we could have kept them all, we probably would have tried to, but anyway, I say all of that to say that you just never know, um, what litter it will be that could completely change your life and your whole program. Okay. So I don't think it is lazy to repeat a breeding. If we could, um, breed blue again with charm, we definitely would charm is retired now and blue is a fluffy carrier. So we were literally saving her last breed for a fluffy. We had no idea that we would inherit Mr. Burberry. We had no idea that charm would be retired. So that's why also when you're running a breeding program, you need to be flexible because we plan all of our breedings, but you just never know like what could be down the road. You, you, you never know, um, what possibilities will open themselves up to you and your business. So just, you know, try to be open-minded. Okay. Um, Michelle, yes, you understood the question, hon. All right. Let me see what we add on time. You guys. Okay. No, we're good. We're good. We're good on time. Okay. Max said, what are you selling your pups before you see how they turn out? You might have that diamond in the roof. Mac. Y'all, he literally just summarized this segment because our last litter, not the litter that we have on ground, but our January 25, 25 litter. Y'all, it, it just changed how I view breeding because those are the things that you pray for. Like we haven't even been breeding a year. Yeah. It might shock y'all, but we have not even been breeding Frenchies a year. Although my journey started in 2016 with English Bulldogs, um, I didn't even get to see the breeding because my English was, you know, stolen, but dream deferred, right? Um, a no doesn't mean never. And, um, the now does not mean, you know, um, never. And I, I, I firmly believe that, but now we're breeding Frenchies and we haven't even been breeding a year. Um, dream just had our third litter and we just bred blossom who will be our fourth. And we also just bred blue who will be our, who will be our fifth. Um, that is also why our prices are structured how they are. We haven't been breeding a year. Um, our year is coming up in September actually. And by that time we will have bred five litters, which is absolutely crazy to say, but, um, Mac is right about that diamond in the roof. Y'all little legacy. Oh Jesus. Y'all even alpha. I mean, thank God we kept him, but alpha omega legend, like all of them are so special and they went to great homes. So we, you know, we, um, we can see them when we want to, or if we want to, but blue and dream y'all, they produce some fire litters, like absolutely amazing. Okay. Let's move on. Let's move on. Oh, before we move on, let me say that, say this, even if you repeat a breeding, it doesn't guarantee that that second litter is going to hit like that first one. So, so that's the risk in doing a repeat breeding. That first litter could have hit hard, right? Those puppies probably, you know, sold themselves. You know, you had to do a little marketing, you know, they just amazing. But that second litter of that same breeding could be absolutely, I don't want to say disastrous because if you breed quality, you're going to get quality, but it might not hit how the first you hit. Um, a lot of business people like to say scare, scarcity sales. Um, so if you know, your clientele know that, Hey, like, if I don't get it, if I don't get it now, I might not be able to get it again. So let me get it now. But if they know, okay, well, they just going to have the same type of litter next time I can wait, I can wait, you know, it's no need for me to, you know, uh, rush and, and put down a deposit or anything like that. Cause it's going to be the same type of dogs next time. You know, you want to switch it up. You definitely want to be competitive. Okay. So now let's get into the business talk. Um, the hustle that nobody wants to talk about. Mind you, this is a good opportunity for me to talk about my hustle shirt, y'all. So I actually made this shirt today, um, in honor of our first episode of our podcast, check out the back, check out the back, check out the back, check out the back. But, um, I wanted to make this hustle shirt to honor our podcast because, you know, humble beginnings, y'all humble beginnings. Um, we are venturing out to do something different that we haven't seen done before yet again. Um, as you got, well, some of you may know, we just monetize our YouTube channel. We are so thankful. Our goal was actually September 2nd, um, on my birthday, but we monetize before. So, so God be the glory for that. I'm so thankful that we are finally monetized. I know sometimes it might be a little annoying to see ads, baby. We apologize, but, um, we are definitely trying to fund the pups, you know, get some of that 45 back, baby, that we invested. Okay. So, um, let me see, let me see what Mac said, y'all. And then Peyton said something too. Mac said, you're going to have IG me some links for English wudogs. You're going to have Mac. What you just said? Mac said, you're going to have me some links for English wudogs. What you mean Mac? Peyton said, um, uh, I know Peyton, I didn't realize it it's next Friday, but thank you for telling. Thank you for telling me. Okay. You guys. So I'm three minutes behind our next segment on business talk. Let's talk about the breeder hustle. Nobody likes to talk about the real cost of raising pups. Okay. We kind of hinted toward it, um, a little bit earlier, but I didn't really throw out numbers. You guys, do y'all want to see the spreadsheet or not? Save that for a whole nother live. I could save it for another live, but let's, um, let's pull out the calculator. I love doing this, um, to show people how much puppies are really worth. I love doing this. Okay. So let's pull out the calculator. I'm going to see if I can put my phone on the screen so that y'all can see. Um, so it's there, but it's not active. Okay. Boom. It's there. Okay. So y'all can't see what I'm doing, but I will definitely show you in a second exactly what I'm doing behind the scenes. Okay. Boom. So the phone is there. Let's do some math y'all. All right. So let's pull up the calculator. I don't know what a calculator is in my phone. So I'll just do this. People might not understand why you price your dogs and what you price your dogs at, but I'm going to, I'm about to make it very, very, very plain. Okay. So let's talk actual prices. Now, if you're going to breed, right, you need to start with a mama dog. So let's say your mama dog is 4,000. All right. Boom. Regardless of what breed you are breeding. Let's just say for an example, your mama dog is 4,000. Let's say you are, for this example, let's say you have a stud in-house, right? Let's say your stud is 45. All right. Boom. That's already $85,000 out the gate. It doesn't matter if you purchase those dogs as pets. Now they are breeding dogs. Now they are working dogs. So you're already out $8,500 to start with. Okay. Um, and then it's going to take some time, right? It's going to take at least a year, year and a half, two years to bring those puppies up and to raise them up so that they can be breeding dogs. I'm not even going to put in the cost of food and, um, DNA health testing and, um, vet bills and things like that. I'm only going to be talking about breeding right now because I don't want to like underestimate or overestimate those things, but we're at 85 now, right? Okay. So, um, to breed these dogs, right? Not to feed them, but to breed them, right? If you take your dogs to the vet, an AI or a TCI could run you about 250. Okay. And we like to do two or three. So that's at least 500 right there. So plus 500. Okay. Now we're at 9,000. Hold on one second, Peyton. Okay. Now we're at, now we're at 9,000, right? That's just to breed them. The puppies aren't even here yet. So, oh, and I didn't even talk about vitamins. So let's do a hundred dollars for vitamins for the mom and let's do another 50 for the dad. Right? So now we're at 9,150. All right, cool. Um, a little shot of $10,000. Um, if you estimate dog food, if you estimate vet bills, if you estimate DNA testing, y'all DNA testing is so expensive. 220. Okay. 220 per dog for a full panel. Now we're at 95, 90, um, dog food for the pregnancy, not even a year or two to bring the dog up dog food for, um, the pregnancy. I'll say, let's just say $50 to feed to the, Oh, wait, let's go back to the history. Okay. $50. Oh, okay. 9640. Okay. Um, C-section. Let's say C-sections y'all depending on what vet you go to your C-section could be anywhere from and, and also depending on how much your Frenchie weighs, because y'all one vet that we work with, they do, they price their C-section based on the dog's weight. So let's say your C-section is $800. That's planned. Right. But you also want to have some money in the cut for, um, um, an emergency C-section, which could be double the price, but we're just going to say it's planned. You know, mama is healthy. Nothing is wrong. Plan. Y'all. You, you have already surpassed $10,000 just to get your puppies on the ground. And that is if you are living in a perfect world, right? So what we like to do is we like to, um, sum total of all of our expenses of that particular litter, right? Divided by two. And that is what you should be pricing your puppies at. That should be the bare minimum that you are selling your puppies for. Now, again, to each his own. And as I said, our puppies and our opinion are underpriced and people have also told us that, but this is how much your French bulldog litter or your, your French bulldog puppy is worth, depending on some of the numbers that we put in and we left a lot out. So I just wanted to, um, to do that really quickly to show you guys how easy it is for you to run a vet bills, how easy it is for you to, um, incur certain costs. And again, that is if everything goes as planned, that's not even if your mom needs an emergency C-section. Okay. So let me know if y'all agree with that or disagree with that, but let me look at the, the, uh, price again, the tag again to see how much we should be pricing these puppies at 52, not 52. Okay. And we home of the three K. Okay. I'm just being funny. I'm just being funny. Okay. So now it is, uh, four o'clock. Okay. Another, um, thing people don't talk about is burnout. People don't talk about how many breeders start breeding. And after a long day at work, you come home and let's say your dogs got into all the dog booze or they didn't tow your house up or, um, y'all, this is actually happening or a stud has mismated, has naturally tied with one of your females. I was in heat and people have already paid you deposits for a particular breeding. And now this stud that messed up your whole, your whole plans or your whole business for this litter because of a misty. Um, people don't talk about that stuff. It happens. Um, and that is also why we keep our dogs very contained. Now we don't like our dogs to be in cages. And I know a lot of times when we're filming, you know, y'all might see them put up, but if my husband is in there, he's either in there to check on them or to clean. So it'll be very hard for him to clean the floors. If he has eight Frenchies running around, jumping around, marking up cages and, um, taking, you know, taking dumps or, or choosing to pee, um, in areas that he is cleaning. So again, um, to each his own, it's a lot of controversy on, you know, cages and kennels and couches. There's a lot of controversy around that topic, but our dogs are very well trained and we like to keep their environments very clean and sanitize. So we, um, they have their play times, um, but we also have our cleaning and confining times as well. Um, and, and, oh Jesus, especially when our females are in heat. So just like we just had dream who, um, just gave birth to a beautiful litter. Now blossom and, and mama blue are in heat. So you don't, people don't talk about this stuff. You don't want, you don't want to have your male studs just out and about baby, you know, just roaming around while your females are in heat. Y'all that could cause a whole lot of problems, like a whole lot of problems. And we already have a deposit on a puppy for blossoms litter who is not even here yet. But needless to say, you, you, you just don't want that. Y'all you don't want the confusion now. Okay. We're going to move on. We're going to move on. Okay. But let me know if y'all understand what I'm saying, because people don't talk about that at all. People don't talk about, um, how easy it is for dogs to naturally tie. And now you didn't mess up your whole breeding because, um, you wanted the dogs to, to be free. Okay. I was just pulling the string back up to make sure, and we already have a deposit. Let me unplug it. I was pulling the string back up to make sure the, um, audio is okay. All right. Moving on you guys. Um, another topic that breeders also don't talk about is the loss of sleep. Um, the loss of family time, you're not being able to travel a lot of things that people don't see behind the scenes, which is also why we go live and we have like real life conversations with you guys about breeders burnout, which is very, very, very real. I love editing content. I love showing, you know, my creative side, but we have two kids under two. We have eight Frenchies and we have five puppies at this juncture. It's no way possible. I could be going live every day with my, with my family or with our family, be putting out edited content, you know, um, trying to help out when I can with my husband. Although y'all, my husband literally runs our business. Like I applaud him so much because since we've had our last son, he has literally been super hands-on with the dogs. He he whelps them. He cleans them. He takes them out. He make, he make sure, um, that every, every dog has everything that they need. And now I'm more behind the scenes, like, um, more hands-on with the content, but shout out to my husband. If you have help, use it. Yeah. If you have adult kids, use them. Okay. Even if you have a little bigger babies, use them because breeders burnout is very real and people tend to not talk about that. And, um, when I say burnout, a lot of people might look at burnout differently, but burnout is simply put like this. You're putting your heart, your sweat and your whole soul into everything that you're doing, but you're seeing literal return. Right? So instead of you being excited now to wake up and breed or we'll, or take care of your dogs. Now it's like, you, you kind of like regret it. It's like, why am I doing this? Like, I'm not, I'm not selling the puppies for, um, what I want to sell them for. Nobody's liking my post on Instagram or Tik TOK or YouTube. I'm putting out videos. Nobody's liking them. Nobody's watching them. And then you tend to get burnt out, but let's say you were still working that hard. Right. And everybody's liking your content. I mean, anytime you put something out, it's going viral. Um, your, your social media channels are growing. Your puppies are selling, you are seeing profit and not lost in your business. So now you're excited about what you're doing. And that is the complete opposite of breeders burnout. Um, Oh, Eric said, that's me right now. I'm so sorry, Eric. I'm, I'm really, really sorry. Y'all. We, we definitely want to send Eric some encouragement because breeders burnout is real. It's real. Um, Eric hit us up after the live chat. Nas said W, W husband, W dad. Nas, what you mean? Winner husband, winner dad. Let me know. I don't want to, uh, I don't want to assume, but Eric hit us up after the live chat because breeders burnout is real. And you know, it, there are so many breeders, but it's like, we're so disconnected from one another instead of us coming together to encourage each other or to, you know, resolve issues together or ask questions and things like that. We look at each other as competition and everybody's going in every which way, but that's not how it should be. Us as breeders, we should agree to come together. You know, we should agree to, um, you know, like speak on different topics, have people to call and say, Hey, I'm having this issue. My dog, what do you think? Or I've reached this point in my business where some of the OG dogs might have to get rehomed. Um, that's also why we love communing with you guys. And we love, um, these opportunities to get your feedback. We don't just go live just for the sake of going live. Like we actually love connecting with breeders and getting you guys' feedback on certain things because, um, we've also reached a point in our business where, you know, everybody can't stay, unfortunately. And, you know, if you're no longer working, yes, you're serving us as, as our pets and as our companions. But if you're no longer working, you know, a working dog could possibly be in your place. And that's going to be a very sad day when dogs that we've had for years, you know, have to find a new home. But that's the point of our business that we're reaching. It's like, if we continue to breed, not everybody will be able to stay. So, so now who leaves, right? Like, how do you get rid of, or how do you even, I don't want to say it like that, but how do you re-home the very first French bulldog you ever bought as a family? Like how, how, how in your heart do you do that? Um, people don't talk about that. Um, but that's where we are in our business. And we like to come in with breeders. We like to get you guys' opinion. Um, Nas has some great comments. Nas said, winner, husband, dad, yes, that's what I meant. Thank you, Nas. Nas said, it's a lot of politics in the breed, in the breeder world. Seriously, it is a lot of politics. It is a lot of politics. And normally, um, if you don't have a large following, um, you're not heard, but we don't agree with that. We definitely don't want to, don't agree with that. And that's why we are building this platform for breeders, you know, to stand on and say, I have a voice, whether I have two followers or 10,000 followers, I have a voice and I have, I have a serious input and I want to share that, um, with other breeders or aspiring breeders. Okay. Now I said, that's why it's so hard for us to come together, but it's okay. Nas, we literally said, and French is like cute. I see a comment. We literally said, if there are 12 people on this podcast, we're going to give it our all. We only wanted 12. We thank you for the 14. We're thankful for the 14, but we only wanted 12 because y'all, if Jesus changed the world with 12 disciples, all we need is look 12 breeders to come together and say, y'all let's change the world, right? It's possible. It's so possible. Y'all I'm a dreamer. Um, don't mind me at all, but that's the revelation. Like if, if the world was changed with 12, why can't 12 breeders come together? How, how dangerous would that be? If 12 breeders around the world came together and united and said, Hey, Hey bro, you want to work with this stud? I got this stud. You want to work with this female? I got this female. Like you, you need this color or coat. I got it. How dangerous would that be? If 12 breeders came together and just shared, shared the yard or mixed and mingled, or, you know, came up with different ideas and, and, um, marketing strategies and liked each other's posts, shared each other's posts. Like, what are we talking about? I know we're not still working against each other in 2025. Can't be. All right. Um, Frenchies are cute. Say it. Should I join the link? Frenchies are cute. Um, we are moving to controversy number four. If you want to come on and give your input on, let me put it in the chat. Let me put it in the chat. Um, only if you want to give your input, um, the last five minutes will be just open-ended questions, but we are going very structured today. So, um, I want to stay on task. So let me put, y'all didn't put controversy number three in the, um, chat. Let me put, no, we're on four. No controversy. Number four. Y'all, we are actually doing really well on time. We have, um, about 15 minutes before we wrap it up. I know my husband is proud of me. Okay. So now let's talk about pet homes. I kind of hinted toward it. Let's talk about pet homes versus breeding rights and what's fair. People don't talk about this, but let's talk about it. All right. So wait, wait, y'all wait, I gotta, wait, I gotta get to max. Uh, I gotta get to max. Uh, I gotta get to max coming. Mac don't say that's too much personality. Okay. Don't say that Mac, because that is why we don't get along. Now the breed breeders have to figure out how to come together. Y'all we have to max. That is too much personality. Now I said you are cooking right now. Yes. 12 breeders should be able to change the game. Mac and Nas, y'all need to talk. Y'all need to exchange numbers because Mac is lacking right now. I'm just playing. I'm just, I'm, I'm kidding y'all. I'm a jokester. Okay. I'm just picking on Mac, but let's get into controversy. Number four, pet homes versus, versus breeding rights. What is fair? Another thing that breeders don't talk about is pet homes, right? Or breeding, right? If somebody pays full price for your little baby, do they deserve full rights? And I'm going to preface this con, this, this question with some very important parameters, right? Let's say blue, for example, is about to have her third and final litter in our yard. Yes, you can breed a dog three or four times, depending on the health of the dog and what your goals are. Right. But in our yard, we are breeding blue three times and we will retire her and then re-home her because like we said, everybody can't stay. Um, we have eight Frenchies right now. The goal is to condense down to six, to have four working mamas and to have two working studs. Now that's going to be very, very hard considering we have retired some, you know, we have retired an OG that we absolutely love. And now mama blue is coming up on her retirement as well. Um, someone asked this question, um, after another live stream and we didn't have time to get to it. If, if, if, and when we get to the point where we have to re-home dogs, should you get them fixed? Well, they asked us, do we get them fixed? And I said, no. So look at it this way, y'all. If we could avoid surgery by all costs, we're going to avoid surgery. We don't want to, um, if, if our Frenchies could have their puppies naturally and somebody could guarantee me that, you know, or guarantee us that our mama dogs would be fine. We would do it, but nobody can guarantee us anything. My husband just said the baby's up. So I'm going to have to wrap this up. Nobody can guarantee you anything. Right. So we don't get, um, we haven't, and we don't get, and we don't plan to get any of our dogs fixed. Now, what you can do, I don't know if you guys know this, you can change their classification in AKC, um, as a non-breedable dog before you, um, sell that dog or puppy or puppy. If that dog or that puppy, if that dog has, uh, acquired a disorder of some sort, and you don't want your new family to breed that dog, you can change the classification to be a non-breedable dog. And when they register that puppy, or even before they go to register that puppy, it will come up as a red flag. You don't have full rights to this, to this animal. Um, and that limits their options or their possibilities of, of, um, breeding that dog and selling puppies from that dog. Now, do people just go off and breed dogs? Yeah, they still could do it, but they won't be AKC registered. So, um, we don't plan on fixing mama blue or any of our dogs before sending, sending them to, um, to new homes. Okay.
