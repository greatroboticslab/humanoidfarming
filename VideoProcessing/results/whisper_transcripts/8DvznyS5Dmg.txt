 With the high cost of farm equipment, seeds and other inputs, farmers have to be very careful on how they manage and plan their farms. Yeah, and that's why some farmers turn to crop consultants to help them make decisions on their farms that can save both time and money. The Monaster's Mark Wildman caught up to one crop consultant in middle Georgia and he has this report. On any given day during the growing season, if you are traveling through Bleckley County, you are likely to see Michael Williams swiftly zigzagging his way through a cotton field or a host of other crops as well. He is a crop consultant who works tirelessly so his clients' farming operations thrive. I think it's a peace of mind for a lot of growers that have somebody in the field. It's a second opinion. A lot of growers in the field ten times a day might not realize they had fall worm worms in the pasture beside the peanut field. He works a 12 county area within an hour's drive of his home in Bleckley County, checking for bugs, diseases and other factors that affect the farmer's bottom lines. He gathers information and then shares his results with the producers and then gives them a plan on when to apply fertilizer, pesticides or any other treatments that might be needed. I am like a doctor for a plant if you will. We are there to manage the growth, the health of it, fertility, insects. That is why I told him, I actually had a doctor, I told him, I said, I do the same thing you do but for farmers in the field. Farmers like Chris Hill feel the service is extremely valuable. From planting, when he starts at planting, he is going to check and make sure I am planting at the correct depth. He is going to make sure that we get germination all the way up to, he is checking growth, making sure the plant is not overgrown and making sure it is fruiting like it ought to. He is going to make sure that bugs, if we have bugs, that we are addressing them timely and even further on in the season, if we have a little bit of pressure but not enough to spray, he is going to save us a spraying. Although much of a crop consultant's work depends on walking the fields, there is also a high tech component as well. Williams depends on soil moisture meters along with rain gauges around pivots to make sure the crops get adequate water when needed and utilizes irrigator pro software to make informed decisions. A lot of times what it actually is doing for peanuts is we got a soil from our that keeps a minimum and maximum. It's the cooling effect. If the ground gets extremely hot with high temps, it's going to trigger us to water, not a lot of water, but just a little bit to cool the ground off so the peanuts can really peg in. It's just a tool that maybe spur us to water a couple of days before we think we may need to after a rain is basically what I get out of it. Crop consulting can be a great alternative for someone who wants an ag career but may not have the resources to buy a farm or the equipment needed for farming. They can still make a living on farmland and be an important component of the ag industry. A lot of guys that work for me don't come from a farm background. They may have gotten introduced to ag and FFA in high school or something and even our we've got an awesome ag program here in Blakely County so I do get to choose some of the better of the kids there but it does give them an opportunity to get out in the field. They've seen it all but now they're hands on. And I think a lot of my guys are going to end up doing some ag related whether it be technology based stuff or even forestry and some of the other wildlife stuff. As the price of farming rises so does the price of making mistakes. That's why a good crop consultant might just keep your farm in the green. If I can get an extra 5 percent then that's the difference between me making money and not. And I mean he's going to save me more than 5 percent. Reporting from Blakely County, I'm Mark Wildman for the Georgia Farm Monitor.
