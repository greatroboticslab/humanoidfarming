 Music One of the biggest advances in milking cows has been the introduction of robotic milkers. There are three common types of milking systems. In what we call a tie stall, the milking machine comes right to the cows, and they are milked in their barn stalls. In a parlor system, the cows come as a group to the milking parlor and patiently wait their turn. And at some farms, there are robotic milkers. Whenever a cow feels like she needs to be milked, in she goes, and the robot does the work. Whatever milking system a farm has, there are some basic steps that have to be followed to ensure good milk and healthy cows. The cow's teats are washed with a disinfectant and wiped dry. Then, the milking machine is attached. There are four suction tubes, one for each of the four teats on the cow's udder. It takes about five minutes to milk a cow. After the milking, the cow's teats are dipped with an iodine solution to prevent any bacteria from entering the udder. The milk runs through a hose from the milking machines, to a pipe, to a bulk storage tank, where it's kept really cold until the milk truck arrives to pick it up. The milking equipment is thoroughly cleaned before and after every milking. And this happens every day. Robotic technology has actually been put to lots of great uses on farms. Robotic feed machines dole out just the right amount of food. Another keeps pushing up the feed so that it's never out of reach for the cows. And these robotic alley scrapers don't mind doing the dirty work.
