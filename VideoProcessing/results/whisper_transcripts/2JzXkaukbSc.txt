 When this person digs up a banana tree, he finds heaps of bananas growing from the roots of the tree. Actually, in Vietnam, there's a special type of banana grown whose bunches grow in the roots. Later, they simply hang them up on a cable line and send them to the market. Then they chop the leftover banana stem and feed it to the fish.
