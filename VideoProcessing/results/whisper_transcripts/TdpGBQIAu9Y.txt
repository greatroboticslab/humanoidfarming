Science & Technology
 My name is Jeremy Vunyuk. I'm a field service technician with Platte Valley Equipment. I've been working for Platte Valley for about 10 years. My journey started at atypical compared to everybody else. I started as a automotive technician and realized that that's not what I wanted to be doing the rest of my life and I learned what I know on the job. It takes about five times as long. I think it took me almost six years to get it to be a master certification. When you come out of the John Deere School, about six months you can be master certified. The technicians that come out of the John Deere School, they can systematically diagnose anything. They can take a problem with any sort of any piece of equipment and they can break it down and fix it and they are able to navigate through the operator's manual and the service manual much quicker and faster and more proficient than any of the other technicians that come out. If I had to do it all over again I would definitely go back to a John Deere School and be sponsored through Platte Valley. To be a good field technician you have to you have to be able to think on your feet because not everything is black and white. Working in the shop is a lot different than working out in the field. Working in the shop you always have that guy next to you and if you have a question you get too far in and you don't know what's going on or you break something and you don't know how to fix it there's always somebody there to help you. Being out in the field is a whole different ballgame because there's usually always a customer watching you watching your every move just because he's curious too on how to fix it. The hardest thing about being a field technician is not having a parts store with you. You can carry as much as you can but you can only carry so much so if you break a bolt that you don't have on your truck by chance you're in a bad situation and you're probably going to be driving. I wish that I would have been told that not every day is going to be a great day. Some days are going to be okay days and some days are going to be really bad days where you're covered in oil from head to toe but then the good days definitely outweigh the bad that no matter how bad it is tomorrow is a different totally different day and you know you'll always find the problem no matter what. The best thing about being a field technician in my opinion is being able to go out and the operators can't move. His machine won't move, can't move, can't figure it out, he has no idea, the rain's coming, he's got ten acres left to plant or harvest and you're the only person that is capable of doing it within how many miles and you get it fixed and the guy, the look on his face when you get it fixed and he's so happy that he can finish doing what he's doing and make make his paycheck too. It makes every day challenging in its own different way. I really enjoy it.
