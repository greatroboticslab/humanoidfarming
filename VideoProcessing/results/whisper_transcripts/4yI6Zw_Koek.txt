Have You Tried AMP Grazing or Other Regenerative Agricultural Practices?

 And the best tool that I've found in how to treat our soils and rebuild our soils is cows. And the best method of grazing that I've found is called amp grazing. Adaptive, multi-paddock grazing. Which mimics how the bison helped create 15-foot deep topsoils on the Great Plains. The bison would eat only half of their forage. They'd stomp the rest, covering the soil, and their manure would get evenly spread, a perfect fertilizer. And then the massive herd moved on for better food. And the land got to rest. It's that heavy hit and rest that caused the plants to grow like crazy. And in turn, suck down all that carbon and build all that soil. That heavy hit and rest is what the amp farmers mimic. Breaking their farm into small paddocks with frequent moves into fresh paddocks. For most of the time, most of the farm is resting and growing lots of grass.
