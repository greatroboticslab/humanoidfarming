 hey this is an apple tree I think that's not really a surprise to a lot of people but it's kind of near and dear to me I've been taking care of this tree one way or another for 25 years it's actually a picture of me in the UVM staff newspaper picking this apple as a picking picking apples from this tree back when I was a work-study student and here it is 2020 and I'm kind of the guy who's in charge of managing this whole orchard and also in charge of conducting research and teaching programs around fruit production around the state so I'm Terry Bradshaw I'll be professor for this class PSS 221 sustainable orchard management I'm standing by this tree because it's a pretty common you know easily recognizable sort of tree to many people you know it's got trunk it stands you know 12 feet tall big branches starting to get some fruit well it's got all the fruit that it'll have they just need to get bigger and riper but apple trees or orchard trees look a lot different from this and in this class we're gonna learn a bit about how to manage these trees we're gonna learn stepping back how they came about how they're produced why they're grown why they're commercially important but we'll also look at some of the newer types of systems the different types of systems and we'll consider them all within a lens of sustainability and that sustainability refers just as much to environmental as it does to economic and business sustainability so we'll touch on a lot of pieces here some of the trees we're gonna look at might be grown in a different system these trees are planted only three feet apart 12 feet between trees over 1200 trees per acre kind of a new style of system where you erect essentially artificial trunks a couple different varieties that we're growing within this system and we'll look at the varieties we'll look at the systems we'll look at even how we manage the ground cover underneath the trees and really kind of look at the the key parts of managing a commercial sustainable orchard system some of these won't even be apple trees standing here next to a row of trees planted just easy this year so they're still fairly young these are peaches we're growing right here in Vermont it can be done there's different risks involved with growing other other types of fruit trees but we'll touch on those and maybe we'll even get to try a few Vermont grown peaches if I can find a way to hold a few until class starts that at the end of August we'll even talk about hard cider and some of the varieties old but new varieties that are used to make high-quality hard ciders including this dabinet tree we're trialing out here at the farm and also some of the kind of innovative things we're doing like trying to train cider trees to a whole new growth habit like this one or this one that allows for us to produce fruit ideally you'll see we'll see in about five years in a way that can substantially reduce the cost of production and make the production of really high-quality world-class ciders affordable to consumers and profitable for growers so I'm looking forward to teaching this class one of my favorite classes I teach is the first class I ever taught as a graduate student many years ago got a lot of knowledge and experience to share and I'm really looking looking forward to the energy and the eagerness of students to get out here on the farm and to experience this course with me so thanks and we'll see you guys soon
