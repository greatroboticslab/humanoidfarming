Howto & Style
 Just a quick question and answer about fencing today. How does proper fencing improve livestock management on the farm or ranch? You know Keith, we use it at our place through rotational grazing. It makes us better stewards of the resources we have. So we're able to rotate our livestock and keep our grass growing better. We develop a better root system for it. So that's one huge benefit is being able to create paddocks and use rotational grazing as a grazing pattern for my livestock. And I think also that a good strong fence man cuts down on the liability for the rancher. You don't have cattle getting out. You don't have them out on the road. Then you're very responsible to your animals and keeping them where they're supposed to be. Absolutely Keith. And then you know with a good fence as well you're excluding predators. So if you're in a situation where you're lambing or having kids or calves, it gives you a good fence will prevent predators getting in and potentially creating economic damage to your livestock. And just the fact we really do not want those animals to suffer. We want to keep them in a safe environment. Just goes back to the old lane. Good fences make good neighbors.
