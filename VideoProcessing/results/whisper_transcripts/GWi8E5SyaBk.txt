 If keeping your lawn green is causing you to go into the red, your sprinkler system may be the reason why you're not seeing any savings. But with proper education, you can keep your lawn green and your checkbook in the black. When Robin Button's College Station lawn wasn't looking so lush, she did what every homeowner does. When I first moved into the home, we had some spots in our lawn that were brown and we were watering constantly. Because she didn't want to go broke watering, she reached out to Jennifer Nations with the city's Water Services Department and found out she could teach her how to conserve water and save money. We use our water for a lot more than just drinking, but it's all comes from groundwater. So every gallon that we save is, you know, a gallon stored in the ground for later generations to use. Button said Nations visited her home and not only gave her money saving tips, she pointed out problems that were draining her budget. This one's kind of the seals look a little busted at the bottom there, so I'll just put a flag by that. That one is going a little bit too far into the street. By the time Nations had finished, Button had soaked up a wealth of watering information. I learned how to replace sprinkler heads and know when they were broken. I learned how to spray them to the parts of my yard that needed the irrigation the most. And I learned how long water is going to water because more water does not equal better. And if watering goes continue, the problem may be at the meter. And there may be a little red dial that will be spinning that will show a water leak. Or if you have a digital water meter, there will be a little plus sign on it and that's an indication of a water leak. Nations points out that while waiting on Mother Nature to supply the water is ideal, waiting is not always an option. So watering smart is your best option. To make sure your sprinkler system is working efficiently, call the city and ask for a free irrigation checkup. All you need to do is visit cstx.gov and fill out the online form.
