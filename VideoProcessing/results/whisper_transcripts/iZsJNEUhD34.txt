 Here are some of the vegetables that we're growing vertically along our fence line. The combination of plants that we want to grow could either look great or super messy. Whichever way it goes, we're going to give it a try because we want to maximize our growing space. To start, we're growing one pumpkin and several varieties of vining squash like red curry. These plants can take up a lot of ground space, so by growing vertically along a trellis, you can save a lot of room. One combination that we're growing in a single container is beans and zucchini. Runner beans are fantastic for vertical structure and they grow really well besides zucchinis. We're also going to be growing our zucchinis vertically by using a stick. By growing the plant this way, it's easier to maintain and you can save a lot of space. We also wanted to include a couple of tomatoes in this space and we combined it with one bean, cucumber, and okra. We really wanted to test this newly built trellis, so we're also including watermelons. And lastly, to make sure that all fruits are pollinated, we're adding flowers in the surrounding area.
