 One of the best gifts that I've ever gotten from my mom was an indoor garden that she used to grow tons of herbs year-round. I've really wanted to try one out for myself and so for the past couple months I've been using two of Click & Grow's smart gardens. Unlike most indoor systems that are hydroponic, Click & Grow's pods have soil which means no broken water pumps and needing to add nutrients. You just need to add water to the tank every week or so. One of my favorite features is that these smart gardens have lights that automatically turn on for 16 hours and then off for 8. I really think indoor gardens are the perfect solution for someone who doesn't have a lot of outdoor space or wants to grow something with very little effort. And of course for anybody who's looking to pass along the joy of growing something to someone else as a gift.
