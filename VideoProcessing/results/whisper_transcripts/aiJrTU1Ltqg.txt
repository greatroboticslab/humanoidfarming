Nonprofits & Activism
 Meanwhile in Brazil, several new agroforestry initiatives are underway. The Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, Embrapa, operates an agricultural research center in Belem. For the last 40 years, Japan has provided assistance to this institution through JICA and its predecessors. Here, agroforestry research has been carried out in great detail. Economically viable species adapted to the local environment have been developed and distributed to farmers. What is the ideal spacing for each agroforest species? How are soil characteristics modified by different types of agroforest cover? One research project came up with a notable finding. ...da característica do solo. Com isso você praticamente não tem erosão, diminui, reduz a erosão, pode chegar quase zero a essa erosão. Da forma como ocorre na floresta. Se você entra na floresta, você vai ver esse processo tudo ocorrendo dessa forma. E ocorre dentro dos sistemas agroforestais. A questão dos pássaros, né? A gente observa também um aumento de pássaros nessas áreas utilizado com sistemas agroforestais. Agroforestry supports ecosystem recovery in the Amazon, as well as farmers' livelihoods. Today, Tomea-Sou's Niquei community, under its Nisei and Sansei leadership, is well integrated with local Brazilian society. For the last 15 years, Mr. Ko Nagano has worked as a volunteer agroforestry tutor at weekends to small farmers in his neighborhood, passing on both cultivation techniques and management skills. As a result, he was appointed by the mayor of Tomea-Sou as the municipal secretary of agriculture, tourism and the environment. A position in which he makes regular visits to the small holdings of 5,000 local farming families. Having seen the success of Nikkei agroforestry practices, these local farmers want to learn the production techniques that will give them a steady income from their properties, which range in size from one to several hectares of land. The This is the cacao. The adubation, after forming, you put it here, and there, and there, and the cacao. Always directing the adult cacao. Because here, there's a piece of cacao. Yes. So, if the capinas want to do this, you know? Almost every year, they come here, you know, and teach you how to do it. You do it like this, and I don't know if I do it like this, because he sees the original, I orient him, he does. Because in the future, we'll have another production, right? I'm almost given to him, right? He's going to take the direction, because I've been a little bit of work. I brought him, he's a son, right? He's going to take the boat in front. Thank you, Lord. Thank you, Lord. Thank you. Thank you, Lord. Thank you. Appreciate it. I hope he's helpful. To get what to do, for example, in Boston, or in November 2007, Imbrapa Amazonia Oriental held an international agroforestry training course in collaboration with the Center for International Forestry Research, CIFOR, and the World Agroforestry Center, ECRAF. Significant financial backing was provided by JICA's Third Country Training Program, TCTP, following its previous contribution in 2006 under the Japan-Brazil Partnership Program, JBPP. The lectures explained how agroforestry supports stable and self-sustaining agricultural management while also conserving the environment. Fifteen agricultural extension technicians from Amazon Basin countries contributed to this workshop. The training course is facilitated by the Amazon Initiative Consortium for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Natural Resources. This body includes agriculture and forestry research, education and development institutions from the Amazon countries, as well as the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, CGIAR. The course aims to share with other Amazon Basin countries the ideas and techniques of agroforestry developed with JICA support by the Nikkei farmers of Tomei Asu in order to promote both sustainable rural development and effective environmental conservation. There was great interest in what the Tomei Asu farmers had achieved. The course participants intended to become trainers on returning home. The participants listened attentively and took notes. Although the climate and soil conditions might be different in their countries, the case study in Tomei Asu was an invaluable reference. With environmental change ranking high on the agenda of many recent international conferences, agroforestry is gaining more and more public attention. Sustainable agriculture and forestry production without further deforestation offer a promising solution. Our relevant areas are provided with many species under Manuel семes Sangria members Some species are interesting because same birds are unearned in miel. The market is more big than Brasil. In Lima has been adapter to 특 promotional opportunities for species of操作 It's the market and other situations like that are the international support that basically has been supporting these initiatives. That means technical assistance, roads, that is, that is, everything that would be the value of a product. Agroforestry is a system that supports people's well-being and the conservation of nature. The experience of the Tomei Asu farmers in the Brazilian Amazon is now being passed on for all the world to share.
