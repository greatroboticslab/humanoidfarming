Gaming
 in this 100 days adventures we're going to be playing farmstead a game where you plant cut to get better tools level up skills and unlock new areas during these 100 days i have three goals get one of the skills that is in the game up to level 10 decorate my farm to the best of my ability and hopefully unlock all areas which there are three in the game so let's go ahead and get right and into it starting off on day one once we have loaded in there is a beautiful cutscene explaining we need to clean this place up that there's other areas to explore oh ah then the cutscene told me to get to work so i did first off with messing with the settings with that squared away i started with the starting quest and tilled up some farmland and planted my first crops after watering my newfound crops and discovering i was going to get 1 000 steps in for the day with all the watering i was needing to do i started clearing out the weeds grabbing a few of my fully grown wheat in the process while i waited for the final amount of wheat to grow i set about selling some of the decorations my farm had started with i did not need to have a pretty farm at the moment i needed some money once my wheat was fully grown i harvested it up i went ahead and caught a fish before heading back to town to sell my goods 56 gold later and five new wheat seeds for my quest i ran over and talked to robin to get our next quest started which just involved talking to all the townsfolk once i had done some drive-by introductions to everyone i turned in the quest and started on our next one involving corn why would anyone collect corn is beyond me but free money is always welcome running over to brooks i grabbed his quest for a wooden barrel and crate something i may or may not remember to do later finally i continued the tutorial quest and went to sailor santiago and returned to my farm once back on my farm i took a look at the building menu and shopped to see what i had unlocked before buying a wooden plank to place down i don't understand why that was a needed quest item but there you go and then i finally finished off my starting quest collecting a whole 25 gems oh boy oh boy when i quickly back this town i grabbed some more weed seeds i returned to the farm and started planting all of them i also started setting up an apple farm this would be crucial throughout the run just to get some money and i started clearing out some of the local trees and grass then before long my wheat was ready again so it was time to replant and sell off more decorations before again replanting y'all sensing a theme here the start of day two had me harvesting the remaining wheat and heading into town to sell i also picked up a quest from tom and 300 corn seeds after planting my corn seeds i had become a human lawn mower and chainsaw for a bit as my first patch of seeds finally growing i replanted and expanded my farm a bit before continuing to deforest i now had farming up to level two wood cutting up to level two and forging up to level two and of course more planting and harvesting i then ran around my land looking for forageables collecting apples to sell before returning to town turning in two quests i picked up i sold all my corn and other crops for about 700 gold and picked up some more seeds day three i returned to the farm and bought a square crow this was to stop the stupid birds from stealing my money i then expanded my farmland to fill up the scarecrow spots and planted some corn more deforestation occurred and selling of decorations i bought a composter to help me get fertilizer something of which i wouldn't actually understand how that fully worked but we'll get to that later and on my way to town i picked up some chicken feed that someone had thrown on the ground after a quick trip to craft two blueprints for a quest and turning it in i bought some pepper seeds and with some extra cash to spare i got a new axe and pickaxe before returning home at the end of the day starting to plant my new pepper seeds this new pickaxe was making very short work on the rocks and ores around my farm and i finally hit mining level two day four was more mining and becoming the enemy of all trees i also had my first bit of fertilizer which i placed on my plot and harvested up my first batch of chilies before going to sell them for 666 gold base i bought some pepper seeds and returned to plant them now so that i'm not coming up with different ways to say that i was shopping trees and mining this is something i'm constantly doing while waiting for my crops to grow so if you're not hearing me talking about doing it much in the future rest assured i am doing it a lot with the peppers being fast growers i was able to harvest them all fairly quickly i also looked at the blueprints in my inventory and sold several i didn't want and hope i can get more of them in the future for some easy cash day five started off with me getting my forging skill up to level three selling off my tent because i can sleep on the ground i also bought another scarecrow with the thought of creating more farmland also caught a fish after taking a trip to the town selling my junk which needed me a very nice profit i also left the berries i had been collecting in the jammer in town this was something you were able to do for free until i was able to get them later on buying some blueberry seeds to return home and planted my first field with them day six i started teeling my second field area and watering them and watering them and watering them until my well ran dry and then again i was back over at the composter using my two brain cells trying to figure it out finally those two managed to figure it out and then i returned to murdering some trees then i attempted to plant grass in my field figured out they needed to be planted on regular ground after a time i will not disclose before unlocking farming level three i was very excited for some of the new unlocks day seven started with some tree clearing i wanted to check my stats because i had found something for fertilizer required level four foraging and i really wanted it from there and that would be the mushroom pots i decided to start fishing lost the first one but luckily got the second fishing was not really something i was excited about leveling up and probably wouldn't be leveling up that much then i noticed the blueberries i'd planted earlier were ready to be harvested mostly i then finally finished watering and fertilizing my second field collected the rest of my blueberries headed to town grabbed my jam sold everything for 2800 gold bought some more apple trees max stack of blueberry seeds and i returned to replant my blueberry seeds fertilizing my fields and starting to fertilize my apple farm and then i had to clear out some trees so that i could expand my apple form day eight was working on my foraging skill while running around i noticed a large manta ray shadow by the docks i tried my luck in fishing port and the rng gods have blessed me because i managed to get it i went to town to trade out my jam and get some planks made along with some copper smelting i don't really think i even use them that much because other than making blueprints they don't do anything else i also saw that i could get an upgraded watering can so i sewed everything i had onto the manta ray for some reason picked up a magnifying glass which would help me look at details about my plants i think i used it maybe four or five times and a silver watering can i then picked up some carrot seeds and returned home find another scarecrow to start working on a new field for my crops and set to work getting ready and planting some of the carrots i had picked up day nine was harvesting my grown blueberry plants replanting the seeds i'd picked up fertilizing at my third field that i was working on and then during my daily clearing of my land i hit wood cutting number three which yay harvesting carrots i realized that they were very fast growing and this was making me have to spend a lot of time around the field visiting town i sold off what i had gathered for 800 but considering i was saving my blueberries to be jammed so that i could get more of them i knew money would be slow for just a little bit because if you jam them you get more money i spent the money i had on carrot seeds gathered up the wooden metal i've left in town before stopping by the fertilizer in town and realizing that i could use that one along with how the different fertilizer was used with grass and mushrooms yeah it took me two and a half hours to figure this out the last part of day nine i spent planting my new carrot seeds and organizing my inventory day 10 was clearing day rocks and oars feared me i got mining up to level three and halfway through my day my carrot crops were ready to be harvested i went down and sold everything for quite a pretty penny bought more carrot seeds did my town chores then started planting the massive amount of carrot seeds i had and this literally bled into most of day 11. the remaining part of day 11 i removed the back half of my third field so that i could use some better fertilizer i then started the watering process which the going back and forth was getting incredibly old i then started the same thing in the front to use better fertilizer harvesting my carrot crops resewing the field and i also hit level four in farming start of day 12 i was still redoing my fields well to be frank it was most of day 12. this was also the day that i realized the server was not syncing with the time correctly i believed in an updated version this is fixed however i was just gonna have to suffer through it now i ran to town sold my carrots and other wares bought a copper sickle 198 carrot seeds and returned home to finish up my fields day 13 was continuing redoing my fields once i had finished them i planted my carrots looking back at this now i wonder why i did this when i didn't record this whole thing in a single session and i think i was about to have one of my break times after this oh well once i finished i let up my anger on some trees also managed to hit foraging level four here the end of the day harvesting my carrots and replanting the extra seeds day 14 i invested in my first mushroom box these are helpful because they allow you to be able to get guaranteed mushrooms every 30 minutes and you can also get the purple ones which are the best i then ran into town did my chores buying 198 peas and some more apples to expand my apple farm i kept enough money to buy another mushroom box and got to planting my peas i had to clear the area where i wanted to expand my apple farm but honestly at this point with my upgraded tools it was significantly easier another trip to town i finished up one of robin's quest did my chores in town and headed back home returning home on day 15 started with me expanding my silo to keep a few more of the items i had acquired that i would likely never use again i also made the horrible choice to buy a beehive 100 gems to waste seriously planting the rest of the peas seeds i had i bought two more mushroom boxes harvested some crops and after a quick lap around my island foraging i sold some of the blueprints i had picked up because they're easy money i also bought a concrete maker i think this is one of the only times i actually used it after harvesting some crops and doing some inventory management i headed into town turned in another robin quest sold my inventory for over 9k bought a ton of carrots picked up caros quest before heading on home and as the day ended i started planting my carrots which this was also going to very much so bleed into day 16. and after i wrapped up planting my seeds i started deforesting as normal and then decided to buy two more mushroom pots and a crafting table placing them both down i did take a quick trip to town to turn in car's quest selling some stuff and after taking a brief look at their crafting recipes i bought a chicken coop this thing was far bigger than i thought when i tried to place it and after trapping myself in the coop i decided to go ahead and harvest my crops before we got into day 17. which day 17 was great because i started by getting level 5 in farming and unlocking my first skill cape now all the skills the moment you hit level 5 and 10 you unlock skill capes so this was my first one i would be getting and i was super excited i then wrapped up harvesting and planting your crops then started the process of trying to put up a pen for future chickens i realized i was very much so out of cash so i ran into town sold my crops buying an upgraded cultivator i spent the rest of the day enjoying the lovely building mechanics trying to place fence posts oh my god after that ordeal i bought one of each chicken placed in a watering and feeding trough and then realized i had no animal feed other than the one i had picked up in town so i went ahead and went to town picked up some animal feed and some seeds returned to feed my chickens and get more steps in with filling the watering trough day 19 started with harvesting my fully grown fields i spent most of the day clearing forageables and getting apples and my chickens had finally given me some eggs and then pretty much i just was harvesting my crops and replanting them as day 19 ended day 20 i was still harvesting up my crops and i decided to go ahead and start replanting out my fields with some carrot seeds my chickens were also giving me an absolute ton of eggs and i was also beginning to discover they really like food i also realized that my ingenious idea to have a variety of chicken farm was very ill-placed so i went ahead and got rid of everyone except for the high-end ones after standing and staring at nothing in town for probably a good two minutes i went and sold everything i had for just over 8k bought three sacks carrot seeds and then headed on home i then decided to save my feet and my sanity by placing a well next to the chicken coop and collecting even more eggs i then noticed that my field was ready to be harvested again so i started working on that and replanting of course i will have to say i do appreciate one thing about this game that if you lay out where you want your planting or watering whatever happens to be the game automatically moves you to it and definitely saved my fingers more times than i can count day 21 started off with caring for some chickens and heading on into town selling all of my goodies including a golden egg i had picked up it was well over 10k at this point and i decided to unlock the plains which honestly has to be my favorite area for leveling up forageables because you can just literally cut through so much stuff in this zone it's insane i also discovered this really massive fish over by the waterfall and completely missed it it was also this cute little like greenhouse area that did absolutely nothing and i regret to comment how long i spent just messing around with stuff over here so with the plains area i unlocked a bunch of new crops to be able to use a bunch of new different woods oars and fish and they also had pear trees although they weren't as good as my apple trees in my opinion actually it still get me a pretty good profit day 21 i'm just going to be honest guys i literally ran around in circles foraging the entire time and got foraging level five i did wrap up day 21 by harvesting my carrot fields and starting the replanting process which went well well into day 22 because i had close to 200 crop spots that i had to go and fill so after i finished planting i went over harvesting my apple trees it got the absolute monster amount of eggs from my lovely lovely chickens then went over to the plant area and started setting up for another field now as you unlock new zones you are able to unlock better crops these are going to give you more money so i wanted to go ahead and get a field started because i was wanting to start getting strawberries because one you could jam them and two they're going to give me a lot more money than blueberries so started the process for that i went ahead and put a well down after i got the field set up and then i started the painful process of watering it then put some of the lovely strawberries i'd picked up from foraging i'd put those down with some fertilizer before going back and harvesting all of my carrots that were now fully grown at this point and replanting them day 23 was me finishing up harvesting up my carrots grabbing some eggies feeding my very gluttonous chickens and going to town to sell everything i then picked up a ton of blueberry seeds and i picked up my first full stack of strawberry seeds well maybe two i then realized because i had unlocked level five and foraging i now had a new skill cape so i put on the forging skill cape because mushroom i then returned home and planted all the blueberries i had this would buy me a little bit of time if i was running around the farm because they wouldn't almost immediately grow by the time i was done planting them i went and did some foraging in our main little starting area and working on finishing up fertilizing and planting my field in the plains and at the start of day 24 i started expanding my plains field to have a second little area and i started the long process of getting all that set up have i commented how much i love the drag and click option in this game then with about half of our day gone i went ahead and picked up my chicken eggs and took care of my crops in my first area after some quick inventory management i went ahead about and started replanting everything and hit farming level six yay then after some inventory management at the silo i went ahead and did some little farm chores around mostly getting my mushrooms looking at some stuff in the build menu buying a hand mill which was meant to actually make animal food i don't really think i used that so day 25 marked me actually placing that down and buying a mushroom box realizing i was just a little bit short on money so i went ahead and sold some of the old blueprints i had they're easy money and you pick them up a lot during foraging i would get so many so i bought a second one and went ahead and put both down and after grabbing my lovely apples i headed on into town sold everything i had picked up went over to the blacksmith kind of checked out when i could get some of the next tools a lot of them were going to be farming 11 10 and that was mostly what i was looking at is level 10 and level 7 to get these new tools i then picked up a ton of blueberry seeds and headed home i returned to pick up my chicken eggs which again this is going to be one of those things that i'm constantly doing so i'm not going to mention any more times or else y'all are going to get bored and can't have that so after picking up them chicken eggs i went ahead and started foraging around the main area picking up blueprints all kinds of other stuff and going over to the plans area and harvesting up my strawberries that have finished growing as day 26 rolled around i caught a fish and harvested up my strawberries i then noticed that those blueberries in the first field were done so i went ahead and picked them up and then replanted all of the fields i then ran around and did some mundane things actually i'm not really quite sure what my thought process was here organized my inventory of stuff i was going to sell and went to town after selling all the fish eggs apples carrots and everything else we had 22 000 gold from that so we ended up with about over 28k which was a lot opening up the blueprint menu i bought a barn and realized this thing was even more massive than the chicken coop and realized that i probably did not have enough room so on day 27 i set about clearing a very large area on this little second island thing i had in my main area i tried to place the barn down but i realized if i wanted to enclose the animals i was going to need an even bigger space so i realized i was going to have to clear out this larger section and oh boy i went ahead and placed the barn down to figure out where else i needed to cut in order to put a fence down so that i could actually start getting some cows and then came my epic struggle with yet again the building mechanics trying to get one this thing positioned so i could have a fence line and two placing the fences down i did figure out you could hit repeat placement and that definitely helped with placing them if i was facing the right way when i was doing things and literally at the start of day 28 i finished the fences i went ahead and bought a well a water trough and a feeding trough set all those up so they're easy for me to get to stared longingly into the distance for about two and a half minutes not really sure what happened here and then i went about buying cows so you actually have to have female cows and then you can use male cows to breed them which i got a male cow but i never really ended up doing anything with him so when you do get the cows they do come as babies so i really think that's cute that you can have babies i then realized that my chickens were starving before going and harvesting up the blueberry crops that probably had been done for several minutes while i had been fussing with the farm i then went and harvested up my chilies and my strawberries from the flames if i am realized i did not have that many seeds i went ahead and planted them down anyways after checking on my cows i went to town straighted out my jam stuff sold everything went over to robin realized i had sold the coffee that i was trying to give to her went and buy some blueberries strawberries and coffee seeds plants before returning home on day 29 and starting to plant everything and after planting my coffee plants in the plains i realized i was probably spending half of most of every single one of my days planting and harvesting crops which it is called farmstead so i then proceeded to activate uh foliage mode and work on getting foraging up i then realized that the next area i had to unlock was 200k that was going to be a while i then went and took care of the cows which were going through their stuff super quickly before getting rid of all the blue pins to my inventory that i picked up and ended the day with fishing i started harvesting up my blueberries realizing they weren't quite done i headed to town cleared out my inventory a little bit because it was getting a little bit cluttered and headed back home i didn't realize i had quite a little bit of cash and i wanted to go ahead and get some more mushroom boxes because getting the purple mushrooms was super super helpful so i went ahead and placed some down of course some in myself because you know why not so now i had an absolute monster amount i also was doing that because i was waiting for some of my crops to finish up and then started the very repetitive task of planting more i did open up the perks menu and saw the planter now i wasn't going to buy it just yet i wanted to go ahead and get as high as i could without being super pay to win because i know people don't typically like that so rip my finger after realizing my coffee beans were fully harvestable i went over and replanted that area i then used the magnifying glass on some of my lovely blueberries again one of the few times i would actually use that during this entire run and i ran to town and to start of day 31 i went ahead and sold everything bought some more blueberry seeds more strawberry seeds and went and turned in robin's quest finally so he then asked me for some mushrooms which is going to be easy so once i returned home i went ahead and collected all my eggs realizing that there actually was a max capacity so i did need to pay attention after feeding the little uh egg poopers i did see a squid so i went ahead and tried to fish up the squid and i got him and then went and took care of the cows they had actually fully grown at this point so i was actually super excited and i got my first little bit of milk from them i then ran through collecting some mushrooms for my lovely little quest doing a little bit of forging grinding because foraging was the other skill other than farming i really needed to work on because it unlocked a lot of really useful things and i really wanted to get my own jammers to use on my farm would also help me make a lot more money so foraging grind yay i then took care of my main field in my main area harvesting the blueberries and replanting then went ahead and did some inventory management just as day 32 came upon us i then headed on into town went ahead and sold everything i had acquired and headed back home at home i immediately chopped down one log and got wood cutting four to work went into the building menu i saw that i could get a sawmill which i don't know at this point if that's even worthwhile again something i would only use once i then realized i needed to go to town because i could buy a brand new axe so i went ahead and bought a new axe sold my old one bought some new seeds and headed back home yet again i then went through and harvested up my plains field because all that had finally grown and replanted with what coffee i had left and the strawberry seed i then went around did some foraging and chopping down some trees just to start getting some more experience tried to catch one of the big fish and it got away tried to catch a catfish this one was slightly easier and i did get fishing level two and that was the start of day 33. pretty much most of this day 33 i was mining and chopping down trees just trying to get stuff leveled up while i waited for my plants to grow my mushroom boxes had finally produced some mushrooms for me halfway through the day i needed desperately some inventory management from the pure amount of stuff i had harvested after gathering up some apples i went ahead and started harvesting on my blueberry field a little concerned about inventory space right now but i think i will be okay and i ended up finishing up day 33 started 34 wrapping up my blue i did it sound did my jamming sold everything each of these trips was becoming much more profitable each time i went and then went over to robin turned in her quest and got a quest to get apple pear and cherry trees i then realized that cherry trees were probably going to be in the next zone that i would have to be unlocking so it was going to be a while before i could finish this quest i then picked up some seeds and i then i'm home i then for some reason decided to chop down every single one of my apple trees or 10 of them at least no idea why and replant them not really sure what my thought process was there but it happened i then put down three more mushroom boxes fed the dumb chickens before deciding to actually start my pear farm on this little upper platform in the plains area then harvested up my crops crops someone visited my field i have no idea who that is um then went ahead and spent the rest of the day planting everything and returning on day 35 i'll go ahead and harvest up all the blueberries that are now fully grown picking up all the mushrooms that have grown while i've been gone away and replanting all my blueberries after that we're going to go pick up some eggs and i'm going to go ahead and take care of my chickens and i run over and do the same thing with the cows after collecting up all the lovely apples and doing some quick inventory management because i have so much stuff that i can collect i go ahead and pick on up the strawberries from the plains field and replant those as well and for whatever reason this field even though it's been quite some time this past uh still was good to go with fertilizer and then when fishing i got a fish apparently i tried to fish the stairs there not really sure what happened and into day 36 i was basically doing foraging xp mostly just trying to fill up my inventory before i head back to town and i got forging level six with nothing particularly good unlocked and after harvesting the blueberries i had just put down not that long ago i headed on into town to sell everything we had picked up and made a very nice profit of about 39 000. went ahead and bought some wheat not really sure why at this point i think i was trying to work on the feeders i bought a ton of strawberry seeds apparently was confused when i had bought some beet seeds a lot of beet seeds why are you buying 300 beet seeds and 200 blueberries and we headed on back i went ahead and started planting the wheat because wheat grows so fast pretty much by the time i get everything planted this first batch will be fully grown and at the start of day 37 i wrapped up planting all of that wheat you can kind of see behind me that it's already fully grown it hasn't been that long and it's already there after harvesting up the wheat i started planting some of the blueberries i had picked up then went to the plains area i went ahead and harvested up that we got farming a level seven did some mild foraging and a little bit of fishing but no success running back over the chickens that not even 10 minutes ago i had fed and watered had already eaten through their food i started go ahead and doing a foraging run through my main area on day 38 taking care of the cows getting the milk from them and doing some more fishing i do wish at the time i had been recording this that they did have more rewards for getting higher tier fishing but there honestly was no real incentive to farm it unlike foraging that i got jamming jars so really didn't focus on that harvested up my new mushrooms that had spawned in shared at my inventory for a while and cleaned it up went to town picked up someone else's bucket sold everything for about 18 000 went and bought a new cultivator and a new scythe also kind of wish inventory was a little bit bigger that was kind of another limiting factor so after i did some more inventory management i went ahead and harvested up the blueberries that were already fully grown realized i had hadn't picked up any new blueberry seeds so i was just gonna have to use the ones that i had it was enough to get about half the main field then at this point in time i was starting to slightly get annoyed with the fact that literally i was just running around collecting eggs milk and harvesting plants with no real downtime to start working on my skills because literally it's almost the end of day 38 and pretty much all i've done is harvest plants and chickens i finally managed a little bit of time to work on mining but it was already turned into day 39. so i continued on my little harvesting trip but i did get mining level four i then went to the plains area harvested up my strawberries and beets that had grown replanted everything down visited town pulled everything off made sure i bought enough seeds to be able to plant when i went back since i didn't have enough the wheat and blueberry went over to brooks bought a new pickaxe and i returned home and went ahead and bought a furnace again much like several other items i have bought during this playthrough um there are things that will not get used that much this would probably be one of them as well kind of wish the developers had given more purpose to some of the other things like the furnace the sawmill other than crafting decor items after i'd set up the furnace i went ahead and started planting some wheat in the back half of the field that didn't have anything in it and once it was fully grown i started putting blueberries back in its place because blueberries in the front of the field had already started to grow and i was still doing this into day 40. then i went around grabbed my chicken eggs fed the stupid chickens and put some waters in the draw now i know you're wondering why do you keep calling them stupid chickens and i'm wondering why do you keep calling them stupid chickens and the other ones that are making money they're not that profitable compared to the effort you have to put in and i wish i could say that i knew this at this time i did not cows are kind of the same way there is far better ways to do it including the crops that i was constantly doing so i i feel bad for me for past me having to do all that i did attempt to uh one move the well closer and the water troughs closer so i could feel easier and i gave both the chicken and the cows two water troughs and two feeding troughs to kind of help alleviate my pain and suffering i then went through and decided to commit massive deforestation looking at the builder's table for i don't know what honestly i do not remember my thought process as to what i was in here looking for and again i was having to harvest these eggs as you all can see this is this is getting quite problematic that it gets hard to do anything when you're having to manage the eggs the feeding for those animals and they honestly do not give that much so to wrap up day 40 i went ahead and worked on my plains field because the beets were almost done now the reason i'd done the beets is i actually was just trying to plant one of everything because there is like a collection guide so i was kind of trying to do that so started day 41 went ahead and was planting some more i then went ahead and bought some more silo spots my thought with this was just to be able to organize and kind of just have one of everything and i went back to harvesting blueberries now in order to save not only the time on this video but uh y'all sanity unless we get something big changing i gotta level up or do something different um i'm not going to talk about doing any more harvesting or collecting chicken eggs so once we actually get into the next part of this i'll let y'all know so pretty much from day 41 on just expect that we are doing a lot of harvesting on day 42 i attempted to catch the biggest fish i have ever seen and i caught it it was a trout on day 42 i also went into town and sold a ton of my wares i was up to over 100k at that point day 42 also saw some mild deforestation which i was kind of happy not to be working on crops i got to work on some of my other skills day 43 turned into a foraging montage because i realized i needed to get to forging level seven and i was pretty close and also a few fishing attempts on day 45 i had a massive inventory full of stuff i had collected from day 44 and so i went ahead and sold it for 38k so getting slightly closer to that 200k that i needed in order to unlock the second zone or the mountains on day 45 also saw a visitor come to my island not really sure what he was doing but it at least was amusing and something for me to look at other than harvesting crops on day 46 i stared at this wall for no particular reason at all on day 47 guess what i mostly did on day 48 i decided to go ahead and sell a couple more of those landscaping items that i really didn't need and i was trying to save up some money i also was selling all those blueprint items that i kept picking up because oh my god i had so many day 49 into day 50 it was just more planting and harvesting nothing too spectacular near the end of day 50 i went to town we ended up cashing in a lot of money and i got up to about 160 000 so we were getting a lot closer to our goal i did at this point switch over because i was kind of using blueberries and strawberries but you have to jam them to make good money so i went ahead and bought a ton of carrots and beets and pretty much my goal was to basically push our way into the next zone so that was kind of my hope anyway and on day 51 i hit level 8 farming day 52 had me standing in the middle of the carrot field wondering my life decisions at this point i ended off day 52 by going to town and selling our absolute monster amount of haul that we had ending us i had 184 000 before i took a break day 53 had me coming back to the game about i would have to say probably 12 hours later irl i had finally gotten some honey from our beehive that was interesting it's gonna sell for next for nothing that's why i said in the beginning of the video it is absolutely worthless but i decided to go ahead and take down the plains field because honestly i had mostly grown out of it so i did take down the first field i do realize i have an absolute monster amount of carrot seeds but at this point having to manage all of this i wasn't getting actually any progress done as you all can see what we had nearly 10 days where all i was doing was harvesting over and over and with us getting close to 200k uh there was other things i wanted to be doing and since we're halfway through the challenge as it is i did go ahead and re fertilize my trees and i watered them because the apple trees always are a good resource for me easy cheap and right by the door i then set it to work on the end of day 53 into the day 54 re-watering and re-fertilizing my other field i also discovered on day 54 that i could plant my carrot seeds so they would not be going to waste i then also set up or started to another kind of field area so much like i had in the first zone where it was kind of three scarecrows across that's kind of what i started working on and this lasted until day 55. i didn't work on it long into day 55 because i ran out of fertilizer so i was having to go around collecting mushrooms things like that and also i was needing to get foraging really up to level eight because that's where we were going to excel and for the rest of day 55 we did some foraging into day 56 when i started harvesting my fields and apparently also on day 56 i i had some sympathy for my chickens and my cows and my cows and i decided to go to town and sell all that i had which we were getting very dangerously close to 200k and then for the rest of the day 56 and 57 i have no footage i believe the power went out this day because i knew one of the recordings got cut insanely short but this was kind of the time slot that was allocated for it and so yeah i don't have anything for these days so here's a picture of my cat she is disgruntled okay let's move on day 58 i loaded on in and went ahead and did some chores mushrooms eggs a lot of stuff had regrown which was also kind of good for my foraging skill i then went to town sold everything i had which put us right over that 200k mark and i immediately went up to go unlock the mountain region well after some foraging and this area was a woodcutters and a foraging person's dream oh my god there was so much stuff in here so much stuff i also found like this little ice observatory area that they have in the mountain and it's actually kind of cool to look at um serves no real function and this is also when i discovered that my woodcutting skill and my mining skill were horribly under leveled for this area to be able to take out some of the specialty rocks and the trees and that will be a problem for future sister guard because right now uh foraging and that is what i started day 59 with was beating everything up in this forest i could get my hands on also discovered you could climb on things to get to the trees that are in weird spots but you can't harvest them which is weird and after being a loot goblin in the other area i went ahead and decided to be a productive member of society and you know went back to my fields then after a quick visit to town to dump off literally so much stuff that i had picked up went over checked to see how much the golden watering can was and it was beyond my gym price day 60 started my actual foraging adventure again to go clear out every little nook and cranny i could from the mountain region and chopping down what i could i also planted down some cherry trees so i could finish up robin's quest ran the town sold all my stuff went over to robin and turned her quest in and she wanted apples pears and mangoes and again i got a quest the mangoes are in the furthest area which i'm going to be spoiling how much it is here in just a second um yeah it's 2.5 million then i returned to my loot goblin wheeze i'm pretty sure my crops were done at this point but i was so beyond done doing crops and i really just wanted foraging up and mining up and then i stared into the abyss for about 30 seconds i don't i don't know what was going on probably answering a discord message day 60 i did manage to get to level 5 mining so i was actually kind of excited for that i continued to be a foraging loot goblin and today 61 until i did realize i probably should go be a responsible human and uh go take care of my chores and since i did have mining at level 5 i did switch over to the mining cape because you know it looks like a little nuggy on day 61 i did see another squid in the water so i went ahead and caught that and continued working on basically wood cutting and mining and foraging because i really needed to get those up to be able to work in the new zone to be able to clear stuff and also so i could start making more money i continued doing that well into day 62 until i finally realized okay yeah let's go let's go take care of the crops that have been sitting here for um 25 minutes with me not doing anything with them and then i'll let y'all guess what we did more foraging more mining in the plains biome at the start of day 63 i was staring off into the distance before i decided to go ahead and start going back to foraging don't know why i stood there for 30 seconds i then saw another squid on the pier and then i went back to town and sold everything and we were back up to 37 000. well that is until i bought crops i then decided to rearrange all of my stuff where it was a little bit more easier to get i did go over the functional area i bought four butter turns four butter turns some more cement things some furnaces and some sawmills because i was gonna make stuff that i could you know decorate my farm with because that was kind of one of my hidden goals that i had for myself was you know decorate my area so it looked nice also at one point i put the sawmill on top of myself not really sure why physics let me do that but it did and again dummy sister guard loaded everything up with all the stuff that was there and you know organizing bought more silo space and decided after um i don't know how many days to actually feed the cows which they immediately came running over and just devoured everything my inventory at this point day 64 is just it gives me anxiety watching this back to do the voiceover and then a quick trip to town for some 15k of gold worth of crops and i headed back and we started day 65 collecting more things like does she finally put everything up and we have given up have we given up yes thank you thank you then started working on forging and wood cutting in the mountain area i found this little light up by the little ice lake area and proceeded to play click the button click the button click the button and then went back and messed with the machines again so i don't know why i chose to do this and work on some of my crops day 65 into 66 i decided i really needed to finish forging i needed to get that up to level eight i really needed to level that up so i could get the jams so i could start making even more money and making the big money and then i decided that um i had no idea why i bought that many sawmills and just reduced it down to two which was in hindsight probably a good idea and we got rid of some of the other machines that i had just way too much of that there was no reason i then went ahead and bought some more mushroom boxes because honestly that's the only thing i needed to be buying at that point then i finally got up to forging level seven after i had literally clipped every single piece of grass i could find i went to town real quick sold what i could just realized looking back at the footage i sold 16 wheat seeds just no apparent reason and then finally started buying jams and i bought 30 of them to start and i had this little area next to my apple orchard that i was going to put them all originally i had one space in between them as you know i thought i needed that started jamming immediately up some strawberries that i had uh realizing that i probably could uh put these a little bit closer so i went ahead and started manually moving the ones i had bought because honestly running on top of them was a little bit easier day 67 i planted some crops and i picked up all of the jams that i had left to get jammed they're actually pretty quick and considering how much money you get it's kind of insane so i went to town and i went and settled everything i had because i had about 170 jams so we had 31 000. i was about to buy a ton of strawberry seeds to help make my money back i then started placing scarecrows to expand my fields because in order to have enough stuff or berries in between jammings so i had to basically prep three additional fields on top of what i had and when i say this took me a while it took me a while it was halfway into day 86 before i managed to water them all i haven't fertilized them yet mind you but that was just to water them still at this point was fascinated with making butter and i have no idea why now after spending nearly three minutes solid walking my character around to plant the fertilizer i finally broke over two-thirds of the way done with this and i actually bought a robux item and this is so that for the rest of the playthrough i could actually get stuff done and that was the planter so what this planter allows me to do is to put fertilizer and crop seeds into it and allow me to basically shove it around the field and i can speed puts things in now i'm going to tell y'all right now it took me a little longer than i would like to admit in order to get this to work but once i got it to work it was really nice and just look at the strawberries just i was very excited about this because this would allow me one to actually get some of my goals done because i kind of also wanted to build something and i have 30 days left pretty much and i have built nothing like the front end of our our farm looks poop and i went to town sold everything and bought strawberry seeds so when it was time to replant i had stuff ready to go and i refilled up my little uh auto feeder thing before heading back for the lovely nice day of day 69 and realizing i had plenty of time now to do other activities so much like getting a bunk bed i now had time for other activities and i realized i needed to get my wood cutting up because we needed to get into the mountain area also on this very nice day i decided to go ahead and feed the water the animals because you know i gotta be nice to them at some point after much deforestation and filling up my inventory um i went ahead and went back to town sold everything bought more strawberry seeds again the butter why why why are we still infatuated with the butter i forgot i spent that long on butter and apparently i stared at this screen for no less than a minute and a half so i then had my first harvest which with silver sickle i was able to very very quickly harvest it all up and it was it was huge i went over and put it up in the jams and yes this is my favorite thing to do watching it go and on day 70 we hit farming level nine one more level to max this was also when i got to replant my whole field and i'm loving i'm loving this auto you have no idea guys no idea best item in the game right there i then decided to sit and wait for my jams okay i'm i'm not saying everything in this playthrough was smart that was not my smartest moment once the jams were ready i did move i do promise y'all and i very hastily re-jammed everything because we needed to make back a lot of money from buying all those things and i wanted more went to town sold all the jam 25 000 so much i then started looking at the price for the crops for the mountains area to kind of get an idea of how much i was going to need on day 71 i did manage to hit level three of fishing and halfway through the day i managed to have a strawberry harvest so went and took care of that took everything i had to town and sold an absolute monster amount of jam and fish apparently some mushrooms we had 37 000 so quite a bit on day 72 was a replant and chore day so that was gathering up all the jam putting more in and replanting field and i went ahead and took another break uh because i need trees and trees will naturally respawn if you wait i don't know how long i waited it was at least a day or two just so i could get the max amount of stuff to kind of respawn so after kind of gathering up my mushrooms because fertilizer because i knew i was gonna have to refertilize my fields and apparently i'd left some jam sitting for me which by the way y'all let me know what your favorite jam is in the comment section down below i started working on clearing everything around from my farm so trees all that good stuff i caught a little bit of fish i was still trying to figure out how i could make the mountain area work at this point because i really wanted to get in there and i really wanted to be using the cranberries that you can get from up there because they give a lot of money then went to town and sold everything for 70 000 gold um i also picked up a couple quests from these guys because i wanted to kind of get some more gems so i could get some better stuff i also bought a absolute monster amount of strawberry seeds because i also knew i was gonna have to work and get some money day 74 uh business as usual and i started my deforestation attempts also on day 74 we went to town i completed a quest and i forgot that i have to wait 24 hours or 20 hours to get a new one and i also got carl's quest on so i went and sold what i had got another 21 000 headed home and got back to my uh tree murdering days day 75 again in between um getting that strawberry going i was murdering the trees for the rest of the day i decided to destroy the pink trees of the plains day 76 was also me struggling with the trees for those of you wondering why that this is probably very painful to watch us because it was even for me to play it because literally i was going around finding these minute little trees and i needed some big chunkies and i could not take down the ones that i really wanted to which were these guys in here so i could plant the cranberries i resigned myself to working on mining and chopping whatever i could back in the mountain area i was on day 76 had someone visit dead clown no idea hi thanks for stopping by on day 77 i just finished going through one of my strawberry harvests and i saw i had a couple trees and rocks so i decided let's go take care of them get that xp i was really struggling at this point guys to get some wood chopping xp i was trying as i might but i was losing faith i went to town sold everything i had to be able to do it for 51 000. yeah we're already up to 173 000 yet again again i was very fascinated with all the things i could plant up in the mountains once i had space and i was also trying to figure out time cost i then bought 500 strawberry seeds and there's there's more strawberry seeds or we're up to almost 800. what are you doing? d78 had pretty much been like the past couple days were where it was literally just me scavenging for what i could not using big brain strats just yet and making a lot of money with strawberries did go to town again sold a bunch of stuff made another 50 000 back after we had spent nearly 80k on strawberry seeds day 79 was the exact same oh it's so sad to watch this back but yeah yeah in the day 79 i did end up going to uh town selling everything for a 50 little 50k so that was nice nothing exciting happened on day 80 other than me going to town to sell actually a pitiful 11k i did however buy a single oak sapling in town and what i did was planted it because i had a thought maybe maybe i could use this to farm some wood cutting xp maybe we'll see and then went around because i realized it's day 80 and i have done none no decorating and y'all would give me so much grief if i did that so i sold all the stuff that was in the front bought some of the asphalt road and a few other things because you know i got that strawberry money now and on day 81 i actually started decorating my farm i know some of y'all like that looks horrible sister i kind of agree looking at this now but i started just kind of freestyling it putting stuff down seeing how it flowed also i much much better master of the building mechanics for this game so i was very easily able to lay down pass very quickly and deleted the asphalt that i'd put down because that just looked well i then decided that the pleb farm would definitely have some gnomes i put some little stone thingies down i did discover that i could put stuff on the ground underneath the machines which was nice i then started trying to decorate around my apple orchard i thought a nice little stone path would do well once they were all encased i realized i had like this little back corner area with nothing in it so i decided to kind of make like a little bench sitting area and i went back there and sat and it was nice and peaceful and i decided to flip them because i didn't like how i had it the first time also realized with having that light on that uh lights actually made a difference in this game and kind of made things not as dark so i was like okay let's kind of add some stone pathing around here let's kind of add some decorum day 82 i still was decorating looking around at flower pots towers let me be really honest amongst all this decoration i was trying to be fancy i tried some hay bales because i'm from the south and that is a decorum item in our park then i decided i hated them so i removed them because i wanted some like little garden lamp things and then went back and did some more chores or going into town at the end of day 82 selling everything i had gotten so we were just at about two and a half like 250k so uh day 83 started off i had literally just been staring at that i had decided that i was done with the chickens and i was done with the gals so day 83 they were going bye-bye because i was about to take a day or two off to let everything respawn i had not been using my brain yet i took all this apart on day 83. still don't know why i got it in the first place don't get the cows and chickens they're not worth it should not have ever gotten them day 84 it had been two days i immediately got in and i got wood cutting up to level six and realized i needed to be level seven so first order of priority other than making money because i like money was going to be getting wood cutting up i had 16 days left and i wanted to at least make a super farm up in the mountain areas also realized apparently had a ton of stuff in my inventory from the day 83 that i never went and sold off so after purging my inventory with much scrutiny we were at over 300k i started deforesting hoping to get wood cutting up to level seven day 85 i had finished most of the main area deforestation like as you can see in the background of these shots and it's most of it's gone like i had spent most of the day just clearing everything out i then moved into the mountain area before having to go back to town so that i could sell everything because my inventory was very full yet again still during this time even though i was you know mountain forest guard uh i still was trying to get my jam going because i wanted money if we were going to do cranberries in the furthest area i was going to need a lot of cash i started deforestation efforts in the plains biome hoping i could get another level that ain't though 86 i was working still on the plains biome i actually ended up also working on forging you know trying to multitask there i also bought some more slots in the silo because you know i was a hoarder and then went back up to the mountain area and kept trying to channel my inner mountain man before heading back to town and selling everything i'd gotten we were almost at 400k i was very surprised by that so and then i saw a squid so i decided to go and get it also i figured out how to use worms worms are very important on a fishing rod and with how much i was digging up i was getting plenty of them day 86 i was back in the mountain area clearing everything out chopping down what i could mining what i could and then i went back into the main plains area and i started trying to chop everything down out there that had respawned and then i had to go back and do the chores around my farm that i was doing such as gathering up mushrooms making fertilizer i did go to town sold all the junk i had hoarded on me again i need more inventory space i then decided let's go ahead and buy in some oak trees let's see if we can do something with this 88 days for me finally to have big big brain moment after piddling around in my silo for a little too long i went over and started planting trees as you can see by the lovely colors i have made on the screen um trees don't like to plant next to each other so i was having to basically babysit this the whole time so yeah i'm gonna not bore y'all with this i'll tell y'all when we got done with the trees so i finished the trees on day 88 the problem is you don't get as much experience if you take down the babies so i had to wait until they grew up into the biggins so i went around deforested in the plains area fished a little fish some more day 89 rolled around i chopped down some trees in the main area and then i started the deforestation process and wood cutting unlike you know farming you only have one or two cue spots so i was constantly having to click and watching where i was going because i could get stuck on the trees because they had collision the amount of pain and suffering i endured for this oh my god because i could see it was working so well on the second half of day 89 i started planting trees across the way so that once i was done chopping the trees on my side these would already be all done by day 90 i had finished that and we were back to chopping the main group of trees i had stopped attempting farming at this point because i really needed my wood cutting skill up i went to town i did end up buying more trees apparently and i planted them all back down the original batch was done at day 90 and i went ahead and planted more which is weird because planting the trees you get farming xp chopping the trees down you get wood cutting xp please explain this to me day 91 i had finally planted everything i went ahead and grabbed the mushrooms and i started deforesting the middle area on occasion i stopped to fish don't judge me and i started deforesting then i managed to move to the middle area at the very end of day 91 into 92 i unlocked wood cutting 7. i was done with trees oh my god i was done with trees so i had eight days to finish decorating and to build a super farm up in the mountain areas of course i had to go sit by my um orchard yeah if you build an orchard don't put a a little like swing bench next to it that's a bad idea because every time you run through there you'll spamming e you'll you'll get thrown into it so don't do that i did go back to town sold and then proceeded to buy so many cranberry seeds so many just 400 to start and then went and also got uh the silver axe because i was gonna have to chop a lot of trees up in the mountain area still didn't have mining up i was not gonna fuss with that right now because honestly i was ready to start my farm day 92 uh i started chopping down and kind of planning out the area that i was going to be putting stuff down in so when i started marking off where i would start because i knew how big the scarecrows were so i went ahead and started getting those areas set up and this bled over into day 93. it was it there's a lot of this at this point in time i was just going to go ahead and do six scarecrows worth i wanted to expand out to more but did not have enough time so i went ahead and plopped down two different wells because even though i have the nice fancy cedar thing um i don't have a good watering can and as you can see how fast that planter runs out when i am done i did also find out that if you plant stuff it still will grow it just takes longer if it's not watered it doesn't have a fertilizer also at this point when i was playing the game i know there's probably several people in the comment section like you should have gotten sprinklers when i was actually playing this was before they had made sprinklers super op so yes i am aware now that they have been patched they are much much better however at the time i was recording this and playing uh no they they did like four squares i'm gonna let y'all know it was well into day 94 before i got everything watered not everything was fertilized because i was still having to wait on that you know not using my big brain to uh you know just go buy the fertilizer because you know you had 300k that would have been smart brain bearing move but you know we've already discovered during this playthrough i'm dumb but i did manage at the end of day 94 to go ahead at least get some fertilizer down did also look at the large scarecrows for a minute thought about getting them but then just decided to go ahead and get some six of the smaller ones because i did want to make some stuff bigger because i wanted to make this a super farm and when i mean super farm it it's going to be a lot of cranberries so that's what i did for the rest of day 95 was continue to work on it also i want to let y'all know that there was a single ore i could not take out because i did not have a high enough mining skill that was so mad but into day 95 i went to town sold everything we had gotten together and i bought a lot of cranberry seed well over 700 so day 96 went ahead and worked on my fertilizer i also went ahead and filled in my lovely preserving barrels uh because this area looked a little a little unfilled also looking back at this i'm sorry anyone with ocd um i realized they returned the other way makes you feel any better to trap myself in one i don't know if that helps then went up and i got on 96 i got my first skill at level 10 which was the farming skill so i mean that's to be expected this game is called farmstead that that was going to be the first one i got done and it's kind of the easiest because everything pretty much contributes to farming i then spent a good majority of day 96 watering as much as i could finally had the big brain strat to go to town and buy some fertilizer to finish off the last little bit because my mushroom farm was not cutting it at this point and i wanted all this stuff fertilized but i was still watering i was still watering so much but the end of day 96 i had my second full harvest of cranberries i was super excited finally had gotten this one of the best farming methods they have in the game is up here doing this so i was super excited we had gotten to this point day 97 i replanted the field and i tried to finish up that last little bit of watering i had to do i was i was so excited to have all this done and i was gonna have three days to actually enjoy it and for those of you wanting to know i had only roughly about 150 seeds left from planting this entire field so it was about a 500 plus crop field so i was actually pretty proud of it but middle of day 97 we finally finished that watering so went ahead and started canning on up also started trying to grab some mushrooms because i had no fertilizer i then also started kind of decorating our jamming area just because you know it it looked a little out of place next to the very fully decorated um orchard and i tried i tried for y'all i i tried i tried i'm not normally like a let's decorate the area person minecraft i build like block houses okay i also put floors underneath the barrels too then i went around and collected all that lovely jam took me into day 98 and i did more decorating so that we could have all that nice and filled in and then went and checked on our farm i had 25 minutes so probably could get one more harvest in before we wrapped on up for the day but went ahead instead i went ahead and started building this really long road and trying to design a little bit better so i'm going to describe day 98 to day 100 for you all panic building because i wanted to at least have something nice to show at the end of this video and with the days only being about 10 minutes long i had roughly from about this point in the video 25 minutes to come up with something and sister's a little bit of procrastinator but this was next level so i buckled down and uh i'll let y'all see what we did i did also go catch a manta ray i even made a nice little area that had like the little well and i realized that there was signs so i went ahead and wrote the different stuff on the signs where stuff was pointing to and as always guys please make sure you subscribe and like the video it helps me out a lot this is my first 100 days adventure i always would appreciate your teak so that i can get better and make this more enjoyable for y'all so please let me know i would really appreciate in the comment section down below if there's anything you liked anything you didn't like and if there's any other games you would like to see me do this kind of thing with um also it would be up to like 50 hours for games that don't have a day night cycle because i know not all games do and i had a lot of fun doing this playing this game and honestly i would like to go back and play this game again however if i was to do 200 days i don't actually have the footage anymore so because i did actually keep playing this after i was done recording uh because i did enjoy the game it was a lot of fun now on day 99 i actually did some texturalizing of the sidewalks i put different stones down to help break up the path make it a little a little more appeasing and actually use the trees for my wood cutting farm in order to kind of help make you know a little more scenic view and i grabbed a couple of other decorative items to go ahead and make area kind of fill out a little bit more i did make this little park area and i also put down more of those garden lights i ended up not liking them spaced out so pretty much day 100 was just finishing up everything that we hadn't gotten done yet putting on some less decorative touches so to speak put a nice little street lamp in the corner and i went up and harvested our cranberries for the last time oh i was so excited we had a full field was getting so much stuff i wanted to jam them one more time that's what i did i would have just enough time as our playthrough ended to get one more last thing done i also want to see how much money we made because this was a lot that was a lot of cranberries so as the cranberries wrapped on up i went back to town and sold everything and so we had about 230 000 and i still had another set to wait through so while i waited for that final set to be done i went ahead and started trying to decorate as much as i could again panic building and panic jamming now at this point as i am gathering up the last little bit of this jam i actually have finished our timer so it has officially been 100 days but i do want to see how much money we've managed to grab so officially it has been 100 days i wasn't able to sell that last little bit of jam but i do want to show y'all everything that we have gotten here so skills as you can see there this is all the collectibles i've gotten i never got mayonnaise i got a lot of the fish didn't get all of them i wish i had so and there's the last little bit of our jam let's go ahead and sell that in town just see how much money we cultivated in total i mean it was probably yeah yeah so guys thank you all for making it to this part of the video i greatly appreciate it and hopefully you all have a great day see y'all next time you
