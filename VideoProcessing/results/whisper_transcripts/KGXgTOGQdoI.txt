Howto & Style
 Here's a view of my workplaces community garden. So it's been a couple of weeks since I've received my community garden plot and I've just been so busy and we've also had a lot of rain strangely in Orlando and it's summer it's the end of June and so it's just been strange having all the heat like high 90s and then having the rain and not having the time to get out. So the last time I came or the one time I came here and I brought my stuff out there was two plants this which I think is some type of squash which I don't have I might have gloves in here and I brought out a couple of boards there's hay in this container and I think I have a pair of gloves. Let's move this tomato cage and it looks like yeah there's another that might be sweet potato or that might be another squash yeah that's whatever oh actually this is not squash this is a humongous old cucumber oh how funny yeah this is a cucumber from that side he's connected to that side that one looks like sweet potato surprisingly everything's really green even though we've been having temperatures that are in the high 90s but feels like a hundred this is a strange it looks like there's what is that cantaloupe and it looks like everything was dying when I first came out but this looks like a weird watermelon a weird shaped watermelon look at that it's just weird so I'm gonna let this grow because I still need to bring my plants out and I'm probably gonna bring see in that corner we have like these cages and I usually set up a compost pile on my own area that I'm a little concerned about that plot because that plot looks like it's just growing kind of crazy watermelon yeah look there's a big watermelon right here trying to figure out what this is and just trying to keep it in the borders of it each other but there's a huge watermelon right here so that's the neighbor side and this looks like random sweet potatoes there's like a plant right here and I was gonna bring out another sweet potato that is growing and I want to put up wood I have some extra two by fours and some other wood that I have that sort of just kind of randomly growing I'm responsible for the area against the fence because I have two plots this is one plot and then there's another plot on that side and that's the middle so where those PVC poles are that's one plot I don't know how big that is but what what I want to do is put like this neighbor here I'm going to guess this is a two by maybe six so that's a good size and it's good to know because it helps keep your dirt dirt in there without washing away and it also helps to keep your neighbors plants from invading your area and I'm not sure what that plant is but this this side is growing really nicely so I'm just kind of moving moving some of the weeds and stuff around and then I will can't do much because I'm working where are my work clothes right now what's nice is it's just right outside our north building way over there that's north building and I work on a building on this side called the west building this side is the east building so it takes a few minutes to walk out here so you could water it and tend to it during lunch or after work and it's been a while since I've been out here my main concern in the past has always been red ants and I'm also going to change that little sticker to put my name in my extension and yeah what I'm going to do is look for some see these cages they actually bought a whole roll of wire and put together these cages for tomato cages really and so I see some extra ones over there what I do is I take one of the lower ones sometimes people will cut them in half and I just put all of my weeds so there's some smaller ones like this one's really small for a good small tomato plant and I actually have a couple of tomato plants which is would need a six-foot wire but this one is short it's probably about two feet two and a half feet and what I'll do when I do move the rest of my plants from the other house from the house so what I'll do is I'll dig a hole so that this this wire thing will stay so I'll have to bring a tape measure out here so that when I go to Home Depot or wherever I can cut the right I can get the wood cut the right size if I bring those out make the reds beds like this it'll be much easier to deal with to deal with to deal with the the weeds and to deal with neighboring plants so yeah I'm gonna do exactly what this plot has done because I really like their plot growers so these are volunteers all this is voluntarily growing from another season I'm gonna let them grow because I can always use sweet potatoes once it becomes fall and they're ready to harvest so I'll show you some of the other sites like somebody's growing some strawberries that looks like some herbs probably mint and maybe oregano that looks like some some type of squash or melon they allow us to grow grapes now I wanted to grow berries so I don't I'm not gonna do that right now there's just too much stuff going on so I'm gonna change my nameplate and next time I come out here will hopefully be when I'm bringing more of my existing plants and my wood to just at least put down my raised bed frame so I can start dumping in some really good quality soil that I have at the house thanks for watching
