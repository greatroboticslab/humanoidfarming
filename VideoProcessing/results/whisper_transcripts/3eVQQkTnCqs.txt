 So we've managed to plant out our seedlings and finally got the strip irrigation up and running and installed. So just hang on guys, dogs are barking. Hi, thank you for coming back. If you came back, if it's your first time here, this is the kind of content that you're going to be seeing for a while now. I'm focusing on our vegetable garden and establishment of this. We've got a number of things we're still going to do as we expand onwards and I'll keep you coming along with me. So if you're new to this, please hit the subscribe button, give it a thumbs up, hit the notifications bell, interact in the comments and let's get some discussion. Music Because we don't have a fancy jang seeder, the way we've got to seed this is we basically have to come along here and rip four little furrows and then I'm going to have to hand sprinkle seeds into each furrow and then gently cover it up afterwards. Music We've got two rows of beans in these two beds and we've tried to space them 10 centimeters in the line. Music Music Check it out, it's been hot as putting those carrot seeds in, sweating like a beast. But what we're going to do is we're going to use Jean Martin's trick. We're going to put some beet seeds at the front end of the bed over here. So we know when they germinate and I'm going to throw a weed guard over this row this time around. And we'll see if we can speed up the germination of those carrots. Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music If there was another way of doing this I would. I really don't like these things but they have to be used and they do work well as long as they don't rust off and die. And you can see here our dripper emitters are working nicely. They're spaced out every 30 centimeters between the drippers and it works out because those same sort of plant spacings we're using in some of our cropping. And then if we look in this here just under the surface here it's moist it's very moist so this pool underground here has really helped out. And then all of these things I'm picking up here. These are those bug poos that's just here in our compost. Okay we're down in the bottom garden here we're going to get our seedlings ready. Just see if I can get this fly. Yeah bastard! Planting holes marked out by drippers and we're going to come in and put these seedlings in. Check us out! to have hollowed one. when we see that there's a leaf from some 조 jonathan, one ch tres? Both黑 dove are looking to be able to create those crumbs here and take out my ended Lukaku oil. Two hands on one. this is got a dream stepping so they start to get ready! So whatever it needs to mean, you can go ahead and wrap time. This is these消 arena in the Indian town. So we just finished that one bed of spinach but I don't think I'm gonna film it all. You guys get the idea. It's a time lapse. Planting takes time. Time lapses while you're planting. So what I'll do next is I'll just show you what it all looks like. So we just finished planting this space. Six beds in. Yeah, so we're probably gonna get a bit of rain this evening and that's gonna really help out. It's been a very hot morning. I've actually been out here in this banana section behind me here. We've got every alternate row mulched and every alternate row open and I've just broad forked the open rows and I'm gonna come plant in all of our extra seedlings. So when you get a plug you often get two or three little seedlings on it. So I actually tear those off and keep the primary one, the main one in my main beds and then the secondary ones if they're any good. I can start another bed but generally you end up with like secondary patches. So you've got to make sure you have like you have that space available where you can just propagate things out. It's nice to have big rustic type beds around at the same time. It all adds to the system I think. And I'll cover up. Ready? Then I'll cover up. Next time to make sure. I've just finished planting in all the extra seedlings in what I'm gonna call our overflow area it's sort of experimenting with optimizing the space under the bananas we've put in a couple of lines of spinach some eggplants and peppers under the bananas actually in the mulch and that's just to try and optimize our use of the space like we've got this we've got this row over here and we've planted the spinach on this side so we can still walk on this side and I've thinned out a whole lot of the leaves so that we get better light inception and then on then on this side over here we've just dug in some holes and put the eggplants into them cut the extra cut the leaves on the sides too that is a bit extra mulch but this is to let more light in so that these things can maybe survive but we'll see it's about optimizing the space and the tasks involved with it like this will be heavily mulched so we never really have to weed and things here and if we're walking on this pathway over here then the spinach will keep the other side closed so I think overall it's a good layout but we'll see our banana section I was planting out all that spinach that's not quite some tropic agriculture but it's sort of where I'm aiming myself towards I don't have the capacity right now to try and establish a centropic system so we're playing with various skills mixing and matching and I'm trying to understand what where we can push these things because I've already got a lot of plant banana areas that look like that so if I could come into a banana area that already has plants in it and instead of trying to re-establish the ideal system how can I convert the most unideal system into the ideal system and make a number of income sources in along the way some of those things are going to do well others aren't but it would be nice to figure it out hands-on is the best way to learn I think the as I'm out in is it keep in mind here's moving from around to AWS specific years as I do so you Well guys that's the end of my day. It's been hot and it's been tiring and I'm buggered. Rob's on his way back here now from work. Unfortunately he's not going to be talking much in this video because it's just the way the week worked out. My seedlings were delayed and I only received them on Friday which is normally my video day which is when we start to put the final touches together for you guys to see. So today I've had to plow through all of this by myself. We planted out and I gotta take this footage inside now and go and whack out and edit. I'm looking forward to it. I've got a pretty good idea of what we're going to talk about. So the idea with this video is what I wanted to show you is our irrigation system, what we went through to start putting it in, the strip irrigation, the types of fittings we used and then the way it's working. So far visually it drips very well from its emitters. They are identically spaced so each the two pipes next to each other have their emitters in the same places which is just beautiful. We had a 10 meter rope so we measured that out and I always cut between two emitters, exactly between them to try and get them so that the two emitters will be in line next to each other and we'll be able to plant dual on the top of the bed. Other than that it's been a pretty good day out here. I've achieved quite a lot by myself and I think I've worked up a serious thirst. So old Charles Glass over there on that side in the cold, cold in my cold room which is too small for the vegetables but in my cold room I've got a Charles Glass waiting for me. Cheers guys, Rob's on his way here to say hows it, check out what I've done, have a beer away. Boo! Oh
