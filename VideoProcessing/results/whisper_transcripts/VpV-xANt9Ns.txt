 Hello everyone. So glad you could join us today. It is 12 o'clock and so I think we're going to go ahead and get started. I'm sure there's going to be a few more people that will be logging on but I'll just go ahead and start with our get us rolling. Thank you for joining us today. This is Heather Frederick. I'm with the Center for Arkansas Farms and Food. We have partnered with Ryan Neal and Colin Massey with Benton and Washington County Extension Offices to host a series of webinars this fall. Last month we had our tomato virtual demonstration and today we are going to be talking about vegetable equipment considerations with Nathan Boone. I'm going to pass it over to Ryan here but just before I do that I wanted to let you guys know or kind of set some kind of guidelines for asking questions. We want this to be an interactive meeting. This is not on the webinar style so we can see your faces so I just wanted to let you know that. If you have questions you're on mute right now you can raise your hand you can use the chat box we'll be keeping an eye on the chat box and so you know we can have you unmute yourself and to make this as interactive as possible. I'll pass it over to Ryan and he can introduce Nathan for us. Thank you and thank you Heather and I appreciate Nathan being with us today. You know we had originally planned on Nathan being here for an in-person meeting and maybe multi-day some sort of training and anyway we've kind of pivoted to being online which I think will be beneficial because we'll be able to record this and also have it on our YouTube channel and so I'll tell a little bit about Nathan. He grew up farming with his father, uncle, and grandfather on a conventional grain and livestock operation in Boone County Indiana. After graduating from Depew University with a degree in geology he migrated west to explore organic farm production. In 1998 he was hired by Seeds of Change to manage their seven acre certified organic research farm in northern New Mexico. Shortly after Nathan moved to Sonoma County California to manage Oak Hill Farm, a well-established 40 acre organic operation specializing in produce ornamentals and field grown flowers. After managing these farms Nathan launched his own operation First Light Farm in Sebastopol, California. Within five years First Light Farm grew into a dynamic 20 acre operation marketing through a CSA program, Farm Stand, five acre farmer's market, at pumpkin patch, restaurant accounts, and wholesale distribution to six Whole Foods Market stores in the San Francisco area. In 2015 Nathan sold First Light Farm and moved back to Indiana to take over the family farm. Boom Family Farm is a 200 acre with 70 acres currently in transition to organic certification. In 2016 Nathan purchased an Oxbow Pixel one row green bean picker to produce green beans on 22 acres of transitional ground for a contract he negotiated with a processor in 2018. Will be the first certified organic production. In the meantime the farm will produce transitional green beans on contract alfalfa orchard grass hay and grain. I'm sure Nathan can also give us some updates on where he's at with that but without further ado I'll turn it over to Nathan and let him tell us more about himself. Nathan, I'm going to stop sharing my slides so you should be able to get yours and I'm going to pin And just one more quick quick note as Nathan's getting his slides up you can I just wanted to remind you all that you can change the view of how you're looking viewing this the slides and the speaker with the in the upper right hand corner of your box there should be some settings for viewing. All right Nathan you're on mute yet so Good morning unmuting is the first consideration. Good morning to Arkansas thank you everyone for having me for inviting me. I was hoping to be there in person and I think I will be doing some farm visits coming up shortly which Ryan is coordinating. I want to thank Ryan for inviting me for the University of Arkansas Extension and the Center for Arkansas Farms and Food for just kind of hosting this and holding the container and making it possible and The guys have been really great to help me get this organized and get this presentation together so thank you very, very much. I wanted to start out with just some storytelling in the beginning to kind of warm us up and I really do encourage everyone that's here online to think of this as a dialogue and a conversation because I'm. I'm a grower many of you are hopefully growers as well and we learn best through each other and from each other and I certainly all the things that I've learned had been from from other people. So I really encourage you to raise your hands or do whatever it is to get Heather's attention so we can hear from you inshallah. Okay, so I am going to present to my next slide. And for some reason I'm not able to click it forward. So let me see if I can move forward here. Nope, this is not what I want to do. Of course. Yeah, there we go. It just took a little bit of time. So I wanted to tell the story of how I got here in my learning path. Because all of us have some kind of a path that has led us into are we continue to be in agriculture. And so my learning path went through many iterations. And as Ryan mentioned, I did grow up on a conventional grain farm in central Indiana very typical kind of operation multi generational. And I had no interest or no, I really didn't like gardening at all when I was a kid because it was just work. I mean, mom would say go pick green beans and I was like the worst thing ever. And then here I am in a green bean operation later in life. But at any rate, my journey back to produce was just became a personal interest in growing my own food. And that kind of culminated in landing a farm management system at Seeds of Change in northern New Mexico, which was kind of a dream job. And managing other people's farms is one way to learn very rapidly because a lot of times you're stepping into an existing farming operation and you kind of just get to play with a full set of toys and see how they do it. You get to see the good and bad and the ugly and Seeds of Change certainly introduced me to an operational seven acre seed trial farm and we grew all kinds of variety. It was just outrageous. I mean, the kind of stuff that they were growing there I'd never seen before. And that definitely just kind of fueled my interest in growing healthy food, diverse food and lots of different specialty crops. I farmed there for two seasons and then I got an opportunity to work at Oak Hill Farm through a friend that was a connection in Sonoma County. And Sonoma County became a home for about 15 years for me. So the next step was to go manage that farm and that was had been around since the 50s really and had a full full farm working crew. They had vegetables, they had flowers, they had ornamentals, everything was there in place. And that was a whole nother scale. They had flower markets in San Francisco. I mean, it was a really, really dynamic operation. And I was playing a small part actually just in the produce, but also also all overall farm management. But that introduced me to flowers, which I which I'll come back to in a little bit. And then after managing people's farms, you and if you have any experience in working for someone else or for managing a farm, you get to the point to where you feel like you're ready to do it for yourself. Part of that is that you're kind of limited when you're managing someone else's farm because it's their farm and you can't always do what you want. And you may not always see eye to eye with how they're doing things or their considerations. So after I worked for Oak Hill Farm, I actually took a five year sabbatical off of farming because I've been farming intensively for about four to five years. And I kind of felt like I hit a wall with managing other people's farms. I didn't it didn't feel like that's the next step I needed to take was manage yet another farm. So I took some time off and I was the land steward at the Sonoma Land Trust. And that was fabulous because I got to stay in the Sonoma County and I was managing large properties rather than individual farms. But I still came back to that passion. I still I still found that I really, really wanted to be a grower. And so that's why in 2007 I launched First Light Farm and I picked this picture of this kale crop because a lot of our farm was based on this, you know, really good crop for us. And there's reasons for that. One, this is a coastal farm. It was very productive. I had a silt soil, silt loam that you just could not, you could not do anything wrong with the soil would always produce. There's no, there's no downside to a silt loam. And because it was coastal and because it was fertile soil and because I had a goat dairy nearby that we made tons of compost from, I had all kinds of fertility. And that, that farm became a signature kale farm. But anyway, I wanted to walk you through how I jumped from managing other people's farms to my own farm in 07. And then we're going to get into equipment considerations as to how equipment plays a role in one's ability to grow and diversify a farm operation, hopefully. So the advantage of working for someone else and managing other people's farms is you get to take what all the learning that you can from them and all the different operations and systems and equipment and just how they do things. It's all, it's all systems. So everything that I had learned that turned into about a 20 acre, 25 acre year round vegetable operation, all kinds of markets. And so when you grow that when you grow that much vegetables, you have to sell them. And so really your, your marketing becomes a huge driver for you. And we were at that time about 50% direct sales retail through CSA farmers markets, restaurants, chefs, you name it. And then about 50% wholesale to natural food stores. So that's kind of the 50 50 was kind of how we did it. But there was a lot that led up to this. And I wanted to kind of remind everyone, especially for the beginning farmers or the farmers that are just kind of getting getting going, is that, you know, really. You can't just look at the pictures and realize that a lot of work went into all of these things. So it looks like talent is often careful preparation. And this quote also says what looks like skill is often persistent revision. So we're always as farmers, we're always tinkering with things, right? Like we're always trying to figure things out. And so every week and every month and every season and every winter, we're kind of recalibrating and that's kind of how, how it works out. But it's good to have some goalposts in mind. So here's some of the ways that I kind of, I set this up because I was doing a panel on scaling up and this is kind of a real linear progression of like how I started, what scale I was at, how I did different things and why. So I wanted to kind of walk everyone through this. So in 07, I started with about two acres. I found a landowner that was a cooperative and wanted to work with me and gave me access to the land and a lease and a property. And a lease and a place to live actually, and even let me use this tractor. So that was a great low, low cost way to get started farming. And I started with farmers markets because that's really the fastest way to get into into selling is enter into a farmers market and also the restaurant sales. So that's where I started. But I also started building my CSA at the same time because going to farmers markets, you're meeting people, you're talking it up, you're building your CSA simultaneously to that. So I did that for about a year. I got the CSA membership up to about 100. And remember, this was during the Great Recession. So this was like 07, 08. And so it wasn't an easy thing to do. But where I, the region of the country that I was in, Northern California, local food was becoming a more and more of a thing. And so people were very responsive and the CSA model at that time was still very attractive and it was easy, relatively easy to sell the CSA shares and keep that going. And then in 09, I took over a 10 acre potato farm. That was just an opportunity to kind of fell on my lap through a friend. And it was an existing operation. It had a great reputation. It was a dry farm potato operation, which I didn't know anything about. I didn't know anything about growing that much potatoes, but I just kind of stepped into it. And the existing owners kind of coached me and introduced me to their markets. And that's where it kind of took off. The potatoes then led me into getting into additional farmers markets because a lot of our farmers markets are full out here. I don't know what they're like down where you're at, but it's actually very hard to get into farmers markets. You get on a waiting list and it's really not even that easy because if the market managers are really trying to balance the kinds and the types of produce and products that are in the market. So if you don't have the right product mix, you're not going to get in. I mean, if you just have tomatoes and corn and melons, everybody's got that and you're not going to get in. So the potato farm gave me an opportunity to get into the markets. And this highlights a concept that I want to share with you. And this equipment conversation is going to be as much about concepts and ideas and approaches and philosophies is that it's going to be about me telling you what equipment works because you guys know what equipment is out there. There's more information than ever on the Internet and every which way and from extension. And there's so many resources now. But the question is, how do you decide? How do you know? And one of the concepts I want to I want to encourage and emphasize this morning is stepping into the river of life. And when you choose to grow, when you choose to expand, when you choose to go in a particular direction, you're stepping into that river of life, which then carries you to a new place that you weren't before. And you don't know where it's going to lead and you don't know where it's going to take you. But you're affirmatively stepping into it. And so this 10 acre potato farm is a really great example. It kind of landed in my lap. I didn't really know what I was getting into, but it was awfully hard to say no to because it was a great opportunity. And it actually translated into a massive market expansion because using the potato reputation of this particular farm, I was instantly able to get into farmers markets that I never could have gotten into if I just showed up and said, hey, I have veggies. They were like, oh, you're the old Tommy boy potato garden. I'm like, yeah, that I'm that guy. And so they're like, okay, come Saturday. So that opened it up. So I started I had access to this 10 acre farm in coastal California with this gorgeous silt loam, and kind of a cooler, more moist climate. And I started trialing a bunch of different things because I knew this place could grow. I said, know exactly what. And one of the things that I trialed was kale. And I honestly direct seeded kale and just walked away from it. I didn't even have time to deal with it. I just direct seeded a bunch of different crops, including kale. And then I came back like mid summer and the kale was already like practically waist high. And it was the most beautiful kale I ever saw. So that led me to the next step. So I moved on and so we're all the way to 2011. I had grown, I was at the 10 acre scale and I was starting to diversify into other crops. And I knew that I needed more help. And there's a difference between farm worker help, which is the people that are working in your field and helping you and people that are helping you manage and doing high level, either tillage or cultivation or running deliveries or what have you. So I needed someone kind of a right hand person to be able to help me. So I brought on a farming partner. And at that same time I landed with this kale, amazing kale that I had, I landed a contract for a hundred cases of kale per week from a kale chip manufacturer that was fairly close. And I thought that that was the greatest thing ever. And it was, a hundred cases per week is a good deal. And it was a great price and everything was lined up. And I had, I kind of had one season of kale at this farm and I thought I could do it. And I did it. And I thought, the very first delivery, I got a call back a couple of days later and they said, we cannot use your kale. And I said, why not? And they said, it's so sweet and so soft and so tender because of my coastal setting that it did not dehydrate well. And it didn't make good chips. So here I was with a hundred cases of kale per week in the field and the main buyer that I had couldn't buy it. So this is a, this is a tale too, of stepping into the river of life, but also where a tragedy leads to opportunity. So with all of that kale needed to be sold, I developed additional markets to other regional buyers. Cause I had a ton of kale in my mind. And I started reaching out to all the different stores and distributors. And I found that they were starting to pick me up. And so that, that led to more, more increase. And then in 2012, my partner and I found another farm that was just coming up. This was a retiring farmer. And we also took that one over, including his equipment and everything started to gel at that point. And at that point we had grown to the scale where we had all the farmers markets. We had all the wholesale. And now we were just really kind of like dialing it in and really trying to perfect our production systems and get our yields up and our quality up and just make everything click. So we also started our CSA back up in 2012. And then that went all the way until 2014 and 2014, for personal reasons, my daughter graduated high school, for example, and went off to college and my parents were getting older and I wanted to move back to the farm. So I sold my farming operation, the business, not the land, because we rented everything, but I sold the farming business to my partner. And I moved back to Indiana in 15. So that kind of capped the whole seven year expansion process of farming. And when I came back to Indiana, it's completely different. There's not a local food movement at all. I couldn't find no interest in diverse, any kind of produce in the local markets. And I didn't want to repeat the farmers markets experience because they're not as vibrant there. And you just can't. I had a lot of land to play with and I needed larger markets. So I found a food bank actually that had a processing facility that wanted to buy green beans. And I made a contract with them. I found the green bean picker. And ironically, I came to Arkansas first to look at a green bean picker. Actually, really, really close to where Ryan is, I think, up there in Northwest Arkansas. But anyway, I bought a green bean picker and I started that operation. And the rest of the farm, as Ryan said, is in kind of transition to organics. And we've been doing organic grains on smaller parcels. We did field corn. We've done tofu soybeans. This year we did popcorn and that worked out pretty good. So we're just kind of playing around. But anyway, that's all of my background in produce and playing around with all the different equipment. So let's jump into kind of getting into the heart of this conversation. So this quote is from a physicist that said, an expert is a person who has found out by painful experience all the mistakes that one can make in a very narrow field. So that's, I'm not an expert, but I certainly have gone through a lot of painful experiences. And some are mistakes and some are just the curveballs that you find in life. So I want to talk about pitfalls to consider when you're thinking about how to make your operation better. And I'll just pause right here and ask Heather if anybody is raising their hands or asking any questions. Heather, I think you're muted. I don't see any questions out there, but does anybody have any questions at this point? You can feel free to raise your hand or type something in the chat box. Okay, no problem. No problem. So I kind of thought about when I read this slide, I was just kind of like, what are all the things that I did? And now this is from my perspective. There's certainly many, many more pitfalls to consider, but these are the ones that kind of jumped out to me. The things that if I could do it all over again, or if I could talk to a younger person or someone that's just starting out, you know, what are some of the things to consider? And one of the things that I did a lot of was doing without like substituting grit and sweat to make it work. And certainly that's always necessary. But if you're in any kind of small business and if you're a small farmer or any farmer in general, doing without, you kind of have to do without like, and I don't know anybody that can just buy the perfect factory and just start running it. That's not how farmers typically do it. But there's a fine balance between understanding what you need to be successful and then actually not doing it. Like just doing something slightly less than, which is guaranteeing you that you're going to be less successful. So when you're younger, and for me, for sure, you know, I had a lot more energy and a lot more ambition and I could work longer and harder. I would do that. But looking back, I sure wish that I would have just stopped to do a little bit more planning, to do a little bit more projecting and calculating and number crunching and understanding like, yeah, the sooner I get this particular piece of equipment, the sooner I can be producing at the scale or at the level that I want to. And making my operation click better because I think for me, like I've evolved to the point where I look at things now more as a system and as an organization. And as an entity rather than just diving into one thing at a time. So that's one thing. Skimping on important aspects to save money. You certainly have to save money. But you it doesn't make sense to save money on things that are costing you. Right. So like if you do need something, you need to figure out a way to make that happen, because the sooner you make that happen, the sooner everything's going to be working the way you need it to. And hopefully that's tied to you being economically viable. Not selecting the equipment that can work longer term. This is another common thing that happened for me and other growers that I know is that you just get you just get what can get you by that season. Or, you know, in my case, I went through this evolution of transplanters. So, you know, first we transplanted everything by hand because we were like a two acre scale and that works fine. But that means you're limited to doing everything by hand. So your your weeding is done by hand and no matter how straight you try to make your rows, it's pretty hard to do mechanical cultivation or tractor cultivation. And then you do transplanting. The first transplanter I got was a one row transplanter. And so that worked great. We just thought that was the greatest thing ever. And then I got the kale contract and I needed to plan about an acre of kale at a time. And the one row, you know, you can only make two rows on a bed if you offset your one row and then drive it out. And then you drive down the bed and turn around and drive back the other way. That way you get two rows. Well, you can never get them straight. So we were still we had saved time by having a transplanter, but we didn't have a two row transplanter. So that meant that our rows were a little squirrely and we couldn't really use mechanical cultivation that well. And every once in a while we'd knock plants out. And then we graduated eventually to our our higher speed two row mechanical transplanter. And then then that kind of like sustained us and was the real ticket that kept the farm going for the duration of the farm. So, you know, looking back, I sure wish I would have just bought the two row, not struggled with the one row at all. But I didn't know that at the time, but I'm I'm telling you guys now. So now you know that. So just don't don't think that you're going to if you step up every single time you do that, that means you're going to be buying a lot of things and then and then getting back out of them. And with smaller equipment, as you may know, it doesn't always hold its value as well as larger equipment. So burning through a bunch of small equipment means that your bone yard turns into kind of like a museum of old stuff that you don't want to use anymore. The other thing is buying old things that break down all the time. We all know about that one. I mean, there's a lot of cheap stuff on Craigslist and Facebook. And sometimes if you have time to fix all that or if you like to fix stuff, that's cool. But the bottom line is when you are when it's go time and it's spring and you're planting and you're harvesting and you're doing all that stuff. You don't want some anything to break down at that time. Everything that's broken, you want to fix it late spring or early or late winter, make sure everything's working. So a lot of I know I know one farmer in particular is actually my best friend. And I don't know why it is that this farm family, they're always breaking down. And it's not because they buy old things necessarily. But for some reason, that farm is always breaking down and they're always, you know, you always see a tractor sitting in the field and there's some pickup truck next to it. And they're always jumping this tractor and doing that. And that's a real drag. I like to have everything working and going as much as possible. So that can really slow you down. Also buying too many things, you know, in specialty production, there's all kinds of equipment. There's a lot of there's a lot more more now than ever. And you can certainly buy lots of bells and whistles and pieces and things that can help you. And, you know, it depends on what your finances are. If you can afford those things and you can cash flow them and you've got the savings and it's important to you, that's not a problem. But if you have if you're on a budget, you kind of have to be a little bit more specific and a little bit more focused. Also thinking about one of the things that I did early on was thinking about buying equipment as an expense when really your equipment is a capital asset with a much longer lifespan. So, you know, if you think about that, that piece of equipment, it might be three, four or five, six thousand dollars. You're like, wow, I can't afford that. That's that's a lot of money up front. But really, a piece of equipment is a capital asset that doesn't really lose its value that much. I mean, it does depreciate and you might not get as much for it as when you paid for it. But it really should last. And you really you've got to give yourself the ability to cost that out over its lifespan of its use. So if you're going to use something for 10 years, 15 years, even five years, it doesn't really cost the five grand the first year. I mean, you have to come up with a five grand, but it doesn't cost your operation that much each year. So for me, that's that's one of the things that probably prevented me from just investing and figuring out ways to invest that would give me the equipment and the wherewithal to get down the road and get done what I needed to do. And that gets me to these last two points. So avoiding planning and making a commitment to find capital, because we just sometimes we just jump to our conclusions like I can't afford that or or that's not for me or maybe I'll do that next year. And instead of just planning it out and really looking at your operations, say, you know what, I really do need to upgrade my irrigation system or I really do need to make this happen. I really need to build this walking cooler, but I don't have the money. How can I find the money? So find your solution first and then figure out how to finance it. But if you don't, if you always just make the excuse, I don't have the money for you, you're not going to do it. And that's just that's just the way it works for me anyway. And then avoiding financing and therefore more sustainable cash flow for your operation. So, you know, when you I like to pay for things if I have the money. And one of the downfalls of that is that it's hard to cash flow your operation if you have to buy a bunch of equipment all at once. And when we took on our 16 acre farm, we actually took on about a $90,000 loan. We bought all the equipment from the retired farmer and he self-financed about 40 grand of that. And we had to come up with 50 grand. And we actually crowdfunded for about half of that 50 grand. So about 25 grand we got in a crowdfunding. And then the other half we we found a private investor. The that was a good way to spread all that out. But the mistake that we made is that we had a three year payback. And I don't know why we did three year payback because at the time it seemed like the way to do it, but it wasn't. Because that much that big of a loan needed a way longer payback time because it really I mean we were able to pull it off, but it was very difficult and it put a lot of stress on the farm. So when you avoid financing, it really puts a cash flow crunch on your farm. So figure out what you need and try to find a long window, a long runway, so you can cash flow the equipment over a longer period of time. So that's that's my suggestion on that. And this is kind of a story that I wanted to share with you. It's very similar to my transplanter story, actually. So this is a great little operation out east. Jean Paul is as well known. He's written some books and he's on the speaking circuit and all that. And he's really a big advocate of this, too, of like, you know, thinking about your your ideal equipment system, thinking about how the pieces fit together. Right. So and he says you really have to plan before you spend a nickel. And every time you purchase equipment, it narrows your options for future purchases. So he talks about how for years they did a water wheel transplanter. And Ryan tells me a lot of people have the water wheel transplanters in your area and they work and they're they actually work pretty good and they work good through plastic mulch and all that. But for Jean Paul, he found that they weren't very well designed for what he needed for long for day long transplanning days. And you just couldn't get it. He just they weren't fast, very fast or kind of slow. So they bought a high speed carousel planner and they increased their efficiency. And that's kind of where he needed to be. So again, this goes back to being realistic about the scale that you want to be at and, you know, kind of landing on the the size or the solution that's going to fit you for a little while. You don't want to outgrow of your clothes the day after you buy them, you kind of want to grow into them and then have a little bit of room for expansion and for some change as you go along. So just going to take a quick drink of water, excuse me. Okay, so before we get in, we haven't talked hardly anything about equipment, but I'm going to talk about farm scaling up issues. And this being kind of the backdrop and the in the foundation for when you think about equipment and how to think about it. So when you when you think about scaling up and I always put this first and you'll find that when you read about farm planning, the very first thing that they talk about is your goals. Like, what are your goals? Because everything is relative to you. What is it that you want? What is it that you're trying to do? What's important to you? And I remember, I'll tell you a little story when when I was farming in California. Our farm was selected to receive farm financial planning technical assistance from a new nonprofit. And these were like people with finance backgrounds and they had worked for banks and they were like business planners and they were really super smart. And we sat down for our very first meeting with our with our advisor and he was going to be our advisor for the next two years. And so we had no idea what to expect. We were farmers. And so we sit down in our kitchen table with him. And the very first thing is he looked at both me and my firing partner. He said, Well, what do you guys want to do? And we both looked at each other and laughed and we're like, Well, we thought you were going to tell us, you know, because you, you really have to decide yourself what it is that you're doing and why and what's your personal. So what's important to you and why is very, very important. Don't overlook that. And then you start with an accurate assessment of your operation, you know, and I put both feeling and finances here. So how did how does your life feel in this particular setting? And what are your finances telling you about how you can fund and continue and maybe make a go a go of this so And then your current and your potential markets. So your current markets or whatever they are. And then your potential markets are are kind of pointing you to where you can grow because you can't grow beyond your markets, obviously. And for me, the market development always preceded the production expansion. So we never produce anything if we didn't have a market for it. And we and we certainly grew things anticipating that there are current markets could absorb them. But we never ever planted without knowing where we would which channel we would go with that particular crop. And then this next piece is really about your your personal orientation and capacity for change, because when you you know when you're on a smaller scale, you have kind of the flexibility to be your own Your own boss, of course, and you're kind of just doing your own thing, your own personal way. And that's really important at that scale. But when you start to get larger scale, you're all of a sudden now you're you're more of like an orchestrator or a conductor of a much larger, more chaotic symphony. So whereas before you're just jamming by yourself and and just in your garage and you're having a great time. But all of a sudden now you've got more farm workers, you've got more customers, you've got more days that are this and that is happening. You have to be able to orchestrate that and develop higher level systems and also managing more relationships. So all of these things mean that you have to you have to increase your capacity and all of these things. And can you can you do that or can you learn to do that or are you kind of already cool with that? But that's that's a big thing, because some growers that, you know, even the growers that I hobnob with and rubbed elbows in the markets with. You could see some growers were kind of like, well, this is this is all I'm going to do. Like, I don't I'm not interested in anything else. This is I'm going to grow apples and that's it. And other people were just like really creative and dynamic and just trying all kinds of things. And, you know, there's no good or good or bad or right or wrong. It's just, you know, scaling up requires increasing your your capacity for change. And then when you talk about or think about scaling up, you know, it's important to understand the need. Are you looking for more income? Do you want to do it full time or is it already full time? You want to make more money? Do you have land like I have? I have I have the blessing and the you know, also the the curse of having a lot of land. I have 200 acres. I can't just do one thing. I mean, I have to figure out how to use all the land. Or maybe you just have an opportunity. Maybe there's a market that's literally knocking on your door that's asking you, hey, could you grow this for me? And I've had that situation. I mean, the kale, but also we grew we grew cabbage for sauerkraut. And that was by far my funnest contract ever because growing cabbage. I don't know. It just turned out to be really, really fun. Our biggest head was 21 pounds and there's something really satisfying about growing a 20 pound head of cabbage and selling it on contract. So just define your need, understanding what it is. Why are you scaling up and what is really driving it? And what is your relationship to that driver? Is that is that all in alignment for you? So I'm not going to talk about the SWOT analysis a lot in this presentation that came up in another presentation, but a SWOT analysis is very helpful. You can look it up, but I will tell you very quickly. It's the strength, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. And it helps you to kind of step out of your box because a lot of times as growers, we don't always manage our farms or think about our farms as a business. It's just kind of like us doing it right. And we were very highly attached with the farm. So the farm success is really about our success. And if the farm fails, then we fail. And really, these other ways of looking at your business come from other industries and other business worlds, and they're very, very helpful. So the SWOT analysis is an opportunity for you to kind of get out of your personal attachment to your operation and really look at it objectively and say, okay, what are the strengths of my operation? What are the weaknesses and what are the opportunities and what are the threats? Okay, so as a grower, you are probably more biased towards optimism and to the possibilities and to things being possible because that's why you're a grower. You wouldn't be a grower if you didn't have those strong qualities. So for me and for the people that I've done this with, the hard parts are the weaknesses and the threats. They tend to rely heavily on their strengths and ignore their weaknesses and they look really strongly at their opportunities and orient around those and they discount the threats. So when you do this analysis is kind of a brain dump or a brainstorm. You just kind of list them all and then it helps you to kind of understand opens up so that you don't have as many blind spots when you're kind of thinking about your operation. That's a whole presentation. That's a whole webinar all by itself. But I just wanted to throw it in there and then crunch your numbers because more activity doesn't always mean more profit. So that's one of the things that I've learned you you can get really, really busy and farming and not make any not really walk away with any more money in your pocket. So so be careful of that. Okay, and the same theme of scaling up staying the same or going down. I when I found this chart. I thought it was really amazing because I I'd never seen this chart before. And I'd actually my farm actually kind of went through it and when I realized this, I felt like it was helpful. So I wanted to share it with you. So at the very far left. I don't know if you can see my pointer here. When you're a startup, and you're an initial phase where you know you really are in your first five, five years for sure. And maybe even more than that, you're an opportunistic and you're responding to opportunities and you're kind of doing a lot of things and trying a lot of things and kind of figuring out what works at the same time you're doing all that you're also figuring out what are the what are the strong drivers of your of your finances like where where the profit centers and what's really working so you get you get to a place where you figure that out and it starts to You get to level off and where you're established like you your crops are established your crop mix your brand your markets your customer base. And and then from there, you go through another phase where you either kick off and you grow more you either sustain that or you actually decline. I mean, those are the kind of the three options there, right. So I just found this helpful in organizing and sometimes it's nice to know where you're at in the cosmos. And so if you see yourself somewhere in the You get a chart, it can be interesting information and it's this is uniformly, you know, it happens to all all entities and all businesses and so I thought it was very useful for farms as well. Okay, moving on. Where's the profit. So I'm doing all this stuff before we get to the equipment, because I feel like thinking about your equipment as part of this thing of overall like how to make the firm successful. And of course, you define success in your own way and that's why it's important to know your intentions and your values and your goals for your farm. But certainly the profit is the cash flow that's making the systems work and underpinning it. So when I thought about where's the profit I started with a list of what how where's the real areas to focus on. And one of the first because this is an equipment presentation we're talking about increasing efficiencies to reduce expenses and labor. And of course, this is like this is class book, you know, textbook one on one any ag land grant university you go to and conventional ag is all about reducing expenses. Because there's, there's not a lot of control in any other aspects. Now we, and especially production and produce and high, you know, higher value, there's a little bit more wiggle room and we get a little bit more creative than the standard commodity crop guys do. But your increasing efficiencies are really have to do with your equipment selection, your infrastructure, meaning like, just where is stuff like where's your packing shed, where's your, you know, where's your cold storage, where do you live, I mean, all these how all these things relate. And then the systems that you create to organize yourself, organize your tools, organize your time, organize your management, all of these things are ways that you can reduce your your time and your labor. And so a little softer way of talking about, you know, this harsh reality of like hacking down your expenses and hacking down your labor. It's really not about that. In my mind, in my mind, it's about making everything work so that you can enjoy your farm work more and you can enjoy your life better. So this is why this is at the very top. The next thing. And then, and it's related to this is better yields of marketable produce like you can't just you just can't increase your yields, it has to be marketable. So you're you're looking to get not only better yields, but if something you can take into the market. And so the very basis of that, in my personal opinion is soil health improvement, plus your cultural methods, all the ways that you produce it, plus the systems that you set up to support and reinforce that and make that possible. So better genetics. You know, there's a lot of great varieties that you can grow. Some of them are are hybrids and some of them are heirlooms and then you really have to find what genetics are best for you. But you will be really you'll be really shocked and surprised if you don't already know that there's a great variation in yields and in how much you can get for different crops. I did just this last season, I did some trials of 300 foot row of a hybrid butternut and then I did the same 300 row of a delicata, which is kind of more of an heirloom, non improved variety. Sorry about that. Oh my gosh, I got 33 cases of butternut and I got nine cases of delicata. So that told me right then and there, like if I'm going to grow like an acre of squash and I'm planning on selling it and trying to make money out of it, I should not grow delicata. Now delicata can be a great, you know, great for the market garden. It can be great for yourself. It can be great for like a CSA that could afford it. But literally it's a third of you're getting a third of it. So you'll find that a lot of the heirloom varieties of all the different things that look so super great in the catalogs. And I know this from my seeds of change experience. They look great, but on the field they do not produce. And so you have to be careful. Like if you're going to be doing something at a larger scale, it has, it kind of has to work. Like it, it doesn't really matter on a smaller scale as much. But when you start to ramp it up to like a half acre, an acre, or like a 10 acre scale. I mean, then you're talking about a 30% increase in yield is a huge difference. And so you really want to seek out the varieties that perform well, but that also meet all of your other needs. So that's, I'm just saying that's a really important thing to look into. Of course, better markets. And that kind of leads to better prices, but it's not just prices because sometimes it's about volumes and sometimes it's about the duration of the market. So, you know, you might like, for example, with the green beans, I was planting green beans every week. I was doing two acres every week. And so I had this duration of harvest that I would not have been able to do. I couldn't do 22 acres in one week. So I had to do two acres each week. So extending out your harvest is another way. And that was a really important market for me to have. So after that, we're looking at crop selections, you know, how do you evaluate which crops are profitable? You know, on a small scale, it's kind of very challenging. And I've got there dropping the dogs, which means, you know, when we finally got to the point where our farm was, we were doing better record keeping. We got the whole farm on QuickBooks and that was a big deal and it was painful and sometimes expensive. But we finally did. And then we could really start to see what our sales were. And we calculated that and we added our farmers markets and we could start comparing apples to apples, so to speak. We could compare all of our different crops and we found out which ones were the more profitable and which ones were the least profitable. And then you have the ones you can't really get away from. I mean, if you're doing a farmers market or a CSA, like you cannot just show up with some items. You know, you have to. But how much of that, those lower performing varieties, you certainly can can change that. So for us, for whatever reason, cucumbers were like, wow, we looked at cucumbers and we're like, we're not going to grow cucumbers. But we did. But we just didn't grow very many. We just grew enough to have a farm stand and a few for the CSA. And that was basically it. And we really bumped up the kale because for us that was the highest profitable crop that we grew. Another way, like if you don't have accurate records for yourself, there is some benchmarking data that universities are starting to do. The University of Wisconsin has some of that. But also there is a benchmarks that Kate Rizwold has come up with. And he's done a really, really good job of keeping track of his own operation. And you he has about 16 or 18 different crops and he shows you all the numbers and you can look them up and you can just I mean, it's actually pretty uniformly correct, regardless of the growing area. There's going to be regional variations, but relatively that's a similar ranking. Right. And then bottom line, all this stuff is just encouraging to keep better records to understand where their money is going. And that's just going to help you overall. OK, it's time. And for anybody, anybody at all, you have to be writing to ask a question. Or make a comment or sneeze or something. Anybody. And sometimes it's good to ask a question because other people are thinking about it and you're the guinea pig and it helps the other people to learn something from your question. So it's not always. You know, it's a good thing. I'll ask a question. OK, you mentioned record keeping and one of your last bullet points. What is your approach to record keeping? Do you do it like on a daily basis on a weekly basis or collect a whole bunch of notes and and from in at the end of the season and analyzing that, you know, what is your approach on that? OK, that's recommendations for. Yeah. Yeah, that's a great question. Thank you. So. So I guess in my mind, there's kind of different types of record keeping. Right. So there's financial record keeping, which is just like at the bare minimum, you have to deposit money in the bank and then, you know, you have you have a bank statement. I mean, that's like the bare minimum and looking at. But in order to make sense of that, it's good to know where the money came from. So there's financial record keeping and you you may or may not have a record keeping system for tracking your sales, for example, or even tracking your deposits or are tracking your farmers markets receipts, for example. So financial record keeping is one whole area and that's, you know, you can you can use paper systems, you can keep spreadsheets, you can go all the way to QuickBooks and have every single deposit, you know, broken out into an invoice if you want. And that's that's a great way to do it if you can. Another part of your question, though, I think, is how do you do record keeping for farm activities? So production, seeding, harvesting, all those kind of things. And one of the easiest ways that I've learned about is having a lot of clipboards and keeping track of things as best as you can, because it's very challenging and very difficult. One of the things that I want to to bring up is a way to kind of tackle that to understand some of the key activities of what you're doing on your farm, because you you're no one's going to like this isn't a university lab setting where you're going to sit down and you're going to track every minute or every hour. Or every hour of your day, right? Like no one, no one that I know can do that except at a university demonstration farm or something. So but what you do want to do is you want to think about what is important to know. And so, for example, when I was doing the kale, I was kind of always trying to track. You know, how many cases could my crew harvest in a day? And then I would then I would do the math and figure out, oh, OK, I basically like my top guy can do six cases per hour. So I got to that metric, right? Six cases per hour was a good harvesting rate. Or if I sent the guys out to harvest for one hour, how much value in produce did they come back with? So I started to get you see what I mean? I'm trying to get metrics or standard units so that I'm not having to keep track of the entire kale harvest over three months to know that I don't have to. So there's a quick and dirty way, which is just estimating like, OK, how much time is this activity taking and how much am I getting out back out of it? And that's a relative way of looking at, you know, the labor efficiency or the return for your time. And that's how you can also kind of look at crops, because some crops like flowers you can pick for an hour and you can walk back with a couple hundred dollars worth of sellable produce. Right. And if you go pick watermelons for an hour, you might get a bin and it might be 50 bucks. So it all just starts to inform you. So does that answer your question, Heather? There's like the different there's different types of record keeping and depends on what you're looking for. Yeah, that was great. Thanks. OK, cool. Any other questions or comments or. I am also curious, I'm maybe you've switched up your market, but you said that you got approached or you approach the food bank there and that they had, you know, interest in processing green beans and your transition to organic or maybe organic at this point. But was that decision to become organic philosophical one or are they offering to pay more money for organic? Yeah. So for me, because I because I found a niche in the organic markets and that's the that's the markets that that could support a smaller scale operation in California. It was both a personal and just kind of a financial decision that that's where the markets were and that's where I wanted to go. So when I moved back to Indiana, you can't make it on 200 acres as a conventional grain farmer. You can't even make it probably even on, I don't know, a thousand because you're losing money every acre. But so for me, I wanted to get into specialty crop. I wanted to get into a higher value market. And I had this background and experience of doing organic production. And so those are the markets that I was looking for. I found a price that worked for me. They were they were happy that it was a transitional. They were more interested in finding local green beans than they were the organic per se. But I was already planning on converting the farm to organics. If that's if that was part of your question and just looking for, you know, the the buyer that would support that. And I and I found that with that contract. Great. OK, that was a nice little that that was good. Good job, you guys. After this, we'll get we'll get some other growers hopefully to ask some questions. It'd be great. OK, so I don't have to tell you, but I will that farm later labor is your highest expense. And so this was a graph that John Hendrickson up at Wisconsin, a guy that I know, and he's done tons of crunching the numbers and about records and production and all this stuff. And they they came up with this looking at, I don't know, maybe a dozen farms and we don't have to get geeky about the numbers. But I just want to point out to you that the labor hours per acre for three different farm sizes are instructive and they they they have to do with the level of intensity of production. But they also have to do with the level of equipment that you can kind of have on these different scales. And so under three acres, you see, you know, it's the highest. It's almost two thousand hours per acre. And then the three to six scale is about a thousand and then six to twelve a seven hundred and then more than twelve was five hundred. Well, I bet you that most of that is because under three acres is mostly hand or or smaller scale and less mechanical weeding and less mechanical tillage, I would guess. And then as you get larger and larger, you have bigger equipment, not only bigger equipment, but just equipment that's kind of dialed in to do everything. So you're doing less by hand. You're basically planting with the tractors, you're cultivating with the tractors and your labor is primarily a harvest kind of a big, you know, harvest costs there. But everything else is just done by a few people. I was able, for example, to do my green bean operation because I'm no longer doing the green bean operation, which I'll tell you that story later with myself. And then I did everything. And then on harvest days, my dad and my uncle, my uncle ran the forklift because we had the forklift the pallet boxes off the equipment under the truck. And my dad rode on the picker and picked out frogs and dirt and rocks that got spat out the back of the machine into the green bean picker. And that's that's what he did. So, you know, it was pretty easy. But I paid 30 grand for that picker. I mean, I never paid that much for a single piece of equipment. And my dad was like, he's an old he's an old schooled farmer and we're Scottish in origin and man Scottish people are tight. So he's like, wow, that's a lot of money. But when I thought about it, my my foreman in California, I paid him 30 grand a year and he was worth it. I mean, he was the guy could pick 40 cases of kale in one day. I've never seen anybody like that. And I'd pay him 30 grand a year. There's no way that he could have picked 100,000 pounds of green beans in one year, let alone in eight weeks. So your equipment, you know, if you get the right equipment selections. Yeah, the equipment's expensive, but labor and your own labor is way more expensive than you realize. And I think a lot of growers don't count on how much they're spending of their own. They don't pay themselves enough because they're not paying themselves at all, but they're not considering how much it's costing them to kind of roll up their sleeves and do the grunt work. When a piece of equipment could could do it for you a lot easier and then freeze you up to do other things on your operation or in your life that you need to do. So I just thought that this I just thought that I'd kind of emphasize this, not that this that these numbers are, you know, that important to know or to see like, well, how many hours per acre? Am I doing? I don't know. But you know how much you're working and the idea is to try to find a more efficient production system for the scale that you're out or maybe even consider a larger scale and how how that work. So I wanted to share that with you all this morning. Okay, we're going to do some we're going to do some deeper dives before we get into looking at pictures of equipment. These are some intellectual tools, because these are kind of the things that I've learned over the years. And again, you know, there's so much on the Internet, and there's so much you can look up and watch YouTube videos. I mean, there's just tons of things. So I want to talk more about the intellectual tools. And this has to do with when you're looking at yourself and you're looking at your operation, you're looking at your farm and you're trying to figure out what to do and where to go. Understanding your intention is really critical. And I learned this and I live by it and I try to teach it as much as I can, because for me it was a big thing. You are the captain of your own ship. So steer. And that means to set yourself up for success and to understand that your actions are the result of your intentions. There's actually scientific basis for this, but also this is this is kind of a universal understanding of human behavior. When you intend something, you tend to do it. And when you don't intend something, you don't do it. And if you're unclear of your intentions, you are an indecision or you're kind of waffling or you're not sure. So if you're not clear, it's usually because your intention is not clear. So the the the point there is and it's OK to be in that place, but you just need to know that, oh, I need to clarify my intentions. And then once you get clear, then your actions flow a lot easier. So and when you grow your operation, you might already feel like you've got a lot on your plate and you do. And then you when you're considering like expanding that you have to really look at how you're you're conducting yourself and conducting your business and operating your farm, because maybe for me it was moving from chaos and overwhelm to clarity. And that was a journey for me. But I realized that I had to make that choice because reacting to the farm was not me steering the farm, if you can understand. So when you take control and you plan and you and you make the decision, you get really clear on what it is that you're doing and what you're wanting, then it's a lot, lot easier to do it. Whereas if everything is coming from you left and right and you feel overwhelmed and everything is chaotic and you're just reacting to that, putting the fires out. That's kind of how it's going to continue to happen until you decide to stop that. So for me, that was really important. And that's why I think understanding your intention and clarifying your intention is really important, because I think some of the things that happened for me in my farming journey is like you just I just kind of knew like I needed to do this thing. And I was really clear, I didn't have any second doubts about it, and I just decided to do it. And when I when I kind of approach things that way, those are the those are the junctions that worked out the best for me. And when I came to points where I was unclear and unsure and you know that I made I made less well informed decisions, I found. So I just always try to encourage people to think about understanding your intention and clarifying your intention so that you really get clear with yourself and that's easier to move. Okay, the next two are little are little tools from other industries so supply chain management. Wow. You know, over over my lifetime and my career in agriculture. I've been amazed at how advanced other industries and other businesses are within their intellectual tools. So like if you if any of you have had jobs and I don't it doesn't even really matter if it's a larger organization, whether it's a university or maybe it's a corporation or what have you, you actually get training like farmers don't get training except for how to do farming stuff. But we don't technically we don't really get like training on how to figure stuff out or how to manage things or how to manage businesses, but other people do so I'm I'm kind of hijacking a couple concepts here that I think are really interesting. And I think they'd be helpful. They're helpful to me and I'm thinking they might be helpful to other farmers. So this tool is just the five wise or it's sometimes called root cause analysis. It's kind of geeky, but I like the five wise because usually when we when we have a problem in our life, we jump to conclusions like like who did it like why did you do that. Even if it's yourself. So the five wise gives you an opportunity to uncover what is the underlying organizational or systemic or design reason that this problem even came to exist in the first place. And that's way different. So I I've worked I have I'll beat up on my best friend again. So he my best friend his he tells me my superpower is jumping to conclusions and and I just crack up every time he tells me that because he knows that about himself. But literally, like if I if I'm farming with him and something breaks, the first thing he does is he blames you like how come you broke the disk? Like I didn't break it. I was just driving the tractor and it broke. So, you know, if you stay at that level and I'm just making an extreme example for my poor friend, you never get to the root cause of why the disk broke. Right. But this asking five wise kind of helps you to get to the very root baseline of why a problem happened. And it's an exercise. So in this particular case, it is the problem is you ran through a red light. So why the first why is while I was late for work and like, well, why are you late for work? Because you woke up late. Well, why did you wake up late? Because the alarm clock broke. Well, why did the alarm clock break? Because you didn't check it for work. Why didn't you check it? Because you forgot to do it. So this is kind of a silly example. But what what you can find in your farming operation is when you have a problem instead of just putting the first bandaid on and forgetting about it, it helps you to walk through. Well, what in my system is not working that that even enabled this? And this is what this is what the point of this is, especially for larger organizations that have a lot of people and they can't keep track of everybody. So they have to they have to build systems that work for everyone in a kind of every situation. So you can think about your farm in this way as well. So I find this helpful. So ask the five why's and you can get to the bottom of it, hopefully. So this is the last one. I'll stop boring you with my intellectual tools. This is called the weakest link analysis. And it's actually pretty simple. And we all kind of do some to some degree. But it's actually a concept and it's it's in the lean the lean management toolbox, so to speak, because you can't fix everything. And as a as a you know, as a small business person, as a independent farmer, you have limits and you can't fix everything on your farm. So and it can get overwhelming. So what do you do? Well, you look for the weakest link, you look for the thing that is the most obvious or maybe it's the thing that's the most painful for you and your operation. And then you fix that first. It's really that simple, like some people have a problem with getting distracted by too many things. And I can be that way sometimes. But I've learned to just focus on one thing at a time and try to nail that. So the so here's how that works. You find the weakest link, you fix it. Now you've just removed that weakest link from your analysis. So now you look again and you find out, OK, what's the next weakest link? And then you fix that. So this is a continuous improvement cycle. You don't just fix the first one and then not fix anything. You just keep fixing stuff. So this is just a little tool to help you figure out how to how to tackle things. Just tackle one thing and then keep doing it. All right. Finally, if we still have we have any people on the call. OK, so now we're going to get to equipment considerations and I know you're supposed to show pictures and try to help people stay engaged. And I hope that you are still engaged and I'm keeping you engaged. We're going to talk about briefly because I'm not going to tell you what equipment to get or what's right for you because I have no idea. But we're just going to kind of talk about some equipment considerations as you think about growing and expanding or maybe increasing your acreage or what have you. And these are from my perspective, of course, so they're not trying to be all encompassing and I'm not trying to get super nerdy and telling you, like, get get the model five oh six one of this thing. I'm just going to show you some pictures and we're just going to talk about it and I hope that it encourages some discussion and some questions. And here's a big list of all the areas. Because there are so many areas that we that we buy equipment for or that we need equipment and tools and sometimes they overlap a lot. So for me, when I was organizing this talk, I started saying, what are the different areas? What are the buckets that we that we really need on the farm? And this is the bucket list that came up. Okay, so again, from our friend John Herrickson from Wisconsin, he found that what is the average equipment cost or investment per acre for farms? So they're actually pretty similar. So on vegetable farms, which are, you know, bigger farms around seven grand, eight grand per acre. So if you're looking at a 10 acre farm, you're looking at 70 to 80 grand. That's about that's about what we were. Market gardens are a little bit higher, primarily because they have less less land to spread the equipment cost over. They may even have the same basic equipment, but they just don't have as many acres. So that's why it's kind of relatively the same. So this is what people up in Wisconsin anyway spend on on farm equipment per acre roughly. And this is like 12 different farms. So these are just averages. You can certainly do lots more and you can certainly do lots less depending on what kind of operation you have. I think these are fairly diversified farms growing probably lots of different crops rather than a simple one or two crops. So in the bucket of doing fertilization, manure spreading, compost and amendments, this is all kind of one category. And how do you do it? You know, you can do it by hand. I've certainly done that on a smaller scale by hand or with a belly grinder. You get to a little bit larger scale and you're really going to need a three point hopper because you can use this guy for not only broadcast seeding cover crops, you can use it for amendments, you can use it for pelleted fertilizer. I mean, it just comes in really darn handy. Manure spreaders are excellent for spreading compost. You can also add your amendments to the compost and get them spreaded. You basically want to do as much as possible as fast as possible in the spring or in the fall. You could also custom hire this thing. I in California, I had the benefit of having a compost spreading operator really close to me. And he would come in and spread all the compost that I could make because I had a dairy, a goat dairy right next to me. So we made 800 yards a year just in static piles and he would spread it every fall. And he would charge, I don't know, it was like $25 a load to spread. I mean, it was just ridiculously cheap. So that worked out. And now in Indiana, I actually, there is another compost spreader and it is so cheap. I can't afford to buy a manure spreader. I mean, I've done manure spreaders, you know, but you just figure out how to make this part work. Because this is a big part, especially if you're doing specialty production, you're probably trying to fine tune your amendments at least. Hopefully you're putting on some compost or something to enliven the soil and you need to have this function. So figuring that out is helpful. Cover crops. So I've always done a lot of cover cropping in California. Also here, there's several ways to get this going. You know, at a small scale, you can easily do by hand and belly grinder several acres of cover crops, but you got to have some way to incorporate it. I've used primarily, you know, a rough rototilling and then come back over that with either another drag system or a coltomulcher or a coltipacker or something to give you a good seed soil contact. I've also had seed drills. You can see the old international seed drill. Those are certainly floating around the atmosphere for $1,000 or less, but you have to have a seed bed. Part of the beauty of a cover crop establishment is you can kind of rough it in. And especially with vegetable production, you're probably cycling beds over or cycling fields over. And so you might do a quick disk down or a till down or something kind of some way to get your harvested crop after you harvest it, get it tilled down and then immediately get a cover crop on it. You don't have time to maybe get a perfect seed bed. So I found the broadcasting. I do a lot of broadcasting of cover crops just because I find that it'd be easier. It's easier to throw on some more seed and try to find a way to pack it down a little bit and just go for it rather than try to like disk it and till it and get a perfect seed bed and use a seed drill. Of course it looks nicer. But that's a lot of work when you're moving and grooving. Any questions? Just one comment. One of our extension specialists, she did just a little demonstration trial with some cover crops and she compared the broadcast spreader versus a drilled cover crop seed. And she said, you know, in early establishment the drill was better but by the end of the season, you know, or even like, you know, part way into growth, you couldn't tell the difference between the stands. So, you know, the drill costs a lot more and if you don't have an easy access to one, you know, the broadcast spreader does just as good of a job. Yeah, the beauty, that makes sense to me. I mean, the beauty of cover crops is that you're not, you're not trying to be perfect anyway because you're just throwing a bunch of seed out whether you put it in a seed drill or not. You're just trying to get the vegetative growth and you're not really, you want to get a good stand. Your criteria are yes, you want to get a good stand because if you waste your time and don't get a good stand, you've just, you know, you've just set yourself back. But I've found it easier just to buy a few, a few more bags of seed and throw down a heavier rate and get it done because you usually have little short windows and short amount of time and you're actually trying to do something else while you're doing the cover crop. So the main thing is to get it in. And I found that the quick incorporation of whatever is on the surface and getting the cover crop seed established. And for me, the colta mulcher has been the ticket because colta mulcher will press a seed into almost any surface. And give you a good germination and a good stand. So that's, that's kind of how I do it now. The you can, I don't know if you're in your area, if the NRCS or soil conservation service offices have no till drills for rent, but we do and that is a possibility because you sometimes a no tail drill can get into almost anything as well. And that could be superior to a rough cover crop broadcast in many cases. And I've done that. So, but I don't know anybody that can afford their own no till drill at a small scale because they are expensive and they kind of need to work. But you can rent one for almost nothing from the NRCS office. Okay, let's move on from the cover crop. So, primary and secondary tillage. You know, at a small scale, probably most people are doing some sort of combination of rototilling, whether it's a walk behind or a tractor. And you, and you know, at a larger scale, I guess you could get by with just a rototiller. But the reason I have primary and secondary tillage here is that I kind of think of your primary tillage is different than your secondary and your finished tillage. So your primary is really kind of opening up a soil. It's about opening it up. And it's also about mixing material. We've got the picture of the John Deere there doing a little chisel plow. And that's just a really small little guy. But that's nice for us for vegetable operation because a lot of times you just need to do, you know, a small area. And you don't have a big tractor to do a 15 foot chisel. And you can just open that up. Rototillers and discs also are more of a secondary and they do way better if the soil is already opened up and stuff is mixed around. The rototillers, you could force your rototiller to go through where that tractor is going with the chisel plow. I mean, I've, I've seen people do it. But a rototiller absolutely creates a shear pan or a plow pan because the blades, even if they're coming backwards, but a blade going forward not only cuts but also presses. And so if you go into a hard, hard kind of feel condition or even if you have a cover crop that's not too loose, you'll just smear a plow pan with your, with your rototillers. It looks great on the surface. It's great for planting, but you've really kind of not done good by your soil texture below it. I have spader. You know, spader, I've, I've never had a spader. I've had one used. I hired a guy to spade a field. And then I never, ever had a guy spade a field again because it took him like a week and it cost me so much money. I, I couldn't believe it, but I was paying him by the hour and didn't realize it. And spaders are very slow. They are incredible. They're kind of like a bunch of little doors back there digging your garden, but they are very slow. And if that's important to you and it fits at your scale and you feel like spending the thousands of dollars to buy a spader, by all means do it. And I don't have anything against them. I just personally have not, I've just needed to move faster than a spader can go. And, and I know that they're hard to come by, that they're almost impossible to find used. I've never found a used one, even in California. And these other techniques are, you know, are good too. So that's kind of what I'm talking about with primary and secondary tillage. You know, you just want to find, you want to find the horsepower that works for you so that you can do, I guess this is a good pausing point where we can talk about how your, whatever your tractor is, whether it's a walk behind or, or a traditional tractor. Is adequately sized so you can do all of your functions with the one tractor. So you can do your primary and secondary tillage. You can do your planting with it because it's got the right row width. You can do your mechanical cultivation because your beds are set up for that tractor. And then your irrigation can then get set up on that. So everything is kind of like a system. All these pieces kind of click and fit together. And that's what's really important because you, you know, you don't want to have three or four different interacting systems and widths and, and situations where nothing fits. Like you have to jump on this tractor to do this thing. And then you have to change over to do that thing. And then you have to do another thing to harvest. And that becomes a drag. And that means you have to have a lot of, a lot of equipment laying around that you may not use that much. So, seeding transplanting, you know, Ryan was telling me that a lot of folks down there use the water wheels and also a lot of plastic mulch and those definitely work. I just kind of wanted to throw out some other pictures. And talk about precision seeders, mechanical transplantings and tool ball planters because these are all kind of at the next, next stages of, of getting a little bit bigger. The precision seeders, there's the Jang is the yellow one down there at the left. Any precision seeders, the Jang is kind of like, not quite the entry level, but it's one of the entry levels. And it really will lay seed down the way you need them so you don't have to come back and thin. And when you're getting the longer beds and longer rows and bigger areas, it's really important to plant correctly because you can really, if you mess up, it can, it can really cost you. This two row transplanters there at the top is kind of what I'm talking about. Something that's more uniform, that's really straight, makes it easy to follow up with your cultivation and your harvesting. This makes everything way, way easier. And then here's a guy on his old farm all with a toolbar on it. And though I'm not even sure what those planners are, but you can kind of see that he's getting three nice, fairly straight rows behind there. So he can do his follow up cultivation and everything's fairly uniform. So that's kind of what we're talking about is that you want to find a system that allows you to plant efficiently, to plant straight, to then set yourself up for success for weeding and cultivating and moving through your fields. And there's a lot, you know, there's a lot of options. There's a lot of different kind of transplanters. They're definitely different seeders. They're certainly really high end stuff, but you don't have to have really super sophisticated stuff. I mean, you know, these little push planners and these toolbar planners are not that expensive and they can really, really be helpful to get you set up right. Irrigation systems, you know, there's so many different ways to do irrigation systems. I think, you know, I'm just kind of throwing some generic pictures here of drip tape and some, you know, kind of micro sprinkler heads. I think the main thing I want to emphasize for myself and other growers, because I see this all the time, is we kind of piece together irrigation systems with what we've got. And sometimes they're pretty ingenious and sometimes they're pretty labor intensive because, you know, you're when you start to get a larger and larger system that's more and more chaotic, every aspect of it that you can increase in its efficiency has a big impact. So even though like you may have become accustomed to like walking all the way across the field and opening a valve and then like walking all the way over here, because maybe you like to walk and maybe you're young and, you know, maybe that's cool. But when you start to develop your irrigation system, you kind of want to set it up to think about how can I make this as easy as possible and not only just the use of it, but the management of it. So that means setting up your sub headers and your headers and your valve systems and anything like that to where when you turn something on, you can just get it done. And so that's kind of what I want to encourage. I see a lot of vegetable growers that have pieced things together to the point to where it almost takes a full time person to just make them work and to keep up with them and to repair them. And there's always leaks, but you know, I think you understand what I mean. And I don't have anything specific to tell you about that other than it really makes sense to organize your headers and your sub headers and your valves in such a way that you can manage blocks as consistently as possible. And so what's hard about a mixed operation is you've got maybe 30 different crops and you know, you want to think about, well, maybe I should plant the things that have relatively the same water demands together so I can water all those guys together. So, you know, we would put, we would put everything on, on, in like one acre blocks, for example. So all the tomatoes were on one acre together, they're on six foot spacing. And then on that same header, we could have our six foot spacing for our squash and our cucumbers and our gourds and our pumpkins and what have you. And so we knew, so you knew when you open that valve to that header that went to that block, you knew what you were irrigating. And you could manage it accordingly. Because otherwise you just have one big header and you're trying to irrigate everything and then you're, you're keeping track because it's intuitively it makes sense to you because you're the grower and you're trying to irrigate everything. You know what needs what hopefully, but it means that you're individualizing your management and you want to move from individualizing the management of each crop into more of a broad approach where you're managing blocks and fields rather than individual plants, if that makes sense. And I'm going to irrigate right now. Any questions on irrigation? Are people doing mostly tea tape down there you guys? I see yes. No sprinklers? Micro sprinklers but not, you know. Yeah. Probably. Yeah. Probably for whatever crops really benefit from overhead because there's certainly crops that really thrive in that. And yeah, it's pretty hard to beat that. All right. Very good. No, no furrow flood irrigation down there. More in eastern Arkansas for row crops but not northwest Arkansas. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. We're moving on. How are we doing? On time, by the way. We're about an hour in it looks like. Okay. So we're actually, I think we're about an hour and a half in so. Oh, okay. So does that mean how much more time do we have? What did we say, Ryan? Did we say that it ended at 1.30? Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. But, um, so, you know, I expect there might be some people that will jump off here shortly. But, um, you know, we can stay on, um, you know, until you're, until you're finished. Okay. Well, I'll try to, it sounds like that I'm pretty close to being at time. So maybe I should put it in high gear. Okay. So remember how we were talking about labor is your highest expense. And weeding and cultivation is probably the area that we could always use the most improvement in. So scaling up leads to a need for more uniform beds and, and, and row spacing. And so that's why. So you can get into a mechanical cultivation and weeding system. So transplanting direct seeding is straight. And, um, I'll talk about these two. These are two of my little favorite ones. There's many options. There's many ways to do it. But I think fundamentally what I've learned is that you have to move the soil earlier and more than you think. Um, be, and the time system, the one on the right is called the Williams toolbar. And it's, it's the main toolbar system. Whoops. It's the main toolbar system that I had. I'm going to back up there. Sorry. I touched it with my mouse. Um, and there's these tines that are, that have like, um, they're sprung steel. So they kind of, they kind of really force themselves down into the soil. They don't work in every soil. Okay. I know that the, they don't work super great in Indiana. Um, but if you have the right soil texture, um, the tines are really good for picking up pin weeds and then the toolbars on both the front and the back give you all kinds of options for sweeps, knives, blades, hilling discs, you know, whatever you want to throw on there. Cause it's a diamond toolbar. And the, this tool, if there's one, if there's one tool to get, um, this is what I got. And this is what I used for a lot of my vegetable crops. Um, and I, I would recommend it to anyone. But you can certainly just do your own kind of toolbar fab up, um, whatever you want. The main thing is you can see behind this one. There is right behind the tractor wheels or guide wheels. So that's a depth. And then right behind the guide depth wheel is a sweep. So you really need to sweep your tractor tires because that's where your, a lot of your weeds from compaction are going to be going. And also that sets your depth for all the other, uh, attachments. So that you can get what you need to do. You can just set things the way you want. And it does, you don't have to worry about up and down. It just sets itself. The other, um, piece of equipment, which are really kind of hard to come by. And I don't know down in your area, Ugg, because the shine of timber, construction annual wetlands, getting into wetter heavier soils you can get into a soil way faster than you can cultivate with a shovel or a blade and kind of mix it up and have some fun but the thing that i want to explain is that you know you guys maybe already know this and i apologize for explaining it to the people that already do you're not really wanting to find yourself having to hoe weeds or cultivate weeds you want to get them at the germination pin pin stage because when they get up and start growing and you have to start weeding them at that stage you've already waited way too long i mean pin weeds like after your last cultivate after your last bed prep at planting time within about three days you're going to have those those pin weeds developing and the pin weed is where the the weed seed is germinating underground and it's sending an exploratory root that's just kind of free floating in that loose soil and it's trying to figure out where down is and then it's going to stick its head up real fast and you're cultivating and disrupting the soil at that at that level so that you can eliminate even the emergence of those weeds so that means going in like almost immediately after planting and of course you can do stale bed and you can flame prior to seeing some crops and that all that's great but if you're going to do mechanical weeding and mechanical cultivation you want to get in early and just move that soil even though you don't see don't wait till you see weeds and once you see weeds it's too late i guess that's kind of what i'm trying to say and you do that have to do that too but if you don't if you don't hit it early and hit it often you know you kind of have to rethink your weeding strategy so those are my kind of two little secret weapons that i like and there's lots of others including wheel hose and all that kind of stuff but people know about those um you know your biggest labor expense is probably harvest and um again i'm coming back to this cliche set yourself up for success um have everything at hand organize and standardize all of your harvest tools and crates and wagons and whatever you use and and just make it make it um try to get it done fast because i found that harvesting in larger crews is actually better i mean i've had situations where i had to have three things harvested and i'll send like one guy to each and harvest three things separately because like it makes sense right you're going to get it all done at once but it's actually not there's a synergy when people work together and it it makes the harvest go faster it's good for morale it's better for their bodies um and you know just try to set that up i have this picture of these guys harvesting chart in here because i i want to ask the question what's wrong with this picture so kind of like clue clue hint hint wink wink what's you see at the left and what do you see different on the right where are they um where are they going to put their harvested greens on the right yeah yeah so again it doesn't it the truck's not that far away like well i'm just going to carry it over there well the thing is like okay multiply that times a million and what is that so you know the course of your farming life you're going to be doing these activities over and over and over and over again so the easier you make it um the better the better off you'll be it'll be easier for you first of all you'll save time you'll spend less money you'll have less wear and tear on your bodies and on your equipment so just set yourself up for success and make it easy and and your job as the farmer and kind of like the coach you got to give your team everything that they need and you don't even want them to ask you want to give it to them and you want to say i want you to do it exactly like this this is how i want you to do it and if you set it up right they'll be happy to do it that way and if they're not you've done something really wrong because most farm workers and most farmers want to do the work in such a way that they that's more enjoyable and it's easier almost everybody's trying to find an easier way to do work so that's my suggestion for the harvesting washing sorting packing stations my gosh this is a whole nother webinar this so many things can factor into this um again cliche set yourself up think about your flow uh main thing that i see wrong is people don't understand that water flows downhill and uh water does not drain if there's no place for it to drain so make it clean make it easy to drain it doesn't have to be these are fancy pictures you can get overwhelmed with how many fancy packing sheds there are in the world um but it doesn't you know i've seen them in garages i've seen them it it really doesn't have to be too complicated but um give yourself some time to design and think and explore and talk to people and go see some and you know to either build your own or improve your own and um you know make it work for you because you do this functional space you spend a lot of time in there you want it to be functional you don't want to be struggling um with things and you notice that most things are up off the ground um and that's all food safety stuff and that's a whole nother webinar so i don't really talk too much about that but you when we did our kale we actually had a lean to almost out in the field and all we had was two dunk sinks and tables to put clean things on and that's all we had and we we ran hundreds of thousands of bunches of kale through that so it doesn't have to be fancy it just has to work right and it has to be clean so um you can figure that out cold storage i didn't even i was lazy i didn't even try to do much on cold storage because for a for a smaller operation even up to you know for us even we just did cold storage with cold bots cold bots are as you know um some guys created this work around electronic thing that's tricks basically it just tricks an air conditioner into thinking it's not cold enough but it also keeps it from freezing um so it's constantly tricking and it's telling it's not cold enough and then as the condensers start to freeze up it says now it's cold enough and that's all it tells it all day long so you program it for the temperature you want and and if you have it hooked up right and it's pretty easy it actually works as long as you're not trying to cool too big of a space which all farmers do however it will not bring down um hot vegetables to a cool temperature very fast if you have a perishable crop that needs to be brought down quickly a cold bot will not do it because the poor air conditioner only has so many btus but if you're just doing regular stuff you can you can make a cold bot work for you so that's my recommendation on cold storage you can build you can build your own you can insulate it a room in a shed in a barn you can insulate a trailer you can buy an insulated box i mean you can just do you can stick a cold bot anywhere delivery distribution um this is a no-brainer of course i just kind of wanted to show you some some pictures you can do it different ways you know it's always good to have advertisement on your delivery vehicle if you can um because you always want to be putting your farm name out there um also i like this i picked this one because the guy has a hand truck he's being smart he's using tools he's working smart not always hard but you don't have to have a fancy van i didn't have that fancy of a van at all um the thing i like about having a separate vehicle for your delivery is you can keep it cleaner and if you if you have to get gap certified which is a whole nother webinar um your delivery vehicle has to have a cleaning log and you can't be like hauling compost and manure and your dogs and chickens in the back of your pickup truck and then throwing salad mix in there okay um if you've done that and i probably have in the past maybe um you can't do it anymore so um it's kind of cool and once you get a once you get a real van um oh my gosh it makes your farm life so much easier than just hauling stuff around in random vehicles okay so we're getting close to the end here um this is from richard wiswall and he's one of my um he's one of my heroes and he's the one that helped me understand through his book writing and his office worksheets how to um find the profit in your farm but this is one of the things that kind of struck me when i was um you know earlier on in my career so when you're building a farm you're kind of really hyper focused on building the farm and sometimes you lose track of why and and sometimes the production leads the farm rather than a farmer leading the production and i i kind of wanted to end the session with talking about this quote and he says before i had a clear goal meaning your intentions your goals what's really important to you i was washing carrots to wash carrots meaning and purpose were absent now i wash carrots knowing that i'm supporting my family enabling leisure time planning planning for my retirement building community and living the life i want to live carrot washing was put into perspective so you know when the reason why this is important and i wanted to share it with you all is that sometimes our our personal um creative aspect is to just create this beautiful productive farm right and um and that's great but there's even a larger purpose and you have to tap into those larger goals of why it is that you're working so hard so you can sustain it and um you have to be careful of burning out everyone has burnout in any career you're in so you have to really couch all of your activities on this much larger goal so that you really know why you're doing everything because you you really can just gobble yourself up with work and um i just wanted to remind myself and all of you of of this larger perspective and the last i'll um i'll kind of kick this book out there is a book that's actually called wholesale success a farmer's guide to food safety selling post-harvest handling and packing produce it's very excellent atina duffley um is the main author and she's excellent and i love her presentations and her work and i find her to be right right on and um this book is available and it talks all about more about wholesale and gets gets uh geeky and nerdy about all of that but also very practical and um you know we can maybe talk about that at a later workshop or later conversation hopefully but i wanted to kind of plug that because i learned a lot from her and a lot from this book even after doing it thank you so much for for bearing with me for looking at your screens for an hour and a half i can't believe it's been an hour and a half and um i'd love to hear from you and uh also i'm going to be in arkansas um uh on the fifth starting november 5th and i think ryan's got some farm visits so i hope to visit some of your farms and um bug ryan if you if if you want to get in touch with me i'm more than happy to follow up with you anybody that's participated in this talk i'd love to hear from you and um i'm open for you calling me asking questions or just talking about your farm thank you very much thank you nathan uh does anybody have any questions for nathan we've got a little bit of time here um they're speechless unmute your you can unmute yourself or um you can ask me anything it doesn't have to be about farming you can ask me about my hair or anything you want hey then i am curious um you know we took a field trip a few of us on the call to eastern arkansas to visit no-till us i'm beethoven i only got leaned us but you know a little bit these people told us and you can do mac and you know what our other work was that we're doing um to be with us so you know we were doing all the 위endo animals because we just started out here yeah yeah i couldn't see anything i couldn't find hologia from reviewer um 하나 of them almost uh i guess what was the first one you mentioned uh yes i wanted v ச i would think oftentimes um yeah you know I haven't so I personally don't have a lot of experience in the no-till veggie but what I've seen and what I think would be really cool to try is I've seen Rodale do a no-till roller crimping approach to both doing pumpkin winter squash and even potato production so they'll go into a vetch rye or maybe even a pure rye and then they will direct seed through that crimp and and go in and it particularly is great for pumpkins and winter squash because you are the crop is growing on top of this huge mulch which keeps the fruit off of direct ground so you have no dirt splash or dirt or dirty bottom so to speak on the pumpkins so you have no washing of your produce your produce is very clean I don't I just haven't done it because I don't have markets that would just I just I don't grow winter squash for pumpkins you know and when I grew potatoes I was doing dry farming which dry farming of potatoes dry farming in general requires the creation of a dust mulch which caps it's almost like icing on a cake the reason you put icing on a cake is of course it's tasty but you're actually preserving the moisture of the cake that's the functional purpose of icing so when you do dry farming you kind of have to till the soil like there's really no-till and dry farming aren't exactly compatible so I just haven't personally done it but I know that some farmers the only the only kind of no-till and I was actually watching youtube about this last night no and in veggie circles in the smaller scale it's called no dig and so that's where farmers are putting a lot of compost into their beds and they're kind of constantly top dressing compost and they're never really tilling the underlying soil and so they're always doing that but that is a more labor intensive bed by bed and I've seen operations up to the five even ten ten acre scales that are doing that but it's a hand labor intensive production system because they're not they're not using tractors and tillage and mechanical cultivation they actually claim to have almost no weeds and they're just running direct seeders or or the paper pot transplanters by hand to get the production but they don't they don't have any other sort of mechanization other than what a market gardener would have and I think those are fascinating systems I I know a guy in snoma county that was one of my buddies and competitors and he went that route and and ten years later he's doing fabulous he really has grown his farm and he's doing really well but he's at the same scale that he's at I think he's at maybe a definitely under a five acre scale he might be two to three acres and everything's done by hand and he has a pretty good sized labor crew but he's making it work and he he loves it and so I know that that's possible but in terms of like a larger you know like no-till soybeans and no-till corn like you see in the commodity crops I don't know anybody that's doing large-scale no-till mechanical no-till in the veggie world per se the snow you know this past spring at least may I think we're 10 inches above average as far as rainfall goes it's just difficult time for people to get out in the field you know there's a lot of flooding incidents as well because a lot of our timeline would close to a river and so you know just as we prepare to become more resilient you know what does that equipment look like and you know can any of it be you know used as we transition to maybe lower amounts of tillage you know that sort of thing people like a raised bed certainly for the for the warming effects and also just for the you know resiliency is if we get 10 inches of rain over the course of three days yeah yeah that's a good that's a really good question so you know ironically that I you know I'm a tillage guy so I only know tillage solutions so for example I'm glad you mentioned the the bed shaper because I didn't throw that in in this talk but bed shapers and hilling soil and throwing soil has has advantages and disadvantages but one of the advantages in the spring is it gets you a drier a drier bed or it gives you a slightly drier bed during crucial growing phases so one of the things that that I've seen growers do in the prior to the winter because they know they're going to have a wet spring is they'll leave their fields rough or they'll actually do like a chiseling which will leave ridges in the field and so you have a lot more surface area when you have a ridge like about a mountaintop in a valley mountaintop valley and that makes that'll dry out faster in the spring also some veggie growers out here in California they pre-shape their beds in the fall and let them over winter and then in the spring the the pre-shape beds are kind of sitting there and they dry out faster too so those are all kind of some considerations I think you know building organic matter and compost levels in the soil also makes soils breathe better so that's part of resiliency that can be helpful I think the cover cropping cover cropping done cover cropping is kind of a mixed bag with that because sometimes cover cropping can help drink out moisture because you've got more of a transpiration happening through the canopy but then also you can kind of shade the soil and have cooler soils as a result so sometimes it just depends on what you're doing but rye can really pump a lot of moisture out of out of soil but it does so at the expense of having a tremendous amount of biomass to deal with so you've got one solution but you've just created another problem what are you going to do with five tons of rice straw per acre you know so those are some things that I that I think about I didn't see a lot of plastic in any of your photos I I did you use it I mean I know California is just tremendously different yeah I I had I did I didn't use plastic um primarily because I was doing a lot of direct transplanting in California the reason California is different is it does not rain after a certain date so it's a Mediterranean climate so after like even it doesn't even rain really in the spring except maybe once or twice so you have almost no weed germination after you start tilling ground after the initial moisture leaves and so what that means is it's so so much easier to control weeds out here than it is in a temperate climate where it rains every week or every other week so it's just a radically different picture than the midwest or where you guys are at and that's why plastic culture out here is just not that big except for crops like strawberries and and things that really really you get a big bang out of it but but because of the dry soil you're only wetting you know the tea tape line and we would mostly actually throw soil and cover soil and and do like mini hilling or even aggressive hilling on crops you just we didn't have problems with weeds out here not not like you do in a rain a rain fed growing area so I understand that plastic cultures you know very necessary in many parts of the country to have economic production all right that's great um is there any other questions for Nathan well I wanted to let you would let everybody know that we do have a couple of other upcoming webinars this uh um fall we've got one coming up in a couple months it's a farm management uh webinar using the tend software and real-time data collection that's with some local folks um a couple of farmers Adam and Melissa Millsap and then Jonathan MacArthur who um is is part of our program and then similar to Nathan we had Ellen Palaszczuk scheduled to come um and because she you know because of covid she's not traveling um so we're going to do a few webinars with her and they're you know um all related to farm management as well um the first one is um is about is on crop crop costing the second one investing in growth and then the third one is uh discussing market channels wholesale and uh direct to consumer and so um I hope you uh join us come back and join us for those webinars and you can find um information on that and registration um is is open for the um the one coming up on November 18th just look at our Facebook page CAF UA is the call name for that and so you can find more information there and if there's no other questions um I think we'll say goodbye for today thank you all for joining thank you so much thank you thanks
