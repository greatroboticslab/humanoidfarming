 Zucchini has a reputation for growing oversized fruit and sprawling uncontrollably throughout the garden. But it doesn't have to be this way! Here's how to keep your zucchini plants completely restrained and encourage them to produce tons of small high quality fruit for the entire growing season. First, harvest all the fruit when it's six or seven inches long, whether you want to eat it or not. This regular harvesting prevents the plant from producing mature seeds which encourages more fruit to form. Next, once you begin harvesting from a plant, start pruning off leaves below the lowest forming fruit. This feels wrong initially, but the science shows that the pruning of summer squash stimulates more flower production and this leads to higher yields in the long run. So get out a knife and show your zucchini who's really in charge of your garden. Throughout the summer, the spine of each plant is going to increase in length. And these spines can lay along the ground, but in our smaller garden beds I like to grow our zucchini vertically so that they stay in the same place. I use two stakes for each plant and position the splaying leaves between these stakes to help keep the plants centered as they grow.
