 You want to become a plant parent but don't know where to start? Come with me let me show you what to look for at the stores. I love rescuing plants but I'm gonna need you to stay away from that section just for now. We'll get there eventually. Now pick up a tag. Now the thing is this but okay that's not a starter plant in my opinion but at least we have a name so that's helpful. And then from there just do a quick google search. So once you find a little bit more info about it then you can go about choosing the plant that's gonna fit your environment. And they're not pokemon you don't need to have them all so just pick one or two that you like. And then put your face in it no but really. You'll look goofy but check the stems under the leaves. You may find pests and we're trying to avoid those at all costs. A plant like this is perfect. It's in a nursery pot with a pretty cover pot. It's not sitting in water and this will be so much more manageable when it comes time to water it once you bring it back home. You chose a plant yay! Stick around and I'll show you what to do once you brought it home.
