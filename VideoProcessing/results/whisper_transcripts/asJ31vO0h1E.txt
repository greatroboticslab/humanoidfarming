Howto & Style
 This is how I grow my own mulch for better soil health and plant performance. I start with a multi-species cover crop sewn in either spring or fall and let it grow until it's at flowering stage. Once it's at flowering stage, it's time to terminate it. You can either do this by crimping, I'm doing this with an old piece of scrap iron with a rope attached, or you can do cutting, or you can even just tarp it off if that's what's easiest for you. In about a week after it's all dead, you can go ahead and direct seed or plant right into the cover crop residue. This saves us from having to buy in mulch and it makes our soil food web so much healthier.
