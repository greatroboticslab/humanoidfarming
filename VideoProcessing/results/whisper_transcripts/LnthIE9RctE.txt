 Ashland Industries I-950 Ejector Scraper. To enhance maneuverability, the pole on Ashland scrapers is designed to be longer than our competitors. With a longer pole, the tires on your power unit won't easily hit the scraper or impede your turning radius. To prevent rocking, Ashland scrapers have a uniquely low pull point. This low pull point reduces weight transfer from the scraper's back end, which prevents the wobble effect you may experience on other machines. To strengthen the pull point, Ashland scrapers utilize an easy access ball and socket set directly in line with the spindles. All rotation is in one small, confined area which reduces stress on the machine and minimizes binding. For long-lasting use, the gooseneck on Ashland scrapers pulls from a much larger surface area of the front section pipe. With a longer vertical weld and offset gussets, we avoid the shearing seen on lesser quality machines. For smoother operation, this gooseneck also distances the front tires from ejected material and reduces binding. To reduce torsional strain, Ashland uses a rounded front section pipe with extra thick walls. This heavily structured pipe manages torsional stress better than our competitors' square pipes whose joints are prone to failure. To protect your hydraulics, Ashland scrapers feature a bulkhead that will minimize hydraulic damage should your power unit accidentally separate. An apron dirt shield further protects the hydraulic lines from ejected material. To accommodate high-flow power units, Ashland scrapers use stronger clamps and larger hydraulic hoses. This reduces pressure buildup, which helps preserve your inner valve workings. For a reliable hold, Ashland designs its trailing arms with enhanced vertical depth. This depth provides better support of the load so you have the strength on hand to move more material. To reduce mechanical leverage, Ashland shortens the connecting distance between its lift cylinders and front section pipe. This allows our machines to effectively handle more stress. Offset gussets also eliminate the tendency of other machines to crack and fail in these areas. For fast response, Ashland scrapers feature a front-loading design. This design allows you to raise your blade quickly if bogged down, so the churning action of the material is lost. By maintaining the materials churning action within the bowl, you can move larger loads using fewer RPMs. For superior strength, Ashland scrapers are built with thicker blades, bigger plow bolts, and a double-plated floor system. Our bolt-on L-shaped blades protect the scraper's sidewalls from premature wear by keeping ejected material within the edges of the cut. All Ashland bolts are grade 8, which is the strongest bolt available and won't break or shear as easily as other machines on the market. For easy ejection, the front apron on Ashland scrapers opens extra wide so material isn't restricted on its way out. This equates to faster ejection and increased productivity. To further improve workflow, Ashland keeps its sidewalls clean with minimal low-lying framework. The machine's crossmember is arched to keep it out of the way during ejection. To help churn material, the scraper's headache rack rolls dirt to the front of the bowl as it piles upward in the back. This churning motion keeps your RPMs up and uses less horsepower to move large loads. With a convenient grease bank, Ashland scrapers are easy to service. Eye-level access to the scraper's grease bank allows you to lubricate the floor and hold down rollers from one easily accessible point. For enhanced support, Ashland scrapers feature wider push-off framework. This width adds rigidity when ejecting heavy material, which prevents the push-off from folding or bending under stream. For heavy loads and high speeds, the spindles on Ashland scrapers have a larger diameter and stronger bolts. The tires can be easily unbolted when replacement is needed to minimize downtime. Ashland's Diamond Tread ANS tires hold slopes better and are perfect for terrace and ditch use. The tread design of these tires grabs more dirt for better traction, providing you with added confidence on inclines. Ashland scrapers are built with a rigid rear push bar. Your power unit can use this bar to push the scraper out of stuck positions without the possibility of damaging the scraper's tires. the rims and вр maze aberches in its mul 난 straight express infinitely wooción flew in tavalla noracağım toест Thank you.
