 Have you ever thought about where your leftover food goes after you throw it in the trash? Or the consequences that it has for our planet? In the US alone, about 37 million tons of discarded food were brought to landfills in 2015. That's equal to the weight of 100 Empire State Buildings. In landfills, food scraps and other organic material are broken down by bacteria in the absence of oxygen, which produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas with even greater capacity to trap heat in our atmosphere than carbon dioxide. Composting is an eco-friendly alternative to discarding our food waste with three important advantages. First, composting allows food scraps to degrade in the presence of oxygen, meaning no methane is produced. Second, composting mimics natural nutrient recycling processes, breaking down biodegradable materials to produce organic fertilizer, a sustainable alternative to synthetic fertilizers that require high amounts of fossil fuel energy to produce. Third, composting diverts waste from landfills, preserving natural ecosystems that would otherwise be cleared for landfill use. And the best part? You can compost in your own backyard!
