Or was it A New Holland Is it like a Matbra? Or something? And they took them up? I don't know really Somebody will know though In the comments I bet there's some people Who would have longed for this In their younger years A TW 25 Not going to say it's in the best condition here But It's still a beast innit? How bizarre is that tanker with a little wheel at the front there? Huh Landini tractor We got a Yanmar on tracks Another big Ford So what's that then? What model is that? Let us know in the comments We'll see if there's another sticker left on the other side But it's a big one We'll not miss any Fords out Ford fans 8, 240 there No stickers at this side It's got some decent Size tyres on the back though Funny Almost looks like it says 8, 7, 30 on the front Is that a number? Setter It's a little beast innit? The Massey fans are going to be happy now That looks fairly well that really Needs a little bit of work but Ah Yeah it needs a window The seat looks alright Whether it's original I don't know It could just do with a window couldn't it? It could do with a few more windows But I think that's how it comes A little load of tractor for somebody 350 that one 290 here Jumpers Teletrucks A little digger Case digger there When we're coming back down to the Diaz The 2040s Is that SG2 cab? You know, John D and Mick will put me right Whether I'm saying the right things here Or is that SG1? I don't know There's one or two Renault 3050 Now I think at my great uncles that used to have a 3050 And somebody stole it and stole a cash machine with it Which is as random as it gets Normal JCB's as well And older And older And older Teleporters You can get the keys for everything and get them started So Hugh's gonna start this for us Over to you Hugh Oh it's not got no gas in it Oh well okay maybe next time Maybe next time Maybe next time Maybe next time No field here Maybe this one does start I think it maybe just needs a battery pack on it Fordstone Dexter Looking very tidy there Doesn't it? Someone's had the paint bush out on that Yeah Old Fordstone Super Dexter Super Dexter Some of these need a bit of love and attention Or it looks that way Maybe it runs I don't know Maybe it's just cosmetically not that appealing There is a massive supply chain I think it's a big deal I think it's a big deal I think it's a big deal I think it's a big deal I think it's a big deal I think it's a big deal I think it's a big deal Some of these need a bit of love and attention Or it looks that way Maybe it runs I don't know Maybe it's a Just cosmetically not that appealing There is a massive selection of trailers going along here The size of that for a car trailer It's huge Livestock ones Look at this This is a bit different isn't it? It's like a welfare unit We'll have a look inside Ok that could be somebody's next camper Business Even some Isuzu D-Maxers Or half of it Shall a trailer innit? Some small tankers Some muck spreaders Our dribble bars That's a big muck spreader that one as well The quad bikes locked up in a compound Even some ploughs Wow check this out for a bedformer A George muck Very local to us Here's George That is a beast innit? We want some power on that That does rotavate it And then it forms the potato bed behind I imagine you go very very slow at that job We've got massive rakes here Yeah they'd be tidy to have They're job done in no time I think we're going when we've got that one Like that sort of size But going four Geez you must be really pulling some grass together Huge set of discs And legs I bet that takes some pulling Loads and loads and loads and loads of like Tines and harrows Flat rollers Really do with like the drone just to show you the actual scale of this place So I'm here with a plate of the drone As well as I go in with a plate of the drone I'm here with a drone I'm here with a drone pulling loads and loads and loads of like tines and harrows flat rollers really do with like the drone just to show you the actual scale of this place so I'm here and beyond them trees down into the bottom it's just full of stuff really really busy really massive sale the spring sale so it's going I think in the next few days so if you did see something in the video you want you need to get on online and look at it a nice is a 7 for a flat flowers it no it's five why is it 7x a few plows in that looks heavy duty don't it this cavernal and one that's for pulling your press along our stuff a 3 furrow look at this here though 7 furrows I think it is what makes this then hmm what make is it go to bed sir I do think should we go wider with the plow get some more for us we've got the bigger tractors now I don't know though then again it's another investment in something that people aren't using as much but I quite like the plow it seems to work for what we do as beef farmers fitting in an arable on the side sort of thing it just works for us well there's lots of stuff in here anyway loads more plows as you can see rollers yeah it's just full look at this this sort of thing looks like a thing that might be required this year with these wet conditions a lightweight agri bugger with a fertilizer spreader on the back the machine people looking at that one there's another one here though a bit less tidy should we say looks like it's got tinted windows this sort of thing it's more badass look at that eh all the room you'd ever need aren't they like a Land Rover I think Land Rover engine and running gear sure I think I've driven one before very lightweight and I'll do a job for somebody so we've got mixers a telehawk down there some other teagle stuff I could almost buy some like can I just thought back door and if it's same size I have to ring Gary up at teagle see if all back doors on a teagle at same size Lucas strobo we've even got a spreader bale and this is a big one this is what we're supposed to use on our bales you see how the height of it is so much bigger like we've not got anywhere near this same height and so yeah if you put in full size hestons like we do you're supposed to buy this machine but as does it so you know rapid ears like it it does the job still yeah it does look a beast does that here we've got the big teagle the 10-10 it's also a little bit interesting I can look at this chute that's got an extending door on that one look at that the door extends out on it doesn't look like they've been backing up to pick bales up with that one although the sides are bent in so possibly we've got a bent inside there a bit of straw in there for somebody that'll add value this year yeah just looking at this one I mean this is all rusted off but that's because straw stops on it and erodes them bits so you know it's not a sign of how bad it is but look those are the stops that are bent over on mine so I could do with welding some in there to stop my flicking up in there it's got very tidy door on it although I'm not sure if it's as wide as the ones on the 10-10 on the 9500 so that's a bit of smaller machine there's more stuff in the straw blower department we've got augers we've got all sorts of attachments for telehandlers we've got silage wrappers the list here is absolutely endless sprayers hedge cutters cattle crushers down here and all stuff cattle related even got into the final field I've just seen behind me somewhere in my oh that's it a rotor grind so that grinds up straw these um yeah these are what dairy farmers are using quite a lot don't know if there's many beef farmers using them you bail into there on that is a hammer mill and it hammers the straw in short lengths so that the cows can digest them um better so this is the sort of thing where if we wanted to save the uh chopping action on our mixer then we could use one of these and it would do a much better job but it's another machine to put on another job to do and yeah tipping it in it's not like our mixer's running all the time like it would be on maybe a dairy farm maybe doing seven or eight mixes a day we're just doing like two maybe three so um yeah we can just let the mixer take the time to chop it uh so yeah loads of cattle crushers chopper a bit like what charlotte ashley's got if you check out her channel you can see one of these working beat chopper kw we've got one of these in green it's very good um yeah we we really like it for when we get beet or potatoes in very good bucket then even got a massive selection of roller mills um in fact just been chatting to these guys over here and they've come for a look round from not so far away from us they all look like the fresh from the factory don't they i'm guessing they are okay well i have absolutely no idea what this is for okay i think it's some kind of stapler or something you should put something in there that's padded so does that mean you sit on it little grass cutting machines a lot of different bits there then in here we've got lots of building material i don't know grass fake grass horse horse they mention any names but somebody has sent me looking for some particular lots right and these particular lots are tires and wheels and they are right at the back of beyond so let that person know uh they have gone above and beyond for this uh for this from all the way up there and we've now got to go into not this field the next field which is full and i mean full of wheels and tires keep trying our unit some cool et mierda as thick to them and to get out to you and then what can you do and i think aoque yarn comes to another visible one in the future and mają a bad brand реlem Liu just shows one name and she knows the Considera or software but that sometimes we've got there and we've got there kaddit 윤 said about all your imaging all right yeah there's stuff in here oh that's right guys or some great stupid things off now and you can hear them whatever you can hear them here or anything they're naked just there's some real random stuff in here straight out of a factory or something although i imagine if you know what you're looking at everybody you're looking at you know what it is kind of filtration must be a washer or something is it a cleaner loader tip your beating i mean whatever it or whatever looks like something's either been chucking wood in it or is that what it's for i don't know it's in for sale but it's a big old pickup in it raised big feeders there this young man wants to sell some it his mom and dad have been putting him up to it uncle mark oh is it uncle mark sorry sorry hello granddad hello do you want his autograph oh bless him look at all the buckets here even more tedders and grass rakes that uh little little lad getting embarrassed by his auntie bless him so when people say hello um and they watch the video and stuff it um yeah i don't know brings it home that we're getting to some young lads and lasses about the uh about the place about farming like yeah get them watching farming rather than watching i don't know whatever stuff's on on tv they might might learn a little bit so yeah well done well done a quick look around some of this newer stuff and then what we'll do is head on back home because we've got stuff to do back at the farm love a fast track um i always have wanted one but bank balance says no some glass tractors what have we got in here 120 mxm 210 on a 64 plate quite a few masses although a little bit um earlier ones 11 plates looks tidy though doesn't it a massive loader would do somebody might need to change front tires sometime soon but he'll do a job won't it 6920s i'm sure this to uh john dmc he might be here for the sale although will he want to just stop with his 10 series that bit extra power though on a no two so i'm back to the start now where we started off um i think i better hop in the lorry and get back to the farm because we've got plenty of stuff to do back uh there but hopefully you've liked it um if you have let us know which tractor was your favorite um was it the big terrogator there was it one of the older tracks we saw earlier was it one of these newer ones that were behind us let me know in the comments and um yeah anything that i didn't know if the answers took please if you know the answer let me know in the comments um head back to the farm so i've just been sat in all this traffic thinking what is going on what is going on anyway we've been stood at a stone still for ages and i saw i got an email so i just quickly looked at it and it's the herwin family have passed me going the other way and said don't worry joe we're just passing you we're going up to a university meeting in hartlepool uh for the daughter and uh it's just a car broke down we'll be i'll be past it soon so it's nice i've even got my own uh traffic
