 Unfortunately, that's not exactly the case for those in the agricultural business here in Texoma. Farmers and ranchers are seeing a decline in helpers and ranch hands due to this pandemic. Ag and Natural Resource Agent for the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Office, David Graff, says that decline could be from workers not wanting to endure the Texas elements or the long hours. Some farmers have to work. In turn, this has many farmers turning to their own family members to pitch in and help. When it's harvest time or when it's planting time, you've got to be out and you've got to go. And so it's just hard to find people that are willing to do that. Now, for more information on how the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Office could help you or your farm and ranch, just head over to Texoma's homepage.com and click inside this story.
