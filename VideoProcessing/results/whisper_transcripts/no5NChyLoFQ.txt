 Oranges, pomegranates and all sorts of other fruits and vegetables. Osgur and Ilknur grow them all at their farm near Turkey's Aegean coast. Osgur spent 15 years working as an electrical engineer before buying this land two years ago. And he's turned his engineering know-how into the backbone of this farm, devising a system where all of its power needs are met by the solar power produced here. Using solar power here has many benefits. Why? Because if we get this energy from the main power plants, we damage the environment because they use coal, nuclear power and hydroelectric power that can cause problems. My friend just visited me last month. He has his own farm in the region as well. After visiting me, he decided to build his own renewable energy source on his farm. In fact, the farm's solar panels are so productive that in the summer they produce three times as much power as the farm needs. So Osgur can maintain an environmentally friendly operation and at the same time profit from the extra power generated. Clean energy means a clean farm. And a clean farm means that Osgur and Ilknur can grow clean produce. It's all part of a wider movement in the region and one that's growing stronger. The Hayat Bayer farm lies just outside of Sefer-e-Hisar. And it's not the average resort town. In 2009, it became the first Turkish town to join the Cittaslo movement. The Italian organization promotes renewable energy and green policies. As well as improving quality of life by encouraging people to take it easy. Umur Ozon-Ollora heads a cooperative that works to encourage renewable energy here. And he says that so far they've been successful. As renewable energy, just one plant is making nine megawatts of renewable solar energy. This is about one third of the requirement of the all city requirements. So other than that, we got all kinds of windmills over here, turbines. And these are a lot more than that. We have eight times more than we will be needing. Sefer-e-Hisar still has a long way to go. But it's becoming a model for the rest of Turkey when it comes to renewable energy and green policies. Policies that are already benefiting locals here. And that they hope others will start replicating. Abu Bakr al-Shamahi, TRT World, Sefer-e-Hisar. That they hope others will want to pull off. Object up to today.mir wüns V 겁니다.
