Howto & Style
 So this year we built what's called a high tunnel. High tunnels are essentially a greenhouse that you grow in the ground. This allows us to grow fresh nutritious veggies earlier in the season. Today is Friday, March 25th and while it's 40 degrees outside, in our tunnel it's over 60 degrees. In just over a week we'll have tot soy and mustard greens available at our market.
