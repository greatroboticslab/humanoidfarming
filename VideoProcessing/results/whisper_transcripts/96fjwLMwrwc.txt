As peace begins to return to the war-torn region, the internally displaced people are returning to their villages of origin to begin a new life. The Food and Agricultural Organization is supporting the return process by helping the returnees through a number of innovative programs geared towards strengthening agricultural livelihoods. One of these innovations is the European Commission Voucher for Work Scheme through the Agricultural Livelihoods Recovery Project, or Alreb in northern Uganda. I think it was completely normal for the last five to ten years to give the inputs for free because the people were in the IDP camps. But now that they are returning back to their home, their villages, it's really time for them now to go back to their normal life and to know that to get something, you have to work for it. We already had discussion with some district officials and they are also in agreement with that. The Voucher for Work approach has been promoted by European Commission and FAO because they generate triple benefits. They improve community productive infrastructure, capitalize farmers to acquire agricultural inputs, and create incentives for private sector input suppliers to start operating. FAO is working in partnership with Appropriate Technology Uganda and Uganda National Agro Input Dealers Association to improve productivity and access to agricultural inputs. A network of stockists has been established to supply the newly settled returnees. Appropriate Technology Uganda is responsible for mobilizing, sensitizing, and training beneficiaries. These farmers are organized into groups. We get them organized into groups and then we help in the development of these groups. Together with the farmers, we work towards that. And then around this, the farmers then identify enterprises around which the farmer training activities shall be done. And on top of the theory training, we also have on-farm demonstrations where the farmers together with the extension supervisors go through the different practices right from land preparation until harvest and even do the evaluation of the different technologies, I should say. Uganda National Agro Input Dealers Association has the role of attracting input dealers to northern and eastern Uganda to participate in the revitalization of the economy. The distribution system is that the inputs are procured by FAO. These inputs are channeled to the distributors who are located in both districts of Padaya and Nguru. And the stockists, these are the small business persons in the sub-counties, pick the inputs from the distributor in town and bring them down to the sub-county where the community people who have done public works, and the local farmers who have been working, pick inputs using their vouchers. Farmers are paid for their labor to build community assets. These public work projects are selected by the returnees and their host communities. Priorities include community access roads that allow farmers to access their land and markets. Payment is in vouchers, which can be exchanged at local input stockists. There's a wide range of inputs, including seeds and farm implements. The stockists then present the vouchers at AT Uganda, which after reconciliation pays the distributors and stockists a marginal fee. The rationale behind the project is to ensure that we have a sustainable source of inputs through the private system distribution and at the same time to create assets for agricultural development. We are implementing the project in two districts, Gulu and Pade, and we plan to target 30,000 households. Grace Lalwenyi is one of the input stockists who hopes to expand her business from the project. I have serenade 4, ginade, and then vegetable seeds, which ranges from tomatoes, onions, eggplants, and then I have tools. I'll be able to get profit out of it and then serve people with improved seeds. ACTED is contracted by FAO and the European Commission to help communities identify, supervise, and provide technical advice for public works in Gulu. We've been meeting communities from the beginning back in January to ascertain their needs as regards livelihood recovery, and they've prioritised roads as their main need, community access roads. And our focus is labour-based, labour-intensive-based roadworks, with using local people and we provide technical supervision. They work under a voucher for work system. After they've been labouring, they receive the vouchers and they exchange them with the selected stockists and suppliers for agricultural inputs. These can be seeds and tools and iron sheets and other needs that they have to recover their livelihoods as farmers. Rehabilitation of old roads and opening up new ones has encouraged more internally displaced people to return to their villages of origin as they become more accessible. Rehabilitation of old roads and other roads and other roads and other roads. Local authorities are very happy with the voucher for work approach, and are asking the European Commission and FOWL to expand it further. The program should be expanded, one, by increasing on the amount of vouchers, and two, by diversifying the activities for which the voucher is paid. For example, the wells and other things. We actually like the program, especially on roads. It's really opening roads. We know, of course, a FOWL program doesn't enter into bridges. But a road without a bridge is not a road. You come to the bridge and you stop, and when rain comes, how do you go to the other side? So that's another area. We feel that where there are bridges, FOWL should come in. The KASAVA KASAVA KASAVA is one of the important food and cash crops amongst the people of northern and eastern Uganda. It is particularly favored because of its ability to withstand drought conditions and ensure food security when other crops fail. During the 1990s, Uganda was struck by the KASAVA mosaic disease, which destroyed over 150,000 hectares. This is a loss of about US$60 million every year. Localized famine was experienced between 1993 and 1997. FAO has used funding from European Commission to support the multiplication of the KASAVA mosaic disease resistant and brown streak virus tolerant varieties in partnership with the National Agricultural Research Organization, NARO. FAO has multiplied 100 acres of two improved popular varieties, Akena and 2961. FAO has been responsible for local 보통 hasn't died.

FAO has worked very badly lioted by the NARO forzić. have been distributed to returnees as they move out of the camps for internally displaced people. Distribution of the cassava planting materials has been greatly facilitated by the formation of farmer field schools by FAO and 12 NGO partners. The farmer field schools, comprising 25 to 30 members each, have been trained in appropriate agronomic practices and facilitated to access inputs. Farmers now cultivating the new varieties are happy with their performance. Our estimate is about 90 bags of cassava cuttings will go to each farmer field school. So if you divide 90 by 30, you will find a member of the school will get about three bags. And three bags can plant about half an acre. And in the back we have about 800 cuttings. If about 20,000 individuals plant about half an acre of disease resistant varieties, we are very sure in the next two, three years all the villages will be having the good variety. In 2008 and 2009, FAO is planning to expand Cassava multiplication to reach more people returning from IDP camps in northern Uganda. In 2008, we have already secured some funds from different donors to maintain these 100 hectares. And we are still in discussion with ECO to establish new 100 hectares, but now not in the Taiso and Lango, but in the actual region, but also in Abim, so a bit in Karamoja. So we will target Kidgum, Pader, Abim, Gulu, and Namuru. And I think it will be like 20 hectares in each of these districts. So that's for 2008. For 2009, we would like to have 20 hectares, not only in one in the capital of the district, but we would like to have 20 hectares in maybe let's say the five biggest towns in each district. And in the future, we would like to establish modern garden on the road between these five big cities. Like this, it will try to cover the whole district. And that will take like three years' time. So we are also discussing with some donors like the USID and the European Commission for these long-term plans. In 2007, heavy rains caused severe flooding which destroyed food crops in many parts of eastern and northern Uganda. FAO emergency response using eco funds included rapid response to people affected by the floods in Taiso by providing cassava cuttings of the new resistant varieties and other agricultural inputs. It's estimated that 50,000 households or 300,000 people were affected by the floods. And in response, FAO provided, planned for supporting 20,000 households with planting material containing granates, simsims, cow peas, and cassava cuttings, and also sweet potato vines. This has already been provided and also other actors are providing this to support these households affected to come out of the situation that they are faced with of food insecurity. FAO as the people recover from the disastrous floods, their hope lies in the new crops to offer them food security.
