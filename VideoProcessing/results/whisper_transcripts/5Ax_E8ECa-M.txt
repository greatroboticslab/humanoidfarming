 Now that the kids are about two weeks old, it's time to start milking the mamas. Baby goats start eating hay pretty fast, and as they eat hay, they drink less milk. So we've got to keep the mamas' production up. This is the time when they have the most milk, and this little machine has been a lifesaver for our small farm and my hands. And the mamas have an instinct to hold back milk for their babies, which we let them do. After we're done, we head back into the barn to greet all of the hungry babies. And while it's a little bit chaotic while they find all their mamas, it all eventually seems to work out, even though it can get a little bit tricky with the triplets. And of course, we use some of that milk for little Newt, who drinks it down greedily.
