 I'd f***ing rather cut my foot off than be a vegan. I'd f***ing eat myself before I'd f***ing sit around and eat vegetables, dude. No, we've got vegan burgers, dude. Do you rather eat your foot than a vegan burger? Dude, so this is what makes me laugh about you as vegans. You want chicken so bad that you get processed f***ing and you make it look like a piece of chicken and then you f***ing eat it. Just eat the goddamn chicken if you want chicken. Processed KFC? I don't give a f*** what it's processed food. You're talking about we're the only ones with processed f***ing. Most of the processed food is meat. What I don't get is if you want to eat a piece of chicken, why make something look like a piece of chicken? Just eat the bloody chicken. I spent an hour telling you how I don't want to kill chickens. If the animal didn't want to be killed, then figure out a way around it. Jeffrey Dahmer can say that about killing children. If you don't want to be killed, figure out a way around it. I mean, it doesn't justify killing the innocent, does it?
