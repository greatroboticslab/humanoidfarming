 So a lot of you guys are asking, how do you propagate ginger? Well today, mom's going to show us how. Mom got this from the local supermarket and now we're about to propagate them. When you buy them, you want to put them in a pan like this and put a little bit of water. And how long do you leave them? Two weeks. And after two weeks, the nodes start growing like this and it's time to propagate. First, you need a deep container like this. And be sure to drill drainage holes, just like this. Put the topsoil on like this. You put it like this. Lightly thin on the top like this. And you water them one week, just one week. Right here. And I eat this and this one they grow back. And this one will later grow back just like this one right here, right? Uh huh. I cut and they grow it back. And you're done.
