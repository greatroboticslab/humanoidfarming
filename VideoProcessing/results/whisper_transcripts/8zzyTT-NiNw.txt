 What's going on everybody? You can see behind me it is round baling day We got some triticale round bale up for this customer we're gonna plastic wrap it And I think we're even gonna use the round bale moving trailer to move a few bales From a random little patch that we have at the home farm. So John Deere 6430 premium McHale v660 baler McHale wrapper We're gonna try and bail this stuff up Chop it up with the knives put some plastic on it make some good for you for these cows. I'll take you along for the ride So I don't know if it's too loud this cab for you to actually hear me or not, but we'll talk for a minute One this feels a little bit drier than most people do for haylage I think we've been bailing around 30 35% so it's lower some higher to I do not have the horsepower that most people have as I'm watching it right now I might have to slow down. I don't have the horsepower most people do for this I think recommended is usually a minimum of 150 horsepower to get through it quickly or At an average pace I'll say We fought the baler for the first I don't know half an hour because everything was still Not shined up brand You know first field of the season everything's got a little surface rust whenever we gotta get it shined up to Make everything flow properly Well, she's running quite a bit better now I'm only running 120 horse on this thing with all the knives in so it is quite taxing And it doesn't allow us to run As fast as probably most people do on us. However, this is about the only field of wet haylage I do Because of that reason but it's a neighbor Really nice guy like doing some work for him So we do it In the future maybe a new set of knives and a bigger tractor we feel this a lot easier But for now, we just take her nice and easy Three four mile an hour bailing not the greatest speed in the world but Thankfully he likes these bales a little bit drier than normal haylage that 15 60 percent moisture So he likes it in that 30 to 35 percent moisture just likes how it beats out for his cows So that works good for me with lower horsepower. I can actually get it through I would struggle a lot more if he wanted it higher moisture so We'll see how We're actually making a bale here Dry hay this tractor does fantastic on the baler Even if I ran knives the dry hay we would just shatter and break it instead of trying to cut it works great But Anyway, do I do it the same way that most people do? No, but I don't have any tractors bigger than this so we work with what we got Someday we'll have a bigger one and maybe we'll do it differently then All right, we're gonna see how long it took to make a bale here to see about how many we're doing an hour There we go. We got two minutes on that bale. I'll take that all day. That's 30 bales an hour I was hoping for 20 an hour so Definitely happy Rocking at that pace Got the triticale all wrapped up or well baled up we haven't wrapped it yet Now I feel like we're actually getting something done Bale a little bit faster now Got a little five acre patch for the same guy that we're just round baling up dry alfalfa for him Came out nice raked together two of the Windrows 16 foot windrows out of the self-propelled mower Making some beautiful bales Look at that windrow See how this bale looks when it comes out Beautiful It says it's not shut Well, I guess we'll go check out and see what that is I love this big It's flat, wide, thick windrows makes a nice size bale real quick Packs it together nice Look at that Oh, it's beautiful I think I'm going to try the cover edge Net wrap the next time Because the regular four foot net wrap for some reason just doesn't like to always cover the edge Or get to all the way to the edge like it's supposed to Here's our problem right here A little build up not letting the door shut I'm going to try the other side of the car No big deal No big deal Bet she closes now let's find out All the fun beeping Well, that's curious I'm gonna have to investigate Well, I found our problem here We'll see if it's a quick easy fix or if we got bigger problems to worry about This side's working properly This is the latch Door latch it says it's closed and this sensor says hey, I'm there And this spring pulls it back down That Is together Properly Now let the alfalfa dust it down a little bit Let's look at the other side And see what this one looks like Door shut latch is not down But our spring is So I think I need a spring Might be a challenge being as how it's Sunday What to do what to do we'll see what we can figure out All right, so we fixed the broken spring Kinda for now With Ingenuity And a couple other springs And wires And hopefully that'll get us through the last Few bales of the day So I can order the right spring And get this thing taken care of the right way Here we go On to the wrapping stage This thing will wrap four foot Four foot and five foot wide Five and six foot diameter bales Just gotta get the net route Or the I'm sorry man I am fumbling all over Plastic threaded through Unto a pin And we're gonna get rolling All right Well Took me a minute or two to figure out How to run this thing Because it's been a year But each one of my levers over here There's an arm to pick up the bales Arm to spin it An arm to tip it And an arm here to cut the plastic And then there's a little monitor on the side here I'll show this all to you There's it counts your number of revolutions Which we have preset And keep track of your bales See like I said I had to remember how to run this thing Because I just goofed that up a little bit Well One bad thing about using my baling tractor for this The wheels are set out nice and wide for baling But I have to be exactly Next to the row of bales Otherwise I won't pick them up And then I just about run into them Sometimes McHale makes one like this as a monitor Just like the baler does It's automatic When you pull into a bale It senses there's a bale there To pick it up Do the whole shooting match for you Tip it off And you just move on to the next one There were not any used ones that was available when I bought this And we frankly don't wrap enough In a year's time to justify it So we got the manual lever one Not that bad I don't mind it at all The machine's really reliable Works great And Glad to have it So we'll show you some of the Some of the wrapping And We'll go from there So there's the monitor How many wraps you've done And your target Up and down with the arm to pick up the bales Spin the bale Dump the bale off And cut The plastic Oh you can't see me at all Cool That's a wrap folks Long day Bailing Wrapping Fixing Breakdowns All the fun stuff Appreciate you tuning in and watching Don't forget to like Smash subscribe Comment We'd love to hear from you We'll talk to you later And see you on the next one Thank you Take care In this Best Once Have a they Of the Need It's Part B Other You You With And You You By offshore
