 Hey there and welcome to Hyperactive Highs. My name is Jay and in today's episode I'm going to quickly cover five tips that will be extremely valuable to new growers using soil as a growing medium. And if you're not new then you'll want to stick around anyways because there's some good information here and you'll probably still find it applicable. Let's jump in. One of the 10 cardinal parameters for a healthy plant is microbes and for good reason because they play a big role in making nutrients bioavailable to your plant. This is a big part of why people use worm castings and while yes they're a good source of micronutrients they are absolutely packed with an abundance of beneficial microbes and nematodes that break down material and make it bioavailable to your plant. For a home grower there are really three main ingredients for healthy microbiology. The first is a source of beneficial microbes. I generally add worm castings straight from my worm bin into my initial soil mix and then I water my plants with a double dose of real growers recharge one to two times weekly. Compost teas are also a great source of microbes. Second is a source of carbohydrates to act as a food source for those microbes. Blackstrap molasses is a cheap and easily accessible supplement just make sure it's unsulfured. Lastly we have mycorrhizae. This is a fungal network that forms a symbiotic relationship with your plants roots. Mycorrhizae are better at mining nutrients from a wider area than roots are which are taken up and transmitted to your plants roots in exchange for some glucose the plant produces via photosynthesis. Usually mycorrhizae is added into the soil mix prior to planting. However products do exist to supplement mycorrhizae after the fact like Real Growers Recharge mentioned in bullet 1 which contains four different species of mycorrhizae. With these three additions to your soil I promise you will see happier and healthier plants in no time. When it comes to pots there's a concept that pot size dictates plant size. So really the pot size you use is entirely dependent on how much growing space you have and what size plants you can support. The bigger the pot the bigger the plant. And while this concept is a general rule it's not a law because plants can be easily stunted by a variety of factors. Genetics also plays a huge role in how large a plant can get as does the environment, the nutrients you're feeding, the medium you're growing in, indoor versus outdoor, CO2 levels and light intensity. You get the point. Training methods also change how a plant can grow. A completely untrained plant will need up to double the vertical height of a plant that's being trained to grow outwards. For the most part though the maximum potential of a plant is largely decided by the pot size. As for what types of pots you should use there are only two types that matter in my book. Fabric pots and air pots. And the reason for both is the same. They reduce standing water and they allow air to pass through the material giving roots access to the oxygen they need. Not only that but many plants will self-prune when coming in contact with oxygen and cannabis is no different. This means that a root will stop growing once it reaches the edge of a pot which encourages growth elsewhere in the root system and prevents root balls from developing root bounding the plant. This also tends to result in a more robust root system with less reliance on a single dominant taproot. I personally use fabric pots because they're light, easy to store, can be machine washed, and generally come with grommets that are useful for training. I stick to growing four plants maximum in seven gallon pots in my 4x4. You can certainly go bigger or do more plants in smaller pots but if you're a new grower I would recommend growing less plants at a time so you can focus more on learning with less to manage. And seriously, do not use clay pots. Soil growers will often start plants in smaller pots because they're easier to manage with the intention of moving the plant into a larger pot in a process called transplanting. Now everywhere you look on Reddit, on forums, YouTube, you'll find people telling you not to disturb your roots when transplanting for a whole host of reasons but I'm gonna tell you right here right now, disturb your dang roots. Especially if you're transplanting a root bound plant. It doesn't have to be a lot, I do it by loosening the outer edges of the roots with my fingers and using pruning scissors to slice some vertical cross cuts along the bottom edges of the root ball to promote new outward growth. I also recommend cutting off any roots that are browning or turning transparent. We want white, healthy roots. Sure, it's possible that these actions may stress the plant or stunt growth for a day or two but the following growth will more than make up for it. And if you don't do anything to your roots, it's possible your plant could suffer from stunted growth because it's still cemented into the shape of the previous pot and outward growth can be very slow. New growers tend to struggle with over or under watering and rightly so because there are a lot of things that can affect how often plants need to be watered. Pot size, growing medium, plant size, environmental factors, and much more. The first important thing you should know, and this goes back to choosing a pot type, is that oxygen is an important and necessary part of a healthy root system. So a good rule of thumb when growing in soil is to only water once your pots have mostly dried out. Over watering is not a problem related to how much water you give your plant at any given time. Rather, the frequency of how much you're doing it and how it affects the roots ability to access oxygen. Now when it comes to how to tell if a plant needs water before it starts to wilt, there are many tells but here's what I found most practical over the years. The simplest way, especially when plants are small, is to lift the pot up and feel it by weight. If you need to get a baseline, lift the pot after you've watered it and make a mental note of that feeling. Lift it again a few hours later the next day and keep doing so until the pot is extremely light in comparison to the fully watered pot. Now that you know how the pot feels saturated and unsaturated, you can go by feel on whether or not your pots should be watered. Another way I found useful over the years is to plant a cover crop, such as white dutch clover, in the topsoil around your main crop and use it as an indicator for when a pot needs to be watered. Cover crops come with a host of benefits for soil microbiology, but they also wilt before your main crop due to their shallow root system, which I found to be a valuable visual indicator on a pot that has almost gotten to the point of being too dry. Lastly, get a soil moisture meter. This is probably the best option for someone wanting something simple or those who are physically unable to lift up pots often. With these, you just probe the soil and it tells you the moisture levels. The only thing I don't like about these is that generally poking solid objects down into your roots isn't the best as it tends to damage them. In regards to how much water to give a plant, in my experience, a solid starting point for any container is to water with 25% of the container's soil capacity. So a four gallon pot would receive one gallon of water, a one gallon pot would receive one fourth of a gallon, etc. This amount can change based on frequency though. Some growers practice more high frequency watering in smaller amounts. For example, these plants I'm growing in seven gallon pots have only been getting one gallon of water every day, depending on pot saturation, and even then I'll have to skip one or two days every now and then because they've retained too much water. The last tip that I have for you today is to get a reverse osmosis water system for all of your plant related needs. There's a lot of benefits to this, mainly it being a controlled variable. For example, I know that my RO water comes out at a pH of 7 and the nutrient line that I use puts me between 5.6 and 6.5 pH every time requiring no pH adjustment, which would not be the case using tap water. Tap water also typically contains various minerals and traces of chlorine or chloramine. RO water isn't just good for your plants though, it's good for equipment and your humidifiers will thank you for it. Humidifiers using tap water often become a breeding ground for bacteria and mold, which you've probably seen before as a pink residue known as serratia. Since switching to RO water, I have never had this pink color rear its ugly head in my humidifiers, which reduces how often I need to clean them while maintaining proper functionality and keeping my grow space clean. White residue forming on the inner walls of your tent is also typically caused by humidifiers using tap water, so if that's you, get yourself an RO system. They're really not too expensive and pretty easy to install by yourself. According to Dr. Bruce Bugbee, sustained CO2 concentrations of 1200 ppm leads to around 30% higher yield on average, even under low light conditions. Meaning first and foremost, WHO normally you can really carry around the low light interest will take about 93% cyclists. of the twenty- Cell beating fire to sollten more territory, hearing over 50% higher yield on the lower light conditions.
