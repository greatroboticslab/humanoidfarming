 Well the amount of rain the borderland is experiencing has been both beneficial and challenging for some area farmers. KTSM 9 News reporter Shelby Kapp is live from Las Cruces where she spoke to farmers and experts about all this rain. Well Daniel Natasia there is moisture out here on the ground at this pecan farm this afternoon as we have seen showers on and off this afternoon here in Las Cruces now the manager of this pecan farm tells me not only is the rain good for these trees but it also saves money. Rain is always fantastic for farmers especially in the middle of the drought. For Greg Davie the manager of Dixie Ranch in Las Cruces rain is like money. Every quarter of an inch of rain is worth a thousand dollars to our operation and saved irrigation and a quarter of a million dollars to our region. Saying without the rain he would be paying to pump the water to his pecan orchards. Predominant means of irrigating in our region is flood irrigation. When we have abundant surface water we use lots of river water to do our irrigation. When we're in droughts like we are now we have to pump the water instead. While Davie is thrilled with the rain coming down chili farmers in the area face a few more challenges. If the roots stay waterlogged if the fields stay very very wet for a long period of time the water logging will kill chili plants. We also have a very infamous disease here in the state called chili will. Saying chili farmers need good drainage systems to get water out of their fields quickly. Another challenge the heat we saw just a few weeks back. Had that serious hot spell which under very hot conditions like what we had chili plants won't set fruit. It's too hot for the flowers to actually pollinate and set fruit. But says the rain is helping. Fortunately that hot spell came in early enough it didn't really hurt the fruit settler plants and now that it's cooled off with all this rain the chili plants are setting fruit like crazy. So I think we're gonna have a really great season for chili in New Mexico this year. While chili peppers will be harvested by the end of this month pecans will not be harvested until December.
