 I want to make it plain that I am absolutely thrilled to bits for Caleb. But he has left me just a little bit in the lurch. Please, come on. It's freezing cold and soaking wet. Come on. I've got to be honest, I'm having a tottering time. While Caleb's away, I'm going to need a hand. You've seen Clarkson's farm? Yeah. Yeah, have you? No. She's brilliant. Should I trim your eyebrows? What's the matter with my eyebrows? Are you kidding? That's so tiny! Watch me call it. Richard Hamm. You know you're in the show. What a brilliant idea. Gonna buy a pub. What? Son of a bitch! Give me a drink! I've got to be honest. When I first looked round, that hadn't fallen down. Oh, man! I love it! The only thing that would help this shithole is a wrecking ball. So they've drilled holes from cubicle to cubicle. I don't think that was to improve ventilation. Yeah. Top of the old thing and then the old thing on wall again, Brad. Yeah. Pigs have clitorises. I didn't know that. Jesus. Yeah, he can't find us either. I can't see it. I want to get it open by the August bank holiday. Fuckin' hell. The carvery is now open. Power cut. Fans are dead. No gas. Lunch service is a bus, basically. Son of a bitch! No, no, wait! Wait! Fuck that! Why is it going at 100 miles per hour? Stop the tractor! I think we get rid of Harvey Swinstein. Harvey Swinstein? Who? To the scientist. It's a scientist. Actor. It's a scientist. Give me a goddamn drink. You've been at school, haven't you? You've been learning how to be a dog. Come here. And heel. Ow! Oh! Oh! The backup in my life! One day! The power in my life! א�? Few ways, AH! In England tuvo You might have good plans of body. Oh! Dead discusses. The better minutes of life. It's going to be an empty verse. You want tirar these cats?
