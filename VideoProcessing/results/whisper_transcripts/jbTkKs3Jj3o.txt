 Ha ha! So, alright, so, alright Gary? Yes? Alright Cain? Perfect. And donkey. We have came to Trillic, which is not somewhere we come that often, this part of the world. We got here eventually. We got here eventually, I was doing the directions and it wasn't up to my normal specification of directions, but anyway, we come up to Trillic Tractors, Trillic Tractors are holding a timed online auction through Mid Ulster Auctions, who most people will know. And it's basically a stock reduction. And there is everything here from projects to, I have no idea what you would, like look at that MXU 115. Some silly agent was very sore in that. But that could have a home, that could have a place. But these guys working an awful lot, exporting and tractors and selling bits and bobs. So they're having this auction, so we're going to go on a wee dander round. And you can go on to Mid Ulster Auctions. It starts on Thursday, I think that's Thursday the 4th, and it finishes on Monday the 8th. And everything that we're taking a dander round here is for sale. There's some going with some cowlil yokes. I think there's a viewing day on the Friday too. A viewing day on the Friday, so you can come up and take a dander round. Go for a good route about, hey. That's what they say, a good route about. If you can find a place. But Dick, there's a 716, right? Now I don't know anything about the history of her, showing a few signs of rust in that round the bonnet. But if that tractor there, if you knew anything about the Rs or its history, if the very old was good, engine was good, that could tidy into a very good tractor. Oh aye, yeah. You know, if she was coming off the auction at the right kind of money, a little bit of tidy up and you could be going. But what about this old 185 McCormick boy? That's just a yoke for ignorance on horsepower. I think we'll walk past the MXU. I'll have it higher. There's a tidier CS 110, in fairness. Reasonable straight track there. Them's a good wee bus. But you know, farmers sometimes don't particularly look after stuff that well. No, they don't, no. They're a wee bit scared of the power washer. 5140 boys. I'm not even going to show that because everybody's going to say, you need one of them don't you? You need one of them. Dullesheft Landini legend. Hey, there's a straight wee bus yoke. Do I see a Lamborghini? Look at the Lamborghini. 1556DT. What does that mean? Basically, if you want to sum this tractor up in one word, it's called rod. Are you sure? Rusty rod, but rod. I don't think I ever was in one of them. Is that about a sir Pete? I would be, aye. Lethal. The doig section. No, I'm passing by the doig section. The Sami Explorer section. I would love a wee Sami 90 Explorer at some point in my life. An 80. An 80, because my uncle had an 80. Look at them. But she's a Centurion. Export model. I doubt they were getting her ready for hand, do you? Cut the front cleaner. Holy. Oh, 8150, follow it. That's the 89 50's the one you want, isn't it? Aye. But aye, you couldn't buy them. Sax 930. Oh, Sax 930. Sax 930. He's a wee straight now too. Oh, there's a wee 4000 all tidied up now. Aye. She's ready for the Vantage runs. A bit out of place runs, yeah. I'm thinking that man's got the collar wrong in the next one. I went for the Leyland blue. Toothbrush finish. Project. Oh! Cabless 6-6-10. Okay. Like what? Is these, what? They've just cut the top off. So the cab's rotten, so just cut it off? Is that the same here? Indian spec. Noor hell. But look at that wee tractor there. Good V40 boys. Solid. Well, she's, you know. Like, the way the paint that's come off that there is what gives that the real, it's what gives it the bad look. What's they call that? Patina? Isn't that what they call that? Would they like her? And it's like that. And it's like that. But no, but they're being serious. There's a wee tractor there, is not, she's not bait stupid. Well, she's all there. She might need a mudguard faxing. Just straight wee tractor in fairness. Aye, but she's not an SLE I don't think. There's an SLE 8340. But she's not dang stupid either, she's just... Well. She's forward. She's a brave project. There's a right tidy. Right tidy 8210 son. Aye, she's alright. She'd look well in the cane sailor. Solid in though, ain't she? A big one or 140 boys. Air conditioning 40k. Lot number 124. Get her bought boys. Yes. Now we're talking about modifications. Tractor cab specialists. He'll sort everything out in there that needs to sort it out. Fiat Ali! I didn't realise 140. Again we have one ready for Randy. Look at the blue 110. Tradition. All she needs is the LED lights and she's away boys. Ready for... Couple more 110s there's a more original 110. How you pick up... That's a piece of a Leyland cab I believe there. It's been stitched onto her. Death scandalous. But you know what... But you know what these guys do a lot of but... They take a lot of tractors in. Could you even set up with that Kean? On Kean. Watch you don't get your feet wet in there with a wee hoe. Oh yeah! Watch it not bounce your head. It must be designed for wee short people. These guys would export a lot but to like Sudan and all these places. And I suppose that's the way they just have to leave them. They just want them plain straight sample tractors. There's a 110. I'm getting that value boy. But Gary there's a 110 then. It's not the worst. We've seen them in far worse shape let me tell you. 399 boys. Yous laughed at me when I looked this up in the brochure. That's actually... Big Perkin 6 cylinder boys. Flat. 229 either. I suppose we have one of them. 188 boys. Cobblest 699. You were looking a shovel. No it's a big dagger anyway after. You said we need a dagger. We have his head turned with daggers now Kean. Big 20 tonner wanted. We need a big dagger. It has to be a 20 tonner too. This is the one I'm looking at here. This is the one. Auction item number one. Which means she'll go cheap. An absolute weapon. Rod. I suppose she's auction number one. She'll go cheap. Aye. First you know. Um. Yeah. No this is it. This is definitely it. Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Mmhmm. We need all this in our life. 20 tonner. Is there any go in there old pig? We need this in our life. See. It works. It works. So what more do you need to know? Might need it. I don't really feel safe standing here. I don't need this. It's not that it works. It works. It works. So what more do you need to know? We need this in our life. See, it works. It works. So what more do you need to know? Might need a... I don't really feel safe standing here. You imagine you could do without you. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. You don't need a brand spanking new digger. All you need is raw horsepower and a big boom. All you need is horsepower and a big boom. Get the checkbook out. Oh. Automatic stop. It's idle. Fuel efficient machine. You might need to get her down though. That's into the power on her. Oh, aye. Fully functional. Change the size. Now it's on now. Oh, rod. It's a wee bit of play on her. But that's just a pin. The pin? That's just a pin. Just needs grease. Aye. Like, cab's tight. Like, there's barely any... Seat's dry. Seat's... Well, it was anyway. Aye, well, it won't be if I get in fried weight myself. I see she's maybe a bat bag. I don't know. Well, at least that's a decent bucket. You might need a bucket, but at least she's a quack hatch. I don't think that quack hatch would fit that quack hatch. She's a great lump, that doosin'. She must. I don't know what size that would be, aye. I'd say there'll be a better value to be had. It's going to be value to be had, innit? The way I look at this here is, if you're a man who knows your way around and you need something, like, you take an old awl like that there for a man around the yard. Chains don't need to be in great condition. If her wheel motors are up and running, her pumps are reasonably functional. You could do a lot of work around the place. If you're sort of, I'm not saying now you buy that and go to the country now. No, but a farmer's dagger. But if you're a big dairyman who's digging out an old hole or a bit of quarry, but come on around the diggers of that. I'm not sure. You're a cabal goat. Have been getting more and more popular over the years. I could see you in that. I could see me in that too. Scooting about and wrecking things. See, I wouldn't want a digger sitting like a new pin and all painted up. I'd like one that if I hit her off something, nobody would know. Well, then that's the one for you. Unless I hit her off someone's tractor or something like that there. JS 130. That's your dagger. You ain't. Aye. I don't know how you... You love the JS. The seat only goes up to 120 kilos, it says. We can sort that one. I'm telling you. Could do worse than taking a yoke like that one. Aye. Nothing else? What did you see? Oh aye, there's a Mitsubishi I was getting for you. I seen that in the catalogue. I don't do daggers, Gar. Huh? I don't do daggers. Aye, you do? No. Aye, you're doing this Mitsubishi. You're a big Mitsubishi fan. You said you love Mitsubishi Shoguns. Mitsubishi L200s. No, I never said that. I found you a Mitsubishi digger. Aye. Guy in you get. Is the seat dry? Yeah. And clean. See, she's got air cone. Then you get to the Mitsubishi. How do you get under? So you climb. There you go. There you go. Now you get on the levers there. If we get your shot here, we get a wee look at you. Get on the levers there, boy. It's just like operating a bag of Hector. Yeah. What? This is what they talk about stirring soup, isn't it? You'll do bother with your hitting your leg in there. Ah, should be your sort of machine now. Oh, man. Oh, guy. I put you in the wrong digger. I've changed my mind. Oh, really? You're on this one at the end. That's got the super comfort deluxe seat in her. Some cherry. I'm telling you. I can sit in here. Give me that there. Do you see that? Let the people see. Oh, no way. Come on, you girlie. That sounded like you last week. Oh, come on. Oh, I need a tiny easy start. Shall we go? Give her a push. See, that's just your wee safety. I'll go and get the two GS200 here. Give you a push. Them's not hitting your leg. No, they're not great all the same. Oh, she will go. She's a Nissan excavator. Is she hey? She is hey. Oh, nearly. That's a full electric seat at her, look. Look. See that guy. Seat's electric, look. Oh, no way. There you go, look. I've been making Jimmy. Is there a massage on her? Oh, no. Put her over. You had to buy a 250 grand tractor to get a seat like that, hey. Look, look, look. She even goes down, look. Full of lumber support. Hey, well, you can get it. Class. Oh, man. That has made my morning. What is that tear out of? I recognise it. Hey, I tell you even better than that there. Airbag and all that. That's what you say. You cowper, you have an airbag to protect you. Look, that is next level thinking. Couple of old tankers. Look, you need somebody to move a bit of poo. New shaft. Straightforward. You can't really go wrong there. Even if you have an issue, pop out your veins. Put in a new set of veins, a drop of oil. That tanker will move a bit of poo. Water. Do it to tanker. Water to cattle. Whatever you need. Ideal. In fairness, drinker. Job. No problem. Yeah. Super. You might need Steph at her. Steph, we might need you over. I think. This one at the end would be a project now and a half. But even there, boys, will lock old tires. Somebody needs an old set of tires gathered up. So that's a... I still haven't worked out what this is. But she's a baby, hey? She's a 25. Has to be a 25. There she's there, look. Yeah, I say it's 25. Sprocket ratios, if you would like to know. Hey, she hasn't much of an intake, hey? I've got a mind in the wee douts and that and a wee 10-foot sward. Now, that's a project for somebody now. Aye, that is a project there. That would be worth saving. Hey, I'll tell you, that tractor might just turn out all right. That's nice. Honestly. That would be good there now. Yeah. Proper international colours. I've said this to you before many times. Yeah. Might need... Steady, steady. I've said to you many times, I'd love another 1455. Only like this here. But I could settle for like a 1055. International. I think I'd love another project now. That's worth saving there now. She's solid. She's not bad now. They would go there like she's not bad. It really is. It really is. As your man said, look. It's... A wee glass there, boys. It's fresh. Good state glass. Axos. That's a good wee loader tractor for somebody there now. Yeah. Bit of a reduction stock. The guys have still a lot of stock in their yard. If you're up at the viewing days, you'll see. Stuff that they're doing up for export or whatever. 2650. That's the gig. That's what these guys is at. The old type cab. The sauna cab. 2650's alright there now. That's a wee quick look around. It is something a bit different. A wee quick look? Well, aye, well. It wasn't really that quick. We just... I suppose we could chat him to the boss man. Over at Maclean's actually. And he said he was doing it. And I said, hey, we'd love to come for a wee dander around. So that's exactly what we're doing. Hopefully he makes us a cup of tea for doing it. But it's cool. I'm telling you. There is a few bargains to be had here. If the price is right on them now. Now there's work to do to a lot of them. We're not trying to take that away. But the boys that's buying that kind of thing is going to do the work. Yeah. You know. It's hard to find a good project. So. Hey everybody. See you later. What do you think, Cain? That 1055 series potential. Aye, pack of them. I have to pick one now. That 1055. She's pack of the series. Seriously, aye. Aye. That turned on a lovely tractor. So it would, yeah. Yeah. 1055, that's it. For these boys. Yep. Personally, I'd be going for the JS200. I thought your heart was setting the Nassau. With the Deluxe seat. Got the복. Await. And the marshes. So. Shall we do? So. You should have hitter.رتutowałais.com Polاس sp houses all over here. Let's do this for me. Before we just put it in, my kit look nice andicosteness.
