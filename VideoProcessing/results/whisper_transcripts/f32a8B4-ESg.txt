 I produced $60,000 more of revenue than they had the year before on the exact same number of acres. And were your operating expenses lower or higher? Absolutely. I had the lowest inputs on the entire operation in my first year in that system. Things look good as far as like cattle market and things right now, but economically we're in a really tough time. Be careful about what you're measuring. You know, we're geared conventionally to want to produce weight per animal. And that isn't always the most productive and darn sure isn't always financially the most feasible. My first holistic experience, so to speak, I was greatly disappointed. I'd weaned 40 pounds less than they had the year before. And my supervisor said to me, you're looking at it all wrong. You need to go back and look at the data and look at your pounds per acre or your annual production. I had weaned 40 pounds less of calf and 30,000 pounds more of production. Increased stocking rate. I mean, you take just simple math at 30,000 more pounds at $2 a pound.
