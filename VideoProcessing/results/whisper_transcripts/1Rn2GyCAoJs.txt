 pre captions We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. So we play this game on Tuesdays and Thursdays. We're just going to keep on rebuilding that farm. My goal is to make a $10 million farm, everybody. A $10 million farm starting from scratch with no experience at all. This is ridiculous, dude. I don't know what I got myself into. Hey, what's up? Hey, what's up? It's good to see you. Man, congestion, everybody. So how's your guys' day? You guys having a good day today? Hey, what's up, Kira? Welcome in. It's good to see you, Kira. I just got home from work. I just got home from work about almost an hour ago. Actually, literally an hour ago. And I'm feeling good. I'm feeling good today. I'm doing good, Kira. I'm doing good. You can skip out, ready to stream with y'all. Get down on this farm and simulator 25 and continue this farm. And then there's people who are reaching out, asking me to play freaking Ranch Simulator. I'm actually thinking about playing that, too. I've been drawing since Sunday. Heck yeah, Kira. What are you drawing? You still working on that comic book? That's freaking awesome. Just popping in to see how everybody is before I go to sleep. All right, Speofy. Oh, yeah, man. Get some sleep because I know it's late over there for you right now. Isn't it like 1 o'clock or something like that right now? 1 o'clock in the morning, dude? I got the art bug. There ain't nothing wrong with that, Kira. You always got to keep that creativity sharp 100%. 100%. And everybody, I got my farmer's hat on today. I got my pride shirt right here. Hey, Moo. Yo, what up? I found your page on Instagram two days ago. Maybe even trying to catch it. Hey, what's up, man? Welcome in, Amoo. Amoo69, dude. Thanks for stopping by. We're getting down with some Farmer Simulator 25, so I don't know what game you saw me playing. I'm going to assume it was Drive Beyond Horizons, bro. I play that game Mondays, Fridays, and Saturdays. So stay tuned for that one. It's a good one. I appreciate you, Kira. Thank you so much for that. I try, everybody. I try the best that I can. But you know what? We're going to jump straight into this game, guys. We're going to get this game just up and going right now. Because I'm feeling it. I've been feeling it, dude. And we got to get this farm going. We got to get this farm going. I think I'm doing okay for starting from scratch. I mean, I did get a financing mod to help me out a little bit. But we got to get this farm going, guys. We got to get this farm going. So we're going to switch on over there. I'm going to go live on the good old TikTok real quick. Hold up. I forgot to set all this stuff up. Man, dude. I think we're good over here. Hold up, everybody. Bear with me. Bear with me. There's always something that I'm forgetting to do. And it seems to be I'm always forgetting to freaking set up TikTok first. I think we're good there. All right. We're going live now. All right. Watch them all, brother. I saw one of your reels. I just went scrolling through them all. I appreciate it, man. Hopefully you enjoy the content, dude. Hopefully you enjoy the content because I'm having fun making it. I'm having fun streaming. I'm having fun making all that content, dude. And it's nothing but a good time. It's nothing but a good time. And I'm meeting nothing but awesome people. Everybody who seems to come into the good old pride chat, everybody, seems to be freaking awesome. I appreciate you guys all for that. Hey, what's up, Archon? Welcome in, bro. Welcome in. All right. Let's get into this dang game right here. Let's get into this game. We've got to see where we left off first of all. All right. All right. So here we are, everybody. Hey. Archon with the bromance blur, dude. It feels like a little laggy right now. Oh, now it just popped up. That's real laggy. Something's up. Something's up. It is what it is. It'll sort itself out, sure. All right, everybody. But check it out. Here we are. Here we are. Here is the farm that we are working on starting from scratch. Got some lime down there. What are all those rocks still doing up, dude? Didn't they rule the land? I thought the rulers put all them rocks back in the earth. Hold up. Hold up. I already forgot how to do this. I already forgot how to do this. I think it's on the map. Farmland. There we go. There we go. Yeah, there's a few stones. So the dude didn't do a very good job. He didn't do a very good job. That's the problem. It's all good. It is what it is. Yeah, bro. I've been meaning to catch a stream, but today I'm finding out we're on two different time zones. It's eight for you right now? Got it. What's that? Yeah, it's 454 for me right now, bro. Damn, where are you from, dude? Look at all them rocks. Oh my gosh, dude. Okay, it is what it is. We might take a little bit of a harvest loss, but that is what it is. Let's check out some of these contracts real quick. We're going to get this going. So here's a cultivating for 5,000 bucks. We're going to get this one going right here. We're going to borrow the items, too, because that's the way to do it, in my opinion. Tired. Still working. You're still working, Archon? You on a break or something? Or you're just working overtime, dude? Blizzard, 33 at 6.55 where you're at, Blizzard? Welcome in, Blizzard. So today, Archon, we're just going to try to keep making money, dude. Hopefully we can... This crop will start growing a little bit. I didn't put the seed down. I didn't put the seed down. That's what we got to do. Which one was the seed? Wait, did I put the seed down? Hold on here. I think we did put the seed down. Yeah, we did. Never mind. We're good. Shit, now I'm second-guessing myself. How do you check? Oh, no. Oh, no. Growing. Okay, we're good. We're golden. We got this, guys. It is growing. So let's go get this worker up and running. No. Finishing my reports. I'm behind. I need to have them done. Dang. Yeah. Archon, if you can't stick around, bro, I completely freaking understand, dude. I do not want to be the reason why you are even more behind, bro. I will tell you what, though, dude. You are, like, hands down the best mod. You're the best mod out there, bro. I appreciate you, bro. Okay. Okay. So where do we got to go? We have to go to 23. 23. So we got to go right. Take this road for a long time. Hmm. And then make another right and get up to 23. All right. We're good. I know where we're at. I say that now, but you know what, dude? Probably going to end up getting lost again. Hey, what's up, Heavy Chevy? Welcome in, dude. Hey, man. How's it going? It's going good, bro. How about yourself? Welcome to the stream, bro. We're getting down with some Farming Simulator 25 today, guys. Continuing the Starting From Scratch series where we will be building a farm. I started off with no money. I had no money at all. Now we have $121,000. I did add a mod to it, though, a financing mod. So we did, you know, kind of cheat the system a little bit, I guess. But not really. It made it more realistic. Stray Bullet. Hey, what's up, Stray Bullet? Welcome in. Good to see you. Hey, hold up. Hold up. I'm getting gifs over here on TikTok. I appreciate you guys. I can't see nothing. Thank you for the rose. I appreciate that. Hopefully TikTok doesn't get up again today. No, I'm always doing my work while I watch you. Thank you. I try to be. Well, I appreciate you, Archon. I appreciate you. And today we're not going to almost get hit by a train. I promise. I promise. It ain't going to happen. What are you just... What are just some of the games you play? Stream. You know, I stream a whole bunch. But lately I have three games that I'm cycling between right now. And I'm doing like series on them. So obviously I'm doing Farming Simulator 25. Hold up. Am I lost already? Now we're good. So right now I'm doing Farming Simulator 25. I do that on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Basically we're just... It's a series where I started from scratch. I have no experience with this game. I've never played any one of these games. And we're going to try to build a $5 million farm. And then Mondays... Mondays and Saturdays are Drive Beyond Horizons. And we're just... We're towing a car during that series. And I'm trying to rebuild every single one of those vehicles. All the vehicles in the game. You know, in one long drive. And then for... Sunday... I play Car Dealer Simulator, dude. And that goal is basically build a $10 million car business. That's going to consist of nothing but muscle cars and sports cars. And after I'm done with one of those games, I'm going to move on. I'm thinking about Ranch Simulator next. Or possibly My Garage. Which I'm having a big, big feeling this is going to be My Garage. Because that game is... That game is actually really fun. It's actually really fun. And... I'm good. Helping with bricks. I was watching the other streams of Drive Beyond. Kind of in silence. Hard to chat on the forklifts. I hear it, dude. I hear it. I do warehouse work myself, man. I'm actually... I train people on forklifts now, dude. I used to be the guy who used to operate them all the time. I still operate them occasionally. But now I'm a trainer, bro. He's supposed to play Hello Kitty Island. Oh yeah, that's right. People freaking voted on a poll on that. Oh, Archon, I forgot. I'm going to have to freaking honor that, dude. Yep, guys. I'm going to have to play Hello Kitty Island. You guys are going to have to bear with me on that one. That was you, huh, Archon? You made that ridiculous poll. Never have 3,000 sheep because you're constantly feeding them. I did it yesterday. 3,000 sheep stray bullet? Dang. How much land do I have? I barely have any land. Whoop. I had to replace the pen down. Dang. That's insane. Maybe. All right. What other contracts do we got going on here? There's a fertilizing one. Ain't going to mess with any of that stuff. Spinach. Red beet spinach. I don't want to mess with the beets, dude. I'm not skilled for the beets. So there's really not that many contracts going on. So what the hell can I do in the process? In this area, there is a problem with Deadwood. Help the owner and cut down all dead trees. Each tree is already marked. You can sell them afterwards. Oh, man. But see, the thing is, is how... I'm going to give this a shot, guys. I'm going to give this a shot. See what happens. We'll try Deadwood. What do you guys think? Should we do Deadwood? No, hey, I love cars, too. My dad owns a big company of auto body shops, but it's just car-related games. For the most part, I guess you would say that. It just really depends on how I'm feeling, because right now, I've been playing a lot of simulator games. I'm having a blast playing the simulator games, but there could be a time where I actually go back to RPGs, because I do love RPGs, too. Hey, what's up, Justin? Welcome in, dude. I'm not going to be able to be in chat. I'm pulling weeds, and it's flooded. Dude, not a problem, Justin. Not a problem. I appreciate you lurking, at least, man. And welcome back in, bro. My trainee quit. Said it was too hard. This is a very easy job. That's how it goes, man. That's how it goes. All right, we're going to do this, guys. We're going to do the farmland. Is Drive Beyond Horizons free? Brayden, no. Unfortunately, Drive Beyond Horizons is not free. I mean, the demo's free. You can play the demo to test it out. Hey, what's up, Ivy? Welcome in. Yes, Deadwood. All right, let's do it. Borrow items. Borrow items. Let's go. Dude, we're doing this one by ourselves. Whoops. I have no idea how to use this thing. I have no idea how to use this thing. So we got to go all the way to 86 down there. Where that blades at right there. So we got to go left. All right, let's go. Let's go. This thing is slow. This thing is slow as molasses, everybody. What is going on here? It's going to take forever to get there. Spiofi, just a reminder, you should probably update the streaming schedule on Twitch. It's not updated? Oh my gosh. Thanks for that, Spiofi. I got to do that for sure, bro. Is it easy, Ivy? Thank goodness. I was unsure. I was unsure. I'm so happy you just joined the stream. I appreciate it, Ivy. Pro level right there, everybody. Ivy is pro level. What do you do for work outside the stream, right? Yeah, I work full time, unfortunately, man. I'm trying to make this a living. But I do. I've been working in the same warehouse for about 12 years now, dude. I'm an operations manager at a warehouse. But yeah, I work 40 plus hours a week. Got a wife and a daughter. I spio him this stream for about two hours. Because I've got to make room for my family, you guys. You know what I'm saying? But I also, I believe in the dream. I believe in the vision. My wife supports me. So I'm going after it 100%. Miss you on Sunday. Not a problem, Ivy. It's not a problem at all. I think you went back and watched a little bit of the live, though, didn't you? Because you were talking about it a little bit. Or you missed... On Sunday, Sunday I was playing Car Dealer Simulator. So he didn't miss Farming Simulator. Driver, we're getting down here. Slowly but surely, we will make our way to the Deadwood. Hey, what's up, Bearded Magpie? Welcome in, dude. It's good to see you. It's back to lurking for me. I'll still be here. Alright, man. I appreciate it, Heavy Shabby. Thank you for the lurk, dude. Thank you for the lurk. And be safe on that forklift, bro. Be safe on that forklift. Hey, Captain Redbeard. What's up, man? Welcome in, dude. Welcome in. We are continuing the starting from scratch series. Hey, dude. That person thought I was too slow. I can't believe they actually do that in this game, dude. They'll just go past you. That person is speeding. That person has somewhere to be right now. Oh, my gosh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm driving off the road. Sorry. Sorry, van. Hey, that kind of looks like the van that I sold in Car Dealer Simulator. Except it's red. You guys, I'm thinking about painting a red van in Car Dealer Simulator now. Heck yeah, brother. I saw your content. I'm driving entertaining. I knew I wanted to come watch for a few free hours. I do enjoy your stuff. I appreciate you, man. I appreciate you. Welcome in, like I said before, bro. Like I said before. This looks sick. Dude, Captain Redbeard, this game is a really good game, bro. Like, I was very skeptical about it when I first started it up. But once you get into it, man, there's a lot to it. It's a little overwhelming at first, man. I'm still kind of overwhelmed, but you know what? I'm having a good time with it. We're going to get that $10 million farm. That's the bottom line. I'm going to make it happen. I have, like, no idea how any of this stuff worked either. The great game hog. I had to rent a server with G portal to save a 16x farm. Did you? Dang, dude. You could have the AI drive there while you do something else. You could do that, Ivy? How the hell do you do that? Oh, my gosh. I'm still learning something new every day. Justin Weaver. I appreciate it, Justin. It's a good hat right here, dude. Freaking good old Bass Pro Shop Pro member status right there. All right. I'm going to go now. Y'all have a good day and night. All right, Spiro Feet. Dude, have, you know, sleep well. Get some good rest, bro. And I appreciate you stopping by and saying what's up, dude. It's 1 a.m. It's 1 a.m., but too thick. Aw, man, bearded magpie. That sucks, bro. Okay, how am I supposed to get this? What tree is it? I just see a green dot on the map. I should probably go and freaking... You probably create Jabra AI to get their, like, GPS. I don't know. I don't know. I just learned how to turn the game on this year. Nah, it's a map feature. It's a map feature. What do you mean, Ivy? What do you mean? See if you'd come on Sundays. Oh, yeah. My bad. My bad. I didn't even think about that, Ivy. I didn't even think about that. How am I supposed to do this? If you select the vehicle, you can pick the destination. Okay. Okay. What, do I got to take out all these trees or something? I'm so confused with this. Now, there's no... The AI won't do this, huh? I'm gonna start chopping down all these trees. I think it might be this tree right here. I think it might be this tree right here. Alright, let's do this. Turn this baby on. Alright, look at that. Look at that. Look at that. Oh, you gotta control it. Okay. How do you open that thing up? Only cut the ones that are dead and have X marks on them. Oh. Hold up here. We gotta get out. The ones that are dead that have X marks on them. Okay, let's look. Oh, there's one right there. There's one right there. Is it just gonna be that one, maybe? Oh, there's one right there, too. One, two. Three. Alright, let's do this. Let's get it. I appreciate that. Florida. Florida. Hey, what's up? TG, welcome in. Oh, my gosh, dude. It is crazy driving like this, guys. How are you supposed to drive this thing? Is this one dead right here? So, I believe this was one of them for sure. So, we're just gonna go straight ahead. Alright, let's do this. That's neat. I was wrong. It's all good. It's all good. The great game hog. I can't see. I gotta drive like this. Alright, let's get this, baby. Let's cut her down. Release tree. Let's get this. I can't see. I can't see. I can't see. I can't see. I can't see. I can't see. Release tree, turn off How do you raise it? Oh my gosh, I think I screwed this up, huh? You probably start from the top The contract tells you how many there are I like how the game punishes you for knocking down the wrong trees Does it really, Chris? Oh my gosh, I gotta be careful I just wanna say, I love your videos I appreciate it, TG I appreciate it Alright, we probably got to bust out a chainsaw for that baby right there Alright, let's go find another one There's one right here, too I'm gonna start from the top As far as I can go, I guess Nah, it's not gonna work Let's just get straight from the bottom I'm gonna have to chop this thing up into pieces With a freaking chainsaw, guys And I'm gonna have to bring my truck over here, too Yeah, it dings you like 500 bucks for every wrong tree Oh my gosh Get down, tree Get down So Ivy says It says in the contract how many trees there are So we got There's 10 trees There's freaking 10 trees, you guys You gotta be No way No way, dude Oh my gosh Guys, we're gonna be here forever We're gonna be here forever I gotta make sure this is one of the trees Alright, that's one of them Oh my gosh, guys 10 freaking trees Those machines you are supposed to What?

Off the topic, but did you put... Did you get rid of the Pontiac? I did not, Johnny Farms. I did not. I actually do have to... Because I do separate videos for the cars that I fully restore.

Hey! Not your hometown hero with a gifted sub. I appreciate you, Not Your Hometown Hero. Thank you for that, dude. Alright. Where's my amp? Gotta pull her up. Now I don't know if any of you guys are musicians and you guys own a PC or anything. I'm gonna show you guys this amp real quick. I'm not sponsored by these guys by any means at all. It's just something that is a really amazing amp. This thing right here is a built-in plug-in that you can use without having a digital audio workshop. You just buy the amp, you plug it in. It's from STL Tones, the Andy James. It has a bunch of good stuff on it, dude. It has like three different amps you can choose from. It has a bunch of pedals. It has effects. It's a really, really good amp. And it sounds great too. You guys hear that? I'm a drummer heavy Chevy. You're a drummer heavy Chevy? Heck yeah, dude. I tried playing drums, bro. I don't got it in me. What about now? Mr. Stone Cold Steve Austin over here... I know, Troy. I know, dude. I don't know why I say that. It's just a thing now, man. It's super quiet. What about this? Why are you playing drums? It's like a human being. What about now? Mr. Stone Cold Steve Austin over here. I know, Troy. I know, dude. I don't know why I say that. It's just a thing now, man. It's super quiet. It wasn't even turned on. What about now? You guys hear that? All right. I'm going to shut this thing off. I'm going to shut this thing off. All right, Gropey. There you go, man. I appreciate it, bro. I appreciate it, dude. Thank you, Frank. I appreciate it, man. It sounds amazing. Jacob, I appreciate you guys, dude. Troy, by the way, I got a free STL thing for my Focusrite interface. He gave me some EVH stuff for free. Hell yeah, dude. That's amazing. The Andy James one. I wanted to get the freaking Jason Richardson one. Jason Richardson is my favorite guitar player, guys. That guy shreds, man. I just recently bought a Beat Pad and Triggers for my double kick. I'm obsessed, bro. Hell yeah, dude. Yeah, the double. Oh, my gosh, man. Double bass is amazing. I think I would have to say my two favorite drummers. I'm not really a drummer, but the two drummers that stand out the most to me, you know, freaking Jimmy Sullivan from Revenge Sevenfold, man. That guy was brilliant. Brilliant. Rest in peace, brother. God bless your soul, dude. And then the drummer for All That Remains. The drummer for All That Remains is freaking amazing. Amazing. All right, guys, but we're going to get back into this game. Horns out for the Rev. 100% Troy, 100%. He's still one of my favorite guitar players of all time, dude. That's the bottom line. Both hands are amazing. Both bands are great, great, great bands. Except I'm not really feeling of Ensemble's new album, guys. I don't know. I don't know about that one. My brother-in-law bought it. We listened to it when we were on our way to Disneyland. Dude, I don't know about that one. I play a mean air guitar. Do you, Augie? Ain't nothing wrong with that, bro. That's where I started, dude. That's where I started right there. The drummer who looks like Will Ferrell. Oh, dude, I think I know what you're talking about. The drummer for Will Ferrell, who looks like Will Ferrell. Man, what band was he in? Dude, why can't I think of it right now? You guys, you guys know who he is, right? Not a drummer, but Chester Bennington was amazing. Chester Bennington was, he's still one of my favorite vocalists, dude. He's a great guitar, a great singer, great singer. Yeah, Red Hot Chili Peppers. That's who it was. He's in the Red Hot Chili Peppers, bro. He does, he looks just like Will Ferrell. It's a trip. I didn't even know Will Ferrell can play the drums, dude, until I watched a video of them both playing together, bro. Okay, let's chop down another tree and make this thing land inside the back of this truck, because that's a nice way to make a little bit of profit right there. I don't know if we should go for another big tree. Should we go for another big tree? Or should we go for a smaller one? I took my double kit from like 65 BPM to 135 BPM, which is absurd, and his name is Chad Smith, but the one I'm trying to learn is technique, is from Sleep Token. Sleep Token, that's another good man right there. Go for all the trees close to the plant. Okay, you're right. So I definitely gotta take that big one down so I can push that back. a little bit more. Alright, we're gonna give this another shot, guys. Hopefully we can pull it off. Sleep Token is a great man. 100% dude. It grows on you. I respect it, but they just do what they want. Nobody is epic that Solo is. I appreciate it, Troy. Nope, he might not. Minus. Hello. What's up, babe? Welcome in. Welcome to the stream, wife. Baby, wanna see something cool? Wanna see something cool? Augie taught me that you can chop these trees down, and they can land in the back of your truck, and if you jump in at the exact time, the right time, and click L, you can strap it in without even having to chop it into pieces. I might get a lot of money for this one. This is like a double tree right here, guys. Let's give this a shot. Let's see if we can pull this off again. This time, I might freaking open up the L gate of my truck real quick. Let's see if we can land her in there. Let's see if we can land her in there. I've been trying better the speed of my right leg. I had surgery on it like a year ago, and I'm finally starting to get it full control. That's good, man. That's good. I feel like drumming could help that. I feel like drumming's kind of like therapy for that, dude. You're working the muscles for sure. I think he's at about 140. Yeah, I think I... Yeah, 148. I got 148. If we get to 200 subs over here, I will eat the world's hottest chocolate bar, everybody. All right, but let's try to chop this thing down. Hell, a nice update. It is tweeter sin. It is.

Not your hometown here with the pride roar. Hold up, guys. Read chat. Wrench a tree cutter machine and drag the tree.

But that is so far away dude I don't know if I'm gonna be able to make it over there But I feel like there's nothing but fields over there Yeah by the farm 57 the bridge is uncovered By farm 57 We might be able to make it all the way around there Let's find out Yeah train bridge might work Let's buy 57 Okay Let's go check it out Go to your store What do you mean Demata go to my store? Do I have a store? Hey what's up Brad Ork How you doing man? We're just lugging this freaking tree through the You know the fields of all the other farmers Because we're gonna try to sell it in one big piece Doesn't seem to be working very good We got stuck in a bridge for about 30 minutes Demon is trying to Get you to check out the sawmill Like where you purchase things in game Yeah that's what we're trying to get to You're talking about that store over here right? The warehouse right here? Big brain moves He's trying to But the tree is bigger Yeah the tree is bigger than the bridge That's the problem That's the problem We tried to go through the bridge And we got stuck For like 30 minutes If we can't get through this guys I think it's the person that ditched the tree There's no way we're getting through here There's absolutely no way we're getting through here Alright guys I think it's time for us to cut our losses We tried We tried for over half an hour It means the store you build things on your farm Same way you place barns No there's a key bind to pull up the store You're talking about This? We could sell stuff from here? No No No buy the sawmill Okay so let's go back home real quick If we can freaking make it home Okay so let's find this place on the map real quick Which you guys are trying to talk about The sawmill by the house So here's my home right there There's a cement factory A dredging Actually if he presses the construction tab I bet that would pull it up Without needing to know the key bind You were doing better cutting deadwood I think so Elite J Is it in the construction tab? So what am I looking for exactly? Hey what's up lioness? How you doing babe? Second item down What am I looking for? There's a Bakery Carpentry Cement factory Dairy Cereal In there There's a sawmill You can build On your farm For cheap Sawmill Is 300,000 bucks Is there a cheaper one or something? Spinery Preserved Carpentry Grain Sawmill $36,000 Take goods Transfer them Into different products That's it That's it Okay I see what you guys are saying now Okay We're gonna go back to the house We can't lose this tree Can't lose this tree We've worked too hard on this thing So the sawmill Is that another good way to make money? Like is it Can you make some good money doing that? Or firewood Try the train bridge You have nothing to lose Taz We're gonna go back to The house And we're gonna buy the sawmill And just turn this into a bunch of planks Chill out with next sir Are you a tree? We are dragging a tree bro I feel like I don't know if you guys have ever seen Lord of the Rings before You know You're like an ant That's what I feel like We look like a freaking ant right now It's a long story It's an extremely long story Fake smiles We got stuck on a bridge For about 30 minutes dude And I just found out Actually I think I was told before You can get a sawmill But I didn't click it together Until you know I was walked through the steps Of getting it And now we're gonna take this Try to take this thing back home Where we originally got it from And I'm gonna purchase the sawmill Hopefully we can freaking get home Hopefully we can get home There's gotta be a way We just gotta wrap around These telephone poles Currently in 5th place Are we babe? Hell yeah Timon you can definitely wear Frank yes Oh we've got this We've got this We've got this We've got this We've got this dude We've got this Let's wrap around the poles We should be pro level At this by now Oh this one's gonna be tricky This one's gonna be real tricky Oh Oh look at that Look at that Look at that We're getting closer We're getting closer I don't think I took this route Last time guys I might I might screw myself somewhere Yeah there ain't no way There ain't no way Alright guys I think we're just gonna Drop her off right here I think that's gonna have to Do it for this tree This tree is no more Um We're gonna go buy the sawmill And we're gonna do this A good old proper way Goodbye tree Oh my gosh sir I'm sorry I put that on his shed He's gonna have no idea What happened He's gonna blame the aliens Everybody It was the aliens Long as it's not Isn't blocking a road Exactly Exactly Fake smiles Exactly At this point You can't process that tree You need to keep it As a trophy For all your trouble Well there we go Every time we We drive by What is that Lot number one We will know That is the tree That got away But it's okay It's okay We're going to get the sawmill Right here right now I wouldn't have any contracts I could've done right now dude How much money I'd have Was to waste Trying to freaking Take a tree Across the bridge But where are we gonna Put the sawmill That's the That's the question That's the question Let's say If I all have more trees And rent them Like that I'd like to admit All trees that I just couldn't get Out of my field You can make like A tree And get out of Here Where can we put This thing That's the question First of all We're gonna have to See how big it is Okay Let's check it out Shift P Sawmill No Not the sugar mill Not the sugar mill Sawmill Oh dude That thing's tiny Bro I could just put This thing like Right here Okay But here's the question Should it be facing A specific direction The iron liner When you are in Construction mode And placing a building If you Push B It will override The placement limit So you can build Really Even if there's trees In the way Oh my gosh Okay We only sold Uh One Upsetting We only sold One Next time I see him As a tree car I'll be rooting For him I appreciate it Chill out with Mac I appreciate you bro I don't remember Where the drop point is Damn Okay Can you see it From here maybe Should it even matter Cause I feel like I need to place it Like right here That should be good Hey Chill out with Mac I appreciate the follow Dude Thank you for the follow The wheelbarrow icon Is where you'll need To drop the tree The wheelbarrow icon Is where you'll need To drop the tree Okay So this Probably be my best bet What if I just place This right here Next to this tree And then just chop You know It's already on The The wheelbarrow side And then I can just Get all this wood Right here Right now Yes right there Okay Let's put it right here Let's do this Here we go It won't It won't work upsetting Why not I'm hyped for the Scotland map The new edition of Farming fish is my calling I'm gonna have to Check that out Freaking Scotland map Sounds awesome The game will glitch It'll glitch out Okay let's not do that Is right here better We're just gonna put it Right here This makes the most sense Do it there Okay There she is We got her Look at that Dude I got a freaking Sawmill now Alright Alright What If I drive over my Property It's not gonna do anything Is it No we're good We're good Okay Let's try to Chop down this little tree First Like Will I be able to make Anything out of this Little tiny tree Right there You probably have Drop Drop damage off Oh really Okay That's good Can you even chop This thing down Turning trees into Sweet Sweet toilet paper Separating those From nature You can chop it down Okay I don't think You can cut that Right here Right here We gotta be quick E-L E-L This shit is Landed right in the Back of my truck Though Will it Oh man Oh man Can I pick these Things up though They seem pretty White Just disappeared Huh So you can't Make anything Out of that Stuff Well let's Clean it up Anyways You can pick up The small ones We just have to Clear like a little Driving area Go to the Wrench Recipe Storing It went into The inventory You have to Access the mill To turn it into Things Oh So I don't Believe I have Enough wood Though Do I How can you Tell incoming Materials There's planks Inactive Cycles per Month It went into Alright Alright cool So it's in the Inventory That's very Interesting dude That is Freaking Awesome As I can pick up How do you get rid Of all this Stuff Does it Does it matter What What he makes If he's Making it For dust Are the Options Mostly just For when you Need a certain Type of wood For building Projects That's a good Question That's a good Question I can't pick up Any of that Stuff But can I pick up Any of these Logs I can't I can pick up This baby right Here Let's go Let's go Okay so we Can get rid Of this Tree Now Since it's Right here Dude Perfect Perfect We just gotta Chop it up Into little Pieces And then So once I Start making These planks Where do you Go to sell Them The carpentry I'm assuming I'm assuming It's probably The only place Bro Grouch Wind Cutting Trees Got it Wood type Doesn't matter For special Projects No Cause I Want to Build my Own house Eventually Dude No The playground Pays the Best Until you Build it Okay so the Playground Pays the Best Man Man I Should've Listened to You guys From the Start Dude I Should've Just you Know Set my Pride Side Thought I Thought I Can Freaking Pull This Off Dude But Didn't Do It Very Well Didn't Do It Very Well But You Know What We Got a Sawmill Out of It Thanks To You Guys I Appreciate It Man We Got a Sawmill On The Ranch We're Gonna Start Making Bank Now I Hope Remember 300 Hours Yeah 300 Hours Dude That That's Some Good Hours Right There If you Teleport To The Playground Bottom Left Corner Of The Map It Will Tell You When You Need To Complete The Certain Phase It Pays A Hefty Premium If You Deliver Anything On The List Okay Cool And Those Are Things That I That I Have To Build What Here Oh Dude Oh Dude It Looks Awesome Yeah The Playground Is All Carpentry And Sawmill Stuff Got It Got It So We're Going To Go Visit It See If I Can Make Anything After I Put Some Of These Trees Up Inside Of Here Or Parts Of Trees Up Inside Of Here We Are Going To Go To The Playground See What's Up You Can Use Small Pieces Of Wood To Move Big Ones Oh Can You Oh Oh Oh I Think I Can Pick That Up No I Can't Move Your Truck Over There Augie Augie You're Genius Dude I'm Just Doing This The Hard Way I'm Just Doing This The Hard Way Because I Think You Can Drive Right Through It Huh Oh My Gosh Oh My Gosh All right There We Go We're Just Going To Throw Everything Up Inside Of There I Got You Bro Yep This Is How We're Going To Do Guys This Is How We're Going To Do 100% Fair Enough I Got Into 22 Pretty Late When 25 Was Already In The Making Just Played It With My Little Brother Mostly They're They're Good Games Dude I'm Very Impressed With This Game I I Had No Idea There Was That This Much To Them I Really Didn't You Can Also Get A Winch For Your Tractors And Drag Entire Trees With Them Okay I Need To Get A Winch Or You Know I Could Just Drop It Into The Back Of My Truck With The Good Old Fashioned Way Yeah You Could But With The Winch You Could Drag Like Four Trees Four Five Trees At A Time Oh Dude Oh Crap I Didn't Mean To Throw That Thing Where To Go Ah Since We're Right Here Only Reason I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I'm I'm I'm not Familiar With This Game At All Really Dude I I Literally Just The Only Mod The Crazy Mod I Have In This Game Is The Financing Mod Which Came In Handy It Came In Handy Dude All Right All Right Okay Let's Go Drive It Over There Beautiful What Do We Got Right Now Let's Check We Got Quite A Bit Of Wood Now Got Quite A Bit Of Wood Okay So Let's Go To The School Where Exactly Is The School Playground Bottom Left Left Corner Of The Map Visit Playground Alright So We Just Gotta Go To The Wrench Wood Beams Planks Rope And I Have $30ских To Project Champs COS That's $24 I H No, I don't want to buy it. No. That list is just for the current phase. Every construction phase project has four A phases where the materials change but it pays really good. Okay. So obviously required materials for next step. That's the phase. Wood beams, long planks and rope. No, get out of there. So planks long. Okay. So wood beams, long plank. So I click on it and just click activate, I'm assuming. Running. Cycles per month. Cost per month, 48 bucks a month. How many hours are in a day on this game? Does it only get dark when you sleep? You could, you could change it. So right now, um, there's like a couple of settings. So check it out. Watch. You go over here to the settings and it shows timescale to the speed at which the time passes in the day. You can go up to, to like 10 and to go 30 and it goes really fast. I'm at two. So it's pretty slow. Only because I'm trying to get as much done in the day as I can. Yeah. So I'm not buying. There are no mods. Can range anywhere from a day night cycle between 20 minutes. I'll wait a real time. You can go to 360 times speed. Oh my gosh. Real time is wild. Heck yeah. Demonic. King of trucks. You have kind of trucks. You have, I only have this truck, dude. That's my only baby right there. Why don't I feel like she's all scratched up and beat up? Is she okay? I cannot believe she's barely damaged from everything we just put her through guys. Everything we put her through. She's still freaking holding strong, dude. How long do I got to wait for this freaking wood? Can I do more? Can I activate wood beams too? Oh, you can. Wood beams and plank. That's awesome. How do you make rope? Probably dirty. Watch renting a server for this game. I'm going to take the server for form similar 25 and then change the form similar 22. I'll have to go through support if you want it back. Dang, dude. It produces continually as long as you feed it wood. Just give it time. Come back tomorrow and there will be a bunch. Got it. Got it. Spinnery is how you make wood. That makes sense. Okay, what do we got to do now? Let's check some contracts real quick. Let's check some of them contracts. Cultivating. Oh, we got some good contracts right here. Guys, let's go get some of this stuff done. All that time we wasted. We got to catch up. We got to catch up. Some more cultivating right there. 4,000 bucks. Okay, it's been fun. Have a beautiful evening. All right, you too, Ivy. Thanks for stopping by. I appreciate it. Sure you don't want to do another... No, I don't, Chris. I do not. Knock, knock. What's up? What's up, babe? Are you here right now? No. Harvesting cotton? I'm scared to harvest anything, guys. Is cotton easy to harvest? That's 15,000 bucks. We got the stone picking one. We can have them do the stone picking, too. That's what we're going to do. Fairly. Divine Hope fairly. So for 15,000 bucks, it's probably a big plot of land, huh? Let's go check it out. That is a huge plot of land. We might have to hold off on that one. I'm nervous. That gets me nervous. We'll do the stone picking one, though. 61, we'll have a worker take care of it. All right, let's go. Let's go put these people to work real quick. Move on with our lives. Yeah, but rent the equipment. Okay, we'll deal with that one after this one. After one of these contracts. Because that's nerve-wracking, dude. That gets me a little nervous. You just use a cotton harvester and then a trailer. It's easy if you rent. Okay, got it. Maybe I can go give it a shot myself. Damn, I didn't mean to do that. Rent the equipment and have AI do it. Cotton harvests just aren't very big, so it takes a while. Okay. What land do I need to be for this one? Because what are we doing right now? This one's obviously the bigger land. So we're going to 50. Where's 50 at? It's not too far away. Let's get there. Let's get there. Man, dude. I'm just freaking traumatized from that whole tree experience, everybody. Holy crap. 15 grand is pretty good. That is really good to monet. But it's scary, dude. It's so scary. Because it's so big. And last time I did a harvesting one, it was bees. And I could not help the AI at all. I could not help the AI at all, dude. I feel bad for that freaking AI worker, dude. Blocking them off. I was cutting them off. I was yelling at them. It was my fault the whole time. Don't do beets or potatoes. That's what I keep hearing. Don't do beets or potatoes. I'll never do beets again, dude. That experience was brutal. That was a brutal experience. I'm just going straight up the long way, guys. I missed the road. It doesn't matter. I hear potatoes are really bad, demonic. I'm just along with the ride. Got to reflect on my thoughts out here. Out here in the woods, man. It's beautiful farmland over here. All the veggies are brutal. I usually just stick to grains because they are easy. And you can get massive combines. Okay. But cod's just, it's a slow process. Beets were trash in Farming Simulator 22. Why do I only have $94,000? Oh, yeah. I bought the sawmill. I was tripping out for a second, everybody. I was tripping out for a second. Trust me. I know. I've experimented with most of the crops before settling on corn and cotton as my main. Okay. So, cotton is a good one, then. I'm going to take that cotton's pretty good. So, if you stick to wheat and grass, you can feed chickens, sheep, and cows without needing to buy any food. That's what I keep hearing, too. And I hear, like, um, because I got a beller that gives me, like, little bells of, like, straw. I could feed those to the cows, too, right? Because I do plan on getting some livestock at some point. I'd say I ain't ready for that yet. We need to buy another plot of land first. Straws for bedding. Okay. Makes sense. Cotton is good, but very time-consuming. Is it worth as much? Okay. So, I might not do the cotton if it's, because if it's that time-consuming, I don't know, dude. Grass, hay is food. Unless I just have AI do it. Unless I just have the AI do it. And I'll transport it, obviously. All right, AI. I need your help. I need your help working to take care of this land for me. All right, let's go pick up the next piece of equipment here. And this right here is for them rocks. You can feed straws to cows, but it's not ideal. It's better to give them hay, which you make from grass. Got it. And for this, don't wait, what? So, this is that 61. So, same thing. I just got to go straight and then right. Okay. The process of turning the cotton into fabric closes the same as the sawmill. You just need to put the cotton in the production building and it automatically gets churned into fabric like wood. Okay. I believe cows don't produce manure without straw in here either. Okay. Man, there's just, there's so much to this game, dude. There's so much to this game. All the manufacturing in this game is freaking just overwhelming, dude. But we are, we are going to make it happen. I'm going to freaking make this $5 million farm, dude. That's the bottom line. That's the bottom line, everybody. Grass is silage and we wear as hay. Got it. I appreciate it, babe. Thank you for that. Or just, I believe cows don't produce, oh, I already read that. Lots of micromanaging to do and say the least and keeping track of profits. Definitely, dude. You know, and if you're anything like me, lots of freaking dragon full trees through the city. Ain't doing that. Ain't doing that ever again, dude. We got a sawmill now. We got a sawmill now, dude. Don't worry, I'm still here lurking in the depths. I appreciate it, Heavy Chevy. Yeah, sexy beard. Thanks, Archon. Thanks, man. Orison, I'm in the middle of growing to 3,500 cows. Wish me luck. Good luck, bro. Good luck. Look at all them rocks. I feel sorry for this worker right now. Take over, kind. Or ma'am. Take over, ma'am. I think I might have screwed myself. On six. I need to cultivate it. Prepare the field for sowing by cultivating it. Do I have a cultivator? Do I have a cultivator? That weeding thing, that's the cultivator, right? Okay. No, that's a weeder. Okay. Well, I don't have a cultivator. I screwed myself on contract number six. Damn it. And you also have a plow, but not a cultivator. Got it. Might have to cancel that contract. Yeah, I freaking botched that one up. Cultivators are cheap, though. You can get them for like 10K for small ones. We could go check it out. Maybe there's something on sale by chance. Trying to... No. No. All right, let's go check it out. Let's find a cultivator real quick. Let's see what prices we're looking at. Cultivator. There's one for 9,000 bucks. All right, we're just going to buy it. Have a worker take care of it for us. It's a small little lot. This should be fine. This should be fine. When you're ending the stream. Pretty soon. Upsetting. Pretty soon. We're not going to finance it. We're just going to buy it straight out. Okay, we're going to pick it up with one of our trackers. Which one? What I need to check. I forgot to check. How do you check all your equipment? Escape graph icon vehicles tab. Okay. I'm looking at all the wrong spots. Owned. Available. We're at vehicles. There we go. Okay. So where's that other tractor at? This one. Okay, so this one is... 70 horsepower. Okay. That thing needs... Yeah, 110 horsepower. So we can't use that. We have to use the Voltra. We're going to have to use that Voltra. Let's go get her. No. Get out of there. Probably drop this roller real quick. Okay. That's the worst spot I could have parked my shed. Parked. Built my shed. Has anyone made lion stuff for this stream yet? Any bugs or beans? No, but we did get our first membership over on YouTube. That's why I ate a bean. Chris the Canadian. Second from the bottom. What's up, Nick? No fixing rusty cars tonight? Not tonight, Kieran. Not tonight. We are getting our farm going, dude. Welcome in, dude. And Conor. Welcome in, Conor. I'm sorry. I didn't see you guys. I am on Twitch, Conor. I am on Twitch. Twitch? Damn, dude. I can't even speak right now. Where we at? Or mom's house. Okay, so we're going to go pick this baby up. Where's lot number six? So it's going to be... Oh, it's right down there. It's real close. Man, none of those contracts are even close to being done either. All right, there we go. There we go. Look at that. We got our very first cultivator. We need to get another shed at some point. Okay, so we're going to just cut through this little field right here. Uh, it's probably... It looks like a freaking cliff almost. Yeah, we ain't doing that. We're just going to take the road. We're going to take the road. We're going to be safe. All right. All right. Now we can get the AI to take care of it for us. With our own equipment. We got our own cultivator now, everybody. Hell yeah. Sausage and pepperoni and salmon. All right, baby. That sounds delicious. That sounds delicious. All right. There we go. Everybody is working. Everybody is working. And we are out here with our property. It's coming along, everybody. The farm is definitely coming along. All right. But... I do have to end the stream, everybody. I do have to end the stream. We've been streaming for over an hour than normal, actually. Three hours, dude. I'm curious. Did you ever use a stump remover to get rid of the stumps from the trees? I did not, dude. I don't even... I don't have a stump remover, man. I got to buy one of those, too. You know the AI costs money. I do. I'm setting. I know they cost money. They're worth the price. They're worth the price, 100%. But everybody over on TikTok, I appreciate you guys all stopping by. I will catch you all... Thursday, guys. Because I don't stream on Wednesdays anymore, everybody. I do not stream on Wednesdays anymore. Then everybody over here on the good old...
