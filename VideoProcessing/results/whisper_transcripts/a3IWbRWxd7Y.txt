Howto & Style
 We recently asked some of our Facebook friends what their least favorite garden chore was, and by far the majority of them said weeding. Now, I gotta be honest with you, I find weeding to be a little bit cathartic at times. Of course, after a few minutes of doing it, I'm ready to quit. But regardless, what I thought I would do is talk to you about one of our favorite hand-held weeding tools, and that is the Ho-Matic Ho. Now, as you can see, this has gotten a lot of use. This is what we use out at our farm. Our farm is certified organic, and so there's a lot of hand weeding that needs to happen. Now, we have machinery that can be attached to the back of our tractors, that can get in between some of the rows, but when it comes to getting in between the plants that are in the row, a lot of times we have to use a hand-held tool. Now, the Ho-Matic here has two sides to it. You can see it has a fork side and then a solid blade. Super easy to use, very, very durable, and very, very effective at getting the wheat. So, it's always nice to have a sharp tool when you're weeding, and so I'm going to take my Speedy Sharp really quick and just do a few swipes to get it nice and sharp, and I am ready to start weeding. Now, it's pretty plain and simple as far as using the straight edge. So, just grab the weeds, cut them as low as you can. You can see out at our farm we have a lot of different types of weeds, and I'm sure that you probably do in your own garden too. But I'm really not using a lot of force here to cut them. Just like that. Now, the nice thing about the forked edge is that say that I have a whole bunch of them that I've just already cut off and need to move. It's very easy to move it out of the way. Or, if you wanted to break up the soil a little because you're going to be planting in it soon, it's another really great way to use the forked edge. Now, I'm not going to have the camera guy pan out and show you how much work I still have left to do, but I am just going to say the Home Attic is a great tool that we use out at our farm. I highly recommend it.
