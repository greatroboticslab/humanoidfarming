 A long-term extension of the biodiesel tax credit would help provide stability for the biodiesel industry and support soybean prices. Currently biodiesel plants are trying to produce without the dollar per gallon tax incentive which is hurting the industry. As I think about the tax incentive it has expired seven times since the year 2006 and this gives much uncertainty to the market. He says without the tax credit U.S. biodiesel plants are running at only 50 percent capacity. A lot of these plants you know run seasonally or some have been shut down because of the tax incentive. But at full capacity plants can provide a great economic benefit. Providing tens of thousands of jobs providing economic stability and growth. Plus biodiesel is environmentally friendly. Biodiesel reduces greenhouse gases by over 50 percent so it cleans the air. This Heartland Consumer Report is sponsored by South Dakota soybean farmers and their soybean checkoff.
