Many farmers across the world keep livestock which supplies a wide range of products and services such as meat, milk, eggs, hides, and skins, transport, drought power, and manure. Farmers know all too well that their survival depends on keeping their soils healthy and that animals play an important role in this. It is out of clothing used by ramparts. I can't get part of the fathers. And now. Man they are riding their cars. Unfortunately, the boys know twice when they are living.<|en|> If you kill According to Meadow, there is information in rejoicing that they live. My deixes and grandchildren even go on to leaflets.

I was working on my work. If livestock are managed well, they can contribute to important ecosystem functions such as improving soil fertility. They are also essential to livelihoods, incomes, nutrition and food security. A changing climate and growing population along with every shrinking land have led to a shift towards mixed crop livestock systems. In this video, we will learn how farmers in Kenya's western region are benefiting from mixed crop livestock systems. Pues bun?? A changing day, Keep IFIT. I am at seperti Iwan bakari.

Integrated farming calls for skill in different types of activities such as raising cows, goats, sheep and poultry, crop and vegetable farming and growing grass. The droppings from the livestock can be used as manure while the nutritious crop residues make good fodder. Making the most of these farm spillovers can help boost both yields and animal growth and in turn improve the household's health and wealth. Crop residues found in Kakamega includes stovers of cereals such as sorghum, maize and millet, and halms of leguminous crops such as beans and groundnuts, and other crops, cassava leaves, sweet potato vines and planted agroforestry species. Maize stove is the most abundant of all crop residues in Kakamega. The farmers collect these crop residues from the field and store them at home to feed the livestock. Now, what have we learned? Mixed farming systems are found to be more efficient compared to monocropping or specialized livestock production systems. Land is more intensively utilized as population density increases and crop livestock interactions intensify. Adding manure to soil increases nutrients and soil water holding capacity and improves soil structure. In addition, if rotations of various crops and forage legumes are used, they replenish soil nutrients and reduce soil erosion. TheyFinally change unless only knowing how much physiological saus moins water to cover. Eve answered this and answered it among viewers. The letter was published shortly now And the letter clearly happened during this presentation. I asked why the letter was written, wydaje it right away. It is a message from my mother who answers it I would say to them. I say hear the letter popping up when it comes to me.
