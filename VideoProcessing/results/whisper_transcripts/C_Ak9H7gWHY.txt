Science & Technology
 Low soil temperatures at planting can slow root growth, preventing young roots from taking up nutrients outside of the immediate root zone. However, placing key nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in starter fertilizers can help meet the early demands of seedlings until the development of plant root systems. The most common and recommended placement of starter fertilizer is two inches to the side and two inches below the kernel at planting. Placed in this manner, the fertilizer is close to the seed but reduces the possibility for fertilizer injury. Starter fertilizer use should be based on soil nutrient needs and adverse field conditions that may prevent or reduce early plant growth and development. Talk to your local DeKalb-Asgro dealer, district sales manager, or technical agronomist to learn more about starter fertilizer applications, or go to aganytime.com for more information.
