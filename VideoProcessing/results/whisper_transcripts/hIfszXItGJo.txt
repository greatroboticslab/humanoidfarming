 You know what that means? Time to milk goats. All the goats are usually waiting for us to set the gate every single morning and evening. They all have yellow collars on to make it easier to distinguish who's going to milk and who is not. This is Ivory. She always tries to run up with the milking group, even though she doesn't get milked just because she wants the food that's inside the milking room. All the goats know exactly where they're going because they go twice a day every single day, so they can generally get to the milking room without much guidance. Then they all file out this ramp where they head inside the dairy where Carter is going to start milking them. He starts by stripping them out, which is checking for any lack of consistency and texture and discoloration in the milk. Then he wipes off their udders with super hot water and dawn and dips their teats in iodine. Now it's a pretty positive experience for the goats because the entire time they're eating and goats are very food motivated animals, so they love it. Then he hooks up the milking claws. This is what sucks milk out of the goat. And then you can bump them a few times and massage the udders to get the milk to flow a little bit better. After that, everything goes inside this fancy looking machine called the vat where everything is kept cold until we bottle it. Thanks so much for watching.
