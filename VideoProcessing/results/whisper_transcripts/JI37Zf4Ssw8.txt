 Now let's talk about the certification process. The first step is to find a certifier that works in your area and reach out to that certifier for copies of their specific application materials. After submission your certifier will review your application and schedule an inspection. Every year each organic farm must be inspected. After the inspection your certifier will review the report put together by your inspector. At the end of this process the certifier will issue a certificate. Again every organic operation is required to renew its certification each year and the certification may be suspended if it is not renewed. The renewal process involves updating your organic systems plan, signing an operator agreement, addressing any non-compliance issues that have not yet been resolved, paying the annual certification fees, and undergoing an annual inspection.
