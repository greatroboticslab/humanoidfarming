 Organic farming emphasizes the use of natural and sustainable practices to cultivate crops and raise livestock. It maintains and enhances soil health. Organic farming practices significantly increase the amount of organic matter in the soil. Organic matter improves soil structure, enhances water holding capacity, and provides a source of nutrients for plants. Organic farming minimizes the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, which can harm beneficial soil organisms. This diverse microbial community plays a crucial role in nutrient cycling, decomposition, and disease suppression. Reduced tillage and cover crops help maintain soil structure, preventing erosion, and improving water infiltration. Organic practices promote natural nutrient cycling, reducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers, and minimizing leaching. Monitoring soil properties involves measuring organic matter content, soil texture, pH, and nutrient availability. Healthy soils provide optimal conditions for plant growth, leading to higher yields and improved crop quality. Healthy soils can hold more water, improving drought resilience and reducing runoff. Strong soil structure minimizes erosion, protecting water quality, and preventing land degradation. Healthy soils sequester more carbon, helping to mitigate climate change. By prioritizing soil health, organic farming practices contribute to a more sustainable and resilient agricultural system.
