 Okay team, we're going to get back into it again. Grab a seat. I know you've been chatting away up the back there. Come on, bloody Kiwis. Okay, we're going to carry on with this session. We have Jai-Hu who's going to talk about conservation patterns in North China. That's all you. Thank you. Hello everyone. I'm very honored to be here to share my work with you. I come from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resource Research, Chinese Academic of Sciences. And my title is the Conservation Pondens of Grass-Dense Ecosystem Based on the Forest Leaves of Balance in North China. Actually, I have changed my title because I think this one can better reflect the direction of my research. So, I apologize for any confidence it may bring. This is the outline of my presentation. It contains six parts. Here we come to the background sections. As we all know, grassland provides a wide range of materials and non-materials benefits for human beings, such as the water regulation, food supply, or the carbon sequestration. However, a large proportion of grassland area globally have been degraded in different degrees due to the human activities and climate change. Overgrazing is considered a major driver of glass land degradation in China. The grassland degradation has associated with a series of issues, such as soil erosions, loss of biodiversity, and the decline of productivity. Therefore, Chinese government has launched a series of projections for grassland conservation and restoration since 2000. Many existing studies show that this project has had great positive effects on the grassland grassland vegetation. However, the appropriate of the measures may insert negative effects on grassland. Just as this picture shows, the planting of pine trees in the area in the grasslands in the Mongolia may destroy the grassland vegetation and worsening the water shortage there. So, it is necessary to determine a special part of grassland conservation and restoration for policy formulation. Forge-leaf soil balance is a balance between the forge production and of the forge production. Forge production should be accurately estimated. And model formulation, sorry, and the field survey and or the forge production, the forge production should be accurately estimated. And the model formulation, sorry, and the field survey and or the model simulation is are two widely used methods. And the model simulation methods based on the remote sensing approaches is widely used because it's more appropriate for the large-scale investment. So, our, the aim of our research is to address the two scientific questions. How does the grassland and its productivities and livestock carrying pressure change over space and time? And how to meet the the two scientific questions? And how to meet the two scientific questions? And how to meet the scientific questions? And how to meet the scientific questions? And how to meet the scientific questions? So, I will next introduce the methods. The study area of our research includes Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, Qinghai, and Gansu, and five provinces in North China. And we classified the glassland into six types, including temperate temperate, temperate, desert, desert, desert, apple, apple, meadow, and apple, desert. The time series of my, of our research is 2000 to 2015. And then we estimated the grassland change based on the land use transfer metrics using the land use and land cover change images. And And then we developed the remote sensing classification system for grassland degradation based on the vegetation change. And we classified the grassland change into six levels, including slight moderate of the forest restoration. Then we used the NPP data to estimate the 40 yards of grassland based on the ratio of background to underground biomass combined with the special distribution of grassland types and the survey data. Here is the calculation formula. And for detailed information, you can refer to our paper published online. And then we calculated the forage leaf store balance using the leaf store carrying pressure index. It was estimated as a ratio of actual leaf store carrying capacity to the theoretical leaf store carrying capacity. And the formal one is calculated based on on the statistic data from the government. And the later one is calculated based on the actual forage supply. And when the index equal to one, it refers to the forage leaf stock balance. And when it's processed one, refers to the grassland overloaded. When it's below one, refers to the leaf stock carrying potential. And then we calculated the index under the index under the index under the index under the three signals. The first one is supposing there is no supplementary fading. And the second is supposed is the actual supplementary fading in cold seasons. And the third is supposing there is four supplementary fading in cold seasons. And this picture shows the input parameters during our calculation. Here is the results. Here is the results. We found that the grassland in North China showed that the net decreased over the past 15 years. And the vegetation coverage of grassland showed an overall increasing trend. Among this, the degraded grassland was many years state of slight degradation. And for the the forest and forest supply, we calculated the value of forest supply for the past 15 years. And found that the, and found that Xinjiang has the lowest forage supply and Qinghai has the highest forage supply. And the forest supply has a trend of increasing. However, as you can see in the picture, the grassland in the, in the, in the, in the, in the Tian Shan mountain arrows and the, the Latha river arrows should, should, should, be a decreasing trend of, should, be a decreasing trend of forage supply. As for the leaves or carrying capacity, the special patterns show that the low values was observed on the central, central Tibetan plateau and in western, inner Mongolia. And in western, inner Mongolia, both dominated by alpine desert grassland. And as for the actual And as for the actual nipostal carrying capacity of grassland, it shows an increasing trend. And the nipostal carrying pressure on the three signals shows that the first signal with no supplementary feeding has the highest nipostal carrying pressure, especially in the surrounding areas of Tami Basin and the western Inner Mongolia. As for the center of two, with the actual supplementary feeding, the pressure in the central and western Inner Mongolia was significantly released. And as for the third scenario with the four cementary feeding, it shows that most of the grassland in North China should relatively lower pressure. And while this place was extremely overloaded, still has high nipostal carrying pressure. Then we conducted overlay analysis of grassland change, grassland degradation, and leaf stock, forage balance in different scenarios and identified the special patterns of grassland conservation and the restoration. And then we proposed different strategies according to these patterns. Specifically, for the natural reserves, key ecological function areas and apple desert, strict natural grassland protection, such as the exhibition of grazing should be promoted. And for the degraded grassland in post row arrows, rest grazing and grassland restoration is suggested. And for degraded or unchanged grassland with surplus or balanced livestock carrying states, rotation grazing and grassland improvement measures are advocated. And as for degraded and overloaded grassland in farming or farming pastoral arrows, high efficiency and grassland, sorry, high efficiency grassland animal husbandry and improving supplementary feeding is necessary. In conclusion, the total grassland error in North China showed a decreasing trend. And the forage supply of grassland and livestock carrying pressure both increased continuously over the past 15 years. And the supplementary feeding can elevate the livestock carrying pressure of grassland in central and eastern in Mongolia. But this effect was not apparent in other regions because of their no rate of supplementary feeding. Assuming for supplementary feeding in the cold season, the livestock carrying pressure in that can be substantially reduced by about a half. And finally, we proposed a various strategies to balance grassland conservation and animal husbandry production in different reasons. However, there are still some limitations and uncertainties in our studies. For instance, when we're calculating the livestock carrying pressure index, we did not consider the consumption of wild hovers or consider the trade of the forage. What's more, the assessment of grassland degradation based on the coverage change cannot detect the formulation of toxic weeds or the black soil beach. In spite of this, our studies still provide a scientific basis for the sustainable management or utilization of grassland in China. That's all my presentation. Thanks for attention. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Thank you very much for that. Unfortunately, we do not have enough time for questions, although it does raise a lot of questions about some of the integrated managements that might be applied to restore grasslands. Thank you very much for that. And now our final speaker is Anja. And we're going to talk about Colombia this time. So we've been virtually all around the world so far in this session. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you very much. My name is Anja. I am doing my PhD at SEAD, the Center for International Tropical Agriculture in Cali, Colombia, and together with the University of Hohenheim in Germany. And I form part of the Tropical Forages Program at SEAD and within that program the socioeconomic team. So we heard a lot of talks about animal behavior in this session, but I am focusing on human behavior. And yeah, I'm talking about the cattle value chain in the Colombian Amazon. So what is the problem? The cattle sector plays a very important role for the local economy and food security in the Amazon region. However, it is linked with severe environmental damages. It's one of the main causes for deforestation in that region. And it's also linked with other environmental impacts such as land degradation, greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, and many more. So in addition to the environmental sustainability concerns, also productivity levels are quite, quite low. So this is why sustainable intensification has been on the national policy agenda for quite some years now. It's been included in several national development plans, has been included in the university curricula, et cetera. And several projects have been implemented to promote sustainable intensification, yet with limited success and adoption rates of improved practices, sustainable practices such as using improved pastures, integrating more trees and legumes, et cetera, remains at a very low level. So this is where my PhD research comes in. My objective is to improve the understanding of the adoption barriers and what drives farmers to take certain decisions or, yeah, to adopt or not adopt certain practices. So what are the gaps? Well, at the moment it's widespread knowledge that innovation diffusion is not a linear but a very complex process. However, in the cattle context and particularly in the Amazon context, very little is known about collaboration patterns, information exchange patterns, learning patterns, which are important mechanisms for innovation diffusion. There's also very little known about the interconnections of different types of actors, so not only farmers between farmers but also with other actors that are important for technology adoption. And also what are the preferences of the farmers not with regards to whole technology packages but instead individual technologies. And then lastly, oftentimes farmers in many studies are considered as one group of farmers but in fact they are very heterogeneous and this heterogeneity is also only marginally considered. So this is my overall doctoral methodological approach. I did some qualitative research last year and this is what I'm focusing on today. Right now I'm doing a social network analysis and then I'm also doing a discrete choice experiment to assess farmer preferences and willingness to invest. And together with a master student I'm also doing a profitability analysis because also for that there's almost no data available for that region at the moment. So first some background. Where are we? So we have Colombia here and I'm focusing on one department only which is called Caquetá and is located in the Amazon natural region. It's the third largest department but has only 1% of the population. And what is important here is that we have the Andes running across here more or less. So it's the Andes form the border with the neighboring department to the west. Climate. We are in the tropics. So average temperature is 26 degrees. Rainfall is very high. So average rainfall is 3,700 but in some regions it exceeds 4,500 which is a major challenge for the farmers in that region. Deforestation is one of the departments with the highest deforestation rate. It's the department with the highest growth rate of deforestation at that moment and only in 2021 40,000 hectares approximately were the first.
