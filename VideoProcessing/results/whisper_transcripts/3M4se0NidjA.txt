Science & Technology
 Being a farmer means understanding and managing a wide range of different subjects. Agronomy, science, legal and regulatory requirements, engineering, strategy, finance, digital, all to be able to sow, care and harvest your crops while achieving the best yield. But being a farmer also means that you have to be strong and resilient and face every day with enough belief, courage and strength to turn each challenge into a victory. This doesn't have to be a lonely path. On the contrary, the ones who always prosper are the ones who choose the right tools, the right products, the right partners, those who always make the right choices. Corteva Agriscience has always been by your side and always will be. Attentive to all signs, with eyes on the horizon, anticipating challenges, investigating, discovering, testing and developing the best solutions. Plant disease, harmful weeds, pests and challenging weather conditions are part of the farmer's daily harsh reality. And with a global growing population, crop protection has become one of the world's top priorities. We need efficient solutions to feed and respond to the increasing demand for high quality, affordable, healthy and sustainable food. We've come a long way together, trying to find solutions by listening to every farmer who works with us and who trusts us and we take that trust very seriously. Your challenges are our priority. We bring them to our laboratories, to our field trials and for that, we need to be as close to you as possible. We have to develop and test each product and each solution to provide you, your farm and your crops the best tools. That's why we created the Integrated R&D Centre in Eschbach, Germany. Here we perform all the work that will allow farmers to treat their crops and the consumer to consume their food. We have available state-of-the-art technology and techniques, such as molecular biology for resistance studies and synergies between plant breeding and crop protection research. We take advantage of the advancements in application technology with closed transfer systems and intelligent sprayers and integrated solutions. The HBAR Centre will be a place where will be located both the seed product development teams but also the crop protection discovery and development teams. And for what we call CPD&D, they will be specialized people on weed control, disease control, seed apply technology, resistance characterization, nematology and there will be a kind of synergy opportunity across all this group and with CPD also. I think that the combination of plant breeding and crop protection will help delivering sustainable solutions. And that's the only way to me to reach sustainability moving forward. To be a farmer, you must be a lot of different things all at the same time to be able to achieve the best outcome for your farm, your crops, yourself and your legacy. But you are never alone. Corteva Agriscience is right there by your side and always will be. Helping you to overcome in the best way possible all the challenges that will come your way. With Smart Science, our years of crop protection solutions continue improving with innovative new products discovered, developed and tested with efficacy and sustainability in mind. We are in a KVS Lillemark on the Tegnhus Guds in mid from Stevns. It's very exciting to be a patient here who is sprayed with Univoc. If we don't use Vibala against Ambrosia, I suppose within 2-3 weeks the Ambrosia would have been even higher than these plants. The products that we applied came out of effect. So they were resolved. Now, if it was a miracle or it was from the product, God knows.
