 Well, hey friends and neighbors, this is Chuck out at Sheraton Park Farms. Welcome back to the farm. So today, I want to talk a little bit about a topic that I don't see a whole lot of folks mentioning, and that's agritourism. And how can that be beneficial for you on your farm, and how can that be beneficial for you as a potential farm customer? So hang out with us for a little bit. We've got a farm tour coming up today. It's our first ever friends and family farm tour here at Sheraton Park Farms. We've got a group of folks coming out. We're going to go out and show them the farm. But I want to talk to you about some tips that you need to be thinking about as a farmer, and some things that you might want to be looking for if you're a potential customer going out to visit a farm that you're thinking about patronizing. So hang out with us for a little bit, and let's talk about getting to know your farmer. Okay, so let's talk a little bit about exactly what it is we're doing here. So we're having our very first friends and family farm tour here at Sheraton Park Farms today. And what we've done is we've created an event that there is a ticket, and we'll talk a little bit about the ticket here in just a minute, a ticket required to come out, and we're going to do a two-hour farm tour of exactly what it is that we do here. We're going to give folks an opportunity to see the animals, see how we raise the animals. We're going, you know, this is a kid-friendly event. We want folks to come out, take plenty of pictures, ask lots of questions, and really kind of connect with us and learn about us and how we do things here on the farm. There's a couple things at play here. First off, it seems that there is a real hunger among folks to connect with the land and where their food comes from. We live just outside of Greensboro. I've said it before, you know, it's the one, two, third, third or fourth largest city in North Carolina. And there's just not a, you know, there's not a lot of opportunity for folks to get out and experience agriculture this close to town. So we're making it possible for folks to come out, bring their kids. They're going to get to see the pigs, the chickens, the sheep, the goats, the whole deal, everything that we do here, and experience a farm firsthand. So as a farmer, that gives you an opportunity to showcase exactly who you are, what you do, and how you do it. It also gives you an opportunity to generate a little bit of revenue. We're charging eight bucks a head for all adults over 18 to come out and see the farm. We think that's a very fair price. We're going to take two hours out of our day, which is two hours that we normally would be using to projects, animal care, whatever the case may be. So there's a value there that we're going to give for our time, and we think that we need to be paid for that time. So eight bucks, eight bucks a head. It's a very reasonable, I mean, you can't go to McDonald's and get a daggone meal for eight bucks. So, I mean, well, I guess you probably can because it's cheap food, but you can't, you know, you can't go out and spend eight dollars and get as much value as what we're going to give you for two hours. On the consumer side, if you're interested in visiting a farm, you should find a farm that's doing some tours. Go out and actually see how they're raising their animals. How is that food being produced? What do they, what are their principles? How are they raising those animals? You know, are they using antibiotics, chemicals? And the way that they're raising that food does that align with your value system and the food that you want to raise your family, that you want to feed to your family. So find a farm, and if they're charging an admission price, those guys are taking time out of their day. They're stopping what they're doing. They're interrupting their normal work to spend some time with you and show you what they're doing. So, you know, eight, 10, 12, even 20 bucks. I mean, I think, I don't know what South and charges at Polyface. But, you know, it's a good value, and it's a way for you to really see how that farm operates, where your food comes from. So, from the farmer side and the consumer side, lots of value there. So, let's talk about some other things that we got going on, how we've set up to do this farm tour, some things that you as the consumer, the customer might want to think about. And then we're going to shoot some footage of folks being here. We're going to walk around, take a look at all the animals, and then we'll come back at the end and kind of wrap this thing up. So, again, stick around with us. Let's do a farm tour today and talk about the benefits for both the farmer and the consumer. So, to prepare for the tour, we've done, we've spent a lot of time this past week kind of picking up, straightening up, cleaning up, mowing, trying to make everything look nice. So, on the farm side, if you're going to have folks out to your farm, you want things to look good. You don't want a bunch of junk laying around. You don't want a bunch of trash laying around. Understanding that it is a working farm, and you're going to have areas where you have staging of equipment, supplies, and that kind of thing. Just let folks know about that. I mean, it is a working farm, but you don't want just a bunch of junk laying around. You don't want, you know, three or four old half-broke-down tractors, you know, parked in the yard. And, you know, you don't want a looking junkie. So, pick everything up, make it look nice, and get your farm ready. From the consumer side, if you're going to visit a farm, you want to look and make sure that the place does look neat, that it's not, you know, got a bunch of junk laying around. Again, understand that a working farm is going to have equipment, supplies, staging of materials, and that kind of thing around. I mean, you know, these guys have got to have stuff to actually work with and run their operation with. So, we've worked this week to get our blackberries kind of trellised up. Got some of them looking nice. Still got a few to go, but I mean, it's fine. It doesn't look trashy. Garden looks nice. We don't have any extra tools or buckets or any of that kind of stuff just laying around. I mean, we've picked all that stuff up. So, presentation of your property and presentation of the property that you're visiting is important. Needs to look nice. So, something else that we're doing is we're going to fix some samples of some products from what we have here on the farm. I think it's a good way to really let folks experience everything that the farm has to offer. They're going to see the animals, see how you raise those animals, how you care for the animals. But also, if you can, give them an opportunity to try a little something. We've got some thin cut pork chops. We've got some of our breakfast sausages. Sondra has made some meatballs. We've got a little bit of chicken cooking. Are those brats? We've got some bratwursts. So, what we're going to do is, you know, we're certainly not going to feed a meal here, but give everybody a chance to sample a few things. Got a little chicken there, so we'll have some, you know, pieces of chicken. We'll have some pieces of pork chop here. So, give folks a, you know, a chance to try what you've got and really experience the full, you know, the full effect of what the farm's offering, which in the end is a good high quality food product. If you're a visitor going to a farm, this is something that you might want to look for is do they have some samples available or do they have something that you can try to get an idea of exactly what their products are? Do they have some products at least available for you to look at? You know, some packages of chicken or bratwurst or sausage or whatever. So, another opportunity here as a farmer to share exactly what you're doing and as a consumer to experience what the farm that you're going to be buying your food from has to offer. Also, have some refreshments available. Water is super cheap. You can get a 48 pack of water at your local big box store for like two bucks. I mean, it's nothing. So, have some refreshments available so that folks have a little something to drink, especially on a hot day. We've got a beautiful day here today. It's probably mid-60s, the sun's shining. It's just a gorgeous day, perfect day for this, but still have a little bit of water, some refreshments or something for your customers and your visitors. We're going to do a fire here. We're going to build a fire in the firing just to kind of give it a little bit of a homey feel. So, you know, just you want folks to be comfortable. The farm that you're visiting, they should make you feel comfortable. They should make you feel welcome and it should be worth your time and effort to go out and visit the farm. Well, y'all, we'll get started a couple minutes after one. First off, we appreciate y'all coming out. This is our first time doing this, so we ask for a little bit of grace if we stumble on something, but we really appreciate y'all coming out. What we wanted to do is we really wanted to open the farm up so folks can kind of see where their food's coming from. You know, nowadays, I know a lot of folks are living in neighborhoods and cities and areas where you just don't have access to a lot of animals, so we wanted the folks to have an opportunity to come out and see some critters and bring the kids. If you've got a camera, we encourage you to take all the pictures you want to take. We'll have an opportunity for the kids to, you know, pet and touch as much as they want, as much as we can let them, you know, like baby piglets, it's impossible to catch a baby piglet. We pick one of those things up, it's going to start squealing, and we're going to have an issue with the mama pig, and that's not going to be good for anybody. This is a working farm. There are fences here. Assume that the fence is hot. 90% of them are. We've got one or two fences that don't have any juice on, but assume that the fence is hot. Watch your steps. We do have, you know, potholes and trip hazards and hoses stretched and that kind of thing, but we just want y'all to enjoy yourselves. Ask any questions that you've got. We'll kind of talk about what we do and how we do things here, and again, if you've got any questions, just jump in there and ask us. Sonner and I bought this farm about four years ago now. We bought this in June of 17. We came here with basically zero agricultural experience outside of just keeping a few bees. What we do here, we've learned to do with books and YouTube and seminars and that kind of thing, so we're fairly green at it, but we've had this pretty steep trajectory on what we've done. We started out with six pigs. Right now there's about 70 pigs on this farm. There's a little over 400 chickens, some turkeys, some goats, some sheep. I mean, we've got a whole bunch of different stuff going on. So, okay. So, I want to thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I think some of the moms and dad probably had a good time letting the kids kind of go do their thing and let them enjoy being outside. Burn off a little bit of energy. and I'm sure some of them probably slept pretty well last night. So 16 adults, that was 16 admission tickets that we had. And then again, we had some samples out. We showed a little bit of that a few minutes ago. Had some samples out. Folks were able to try some things. I think folks were surprised at how good everything was, how flavorful, and being able to see those animals and how they're raised, I think gives you a little bit more of a context on where the food comes from and kind of connects you more to that food and understanding the value of it. So we ended up having quite a few sales. That was about a third of what one of our normal farmer's markets is on a Saturday. So two hours worth of work. We got exposed to some potential new customers, had some sales. Super excited for the farm. Was well worth our time and effort. For those customers, they were able to actually see a working farm, see those animals, see how their food's being raised, and connect with a local farmer and a good local business. So hopefully we're developing some more long-term relationships with that potential customer base through those farm tours. So if you're a farm, again, if you're considering doing farm tours, I would encourage it. Make sure that you've got a good setup, that you're giving folks value for their time and money that they're going to spend with you. And if you're a consumer, look for a farm that's doing tours so that you can actually go out and see how things are being done on that specific farm that you're thinking about patronizing. So anyway, I've rambled enough. I'm going to post a link to a couple other videos over here, other stuff I've got going on. I'm down here in the new maternity ward for Big Mama and Little Mama. We've got some more piglets on the way, so excited about that. If you're not subscribed, hit that subscribe button. Follow along with us. We appreciate y'all watching, and we'll see you on the next video. Thanks.
