 Well, farmers think a change made by the US Environmental Protection Agency could boost crop demand. On Friday, the EPA proposed an update to the renewable volume obligations under the renewable fuel standards. These numbers tell us the minimum amount of renewable fuels that must be blended in the U.S. fuel supply each year. That fuel is measured in RINs. In 2026, the EPA would like to increase the baseline RINs of biofuels from about 22 billion to over 24 billion. Kenny Hartman is a Midwest farmer and the president of the National Corn Growers Association. He thinks crop prices on the Chicago Board of Trade have already responded to the news. It's a win for the consumer because it's a cheaper product. And it's a win for farmers because we've got right now with the economy the way we have with plenty of product, it should help bring up prices to corn. It should bring up prices to soybeans. And the EPA will hold a virtual public hearing on July 8th to hear feedback on the proposed rule.
