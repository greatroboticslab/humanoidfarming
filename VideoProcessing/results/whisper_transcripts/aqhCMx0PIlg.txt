 Hello welcome back to VegPot. I'm in the polytunnel today because I just wanted to show you how things are growing and the tomatoes before I harvest them all because it's getting to that point where the vines just are full of ripe tomatoes and I'll pick them and then you just won't see how they're growing. So I wanted to show you around the polytunnel. I've picked a few already from the greenhouse and a few from one in here and this is what we've got at the moment. So there's a nice selection in here and if ever there was a reason to you know grow your own tomatoes I believe this basket is the beginnings of that. I mean when you go to the supermarket you get these red things maybe a few yellows if you're lucky but that's about it and they're flavourless really aren't they? I mean some of the vine ripened ones have got a bit of flavour but nothing compared to these I can promise you. This is Alice's dream from the greenhouse and this is such an amazing tomato. This is beautiful exquisite flavours to it. It's been top of my taste test for two years running. It's got this lovely anthracyanin on the top which blends around in this sort of fiery blaze right around to the base which is oranges and yellows and golds and this has so many flavours in it. It's sort of got a bit of umami but it's sort of sweet tropical nectarine peach. It's soft, firm, hardly any seeds. This really is an exquisite tomato and if you want a reason to grow your own uh then this is this is it Alice's dream just grow one grow this that's my best I've discovered so far in the last few years. Closely followed by this and although this is slightly cat-faced this one isn't although it's not quite as ripe this is lucid gem and I've got a few more growing over there here in the polytunnel and this again is a delightful tomato exquisite flavours beautiful beautiful. This here this is Uluru ochre and although it doesn't look quite as exciting as the others the flavours in this are delicious it's sort of got umami smoky sort of savoury flavours slightly sweet um yeah really delicious and this is from a dwarf plant bred by a bridia in Australia um I'll put a name on the screen if I can find it um yeah Uluru ochre so gorgeous grows to about six foot these plants I think they're between three and six foot so they're delicious uh this here now this I grew didn't grow last year but I've grown previously a couple of years and this is pink Barkley tie-dye and this is a delicious tomato really rich and savoury inside really really really delicious and grows really well you get lots and lots of tomatoes on the vine and a decent size so yeah pink Barkley tie-dye I think there's a green Barkley tie-dye which I haven't grown yet but that's delicious all these little red ones these are really um similar to the things you get in the supermarket uh these are cherry falls and they ripen really early in the season so these were the first I got to um enjoy this season and they make a great tomato sauce like ketchup and things but hundreds of them on the plants really literally hundreds of them so that's what we've got so far in the basket uh what I wanted to show you around the polytunnel just so you a few of the others if you're new to tomato growing or you're thinking about doing it really give it a go um if you've got an indoor space they'll grow better I think they do for me anyway because we suffer from blight down here quite badly later on in the season but in the polytunnel don't seem to have many problems so right let's get started shall we so if we uh skip these little orange ones here I'll come back to these in a minute uh and these are the heirlooms I've got uh this year now this these are masses on these trusses are p20 beauty king now you wouldn't get that in the supermarket would you and again a really decent sized tomato very similar to lucid gem I don't know if I can take it off now I'll come back and do that with scissors uh but yeah the the taste in this I taste did a taste test video the other day of this and they're really really nice oh that one has yeah look at the colors on that sort of fiery orange anthracyanin on the top just a beautiful tomato so that's p20 beauty king uh you can see there and yeah I really recommend this this is a lovely tasting tomato right moving on down we've got summer of love now this was a delightful tomato last year but this vine has produced hardly any apart from right at the top and we've got some beauties at the top here we've got four uh one two three four really big ones there and a couple down here but there were none at the top so on the way to the top but this is a delightful tomato really really tasty you should check out last year's taste test video if you want to know what it's like uh but I will do it as soon as it's ripened but yeah I can't wait for this one it's gorgeous it's a dark green and red when it's ripe I don't suppose it's picking up in this light to be honest right this was pink barkley tie-dye as you can see quite a few on the vine there still got harvest those and then we get to rebel starfighter prime and look at all of these on this fine now I let this one grow into two stems and it or three even and it's been really worth it but I don't know if you can make out the size of this one here this is just extraordinary but yeah look at look at these they're massive really delicious two really good rebel starfighter prime worth growing then we've got ananas noir now this is the first time for me this year I grew it because some pictures I saw on the internet when you slice through the middle the colors are exquisite not so you know glamorous to look at here I have to get scissors to take that off but yeah check out my taste test if you want to know what that's like really really tasty now this bright yellow one uh yeah masses masses tomatoes all the way up the vine again I've let it split here into two but look at this beautiful colors these yellows and if it's picking up on the camera but really delightful and this is jack off white but a lovely sort of sweet um not overly sweet um does to me like a tomato even though it's bright yellow quite hard to take off the vine they really hang on the vine well so I'll use scissors to cut that one but yeah that's another really nice one which I is first to grow this year but really nice better than anything you can get in the supermarket at the end here we have got a another new one for me and this is sun gold select and if you can see that down there but this is similar to sun gold but actually in a heritage style variety where you can save the seeds and grow your own next year and as you can see there are masses and masses of them on the vines just masses and although not quite as sweet as sun gold they are quite close and really quite a nice tomato they're not quite the same as these down here so we'll come back to these now so that is sun gold select and we'll put that with those now these which you've heard me talk about before are honeycomb and these are an f1 one of the few f1s that I grow and they harvest really easily and they are so sweet there are so many flavors in this if you've ever tried growing them and haven't got the flavors then it's probably because you're just not quite letting them ripen enough you've got to let them ripen up really nicely till they get to this lovely deep orange but these are exquisite really really beautiful and well worth growing you won't get anything of this sort of flavor in the supermarkets not here in the uk anyway right let's go on to the other side of the polytunnel you can see there are masses now all ripening up these green ones in the corner now I really like these I've grown them several years in a row now and they are beautiful they're Michael Pollan you can see the name there and they grow in these great trusses not so many on this plant I've had some in the greenhouse before which I've grown many many more but yeah Michael Pollan and you know when these are ripe because if you can see it's going slightly yellow and the unripe ones are still very green so that'll come off there there we go yes slightly yellow and this is a really sweet green tomato and goes really well in a tomato salad or something like that really delicious I think there's another name for it mint julip perhaps maybe I'm making that up but yeah this is Michael Pollan and really really delicious so let me put this in the basket and then we'll come back to look at these exquisite tomatoes this is another one of my favorites this is kaleidoscopic jewel and this is such a beautiful tomato and they sort of glow here in the polytunnel really beautiful again these are sort of apple sized I don't know if I can take that off nope again have to use scissors but yeah look at these on this truss aren't they gorgeous beautiful really really good these and uh quite a few on the plant um at the back here we've got indigo cherry drops and they're a smaller tomato I think what happens in the back of this this is the darkest corner of the polytunnel they don't get so much sun and so the plants don't produce quite as well but you know last year I've had masses on the vines so but again a very nice tomato um here we have ozark sunrise and the colors on this tomato are exquisite they're sort of a pinky um red absolutely amazing colors extraordinary um and they again they sort of glow here in the polytunnel so they're ozark sunrise and they're quite tasty now this is sunrise jazz now this I haven't taste tested this this year yet so I'll come back and take that yesterday uh later and we will do a taste test of it but I grow it because it's such a beautiful tomato and look at the colors on it it's extraordinary it's not the most tasty but it is a stunner and goes well in the sandwich or you know on a bit of sourdough bread or especially in a tomato salad really delicious for that but yeah that's some nice jazz in the back here this one was a new one for me and this is tiger and this is a really big sort of heart-shaped tomato um grown by a lady in canada I believe uh yeah and this I've done a taste test of this this is really quite tasty a nice one but not quite ripe yet then we've got black russian and these are a sort of a regular sized tomato but a really sort of rich ruby sort of red dark sort of um prussian sort of I say it's prussian blue isn't it not prussian red but just has that sort of color it's a rich rich red with sort of a green on the shoulders um quite tasty that one in the back cuban salami now this one is ripe I don't know if I can harvest it no again I have to come back with some scissors but yeah this is a lovely tasting tomato really savory smoky umami flavors delicious that not masses on the vines and next year I'm going to try and go two stems for that one back here we have black crim and this is quite a good producer again a bit like the black russian um yeah and similar in colors but slightly different shape as you can see here um I can juggle them around so slightly flatter on the base but yeah this is quite a good tasting tomato too um won't find anything like that in the supermarkets really quite nice and then here we've got these captain lucky now this is the first year for me I've done in the taste test for it and it was really quite delicious uh it's beginning to split so I need to harvest that one quick but yeah quite a lot on the vine and um yeah decent size too so just need to get those to ripen up here we have amish sherbet now this is quite a rare heirloom tomato and it has this beautiful coloring sort of orange going around to yellow it will get more orange as it ripens up but that's a really thick meaty slicing tomato so delicious really really really good this one so I like that I grew that last year as well again not many on the on the plants but I'm hoping next year we'll do two vines and then we'll get more and then we move on to a new one for me sorry this video is getting a bit long isn't it I'm just sort of doing it and this is like a one take so I hope you're bearing with me I hope it's proving useful uh this is sartre loise and this is new for me uh this is a delightful colored tomato sort of a custody yellow on the base with purple anthracyanin on the shoulders quite a lot on the vines on the trusses look at the size of this one it's extraordinary amazing size anyway it's not quite ripe that I don't think although I would potentially harvest it and let it ripen up indoors so yeah these have been really uh good and produced lots and lots of tomatoes for me and then we move on to lucid gem the ones we had in the uh greenhouse this is split so that needs picking but yeah these are doing really well harvesting some of them and then in the corner here we've got alice's dream this isn't ripe yet you see it's just beginning to turn but we've got some lovely uh ones here at the back so they're most of the tomatoes um I've got growing this year in the polytunnel there are these here which are quite uh different what happened is if you've seen my other videos uh they got scorched in the spring so I snipped the middle out and we're running two stems up but they are literally hundreds and hundreds of tomatoes on these vines and on the trusses uh these are honeycomb so these are just so delicious and I'm going to be doing that every year from now on I'm going to be nipping out the middle stem letting them grow up it takes a little bit longer for them to get ripe and so on and so forth but if you do it early enough on in the season you're just going to end up with masses and masses more tomatoes than you would if you just ran with one stem okay that's the tomatoes I've got growing this year I'm about to do a massive harvest now and get as many as I can going to enjoy them fresh but also going to have to freeze some of them and make tomato sauces and things like that with them as well okay I hope you enjoyed that one I'll see you in the next video bye for now
