 Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah I've been contemplated, meditating Should've waited, should've never dated You seem irritated, baby Why you never say it? Isn't this worth saving? I can feel you fading, oh We're not gonna make it long Guess you cannot take it Guess it's worth saying It's none of your concern anymore None of your concern Is it even worth it at all? Is it even worth it? Is it gonna work anymore? Is it gonna work? Am I being hurt anymore? Am I being hurt? Nah, yeah I've been hearing things and seeing things And so it seems you're moving on from me Caught you on the scene with little mistake And trust me, she really don't want beef That's besides the point, I'm disappointed As a homie, what is it you see? I want better for you, moving forward What's better for you than me? Guess that's none of my concern anymore None of my concerns It ain't even worth it no more It ain't even worth it It don't even hurt anymore It don't even hurt It ain't gonna work anymore It ain't gonna work You've been hearing things and seeing things And so it seems I'm moving on my own The audacity to question me Like you ain't leave me out here on my own I was dramatized and suicidal Sick and tired, I am not to blame Once I felt a way, but not today I'm not afraid, now I can say Get your bitch ass off on my phone Please leave me alone I am not your girl anymore You need to watch your talk Don't worry about who it is I'm fucking Or who I am loving Just know that it is not true This is enough of discussion I wish you good luck, man When it comes to you It's none of my concern anymore None of my concerns I know that I'm deserving more You know what I deserve Not scared to be alone anymore Not scared to be alone It don't even hurt anymore It don't even hurt You know what I deserve These issues when you met me Results are the post-damages that I haven't dealt with And I only want the best for you moving forward But you backtracking with niggas and they shit for you Don't belong around your aura No, there's not a day in these modern times You haven't crossed my mind, we both crossed the line Seems like I needed you more than I needed myself Just like I always felt like cheating on you would be cheating myself To me, that's just some dumb shit for you to say we done with Trying to speak your heart, trying to make your mark Then go deeper and make your scar But every time I lay down, I think about you naked And if you find my replacement, how could you? I made you come nine times in one day Your two lips would come in the vase You roll my face, I realize you look as good as you taste Fingers all in your mouth, I'm grabbing you up And digging you down and grabbing your waist Your room was my only escape, I guess that's none of your concern
