 I would like to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to my audience and express my gratitude for your continued support. Crop rotation is the practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area across a sequence of growing seasons. Five advantages practicing crop rotation. 1. Increase soil fertility. When the conditions necessary for plant growth are present, we say that the soil is fertile. Proper good nutrition is one of these factors to consider. If the same crop is planted in the same field year after year, eventually the soil will deplete of the nutrients needed by that crop. Since not all crops have the same nutrient needs, crop rotation allows for the sequential harvesting of the various nutrients. 2. Get better nitrogen use. The symbiotic relationship between legumes and rhizobium type bacteria increases the soil's inorganic nitrogen supply, making them an ideal addition to crop rotations. In addition, when grown as part of a crop rotation, peas return some nitrogen and other nutrients to the soil. 3. Improve soil structure. When it comes to controlling erosion and allowing water and air to absorb the soil, a solid soil structure is crucial. The soil can be better shaped to allow for greater water penetration when a variety of plant species are grown in rotation. This is because different plant species have different root systems, some deep and some very subdivided. 4. Prevent soil erosion. It is evident that the addition of mycorrhizae will raise soil quality by fostering a more robust soil structure. Mycorrhizal hyphae will create a path through this soil, increasing water infiltration, which is great because pores make up 40-50% of soil. Mycorrhizal hyphae tunnels improve connections between soil pores, which prevents water from pooling on the soil surface. 5. Increase crop yields. When taken together, the four arguments above suggest that crop rotation is a sound agricultural practice that can boost crop yields.
