 Here's how I prune my tomato plants. First, it's important to determine if your plant actually needs pruning at all. So is it an indeterminate vining variety that can be pruned to a single tall stem and trellis to grow upwards? Or a determinate bush variety that can be left to grow to its determined size? If it's indeterminate, like my plants here, I will begin to prune them a couple of weeks after planting. And I start by removing any lower leaves that are touching the soil as they're therefore more susceptible to issues such as mildew. I then prune the side shoots, which grow at 45 degree angles, out from the axle of the plant between the main stem and the leaves. Larger with snips and smaller with fingers. I remove them all the way up the plant, but always leave the growing point to continue to grow. The side shoots could then be rooted in water, creating a duplicate of the original plant. And I then just train the plant up the twine support as it grows. If the plant has developed two main stems, you could train both up separate supports. Or just prune one away and pop it in water as that will create a nice new plant. So get pruning and follow along for more tips.
