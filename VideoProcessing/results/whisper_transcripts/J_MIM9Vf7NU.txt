Viability of Wind Generation for Farm and Rural Communities

 The Nebraska Public Power District's wind farm near Ainsworth is the largest in the state. Thirty-six mammoth turbines generate enough power for about 19,000 homes each year. But it barely scratches the surface of Nebraska's wind power potential. There's like less than 10 percent of the potential wind development that's currently online. University of Nebraska-Lincoln researcher Jerry Hutchins wants to harness more of the state's wind energy, especially for farms and rural communities. Typically the good parts of the state that have high wind resources are also in the most rural parts of the state. And so they go hand in hand together. With a grant from the Nebraska Center for Energy Sciences Research, Hutchins explores the effectiveness of small wind turbines. They're easier to transport, set up and service than their big brothers. What we hope to do is sort of find where is it economically viable to have some of these small turbine installations and where is it not. So that'll have a big impact on, you know, locations in the state of where it really makes sense to do this. And what size application, what size installation makes sense economically. Hutchins' research will help Nebraskans find windy locations, store energy, and operate wind systems more efficiently. There are all kinds of economic impact benefits. So you can think of rural economic development issues that relate to wind energy because you have potential for land lease payments, tax revenue, job creation. Someday, groups of small turbines could power single homes or farms, bringing energy wherever the wind blows. beisches and geeze and non- Theme sex, pocket money of funding, Andブ ok sweetheart, pamp learn festival and Tamil jsut on national aer debates or national aviation lobbies.
