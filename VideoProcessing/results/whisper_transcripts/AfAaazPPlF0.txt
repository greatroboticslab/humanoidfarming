 Welcome to Survival Ag Ops and Subsistence Farming. What we want to do is talk about the general principles of ag operations under survival conditions, especially once you reach a point where you're under total survival conditions. For instance, in the area that I'm in, we've been in economic decline for the last 10 years. We've had a slow, gradual economic decline with a lot of industry closing, moving out of the area, a lot of population moving. So the first portion of the decline was gradual. Eventually, what could happen is if you go into a raw situation, you would reach a point where you were in a total survival environment. Once you're in a total survival environment, there is no outside inputs. That's the point where the ag operation would change character. You're no longer concerned with making a profit through agricultural operations. Your main focus is on subsistence, feeding yourself and your group, and having enough material produced to trade for other things you need and produce a cash income if that's possible. When you look at survival ag operations, there is a tier of different methods of growing food. What you want to do is concentrate on methods of agricultural production that are low input in both labor and material. When we look at survival ag operations and subsistence farming, what we want to do is organize our efforts based on a hierarchy of low input, maximum output, to high input, high output crops. So what we want to do is when you're selecting land, you want to select land that has the most permaculture opportunity. You want to have the most edible native plants you can find in your area. You're going to need to look at microclimates to do this. The second arena that you want to look at is fruit trees. Fruit trees give you the most production for the next highest amount of labor and inputs. The third level of vegetative production is row crops. Row crops take the most energy, fuel, labor, and effort to produce food. The fourth area of agricultural operations is animal operations. The issue with this is you must have a successful ag-op to have a successful animal operation. Because under long-term survival conditions, you can't produce the food for the animals unless your agricultural operation is successful. If you have a high permaculture input, you can always feed that material to your animals. When you're looking for land, I'm going to go against most of the so-called experts and say you want to get as much land as you can. You want a minimum of 100 acres because you're going to be putting a lot of people on it and you're going to need a lot of production room to do experiments, and have a reserve area to grow plants that would be productive under greenhouse conditions if the need arose. Rule number one, whatever you spend on the land, you're going to spend that much money getting your ag operation going if you're starting with raw land. When you build your farm buildings, fences, equipment, it's roughly one for one. Whatever the land costs is what it's going to cost you to get started. So if you buy $100,000 worth of land, you're going to need $100,000 worth of input of materials to get it going. So when you're looking to purchase your place, you want to find something that has the most infrastructure in place as possible. So if you can afford $20,000, buy $10,000 worth of land and have $10,000 in reserve to get it going. So what we'll do is look at permaculture as a primary method of producing food. Permaculture can provide food for both animals and humans. What we have here growing on this fence line is what's called a maypop. This is a wild food native to our area. It's related to passion fruit. It's an ancient offshoot, I guess prior to the Ice Age, where in the tropics you have passion fruit, but in North America in certain locations you have the maypop. These have never been domestically cultured to select better yields or better taste. Under survival conditions, you grow these on some kind of arbor or let them grow wild in the woods because they require no input of fertilizer and no pesticides that are native to the area. What we'll do is walk around the farm a little bit and look at other permaculture solutions. Here we have another example of a wild food source which can be grown under permaculture conditions. This is a wild muscadine grape. A lot of early settlers actually domesticated these and would grow them in the area. They're also disease and insect resistant and they grow in this area in the poor soil conditions without fertilizer. In permaculture conditions, they're found in trees which makes it difficult to access the fruit. So what you'd want to do is take small starters like these and plant them in vineyards. And what this does, any permaculture material that you can use, it allows you to replenish if you have failures. Because it grows wild all around you and you can enhance what's there, you can transplant and increase production. Here we have wild persimmon trees. These grow all over our area. They're useful for human consumption once they ripen. Prior to that, they're too astringent and bitter tasting for human consumption. And what I've found is a lot of wildlife eat this year round. As soon as the persimmons come out on the tree, deer will start eating them. The other thing is your chickens will eat these. They love the seeds in them. They'll eat them whether they're ripe or not. But another thing I'd consider doing was modifying my fruit plant to include oriental and Japanese persimmons, which are sweet all the time. They're not astringent at all. And they grow the size of apples. So what you can do is look at some of the natural vegetation in your area and you can actually grow similar stuff along with it. This is a black walnut tree. These are edible, but they have to be processed and collected. Under normal circumstances, you could leave these trees be and they would just go on about their business. But under survival conditions, you could clean out around them and collect the nuts and process them and eat them. If you chose to plant trees, I would plant English walnuts rather than American black walnuts. Because the English ones are easier to shell and they give you more nut meat. This is basically a plant that will thrive in your area with zero input. You don't need to fertilize it. It's resistant to insects. It'll go through whatever drought you have. It's native to the area. This is a hawthorn tree. They grow wild in the area, but they're also used as rootstock for semi-dwarf plants in the pear family. What's interesting about this plant is it can be grown in a permaculture situation or cultured in a field. And if you look at this, this plant provides barrier material. So if you want to make hedgerows, it's a good candidate. What makes this such a good plant for barriers, artificial fencing, is it grows barbs that are approximately two to five inches in length. So you can see here, this is really thick foliage. And it would help provide barriers and increase your security. One issue you may have with a hawthorn is it seems to harbor fire blight, if that's common in your area. So you'd want to consider this prior to using this plant for either rootstock or a barrier material. One issue you may have with a hawthorn tree. One issue you may have with a hawthorn tree. When we look at fruit tree operations, fruit tree operations give you a tremendous amount of food production for minimal labor. And the labor is concentrated at certain periods of the year, which frees you up to do other things. You have basically two types of fruit trees as it applies to us in a survival situation. You have fruit trees that are perfectly geared to your area and produce fruit yearly. In that population of fruit trees, what you'll find is out of maybe a hundred trees you planted, a few will be sterile. Some will produce fruit every year. Some will produce fruit every other year. There's just no telling what you're going to get. You just have to plant it and see what happens. And then you take the knowledge you gain from that and improve your situation every year. The second kind of fruit trees is ones that are not perfectly suited to your venue. With these trees, depending on the weather conditions and how harsh the winter and summer is of a particular year, you may or may not get fruit. This peach tree and some of the nectarine trees I have are an example of that. Because of the weather conditions, they're not ideally suited to my area. So I probably get fruit every other year or every third year, depending on the exact species of tree. Another issue you want to look at with survival agricultural operations is having a plant diversity reserve. What this does is allow you to store plants on your property that under current atmospheric conditions will not produce fruit. But under survival conditions, it gives you the option to construct greenhouses and transplant this material into greenhouses. And it will diversify your diet. If you have no income and supply of food, one way to diversify the diet and reduce the likelihood of vitamin deficiency issues is to have a diverse plant reserve. When you look at these, I'm on the North Carolina-Virginia border. This winter, we had some temperatures of seven below zero. This is a banana tree. Through experiments, I found banana trees of the fruiting variety, which were edible, would actually grow in my area. The active growing period is only about five months. It takes 18 months to produce fruit. But these plants will propagate and produce new offspring. We go up and we look here. The banana tree is basically a giant bulb. It's like an herb. It's more like an herb than a tree. What happens is you have a huge root bulb. This one's probably two foot in diameter. And you can see the second trunk over there. And the small new trunk that's coming up, those were all propagated off of the existing bulb. These trees have been in place for about five years. And what they do is they will continue to propagate but not produce fruit. So you could actually use these as a feeder operation. Cut the new shoots off and transplant them into your greenhouse. And just leave your mother bulbs out here. What I've done over the winter is I've experimented with mulching these over the winter. And also not mulching them. And I found in my area both strategies were successful. When I used a mulch, I found that I had to cover them with plastic to keep moisture out. Otherwise, you get root rot in the bulb. And then you can grow all kinds of plants that won't produce fruit under the current situation. And then have them in reserve if it's necessary. You will find that labor is available to help you transplant these into greenhouses and grow it. If nothing else for a portion of the fruit. When you're setting up your ag operation, you're going to need to construct farm buildings and fences. What you want to do is set yourself up a centralized set of buildings that are easy to move between in a central area where you're conserving labor in motion. Because you'll be doing a lot of construction work, a lot of repair work. This survival ag workshop that you will need to support your farm operation will also provide the opportunity for you to make money doing repair work, production work for other people. It will also afford you the opportunity to produce limited runs of materials. Whether it is furniture, equipment, backpacks, gunsmithing, whatever it is you need to do and accomplish. It also provides you an area to work on vehicles and equipment. You can service vehicles for other people to raise money. There will be plenty of opportunities in the future to do this. So you need to keep this in mind when you're setting up your ag op. You want to have really good access to your central buildings that you're going to use to support your equipment. That will be running your ag op. When you're setting up and utilizing your survival ag operation, you want to do it as soon as possible because you want to have it in place and operating prior to the emergency. What this does is gives you time to develop your operations and learn from mistakes. When you set your ag op up, what you want to keep in mind is 80% crop failures are not uncommon in my area operations. So in your planning, you need to determine that you can survive off of the material produced at 80% crop failure. And what you would do in good years is use that material to increase your reserves or to trade it. So it's imperative that you calculate your agricultural need based on famine years. Some of the key inputs to an agricultural operation are electricity and water. These are usually overlooked by beginning agricultural students. During a decline in economic situation, you want to utilize as much existing infrastructure as possible, whether that's power supply, the road system, etc. But you want to be able to transition to producing your own power both mechanically and electrically. The only two viable ways to really do this when you're looking at your farm equipment and your power needs is to produce it one of two ways. You will produce fuel or you will produce the electricity directly. And ideally, you'd want to do both. Hydro solutions on ponds are probably the best way to produce small amounts of electricity. That followed by wood gas generators or alcohol generators. The wood gas and alcohol can be used to power agricultural equipment. This is going to be a necessity because one person with a tractor and a support crew of four people can do the work that 200 laborers would do by hand. So you're going to want to use all the mechanical force multipliers you can find to support your ag operation. The other thing you want to consider is wild game. Creation of ponds, the improvement of ponds, permaculture, fruit trees, row crops, they will all bring in wildlife. This wildlife can be used to feed yourself, your guard dogs, other animals. You should try to nurture and increase the wildlife in your area because that's only going to benefit you in a survival situation. Because that's meat that you don't have to raise. You don't have to feed. With agricultural operations, if it's plant-based, you have certain times of the year that you have to do a lot of work. But you do have slow times or free times during the year where you can do other things, go places, etc. If you're doing animal operations, that's 365 days a year. You're there 100% of the time. You have no opportunity to go and do other stuff. You always have to have someone operating on the farm. So from a priority standpoint, animal operations are not as attractive under long-term survival. The other issue with animal operations is if you have a failure and you lose your herd, where are you going to obtain replacement stock? You may not be close enough to any area or have anybody willing to trade replacement stock to replenish a herd. So your ag operations should be primarily based on the production of food crops. Animal operations are secondary on top of that. The last thing we want to consider is how are you going to handle what it is you produce. There's two basic ways to store food in large quantity. One of them is root cellaring and drying. The other is canning. The problem you're going to run into with a large population of people to feed, you may not have the facilities to actually can everything you need to can. So what you want to do is invest in large root cellar operations and storage operations. The last portion of agricultural operations that a lot of people overlook under survival conditions is tree farming. You're going to want to produce and have a diversity of lumber. You'll want soft and hardwood lumber because it produces different products. You want enough wood that is of a reoccurring situation where you can heat everything. You may also need wood to process to make buildings, to make animal bedding, furniture, or any other use. This was a short intro to survival ag operations and subsistence farming.
