 Climate smart agriculture is a game changer in the fight against climate change. Techniques like agroforestry, where trees and crops coexist, enhance biodiversity and improve soil health. Then there's conservation tillage, which reduces soil erosion and keeps carbon locked in the ground. And let's not forget crop rotation. This method not only boosts yields, but also disrupts pest cycles. Together, these practices help farmers adapt to climate impacts while ensuring food security. Embracing these methods is crucial for a sustainable future in agriculture.
