 Welcome to another day of building our family farm. Don't miss a mama's food. Alright, today's the day. We have our Idaho pasture pigs that we got a couple months ago and we've been training them to hot wire and at the same time making soil for our future gardens. When you have pigs and chickens and animals in a spot for a little while, you might as well do a deep bedding. Bring in wood chips because you can always turn that into compost, into soil for your gardens. We've been training them to hot wire. I think they're good in training. These guys are four months old and they are a little bit bigger than our one year old cooney pigs. We've got the hot wire coming from all the way around here. We've got two. So now that the grass is getting longer, things are getting green, I don't like leaving pigs in one spot. I like moving pigs out in the pasture. I like moving all our animals all around. But having that shelter to contain an animal and train them and let them get used to you when you first get them is important. There's a couple of reels that I use. And we got this one. This is probably your standard reel that you would find at an ag store. But then you have this one that this is used to be for Christmas lights. We bought some Christmas lights for our house and I thought, you know what, that's a nice reel. So it even has this knob so you can wind it up. So I took the Christmas lights off, put the Christmas lights in a box. This is a poly braid that I use which has a metal wire going through this so that way when this gets hot you can energize it. We've also used this for our cows. We use this for our pigs. I have one more run that I need to do before we move these pigs out. We have a stepping post and we're just looping the wire on them. I'm going the first hook here and then going about three up. I'm putting two hot wires instead of one because I don't trust no pig. So instead of a bunch of crazy wires with the net, you only have two wires. And the two wires should be a lot hotter. These posts I like using are made in New Zealand. I get them from PowerFlex plus the wire and some of the reels. So I have a link down below. Don't get the ones at Tractor Supply. No, no, no. They will break on you for sure. I've tried it. Hey Lorraine, what are you doing this morning? So I think our last frost is over. And so I'm trying to plan out what's going to go where and how. So we've got cucumbers that will need to be trellised and some other things that will need to be trellised. So I'm trying to plan out where I'm going to put things. I'm going to use this bad boy. All right, we're hooked up. Let's turn it on. We're at 6,000. All right, we're all hot. Perimeter is hot. Let's get their feed. They're not squealing at us. I haven't fed them yet. I've been feeding these guys way more than the cooney pigs. We only have six months left with these guys. I've been feeding them sunflower seeds. Sunflower seeds for just added protein and oil. Helps with their skin, with their fur. Do pigs have fur or hair? Hair? Hair? Open this up. All the way. That wires off. Perfect. The coonies will cross that line. Come on, pigs. Come on. You're free. You're free. They won't do it. Come on, pig. Come on, pig. There they go. That's when you know you trained them really well. When they will not cross an imaginary line. The other one's like, you go first. There you go. Alright, pigs. The Idaho pasture pigs are now on pasture. Give them access to the shelter still. For now. Eventually we're going to keep going. We'll keep going along property in the woods. Their water's over here still. They're still afraid of me. Let me touch you. Wow! They're like, don't touch me. Alright, pigs. You better be good. Yeah, pigs are fun, man. Pigs are fun. These pigs should root more than these coonies. But still, they should not root that much. But we're going to see how much exactly they're going to root here. Look at this, guys. Is this a radish? Well, don't pull it. It's too small. It's too small. It is a radish, but it's too small. Yeah, that's a radish there, guys. See? I planted... My seeds are working. That's going to be forage for the pigs. There's another patch over where I think Zeke used to be. We were walking yesterday, and the tops are much larger. Let's check on the meatballs. Let's see what they're doing in here. So far, we've lost one. One. That's great. One. One. That's great. One. All right. So next on the list is we need to get this water situation going. We've planted... We're already planted in here, guys. Look at this. We've got some leafy greens, some cabbages, kales, even tomatoes. Wow, already. Look at this. We've got tomatoes, tomatoes. We need to add a drip line here, a drip line here, and a drip line there. And then we've got a new filter, because our other filter, I left it on in the winter, and it cracked on me. Lorraine's been coming in here and watering things by hand right now, so that's not going to cut it. So I've been carrying these Nypex Cobra pliers. These have come in handy. They're only seven inches long. They're little, so they can fit in a pocket, along with my Leatherman. I've been using these more than the Leatherman. So water in a high tunnel especially is so important to have that and establish that before you start planting, man. It's the same thing with getting chickens, right? Like, you order the chickens, next thing you know they're here and you're not ready for them. I mean, that happens so many times. Turn it on. Ooh, it's 90 in here. Yeah, I think we're about maybe 60 degrees today outside. All right, so we have this one. This one is in the wrong spot, so we need to take this one out. And then luckily, I have some plugs. Some goof plugs. Plug that back in there. So thankful for farmer's friends who send us extra rolls of this because, I mean, it's kind of like a love, little love-hate relationship with this drip tape. All the way out here from our well, the water pressure is not very good. So I think drip tape probably just works perfect for that because of that. Rather than doing sprinklers. And then you get these little plastic clips. I am curious to see what those pigs are doing. I think they're just laid out. Come on. All right, we're in business. We've got a gusher over here, guys. We've got a gusher. Turn it off. So sometimes these will wiggle out. We're good. So as you can see, if you don't keep coming out here, it's not really, it's kind of set it and forget it with the water, the drip tape. But if you forget it, that could happen. All right. Let's see what the little pigs are doing. Let's see. Let's see what they did over here. If they did anything. I didn't see them go past this little area right here. We've got some rootage going on. A little bit. A little bit. It's kind of warm right now. So usually pigs during the day, if it's really warm out, they'll just lay out in the shade. I mean, they got the life, man. They're training me well. All right. Ooh, it smells like bacon in here. That's because we have to cut our bacon. That's our cooney bacon. Cooney cooney. These were our cooney's that we butchered in November, December. And we finally got around to curing them. A lot of fat, guys. Cooney's are very fatty. They're a lard pig. And that's what makes them so delish. So these are, that's one quarter. This is another quarter of bacon. All right, guys. It's time. Here's another thing we're doing today. We got to move Elvira and her babies. Get your kids, Elvira. Get your kids. I think the most challenging part is we had a bunch of hay in there, bedding, that we need to take out before we move that structure. These little pigs are about a month old now. Almost a month. Come on, pig. Come on, biggies. They got to get used to that. They got to get used to it. Come on, girl. So these pigs are trained on that from day one. How's it going in here? You got it? Yeah. Well, most of it. That should be good enough. I've been using this toe strap. This thing has come in handy with so many things. I just put some hooks on it. You know, no need to make a strap or anything special. Just buy a toe strap. All animals love clover. That's the first thing they eat. Got them. All right, so we need more chicken feed. It's getting closer to the end of the day. Can't wait to see what Lorraine's cooking. Yeah, we just got that time of year where everything is going on. We're moving animals more. We're doing workshops. We need some more pig feed. And the pig feed we soak. I'm doing this like consistency of oatmeal. It's probably 50-50. 50 feed, 50 water. So yeah, guys. A lot of running around today, man. Just kind of getting little things done. I really wanted to move those pigs out. Those Idaho's. And then just trying to keep going. Let's see how these jokesters are doing. They're so used to this shelter, man, that they're just like, I don't really want to come out. I wanted to feed them out here more. I don't think they're really left that area. Yeah, this was the main thing I really wanted to do with this and our water situation in our high tunnel. But I'm glad these guys are out. I feel much better now. So satisfying moving pigs and animals out on fresh grass. Especially in the springtime. Let's see. Let's see. One, two, three, four areas of pigs. We got our new baby chicks. And then we've got our broilers on top of our hill. Let's check on these babies one last time before bed. They're not huddled for sure. They're a little warmer today. Where are you guys at? Oh, you guys are way over here. Maybe the lights are too hot now. Always adjusting as we go. Alright, we made it, guys. We made it to the end of the day. Hey, what's for dinner, Lorraine? We've got some pulled pork. And we've got deviled eggs. And Penelope's working on a salad. And I've got some beans on the stovetop. Just kind of like a bunch of different things. Wow, that's from one of our coonies. Very fatty. Yeah. Let's try it. Mm-hmm. Oh, look at that pasta salad. That looks good. Alright. Pulled pork, beans. It all looks good. Alright, thank you guys for watching. Another beautiful day on the homestead. And we'll see you guys on my next video. Bye.
