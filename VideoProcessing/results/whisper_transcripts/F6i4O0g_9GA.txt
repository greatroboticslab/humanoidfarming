 So hi I'm Martin from Chillingford Organics. I've been farming on this farm at Chillingford Abbott for 25 years now. We started going organic in 1998 and we've been growing organic vegetables now for 10 years and the box scheme has been our main outlet. And now we're supplying the Exeter Farmers Market, we do that every Thursday, and a few other wholesale organic shops. You know, 10 years of growing organic vegetables and we've learnt a lot and we've come now to how I see a really balanced system of growing, so we can build up our own fertility in the soil. We're looking for a range of sizes and we've cut some small cauliflowers and some medium cauliflowers to the boxes. And these are smalls. Alright, let's get in your butt. It's quite important to pick the eggs up regularly because it will encourage them to go brooding otherwise and they stop laying. I think, you know, unfortunately the reality is for us that we've sort of mastered the growing side and we feel we can, we could produce a lot more vegetables but what's limiting us is the market. The reality in Exeter is that the supermarkets now are so dominant that there's hardly any small retailers in Exeter left to. So we're really looking at new ways of giving people a choice. You know what you can smell them. The trouble is, so can the carrot root fly and this time of the year they'll be about and they'll come in to crop and lay their eggs, so that's why we're using this enviromesh fleece sort of cover and that prevents the carrot root fly. Pointed, hispy cabbage. Nice, clean, healthy cabbage. Actually they're really sweet. The supermarkets call them sweethearts. You can actually use them to make coleslaw as well. Beautiful. They're amazingly sweet, you wouldn't believe how sweet they are. One of my favourite vegetables. Summit and Martin's looking into purchasing Summit where you can sit on the seat and look forward rather than guessing and driving forward rather than looking behind and then steering out of position. It's just an ideal little machine for us. Really appropriate for our scale for weeding crops. That's really what we do and how we do it. So please look around the rest of the website and see all the different things that are going on. Thank you. I want to see all the different pots that are going on. I think we'll just have a look at the top of the next two of the plants that are going on. We'll see you soon. We'll see you soon. We'll see you soon. See you soon. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
