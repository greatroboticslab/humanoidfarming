 If you want 64,000 points for free on Terminus, you need to watch this video. If you didn't know, there's a basketball on the roof of this building that drops into this basketball hoop when shot. Doing this will make the net spew out a ton of essence, but there's a couple secret caveats to max out your reward. First is you need to be using the ASG shotgun because the essence reward scales based on projectile type with the ASG pellets being the highest. You can buy one off the wall near stamina up, then make sure you pack a punch it or you won't get the full reward. Next, there's a free double points power up downstairs above melee macchiato that pops up when shot. If you're playing with a group, you can have someone activate it downstairs and have someone else grab the essence up top. But if you're solo or want to split the essence, you can remotely activate it with the C4 instead. This will double your reward from 16,000 to 32,000 and the cursed talisman doubles that to 64,000.
