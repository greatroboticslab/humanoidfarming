Nonprofits & Activism
 Farmers are the backbone of America. They're the stewards of our land and the key to a thriving, healthy food system. For over four decades, American Farmland Trust has championed farmland protection, helped keep farmers on the land, and supported farmers large and small throughout the country. Today our nation's food system faces serious challenges. From extreme weather and an aging farmer population to the devastating loss of farmland, these are issues that if left unchecked have significant consequences. Now with the launch of the U.S. Farm Seal, we're partnering with brands committed to strengthening and sustaining American agriculture with a new certification for products made with ingredients grown right here in the United States. By choosing U.S. Farm certified products, you can support American farmers and invest in the future of U.S. farmland for generations to come. Join the movement, choose U.S. Farmed, and help cultivate a thriving, future.
