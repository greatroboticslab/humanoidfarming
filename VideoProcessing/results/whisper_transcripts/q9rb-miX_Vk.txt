 Perhaps you're at a graduation party of a friend and you eye those deviled eggs that have been sitting out about four hours. You're about to pop one in your mouth when you think, hmm, is this food safe? I'm Quinn Tillotson, clinical dietitian at Salina Regional Health Center. Let's start out in our refrigerator and talk about food safety. Organization and temperature of your fridge are the two most crucial aspects of food storage. You want to make sure that your fridge is organized in a manner where it has the lowest cooking temperature at the top and then the highest cooking temperature at the bottom. So you'd have your ready-to-eat foods, your fresh vegetables, and then your fresh or raw meats. And then for the temperature, danger zone is 41 degrees to 135 degrees Fahrenheit. That's where bacteria proliferates the most. How about leftovers? How long should food sit in the refrigerator? It depends on what is in the leftover, but typically if it's a salad, it's three to four days. If it's a meat product, it's probably somewhere between three to five days. However you can go to www.foodsafety.gov to get the specifics on all other foods. The other aspect of food safety is food preparation. Could you elaborate on that? During food preparation, you need to first off make sure that you're defrosting your meat properly. Don't just leave it out on the counter. That's not food safe at all. You need to either run it under cold running water if it's still in the package, in the fridge or in the microwave for proper defrosting. And then after it's defrosted, you want to make sure that there's no cross contamination. So keep your raw meats and your raw flour products and the cooking tools you're using with those separate from all other foods. Then once you get to the cooking phase, you really want to make sure that you're cooking your meats to a proper temperature. For your fish, your steaks and your pork, you want to make sure that it goes up to a temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit. If you're doing ground beef, then you want to make sure that goes to a temperature of 160. And then poultry goes up to a temperature of 165. Quinn, how long can a food be left out? I know it's going to kind of vary. So perishable food items should be thrown out if it's been sitting out for longer than two hours. If the temperature is greater than 90 degrees in the atmosphere, then you want to throw those out within one hour. How about if there's a power outage? That's a good question. A lot of people think that you need to throw the food out immediately, but that's not the case. Your fridge can hold the temperature up to four hours if you keep the door shut. And the freezer can hold the temperature up to 48 hours if it's a full freezer and 24 hours if it's a half freezer. However, if the power has not come on within that amount of time, then you need to throw your perishable items out. So Quinn, if people want to find out more, where can they go?
