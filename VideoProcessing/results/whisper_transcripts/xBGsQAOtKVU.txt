 The Food and Agribusiness channel started with the aim of interviewing people doing interesting things in the food and agribusiness industries. And from your perspective, Sergio, what do you believe the biggest challenges your industry is facing right now? Competition. What consumers expect and want more is getting the freshest, most conditioned product available in the market. Whenever an individual, whether it's a wife, a husband, son, a daughter, goes into a store and wants to purchase peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, they're expecting a good price, a fair price, but they're expecting something delicious, something fresh, something crunchy, something that as they cut and bite and taste, all they want to do is take another one because they love what they're eating. And you would think that it's very simple to do, very easy to do. It's a simple formula. But because of the different logistics, the different supply chains that you have, whether the product is coming from Mexico, from the US, from somewhere in Europe, from someone in Israel, the logistics plays a tremendous part, a very critical, important part, and maintaining the freshness, the quality of the product before arriving to a distribution center and before arriving into a store. Okay. So, for instance, with us or with getting product mostly from Mexico through land into the United States and Canada, what takes the most is sometimes just crossing the border. A product that goes from, let's say, Santiago de Querétaro in Mexico, to get to Laredo in Texas, it gets to the Mexican border in 18 hours, but sometimes it takes from three, four hours to cross to sometimes three, four days. Goodness me. Basically, because of different scenarios. The border is closed because carriers are protesting in Mexico or in the US, there's too many products crossing. Laredo is the biggest land for the United States. And producing less than 001% of what it crosses. So you have electronics, automobile, other parts that doesn't necessarily have a sense of urgency because they always remain fresh. you have a plastic bottle, it's going to be a plastic bottle no matter how old it is, but you have a perishable. The longer you have in your hands, the quality fails, the quality starts to decay, starts to diminish. So the sense of urgency in produce is always there. You need to move the product as fast as possible within always certain quality conditions to make sure that you maintain the quality and the condition which you harvest and you pack the bottle and send it out.
