 Farmers across the country say they don't have enough workers to even grow or harvest crops. The president now saying he has a solution. John Bolts, the president of the Arizona Farm Bureau, told ABC15 the farming industry is short hundreds of thousands of workers. And if something doesn't change soon, more and more farms across the country will have to shut down. It's been a chronic work shortage. We don't have the folks to work on farms. It's causing farms to go out of business. Bolts has owned Desert Premium Farms in Yuma for more than 16 years. He relies on the H-2A program to fill the workforce gap, a program that allows farmers to hire temporary foreign workers. It's a lifeline. It's the only thing we have right now to keep agriculture working. But many say it has major drawbacks. It's a nine-month process, and then the workers that you get can only work for you temporarily and only for a couple of seasons. It's a big challenge the way the program is designed. President Donald Trump is now working on a solution to address these concerns, which were underscored in recent weeks as ice raids at work sites have caused immigrant workers to not show up to farms. We're going to issue a form of a card or document, and the farmers are going to be responsible for these people. They're not going to have citizenship, but they'll be working, they'll be paying taxes. Bolts says allowing undocumented immigrants currently in the country to work, along with modernizing the H-2A program, is desperately needed. We need to design and build a simple, affordable, and viable, seasonal, and year-round program for agriculture.
