 Commodity prices are at their highest, highest level ever. Never, ever, ever believe that United States farmers lack the ability to overproduce. Because every time the world has told us, everything you can produce, we need all you can produce. Guess what we've done? We've overproduced. Every time that some market specialist, some commodity specialist says, Oh, these prices are here to stay. We've reached a new plateau. That is the time to be batting down the hatches because what's going to happen? All the farmers say, here, hold my beer. And we raise the biggest crops that we've ever raised and flood the market. Commodity prices collapse. Land prices follow.
