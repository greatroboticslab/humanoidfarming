 I'll do it properly now, or is it too late? Oh, it's too late. You're pretty much screwed. And you haven't even drilled it straight. What do you mean, I haven't drilled it straight? That's as straight as a roundabout! That's a European hitch. What's the matter? I got it from Germany. You may well have done. So I can't attach anything to the back of this? Not at the moment.
