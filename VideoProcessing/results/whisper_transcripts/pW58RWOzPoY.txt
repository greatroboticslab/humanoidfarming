Howto & Style
 What happens when you surface lay potatoes on top of the soil instead of burying them? I prepared the bed by fertilizing with some blood and bone. I then laid the potatoes down evenly spaced on top of the soil about 30 centimeters apart. This time I simply just put mulch on top of the potatoes. I just let the crop grow and then it slowly began to die back around the three month mark. What I'm going to do is remove all this mulch and hopefully we've got a bunch of tubers just sitting on top of the soil as it's supposed to be apparently. Look at that! Looks like a creature! What's my conclusion? In this particular experiment I'd have to say for what we put into the bed to what we got out is pretty disappointing. Would I do this experiment again? Oh look I'm not sure.
