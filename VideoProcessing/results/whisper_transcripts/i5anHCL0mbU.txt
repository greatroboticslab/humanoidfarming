 Re. Today let's focus on the the prefix re to re do something. If you're going to do something again or you have to do like a repeat then you're going to have this the sound re in front of words. So you have words like repost, you posted something and then you have to do it again so you have to re post. You did something you have to do it again you have to re peat or re do. There you have the prefix re when you have to do something again. If I have to do the video again I think oh no I have to redo it and if you if you want you can re post this video. Hope you have an awesome day.
