 Located in New South Wales, Australia, the Tarawingi Farm, owned by the Zell family, is famous for two things, its hospitality and its incredible 214-foot air cedar, also known as the world's largest planter. Pulled by a Baldwin DP 600 tractor massively upgraded to 800 horsepower, the giant cedar was first designed to be pulled by two deer 9400 Ts running 24 hours a day to get the crops into the ground. The tractor and the air cedar work at around 5 miles per hour, with the rig covering 2.5 acres each minute. Over a typical 18 hour day of ceding, the huge rig is able to cede about 2500 acres. Located in a remote area, the Tarawingi property covers 47,000 acres to farm wheat, barley, and chickpeas. Looking at this, it seems like there's only one piece of equipment missing in the picture. Good old big bud.
