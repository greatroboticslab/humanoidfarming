 Music Although most focus is on the energy system as a source of greenhouse gases, emissions from our human interaction with land is also a major contributor to climate change. Unlike energy emissions that usually have clearly identified sources, most obviously from fossil fuels, land can either be an emission source, an emission sink, or both at the same time, depending on how it is used. There are both anthropogenic and natural contributions to land emissions, which by their nature are distributed over a wide area, all of which needs to be accounted for. The measurement of agriculture, forestry and other land use focuses on these particularly unique challenges. Through better measurement, we must understand how to work in union with nature to address the climate challenge while not creating other damaging environmental consequences. Measurement provides greater insight into the greenhouse gas mechanisms associated with land and the greenhouse gas mechanisms associated with land that are critical to us in achieving net zero.
