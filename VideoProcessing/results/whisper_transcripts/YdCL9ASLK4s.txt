Over time, Heston's name became synonymous with large square balers, and the 4800 played a starring role in solidifying that reputation. Though overshadowed by subsequent models featuring more automation and higher capacity, this groundbreaking baler remains a favorite of enthusiasts who appreciate how it bridged the gap between old and new. If you see one rolling through a field, it's a living slice of haymaking history that set the stage for modern, large-scale operations. Number 5. The International Harvester Model 45 The International Harvester Model 45, introduced in the early 1950s. This baler quickly gained a following among farmers who trusted the International Harvester brand for nearly all aspects of their operations. With IH farmers already dominating many fields, the Model 45 fit right in, offering consistent performance and reliable bale tying. Its gear-driven plunger was designed to produce uniformly packed square bales. These bales were easier to handle and stack, which was critical in an era when manual labor was still the primary method of getting hay from field to barn. The Model 45's Nodder system was fairly straightforward. While not as advanced as later models, it still got the job done with minimal fuss, provided that you kept everything properly lubricated and adjusted. That being said, a poorly timed Nodder can bring your entire baling day to a halt, and IH made sure to keep that from happening too often. A key advantage was the machine's compatibility with twine types available at the time, ensuring that even remote farms could keep the baler running without hunting for specialty supplies. Where the Model 45 truly shined was in its durability. The sheet metal and frame were built to withstand the usual wear of dust, debris, and fluctuating field conditions. Many older farmers recall using the Model 45 season after season with only routine tune-ups.

Despite the gradual introduction of more sophisticated balers in the latter half of the 1900s, the Model 45 remained a staple for farms that prized simplicity and reliability. It might not boast the bells and whistles that arrive with newer machines, but its place in American haying history is well-earned. Even today, you'll find some of these vintage workhorses in fields. A testament to the quality that IH poured into the Model 45. Number 4. The Alice Chalmers Rotobaler. Born in 1947, this machine stood out from being one of the earliest commercially successful round balers, long before round balers became the norm. Now, sporting Alice Chalmers' vibrant orange paint, the Rotobaler produced small round bales that weighed roughly 50 to 75 pounds each, making them manageable for a single person to handle. The innovative design automatically wrapped each bale with twine before discharging it into the field. Now, for many, this was revolutionary, as it reduced labor compared to manually tying or stacking square bales. Mechanically, the Rotobaler used a clever belt and roller system to roll the hay into compact cylinders. Its operation was mesmerizing to watch, as the baler gradually gathered windrows onto a tightly bound roll. A key feature was the built-in tying mechanism, which eased the workflow considerably. Early adopters realized that they could cut down on extra help during harvest season because the bales were already bound and easy to move. Now, of course, the Rotobaler wasn't without quirks. Operators had to master the timing, stopping the tractor momentarily while the bale was tied and ejected. This learning curve led some to prefer traditional square balers, which kept them rolling continuously. Yet, for smaller farms or those willing to adapt, the Rotobaler was a game-changer. Reliability-wise, Alice Chalmers used sturdy components, and with proper upkeep, many Rotobalers provided years of service. When parts were needed, Alice Chalmers' dealer network in the 1950s and 60s helped keep downtime to a minimum. As bigger round balers gained popularity later in the century, the Rotobaler gradually faded from large-scale use. Still, its place in American baler lore remains unique. Collectors love restoring these compact orange wonders, and they stand as a reminder that the round baling concept has been part of U.S. farming heritage for much longer than what most people realize. It paved the way for future innovations and remains a testament to Alice Chalmers' forward thinking in the mid-1900s. Number 3, the New Holland Super 77. The early 1950s represented a leap forward for New Holland, which already had been making hay-related equipment for decades. The small square baler was known for its improvised feeding system and nodder mechanism that delivered more consistent ties than some of its competitors. Many farmers recall how the Super 77 could handle a variety of crops, from grass hay to alfalfa, without frequent plug-ups. A highlight was the Super 77's two-twine nodder design, which made for tidy, secure bales. Once you got everything dialed in, you could roll through the field at a decent clip and watch those little rectangular packages all pile up. Maintenance on the Super 77 was comparatively straightforward. The pickup reel, feeder forks, and plunger were all within easy reach, and daily lubrication points were clearly marked, a nice perk in an era when manuals weren't always read cover to cover. New Holland's approach to marketing and distribution also aided the Super 77's success. They had a solid dealer network across rural America by the mid-1900s, ensuring that part, service, and general advice was all readily available. This robust support made it easier for farmers to keep their balers in top shape, even after multiple seasons of heavy use. And while the Super 77 was eventually succeeded by newer models like the Super 68 and beyond, it laid much of the groundwork for New Holland's reputation as a leader in hay equipment. For collectors and nostalgic farmers alike, the Super 77 stands as a testament to American ingenuity in mechanized agriculture. Even today, spotting one of these yellow and red balers in a museum or a vintage equipment show brings back memories of sweat-soaked afternoons and the satisfying thump of hay turning into neatly tied bales. Its reliability, coupled with New Holland's name recognition, cements the Super 77 as one of the iconic balers of its time. Number 2.

Featuring Deere's classic green and yellow paint scheme, the 14T was a small square baler capable of producing well-packed bales that were easy to stack and transport. Its feeding system used an auger and feeder forks to move hay into the bale chamber, reducing the likelihood of clogging. One of the 14T's biggest selling points was its Nodder assembly. Designed to be relatively foolproof, it offered consistent tying performance as long as the twine tension and timing were properly set. Jokes aside, there's nothing more aggravating than a run of broken bales at the worst possible moment. Farmers who maintained the 14T said it rarely let them down, even during long hours in the field. A wide pickup reel and adjustable gauge wheels further improved its adaptability to different field conditions. John Deere's extensive dealership network allowed farmers to easily access replacement parts and expert advice. For many, that was a game-changer, since a broken chain or Nodder gear could otherwise bring an entire operation to a standstill. Routine maintenance, like greasing the plunger bearings or checking the Nodder cam, was all straightforward, and the baler's design made most components accessible without major disassembly. Over time, the 14T was succeeded by models like the 24T, but it left behind a strong legacy. Many who started their baling days with a 14T still speak fondly of its reliability.

The 24T featured a streamlined feeding system, improved Nodder components, and an overall sturdier frame. This meant fewer missed ties, denser bales, and less downtime, a triple win for hardworking farmers. For many, switching from old balers to the 24T was like night and day in terms of efficiency and maintenance. Mechanically, the 24T used a feed fork system that provided a smooth flow of materials into the bale chamber. This helped reduce leaf loss in alfalfa and maintain more uniform bale density. The Nodder design was refined, with better twine tension controls and more robust gears that can help you handle a bigger workload without slipping. Seriously though, when you talk to veteran farmers, you'll often hear that the 24T was the kind of baler that you could just set and forget, provided that you gave it a bit of grease and watched your twine supply. John Deere's monumental dealer presence across rural America made owning a 24T even more attractive. Quick access to parts of professional service meant that even if something did break, the downtime was all minimized. This level of support helped the 24T dominate in a competitive market, where baler reliability could make or break a harvest season.
