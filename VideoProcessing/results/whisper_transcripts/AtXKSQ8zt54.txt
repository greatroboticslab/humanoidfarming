 As a field sales agronomist with Envision and Highsoil, I often get questions about cold weather and planting. When our growers ask us, is it time to head to the field or should we keep the planter in the shed, I present them with the three following topics. Number one, be mindful of your soil temperatures and your soil moisture. Cold soil delays the time between germination and emergence, but cold and wet soils will slow that process down even further. Number two, don't just plan for today. Keep an eye on the advance forecast. It's not just about having the ground at 50 degrees during planting. It's about having as little time between germination and emergence. If today says go, but the advance forecast says stop, maybe we reevaluate that planning decision. And number three, and potentially the most important, keep the right seed on the right acre. The GrowMark system supported brands have invested countless dollars in emergence ratings. If you're planning in cool, wet conditions, contact your local crop specialist to feel confident that the right seed is going on the right acre.
