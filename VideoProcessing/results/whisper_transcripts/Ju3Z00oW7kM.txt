 Here's my fertilization technique to help you get more peppers, tomatoes, and eggplants. Nitrogen is important at the beginning stages of the development and growth of the plant and helping the leaves be nice and green. But too much nitrogen means the plant will dedicate most of its energy to producing lots of leafy greens instead of flowers and fruit. As soon as your plants start flowering you need to stop with all the nitrogen fertilizer. You're looking for a fertilizer that has more phosphorus and potassium compared to nitrogen. At the beginning of its growth I like to use a tomato specific fertilizer like Espoma brand tomato tone but once it starts flowering and all of that I switch to something that focuses more on the potassium and phosphorus like this tiger bloom right here. This is a liquid fertilizer I feed it to my tomatoes about once a week. There are tons of other fertilizers that you can find that have higher potassium and phosphorus numbers than the nitrogen.
