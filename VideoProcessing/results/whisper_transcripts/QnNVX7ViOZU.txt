 I'm at Bungbu City, Southeast China. Around me are some 6,500 hectares of alfafa ready for its last harvest this year. While alfafa is one of the best feeds for raising animals and later they will be delivered to the largest dairy farm nearby. Some five kilometers away sees modern farming the largest raw milk producer in China. I'm about to get changed take a look around and find out how they produce such high quality dairy products. I'm inside one of the 26 cow sheds here at the dairy farm where most of the cows get rest and fed. This is the lactating cow barn where cows of around two or three years old are raised. It stretches over 300 meters with the double rows meaning over 38,000 cows eat and sleep here. Unlike traditional dairy farms in China which used to collect milk from individual shades, modern dairy runs large scale pastures and raise its own cows and that just to make sure to create a comfortable environment for the cows before they go to work.

More than 20,000 lactating cows are milked here, meaning they will produce over 650 pounds of fresh milk every day. Now, thanks to this new automatic technology, the pipeline makes milk delivery incredibly quick. It also reduces the probability of bacterial breeding and ensures maximum nutritional value. According to the China Dairy Data Report released by the Dairy Association of China, in 2018, China's raw milk output was 31 million tons, making the country the sixth in the world. Just behind India, the European Union and the U.S. From 1949 to 2018, China's total raw milk production increased from 200,000 tons to 31 million, a 145-fold increase. Consumption of milk and dairy quadruped from 1995 to 2010 among urban residents, also nearly 6.8 compared to rural ones. Along with improvement in living standards, China's demands for dairy products is continually growing. In 2017, the average consumption of dairy products reached to 20.3 kilograms per person every year, as compared to just 8.8 kilograms in 2005.
