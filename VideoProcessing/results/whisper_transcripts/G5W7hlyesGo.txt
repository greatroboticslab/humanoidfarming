 So you learned about the first agricultural revolution in the last video, and by my reckoning that makes it sound like there must have been a second agricultural revolution, and wouldn't you know it? There was. So I reckon we ought to talk about it, and if you're ready to get them brain cows milked mechanical reaper style, then let's get to it. So let's begin with the causes of the second agricultural revolution, and then we'll talk about its effects. But first, as is proper, let's define this development. So the second agricultural revolution refers to a development in agriculture lasting from the 17th to the 20th century in which mechanical technology increased crop yields, made harvesting more efficient, and led to a significant growth in population. A big driver of this revolution was the industrial revolution, but we'll talk about that in Unit 7. Oh, and by the way, if you want note guys to follow along with this video and all my videos, then check the link in the description. Okay, so what caused this second agricultural revolution? Well, I've got two main causes for you, namely new technology and improved transportation, and I reckon we ought to consider those one at a time. First, new technology. It's worth mentioning here that there was about 12,000 years between the first agricultural revolution and the second. And in all that time, people basically farmed the same way throughout, which is to say by hand or with animals. But starting in the late 1600s, new technology was developed that led to the mechanization of farming, and it was kind of a big deal. And you're going to need to know the names of a few of these technologies responsible for the transformation. So first you had the seed drill, invented by our boy Jethro Tull. And this sweet bippy planted seeds at the proper depth, which meant that every seed had the best chance of growth, as opposed to casting seeds by hand all over the dang place. This meant that fewer seeds were wasted, and since the seed drill planted them in straight rows, farmers could easily distinguish between crops and weeds. Second, you had the mechanical reaper, which mechanized the reaping of grain, which meant that harvesting could be done in a fraction of the time. Before this, you could see all these chump farmers cutting down their crops with a hand tool called a scythe. But not anymore, baby. In this period, the mechanical reaper could not only cut the grain, but eventually also bundled it as well, all of which increased efficiency and productivity tenfold. Then by the early to mid-nineteenth century, our boy John Deere introduced the steel plow to farmers in the United States, and that was the precursor to modern combines which can basically do it all, from reaping to threshing. And all of this contributed to more efficient production in the fields and therefore more and more rural to urban migration in the form of out-of-work farmers looking for jobs. Now there are plenty of other technologies that revolutionized farming during this period, and they basically all had the same effect. Farmers could plant and harvest more efficiently, and all of that led to high crop yields in order to feed the world's growing number of mouth holes. But equally important to this development was new transportation technology. You can seed, drill, and mechanically reap all day long, but if you don't have a way to get all that food to the people who need it, then you know, maybe Thomas Malthus would have been right and then we'd all die. But as it turns out, two major advancements in transportation ensured that food could be distributed quickly. First was the railroad, which thanks to the industrial revolution, expanded rapidly in industrializing states during this period. Not only could farmers transport crops to be sold on distant markets via railroad, but they could also receive all those mechanized farm tools that I just mentioned quick, fast, and in a hurry. And then second, the further development of canals increased the efficiency of shipping goods by boat. And in case you don't know, a canal is just a waterway that is made by humans. And as it turns out, rivers don't always allow for the most efficient route between farmers and their markets, so canals increase the speed and efficiency by which food could be shipped to various distant locations. Okay, now let's turn our attention to the effects of the second agricultural revolution, and just like the effects of the first, they're pretty massive. Now the first effect was better diets for people in industrial states. Now let's not forget what we talked about in the last video, namely that thanks to the Columbian exchange, new kinds of food diffused across the world in all directions. And in places like Europe and the United States, the adoption of these new foods combined with the advances in agriculture that I mentioned earlier meant that more and more people had nutritious foods available to them. And more and better food led to the second effect that you need to know, namely longer life expectancy. So remember all the way back to the demographic transition model, and you'll recognize that these developments basically put us right here on the ground. More babies are being born and less people are dying, and much of that can be attributed to these new techniques in farming. So as I am wont to say, never forget that for most of world history, more food equals more babies. And then the third effect of the revolution was a significant demographic shift. You see, when farming is done by hand, well, you need a lot of dang hands to make it work. But during this period, more and more of the farming was done by machines, and that meant fewer workers were needed in the fields. So what are those out of work farmers going to do? Well, as it turns out, at the very same time farming was getting all high tech, factories were springing up like mad in the cities. And what farming technology did for agriculture, factories and all the machines in them did for dang near everything else that was sellable on the market. And so as machines took over fields, massive amounts of out of work farmers fled to urban areas looking for jobs in factories. And we'll talk way more about that in Unit 7, but for now it's enough to know that the second agricultural revolution induced major waves of rural to urban migration.
