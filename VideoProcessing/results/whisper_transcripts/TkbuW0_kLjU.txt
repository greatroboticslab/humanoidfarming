According to a UN report, 9.9% of the world's population still experiences hunger, making the idea of providing food for roughly 10 billion people a difficult task. Given how unpredictable environmental changes are, we must rely on advancements in agricultural technology. Fortunately, the early indications are positive. We don't have to wait three decades to discover how future agricultural innovations will affect how people live their lives. In today's video, we have brought you the 10 innovative farming technology advancements you need to know about. So make sure you watch till the end. Welcome to another Incredible Agriculture video, where we discuss with you the future of agriculture now. Here is what we have to share with you. Number 1. Bead Vectoring Technologies The value of honeybees as a crop output in the United States is $20 billion. Due to the importance of these insects to human life, agricultural equipment is becoming more innovative to preserve bees and enhance their pollination skills. In place of chemical pesticides, bee vectoring technologies, or BVT for short, uses commercially raised bees to offer specific crop controls through pollination. This crop protection method is safe for the environment. The technique does not require the use of tractors or water spraying. Instead, the scientifically created bumblebee hive enables the bees to carry a little amount of pest control powders on their legs as they move over the field. This advancement in agricultural technology encourages increased crop output, sustainable farming, and soil quality. Blueberries, sunflowers, apples, and tomatoes are just a few of the crops that BVT's solution is appropriate for, and farms of all sizes can use it. Number 2. Precision Agriculture Precision Agriculture is an approach to managing agricultural resources that gathers, analyses, and assesses data and provides insights to assist farmers in enhancing and raising soil quality and productivity. Precision agriculture data points are used to inform management decisions to enhance farmland and agricultural products in a number of crucial areas, including efficient utilization of resources, sustainability, profitability, and productivity. This advancement in agricultural technology makes use of big data to support management choices, allowing farmers to optimize output by controlling crop yield characteristics, including moisture content, soil quality, and microclimates. It uses robotics, automation, and remote sensing technologies to enhance crop health and maximize agricultural resources, increasing productivity. Number 3. Indoor Vertical Farming Between 3 and 6 tons of rice are produced on average per hectare. When adopting indoor vertical farming, farmers are exempt from this restriction. Farm products are grown indoors using vertical farming techniques in a controlled, enclosed setting. The method uses vertically placed growing shelves to boost agricultural productivity in constrained areas. The shelves frequently don't need soil because they're either hydroponic or aeroponic. Growing plants in water and fertilizer solutions are known as hydroponics. In aeroponics, plant roots are suspended in the air and periodically sprayed with water and nutrients by emitters. Growers can manage factors like light, temperature, water, and occasionally carbon dioxide levels in indoor vertical farms, which helps them produce healthier and larger crops. Additional advantages of the technique include a 70% reduction in water use, which saves energy, and lower labor costs because robots are used for planting and harvesting rather than humans. Number 4. Livestock Farming Technology Emerging livestock technologies provide farmers with data-driven insights, allowing them to streamline farm management, improve animal care, and boost productivity. Here are some of the many innovations redefining livestock farming. Automated dairy installations milk cows automatically without human intervention, and the milk sensors also help farmers monitor the milk quality. Automated cleaning systems remove waste, enabling cleaner disease-free environments. Armenta's non-antibiotic treatment uses acoustic pulse technology, APT, for bovine mastitis, a cow disease responsible for over $6 billion in annual losses in the U.S. and Europe. Automated feeder systems provide animals with feeding mixtures tailored to their specific needs, and in the right amount. Automated farmers use farmers to prevent animals from stealing food. Faro-matics, a company from Spain, employs robotics, AI, and big data to increase animal welfare and farm productivity. They use innovative approaches to identify animal needs. Number 5. Laser Scarecrows Crops growing in an open field may be threatened by obtrusive birds or rodents. Farmers used traditional scarecrows in the past to fend off ravenous visitors. But to prevent birds from stealing food, farm owners and managers are now using high-tech gadgets with motion sensors. A University of Rhode Island researcher assisted in the creation of a laser scarecrow that emits green laser light after learning that birds are sensitive to the color green. The light can shoot 600 feet across a field to alarm birds before harming crops, but it cannot be seen by people in sunlight. Early research on laser scarecrows revealed that by reducing bird populations near farms by 70% and up to 90%, the devices can reduce crop damage. Number 6. Farm Automation Agricultural automation combines electrical devices, chemical sensors, computer systems, electronics, and data management to enhance equipment performance and decision-making, ultimately lowering human input and error. The widespread adoption of the technology is being driven by decreased work time, increased yields, and resource efficiency. The way that farmers cultivate their crops has changed thanks to the introduction of automated harvesters, drones, autonomous tractors, sowing, and weeding. They can concentrate on more important activities because the technology handles tedious and repetitive duties. Automation can assist staff members to save time because it eliminates the need for them to actively participate in a task, as is the case in every area, pardon the pun. Most farmers now spend more time with their families than they did in the past due to mechanization and automation. Before we continue, allow us to take this time to advise that if there is a topic amongst the list that you, our valued viewers would like to hear more about, feel free to comment about it below. Now, let's continue. Number 7. Real-Time Kinematic RTKE Technology Robert Salmon, an arable farmer in the UK, discovered that limiting agricultural equipment to a fixed lane dramatically decreased soil damage. The drainage and friability of the ground can be compromised if machines are allowed to travel through it without any restrictions. In 2016, Robert intended to convert his 4,800 acres to a 12-meter controlled traffic system, where all farm machinery will use a single dedicated lane. Accurate methods are needed to implement a controlled traffic system, which is virtually unattainable with conventional GPS systems. RTK technology can deliver centimeter-level accuracy, enabling farmers to precisely map their fields and shackle cars to the same lane indefinitely. Tractors can stay on course while traveling since it sends the correct positioning data to them through a radio signal. By improving soil health and productivity, this invention increases output while requiring less input. Number 8. Minichromosimal Technology Agritec Future estimates that in order to maintain our current standard of life, farmers would need to raise crop productivity by at least 23% due to the expanding population and increased demand for food. Consequently, as the world's population increases, losing entire yields to pests is a serious issue. In recent years, genetically modified food has come under fire due to studies that claim it may cause allergic reactions or contain toxic substances that put people at risk for illness. Another problem is that the manufacture of GMO food has the potential to damage natural biodiversity or release poisons into the land. Fortunately, there is optimism in sight. Minichromosimal technology can be used by agricultural geneticists to improve a plant's features without changing the genes in any way. Because minichromosimal only contain a limited amount of genetic material, this approach can be used to modify plants to be more pest or drought resistant without affecting the host's normal growth. In brief, minichromosimal technology enables genetic engineers to develop crops that depend less on toxic chemicals by using fewer fertilizers, insecticides, and fungicides. Also, it enables them to biofortify plants and improve their nutritional value. Number 9. Farm Management Software Many farmers struggle to manage a high job with little assistance, burning the flame at both ends. It becomes increasingly difficult to manage all processes the larger the farm becomes. But in the SaaS era, there is an app for almost everything, which includes farm management. A digital checklist-like integrated platform called farm management software offers real-time data and statistics to help farmers keep track of their daily tasks. Farmers' decision-making across all operations can be improved with the help of this monitoring and reporting software. Number 10. Water Management Technology In order to make drylands arable, irrigation is a crucial means of supplying water to them as they typically receive insufficient rainfall. Despite the fact that this is an essential component of farming today, many farmers still irrigate their fields inefficiently with water, much as the Mesopotamians did more than 4,000 years ago. Flood irrigation can overwater plants, which can stump their growth in addition to waste over two-thirds of the water used. Moreover, it might dump extra fertilizer into lakes and streams, tainting freshwater sources. Farming may now be done more intelligently, safely, and productively thanks to breakthroughs in agriculture technology, including advances in precision agriculture, farm automation, genetics, and water management. Sustainable farming is a hot topic at a time when worries about the environment and climate change are at an all-time high. The survival of the human race as we know it is seriously threatened by our expanding population and the developing shortages of land and water. Nevertheless, farm technology startups are hard at work making progress, while many politicians stall and refute. What was your favorite innovative technology we discussed?
