 The urban farm on the roof of Foodmet uses the energy produced by the market's solar panels and the heat emitted by the building, but also rainwater. The objective of this pilot project is to conquer other flat roofs to produce fruit, vegetables and fish elsewhere in Europe. Water is blue gold. So how does water work here on the farm? We have 100 cubic meter tanks and we collect rainwater. This rainwater is mixed with fish water and rich with natural fertilizer to irrigate our plants and help them grow. Every drop of water that is not absorbed by the plants is collected, filtered and reused for the next irrigation. It is a pilot project, so the aim was to prove that it was feasible to create a working rooftop farm. Our aim is to open other farms and reproduce the model in Belgium and other European countries. Our current ambition is to open other farms, mainly in France. So we are in discussions with others to reproduce the same type of farm, but on a much larger scale. Our 4,000 square meters may seem huge, but in terms of production here, we are at 2,000 square meters. And in terms of fish production, we are at 20 tons and we can really move towards models that will produce 100, 150 or even 300 tons. Turns out to the topologists
