 Hey guys, a lot of times people ask me, how do you keep your pests healthy without using pesticides or things like that? But one of the ways is make sure any leaves that you have that are touching the ground on your veggies, make sure we're taking those leaves off and we're diligent in pruning them. Because that's the way that a lot of pests travel up to your plants and get the munching on the leaves. So here we have a little bit of munching on the leaves. It isn't so bad, but generally that's going to help reduce the amount of pests that you have and reduce your need to use pesticides. All right, see you guys. Bye.
