 Good evening, you're watching To The Point. I'm Akshita Anandakopal. Let's put the focus on what's happening in Maharashtra, in Lathur, where a video of a farmer went viral, which shows the agrarian crisis in the state. Left with no other option, 75-year-old Amba Dasbawar and his wife Muktabai have been tilling land with a wooden plough. They've been doing this for several years now, completely exhausted due to heavy rain which has damaged the crop, pushed him to take loans. And here's a detailed report which once again puts the focus on the struggle of smaller farmers as agricultural costs rise and there's unreliable climate-raising risks. A haunting image from Maharashtra's Lathur that has shaken the conscience of an entire state. In Hadoti village, an elderly farmer couple of Amba Dasbawar and his wife Muktabai have become a tragic symbol of India's agrarian distress. With no money for a tractor, no oxen to plough their field and no labourers they can afford, they have no option but to yoke themselves to a wooden plough and till the earth with their own bodies. They buy one of the parts that they buy for this land yet. It brings them to a- and the debit沒 to envision, The family owns five acres of land, but no income, no savings and no state support. They say this is the second year they've had to do this. Their crop was washed away by heavy rains last year. The loans piled up. The help never came. The money was made by the government. Their story has become a political flashpoint in Maharashtra, especially after the state government admitted on record that it was not an isolated incident. In the first three months of 2025, as many as 767 farmers have died by suicide, as per a written reply by State Minister Makarand Patil. Last year, Maharashtra saw 2,635 farmers die by suicide. Well, this number stood at 2,851 in 2023. Viewing this as a grim indictment of the government's apathy towards farmers, the opposition demanded an urgent discussion in the Assembly. However, the speaker refused, leading to the opposition walking out twice. First over farmer suicides and then over pending payments to soybean cultivators. The Kur過 said, Jotam Shah Gab opponents foreign is Hey maybe you can meet Rest At Samtar Second Montague absolutely problems but the government is not the same as the government is growing. Leader of opposition Raul Gandhi has escalated the attack, claiming that the Prime Minister has failed in his promise to double farmers' income and is now busy in PR spin while the system is killing farmers. Raul Gandhi's words being echoed by his sister and fellow MP Priyanka Gandhi Wadra. But the BJP claims it's a case of the pot calling the kettle black. He was saying that not only individuals are taken down the precedent. Or discredit luxury people's power andidade men on the 직접 hood to�� metal. But while politics plays on and debates rage on, The reality remains that people like Amba Das and Muktabai don't need sympathy. They need support and they need it now. Bureau Report, India Today. Let me bring in now on this broadcast Ritwik Balikar for more details. Ritwik, away from the politics and the bickering that we've been witnessing, the reality is the data that we put out in that report, that in the first three months of 2025 alone, we've seen as many as 767 farmers dying by suicide. So what has the government really done about it? Have there been any measures to help these farmers through this crisis? Absolutely. It was the second day in the ongoing monsoon session where opposition rocked this issue, where government is trying to combat the protest laid by all the opposition's Mahavika Sagadi alliance together. Government is trying to tell that they are supporting farmers through Sanman Nidhi, which is both from the centre and state government. And they have also given subsidies in crop loans and they are trying to give subsidies in power also. But at the same time, the number of farmer suicide is increasing day by day. On an average, nearly one to two farmers are committing suicide every day. And thus, the ongoing monsoon session is rocked and opposition has created ruckus while Devendra Padnavi's government is trying to give a fitting reply by giving the data and stats of how many farmers to cite. We have a detailed plan to help these farmers because the situation is extremely worrying, extremely concerning. The monsoon is currently in Maharashtra, which means the coming weeks, coming months, could be extremely, extremely tough for these farmers. Thanks, Ritwik, for joining us with those details. Let's move on and talk about the Delhi government's rule, which was of the end-of-life vehicles policy, created a whole lot of chaos for the last few days in the national capital. The government now is also to review that policy. The BGP government is contemplating revising the criteria for end-of-life vehicles, suggesting that pollution levels, rather than age, could be a more appropriate measure. The Delhi government has said it will approach the Commission for Air Quality Management regarding the implementation of a fuel ban to end-of-life vehicles. The move is a response to the impact on Delhi residents' issues in the policy's implementation. Delhi ministers have said the policy will only be implemented when it is implemented across the national capital region, alleging that the policy was the ARP's bid to loot car owners. Remember that the policy currently, as it is, prohibits petrol vehicles older than 15 years, diesel vehicles older than 10 years, from plying on Delhi roads. And now, at this point, none of them will be allowed to even get fuel. So they've been selling off cars. There's been a crackdown like never before. And there have been issues also with the automatic number plate recognition cameras at petrol pumps that have been reported further hampering effective enforcement. In general, Vai, we've done the reports We've done this in 2001, leaving US 60 perways we've lasted 10 years later But it can be completed Turn up It came in different homes you said that Aub Flash foreign Oh so that they have to know that they have to remove their cars from here, if they have to go to another state, we have to build this whole knowledge system and we have to build such cars from other states, we will also give them knowledge from this technology. надо
