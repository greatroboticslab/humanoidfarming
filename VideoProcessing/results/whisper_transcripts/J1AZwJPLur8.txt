Howto & Style
 If you want to grow juicy strawberries, do this. This is a strawberry flower, which becomes a strawberry. And these are strawberry leaves, which get energy from the sun, which help make strawberry flowers, which become strawberries. If you don't have enough leaves, you can't get enough flowers, and you can't get enough berries. Sometimes strawberry plants put out a ton of flowers before they have a lot of leaves, which is why early in the season, I take them off. This lets my strawberries focus on producing these leaves. The next thing they'll do is throw out these weird stems. If that part touches the ground, it'll send roots down, and a whole new strawberry plant will come up right here. It's called a runner, and I remove them from my plants. These are just a couple tips I've used to produce juicy strawberries year after year.
