 Today we're going to discuss the mechanical advantage using pulleys. We need things like webbing to hook to a tree, pulleys, we're going to do it with two pulleys, carabiners to hook our pulleys together, rope and press a cord. For our mechanical advantage today we're going to do three different types of pulley systems trying to take this tractor closer to this tree. We're going to pretend the tractor is stuck and has to be moved but of course one person is not strong enough to push that tractor that way. For the first pulley system we're going to tie a figure eight on a bike at the end of our rope. Start with that. Give us a nice loop to hook our tractor to the rope. Nice and tight. All right. Tractor. Then on this end we put our webbing around the tree with our carabiner. We're going to put our rope to our pulley. Run our pulley onto our carabiner and lock it down. Here we have a pulley system of a one to one ratio. That simply means that my one person is equal to one person pulley on the tractor. And as you see I can't do very much as one person. So a one to one ratio is not going to move the tractor. We'll have to try something different. All right. Our second system is a very simple change. All we did was move our pulley from this end to the end with our load. And now we have a two to one ratio. So let's see what happens. And we pull. Oh, a little bit better. Still a tough pull, but at least we were able to move it. We have doubled my power. I am now, this system is equal to two of me pulling on the rope. And we have to move it. Let's try a little bit more. If we go to a three to one ratio, let's see if I can move the tractor a little easier. Three to one, I simply went back to my one to one ratio with the pulley at the tree. But I'm going to add a second pulley on the load end. On this end, I put a pressing knot or pressing cord. I'm taking a carabiner, hooking into that, hooking in my second pulley with my rope through it. Now, I have a three to one ratio pulley system. Now let's see how, whether or not I can move the tractor a lot easier. I'm pulling my three to one with my power tripled. The tractor is much easier to pull up the hill. And that is mechanical advantage. Going from a one to one ratio, a two to one ratio, and a three to one ratio pulley system. I was able to pull the tractor up the hill with just my power. Obviously, when the fully Wirtschaft can pull addressing the feedback loop literally such as plugging in and flowing water. But I'm still going to try it for two to the other eighteen ratio. For their second supper wheel with the tractor is 5.3, which is going to be the next 1.7 ratio cow.
