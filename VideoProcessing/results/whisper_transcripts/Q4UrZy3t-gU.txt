 This is not wildfire. It's farmers burning their crop stocks after the harvest. In early November, air pollutants covered about half a million square kilometers of land in northeast China. That's about the size of France. We gathered air samples since 2013, and our analysis showed that about 20 to 40 percent of air pollution come from stocks burning. We are sure that stocks burning is the main reason that triggers massive pollution in autumn. Just how big is the scale of stocks burning? Check out the red dots shown in satellite pictures from the past three years. They are spread over China's most important grain production areas in the northeast. In Jilin province alone, more than 14 million tons of stocks are produced every year. The stocks are useless to farmers except for feeding to cattle and pigs. Burning crop stock waste after harvest is the easiest way for farmers, and they've been doing this for hundreds of years. It is too costly to simply forbid them from burning the stocks. What needs to be done is to find an alternative way to get rid of this massive amount of agricultural waste. Veteran agricultural technician Wang Guiman has found a special crop rotation plan that allows part of the stocks to be left in the fields. Wang says the method can reduce stocks burning as well as produce organic fertilizers and keep more rain and snow water in the ground. He said the method has been widely accepted in Lishu County. Meanwhile, some companies want to turn the stocks into biofuel and take the opportunity to modernize local farms. We visited New Tianlong, one of China's largest corn refinery plants. The company signed a technology licensing agreement with DuPont to better use leftover biomass on Jilin's corn farms. The two companies plan to build China's largest cellulosic ethno-manufacturing plant in Ziping City. The plant will be built like DuPont's biofuel facility in Iowa State in the U.S. Once the plant is completed, it will produce 82,000 tons of cellulosic ethanol every year to replace 100,000 tons of petroleum. The plant can consume about 40 percent of all stocks produced in Lishu County annually. A 100 million yuan market for stocks collection and sales will be created. Farmers can earn money by selling their stocks instead of burning them. This project provides an unprecedented opportunity to transform China's agricultural sector and improve the economy of major agricultural provinces. It also has an undeliable role in reducing greenhouse gas emission. The plant would not be a simple duplicate of the one in the U.S., as there are different challenges ahead. For example, the plant needs to sign contracts with 200,000 farmers to collect the stocks, way more than just 500 farm owners for the same amount of stocks in the U.S. Wang Jianping of DuPont says he hopes that all stakeholders in the value chain can work together to build up China's biofuel sector. Wang says that will require time and determination. Xin Zheming, CCTV, Lishu County.
