 There is a new range of farm equipment coming to the UK market. It's called FPM and we are lucky enough to get our hands on some. We have got a single rotor rake, we have got a six-star tedder, we have got a disc mower and we've also got, go and have a look at it down here, and a five-star acrobat. Now I've never used one but I'm sure there's lots of grandads out there who have so it's going to be well excited to give that a go. Tested by Machinery Nation. It is the middle of July and I'm here wearing a jumper and it's nearly 12 noon. It should be beautiful sunshine. Anyway the weather forecast now for the next four possibly five days is good. I'm not going to say great, it's good. And we need to get on. We've got a field of grass which is in desperate need of cutting. Now I'd like to have done this four weeks ago but the weather has not been on our side but the thistles have started to come through. It's now taller than the grass. We need the aftergrass for our lambs which are in these little fields here and we need to get it done. So today we are going to cut. It's only just stopped raining about probably an hour ago. The concrete is still damp. Just waiting for that to dry out and then we are going to go for it. We're going to cut, we're going to ted and we're going to fingers crossed make some hay. If not my neighbour is on standby with his round baler and wrapper. So in this video we're going to show you the mower which is there and the tedder. In the next video we'll show you the rake and the acrobat and the baling will be on our other channel which is called find it, fix it, farm it. So make sure you follow on there as well because that's not new machinery. This channel is only for new machinery. So stay tuned let's get mowing and I'll tell you all about fpm. Five Finding Lima The FPM range of farm machinery may be brand new to the UK market, but they have been producing and manufacturing farm equipment for over 60 years, from their purpose-built factory in Serbia, Southeast Europe. FPM specialise in catering for the small to mid-range farmers with a host of different attachments available, from the haymaking equipment we have here, as well as finger bar mowers, flail toppers, rotovators, two-wheel tractors, verge mulchers and more. The FPM range is being distributed in the UK by a company called Farmtech Supplies, who have a wealth of knowledge in the smaller agri-market, and who already distribute several other brands within the smallholder sector. And now with the addition of FPM, they can now also equip the likes of livestock farmers, hill farmers and equestrian operations. Where there once stood either large farm machinery at one end and smallholder equipment at the other, there is now a UK-based company supplying and supporting the middle ground, with a very extensive range of farm machinery and the backup to boot. So the disc mower I have on our tractor today is the FPM DKF 200-5, which as the model suggests, has a 2-metre width cut and 5 cutting discs. They also supply a basic DK range, which start as small as 1.3 metres, but jump up to the DKF range and they go all the way to 3.2 metres with 8 discs. This is a standard straight disc mower, which is mounted on a 3-point linkage and driven by the tractor's PTO, with V-Belt drive down to its main gearbox, powering the better discs. This mower can be used up to 45 degree angles and it is hydronically folding for transport. The grass is on the ground. I am very happy actually, it has gone really well. The thistle is at the top, it did not actually spread down too far into the rest of it. There is one patch out over here and another patch over there, but other than that it is actually not bad grass at all. I am quite pleased with it, it has got a nice shear as they say. So anyway, I think it is time now to leave that to dry overnight and then we will get the tedder out tomorrow. So it is another day and we have got another Sammy, oh yes, now our 110, and we have got behind it our 6 star FPM tedder. So the grass is looking great, I am really happy with how that mower worked yesterday. The smell, I wish you could smell the smell, I wish I could share that with you, but anyway, if you have been haymaking before, you know the smell I am on about. Look at this beautiful FPM 6 star tedder. But we could look at it all day. Let's get on and use it because we need to make the most of that sunshine. But before I jump my gun, now for sake of video purposes, I have adjusted the wheels. So the wheels are at an angle all the way up through. So as I go round my rows, it will kick the grass out into the middle for the first row round. The idea of that is so you don't kick all your grass into your headland or your hedge or the bit you didn't mow because you only just seeded it this year. And yeah, and then after I've done the first row, I'll change all those wheels around. It's quite hard to get that on camera. Hopefully you can see that that's offset from the track there, so I'm hoping I've got that right. I'll go around and that will kick it out into the middle. Personally, I don't think most people bother with that, but I thought for the video purposes, we would do it. If you guys would try to prove a автомa or the process. I will change those wheels. It's hot. The kids are en organizer, but I try to take thoseרכises as well. I'm sure you're a pretty司令. And if you're watching yourUSEIsasy or themetric, we want me to get ready. This is the FPM RAS 600-6, which is a 6-rotor, 6-metre tedder and comes as standard for category 1 and category 2 3-point linkage, with dual landing stands for extra stability. FPM also produce a 4-metre 4-rotor and an 8-metre 8-rotor tedder. These tedders include individual hydraulic folding so that you can lift one side at a time. It also has all the features you have come to expect on a modern tedder, like anti-sway bars, easy change tines, swivel headstock and directional headland wheels, all while utilising their DigiDrive Connect system, adding to easier maintenance and connectivity. Being意图ous Since FPM was founded in 1961, they have strived to stay ahead of the game with cutting-edge machinery and technology, and with their 220 members of staff, they are at the forefront of their market with operations like laser cutting, CNC milling, robot welding, heat treating and gear production. This allows them to produce all of their own componentry and be in complete control of their own manufacturing process from start to finish. With a vast range of equipment and now with the right distribution in the UK with Farm Tech supplies, I believe we'll be seeing a lot more of FPM over the coming years. They are certainly here to make an impression, so don't be surprised if you see them very soon at the dealership or county show near you. So the field is clear, the hay is all in the shed, and as the weather forecast promised, we had a deluge of rain come down the very next day. So now that's out of the way, we can now round up on what my thoughts are of the mower and the tether. Now I think we can all agree that the mower done a fantastic job behind the Sami 80. Now this was meadow grass, it hasn't been cut properly for many years, so it's still going to have some tufts and bits and pieces within it no matter what mower you use. So considering that, it has done a superb job. Now there's a couple of things that I noticed about the mower. One is the smallest disc mower that I have ever used. Now this is a two metre mower, the smallest mower I've ever used is an eight foot disc mower, so you've got a lot more to play with. Now there's a couple of times where I sort of waved away from the line and there's a couple of streaks up through the middle of the field where I missed the grass. But now that's down to my user error, not the machine at all, because the mower actually sort of cuts about 12 inches out from the wheel on this tractor. Now it will all depend on the frame size that you've got on the tractor. But the nice thing about this mower is that you could put this on a small, probably 40 horsepower tractor and you can put it on something which is 110 horsepower if you wanted. The frame size allows you to do that, which I think is a great, great feature. Now another thing that threw me with this mower was the fact when you get to the end of your row, you don't lift it up with your spool like I'm used to, where on mowers I've used before, disc mowers, you get to the end of the line, you lift, pull your spool and you lift the mower up out the way. With this one you lift your linkage up at the end of the line, which is very similar to how a drum mower used to be years ago. Now as I mentioned during the video, this is a two metre mower. Now they start at 1.3 metres and they go all the way up to 3.2 metres. So although this is a smaller one, they also do the bigger ones as well. Now that leads me on nicely to why you would buy this mower. That is that there are so many people out there still now using a 5'6 or 6' drum mower. And this is a much, much better alternative. So the price, how much is this mower going to cost you? Well the recommended retail price is £6,798 plus the VAT. But remember that is the RRP, recommended retail, not necessarily your dealer price. Now the FPM 6 Star Tether. I am in love with this machine. I think it's absolutely brilliant. Let me show you why. Now most 6 rotor tedders are wider than this one. This one is only 6 metres. Let me show you why that is a huge advantage. And there are two reasons why. One is that they are only a metre wide on each rotor. Which means they are closer together. Which means you are covering more ground. The tines are getting closer to each other on your material. So you are leaving a much cleaner path behind. And the second reason is that because they are smaller, the whole frame of the machine is narrower. So if you are in live in Devon like we do, the lanes are very narrow. And you have got bad access pretty much everywhere. So with a narrow machine, it is going to make it easier transporting it. Now most tedders these days you can adjust the wheels so you can go around on your headlands. This is probably the easiest operation I have had to be able to do that. So it is a simple design, but obviously that all relies on how well you are going to grease it and maintain it. If you have had a tether before, you will know the problem I am going to mention now. And that is generally you only get one prop stand to be able to unhitch the machine. Now when they are folded up, that makes them quite unstable. The nice thing about this one, it has got two. Now to have it so that you can swivel while going along, this is probably one of the better designs I have seen. So as you lift it up, it will go back into this section to keep it square on the back. And then it can float from side to side when you are in work. Historically with tedders, I have known it happen a couple of times with different brands and different models. And that is as you are going down your line, your tedder will start to sway. So as you are going down through, one side is trying to catch up with the other all the time. Now with this one, it did not happen once. And all I can put it down to are the anti-sway bars that they have got in. Great design, really good and works perfectly. Now FPM call this DigiDrive and you are probably familiar with this on another machine. But a lot of machines out on the market have got universal joints, which are very high maintenance and need constantly greasing. With these, it is much easier and much easier to maintain. As far as I am aware, most tedders on the market have only got two hydraulic pipes, one for in and one for out. Now on this one, you've got two. You've got one for each side. So on the right hand side, you can fold that down separately to the left hand side. Now that's great if you've got a tractor which has got two spools with two float positions. Now I've got four spools on this tractor, which is great, but only one of them has a float position. So ideally, I need those pipes joined up so I can put it into float and then the tedder will follow the ground much, much easier. So this is a six star. They also do a four star tedder and an eight star tedder. You're probably wondering what the price is. Well, the recommended retail price of this tedder is £11,109. But bear in mind that is the recommended retail price, not necessarily your dealer price. So there we have a great example of one of their tedders and a great example of one of their mowers. And we've still got the raking video to do where we're going to compare a single rotor rake to an Acrobat style rake. So please make sure you subscribe to Better Watcher.
