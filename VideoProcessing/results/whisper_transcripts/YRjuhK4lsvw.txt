 music music music music music music music music what's up guys welcome back to another video today's video is going to be about the top 5 laying breeds in my opinion i've had chickens for about 6 years now if not longer and right now and my flock here i have just about 80 birds including a couple ducks in there but let's get right into it first up on the list here is going to be the red star and this one right here she's about 4 years old and still lays almost every day they're one of my most favorite breeds if not my most favorite since as long as i can remember this is i've always had this chicken i think it was the first chicken i had too so they're great they're gonna lay about 280 to 300 times a year red stars are always good for laying they're one of your most popular ones they go hand in hand with the rhode island red which i'll talk about here in a second but they're very gentle one of the nicest ones they'll come up to you to pet it or whatever very gentle birds most of all of them are nice and good and they're the majority of my egg layers here and i've always enjoyed them and great breed to have and just mentioning the red star or the rodon reds here's one right here and they're gonna lay a little bit better than the red stars but they're still pretty good they're nice and friendly like the red stars and rodon red is probably the most popular egg laying breed you have so they're gonna lay a little bit over 300 eggs a year so you're gonna get some nice big brown eggs everyday almost and they're great to have in the flock they're kinda they're a little more bossy with the other chickens they kinda take a stand with each other but they're a great one to have in there number three here is gonna be the legern and if the rodon red isn't the most popular breed of laying chicken than the legern is they're light and pretty agile they're not the most friendly but they kinda skid around a lot i have a few of these in my flock i'd say around 10 of them i've had them for a while too and they're gonna lay just as much as the rodon red if not better and they're very small birds yet they're gonna lay big white eggs almost every day of the year and even in the cold months they tend to keep laying pushing out eggs every day so they're probably the first egg laying breed you need to get now number four on the list and this is probably one of my most favorite breeds is the buff orpington they're very friendly they go broody often which means they sit on eggs pretty often in the spring months and they lay eggs in the spring and they lay eggs almost every day you're gonna get them in the 250 to 280 range so not as good as some of the other ones but pretty good ones to have and they're a little more of a dual purpose breed if you really need it but they're mainly for laying there and they got a nice golden tint to them i got about six or seven to my flock and they're really nice to have they get along with all the other chickens well and they're kind of bossy to the rooster sometimes but they're they get along with the human pretty well and they're always in the nesting boxes laying eggs and the next one up here is going to be the black astralope any of the astralope breeds are pretty well for egg laying but i like the black astralopes personally i have a few of these in my flock i think four or five and they're going to lay about 250 eggs a year around that range uh they're not the best for hardiness during the winter but summer months they'll pump out those eggs just as good as any of the other breeds on this list and they're a little more feisty on the nesting boxes they go broody pretty often if not more than the buffalo pinkens i actually have three of them on the nest right now trying to fight over some pile of eggs but they lay a nice brown egg color and they're good to have they're going to be at the top of the pecking order in your flock too they kind of boss around some of the roosters and they definitely boss around the hens especially if they get close to their nesting box but they lay great eggs they're a good one to have so those are my top five favorite laying breeds for you guys and they should all do great together they've done good in my flock for past several years and they all work good together you should get over 250 eggs from each bird a year which is great if you want to sell them or eat them and right now i'm getting close to four and a half dozen eggs a day and a lot of those rely on the breeds in this list so thanks for watching and if you want to check out any of the other top five lists of breeds i have go ahead and check them out in the description and i'll see you next time you
