 More and more demands on your time. It may be getting tougher and tougher to get to the grocery store, let alone to get a trip into the farmer's market. Mike Randall meets up with a man whose company brings the farmer's market to your doorstep. We need beets. He figured out a fabulous way to get farm fresh foods to folks faster. Our customers, a wide range of incomes, families, single people. Joshua Bowen started Fresh Fix a couple of years ago, part-time at first. Now I'm doing it full-time with employees. Before he created Fresh Fix, he was a project manager with a computer. Yeah, red peppers, beets, and green squash. I don't think he misses it. Now I'm getting my hands to already work with farmers, and it's a great transition. Joshua works with about 30 local farmers. His customers place their orders online, and Fresh Fix takes it from there. We place orders on Monday. It's all, the call comes in Tuesday. We pack and deliver Wednesday and Thursday, and we deliver directly to homes and offices. If you prefer organic foods, Fresh Fix has you covered. Prices start at $18.50, and all you have to do is go to their website at FreshFix.com to get your Fresh Fix. And your Fresh Fix can go beyond fruits and veggies, way beyond. We have fresh local meat, cheese, eggs, pickles, jams, coffee. Joshua thinks one of the big reasons it's catching on is Fresh Fix is a great time saver for his customers. What is your time worth to go to the grocery store? You can do the most important things in your life, spending time with your family and cooking good food. You can't argue with that. For the Now Buffalo, I'm Mike Randall.
