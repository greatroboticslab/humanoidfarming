 Hello everyone and welcome to another tourism talk. Today I am joined by Pandurang and he's going to talk to us all about agritourism which is a really fascinating growing type of tourism so hopefully this will be a really interesting talk for anyone who is watching and I actually searched for agritourism on Google and it told me that nearly 10,000 people are searching for this every month so it is a growing type of tourism so Pandurang thank you for joining us today and would you like to start off by introducing yourself? Okay thank you Dr. Herli because thank you for this opportunity to speak to your audience and share the knowledge of agritourism what we are doing in India my name is Panduranga Bhagwan Rao Tauri I am born and brought up in farmers family in India a very small town in India I am the fourth generation farmer and the first generation farm entrepreneur we are doing agriculture on 25 acres of land in western region of Baramati Tahsil in Maharashtra India and so this falls under rain shadow area and hence we have built a farm farm to harvest the rain water and that harvested rain water is used for the agriculture partners yes Dr. Herli Okay great so we've got a few questions I will run through so the first one is can you tell us then because I know not everybody is familiar with the term agritourism what does it mean? Dr. Herli agritourism is a very simple concept and we are actually on the you know the borders of agriculture and tourism wherein the tourists from urban cities can come to farm they can live like a farmer they can work like a farmer and they can see various crops they can see various irrigation methods they can see various soil types be along with the tradition of agriculture and see and do new things in agriculture and plus as a farmer he can sell his agricultural produce directly to the urban citizens that is consumers so this is the venture done by the farmer to educate the farm about farming and agriculture to have the entertainment about agriculture for the urban tourists and to sell the agricultural produce so as to have supplementary income and employment generation activities on the farm great that's a really good explanation thank you very much and so as i said before the industry has been growing it has been developing so can you tell us a little bit more about that obviously you've been working in it for a number of years so how has it grown and how has it developed? uh highly what has happened is because all over the world there is a stress on small farms and all over the world almost 80 percent of the farmers are holding small piece of land and hence because of the input cost increase the fertilizer cost has increased the seeds cost has increased the labor workforce cost has increased on the other hand the output and as far as the quantity is concerned and as far as the price is concerned has remained stagnant for almost now 10 years and hence more than 50 percent of the farmers all over the world are of thinking of doing something supplementary to agriculture to generate sustainable income to generate sustainable employment and to generate sustainable livelihood on the farm itself and hence all over the world last almost 50 years agritourism is growing and developing uh in terms of you know the major farms in for example uh australia as far as usa italy they are growing all over the world uh farmers are actually venturing into agriculture agritourism yeah great so it's it's it's really interesting actually i think to see how how much this industry is developing so quickly as well and so yeah so what types of agritourism activities can tourists do what what does an agritourism holiday look like okay uh so when the tourist comes on the farm he has number of activities to do first of all you know he can see the farms he can see various crops on the farm he can see uh eggs of the soils you know on the farm he can work in the farm he can you know water the plants he can weave the plants he can he can sit on the buffaloes he can drive the bullock cart he can drive the tractor and he can wash the buffalo he can sit on buffalo and go around in the farm so there are a young number of activities he can do on the farm itself and plus he can see uh very closely how his food is grown on the farm he can make a farmer friend because henceforth as organization is going to grow uh how i mean we have a concept of a family doctor you know similarly he can have a concept of family farmer and a lot of things he can do he can he can he can do and see new things on the farm from you know from morning to evening uh he can he can be with the farmer and he can see a lot of there is so much of to see and do in the farm and in the farm and in agriculture yeah it's definitely lots and there's lots of different types of farms as well isn't there yes yes each type of farm will have something slightly different to offer as well yes yeah um so which are the biggest in your opinion um or maybe you've got some facts to back this up i don't know but which are the biggest agritourism destinations and what uh what has happened uh see italy is considered as a motherland of agritourism and almost now from 1960s or the first world war and after that 1942 world war the agritourism is increasing day by day today italy has italy has almost more than 22 000 farms who are doing agritourism activities you know similarly in australia uh there are n number of farmers who are doing agritourism activities uh now coming to the you know to the west usa usa in 52 states in usa has agritourism activities they have farm agritourism laws in place government also is supporting for agritourism activities and one country i must say that philippines is very very small country but philippines has the farm tourism policy in place and they are supporting the farmers in terms of the funding for development of agritourism farm and plus for the promotion of agritourism farms in that country so i must say that all over the world more and more countries are coming to in agritourism because of as i told you the the the input cost for the farming is increasing but at the same time the output and the price for the produce is decreasing on the same time so farmers want a next generation of the farmers if we all want them to stay on the farm there has to be a sustainable income and there has to be a sustainable employment at the farm level otherwise the next generation farmers they are going to shift to the urban cities to in search of the job and which is not going to be affordable to neither to farmers and neither to the city city urban dwellers because there is going to be the stress on urban infrastructure if all rural people come to the urban cities and hence to answer your question is the italy australia usa philippines and india for that matter because in the government uh have declared that the farmers income has to double till 2023 and hence uh government uh with their committee has has researched and they have come to the point that agritourism is one of the activity where farmer can double his income so in states in india as well for example maharashtra maharashtra has taken lead by declaring agritourism policy and today maharashtra state in india has more than 1000 farms and farmers who are actually hosting tourists on their farm and generating income as well as employment and as well as sustainable livelihood through agritourism activities second state in india is punjab and likewise there are other states they are following the footsteps of maharashtra and punjab and helping the farmers to develop agritourism farms on their on their on their fields so heli to answer your question is all over the world agritourism is growing and we're at very fast rate because you know urban dwellers they want to come and also stay on the farm and enjoy the farming oh so what sorry this wasn't a pre-prepared question it's just something i've thought of now what kind of people will go on and and take part in agritourism is it is it older people younger people wealthy people is is there a type yes there are there is a type finally because uh say when we launched agritourism concept in india in 2003 uh that time we did a market research and in that market research we found that 43 percent of the urban indians they don't have relatives any relation relatives left in the villages so now if we want them to come to the farm and see the farm where they we are going to go so here is the farmer with his agritourism activities he can host urban tourists on the farm and to answer your question there are different types of aggregate agritourism tourists who are actually coming to the farms one is senior citizens second is one of the groups of for example the the family family groups where they have the small kids because the the older generation they want to show their kids uh what is farming what is crops what is soil what is irrigation so they are also coming in so the corporate groups are also coming in because they are fed up having a monthly meeting in the air condition rooms in the in urban cities so they want to come to the farm and have their monthly meetings have their quarterly meetings and the farm itself and plus there are festivals in agriculture so the festivity events are held up on agritourism farms where people are coming and see the harvesting festival they want to join in sewing festival they want this there are a lot of festivals like kite festival come to the farm and fly the kites we have in india very big international kite festival happening every year so the festival event of the tourist the group tourists and plus the family tourists and in india in india in mandy in the state of maharashtra we have made it for the students from grade five to ten grade we have made it government has made it compulsory to have at least one educational tool to the agritourism farm so that they can learn whatever they in the in the theory they are learning because in the test book students are learning about agriculture they are learning about soil they are learning about crops they are learning about agroclimatic zones agro climatic zones but they they are they don't they are not able to see and go in the farm so government educational department has made it compulsory for the students to go and see what they are learning in the textbook so the educational tourist educational tour is one of the types of tourist groups families and corporates these are the types of tourists they are coming to the farm and enjoying the agritourism activities that's really interesting and and really interesting research as well so you've talked a little bit like about this so what is the agritourism industry like in india what does it look like agritourism is still in a very nascent stage in a very early stage in india because being as an agricultural country almost more than 80 percent of the population in india it depends on you know somewhere or other on agricultural produce so we have you know majority of the population in india they are based on agriculture so that is why it took so many years to develop an agritourism concept in india but yes from 2000 onwards agritourism is growing in india for that matter there were only one or two farms who were doing agritourism activities in india now it has reached to more than 3000 farms in india in india and slowly because the state of maharashtra has taken the lead by declaring the agritourism policy and as i told you punjab and other states also are actually coming forward and are doing agritourism activities now as i told you because in 2015 government of india is coming with the government of india is coming with the draft policy of tourism as well as the agricultural ministry of tourism government of india have declared that the farmer has to have double the income by 2023 and by the way of research the agritourism has found one of the agritourism has found one of the activities where the farmer can double his income by doing the tourism activities so dr. hailey the agritourism is growing leaps and bounds in india and a lot of farmers are coming to agriculture because in india last 15 years the price for the produce and the quantity has remained stagnant the gdp the contribution of agriculture in the gdp has remained stagnant for last 10 years and the contribution in the gdp is decreasing day by day of agriculture because of many reasons out of that major reasons are rain because there is no consistent rainfall throughout india in india is a 90 percent of the farm depending on agriculture depending on rain for the agriculture plus the produce the day by day the produce is decreasing and the price for the produce is not guaranteed in india and moreover there is a labour cost labour problem nobody wants to work in the farm and that is the reason the stagnant the the contribution of the agricultural in the gdp has remained constant or decreasing day by day from almost 50 percent to it has decreased to almost 15 16 percent into a 90 20 22 so that is the reason uh agritourism is bound to increase in india and i think uh the farmers and uh the policy makers in india should come forward and should support uh agritourism uh the farmers wow that's that's really interesting how you've got all the uh the sort of government initiatives and the drive uh sort of the agriculture industry and agritourism because obviously it's so important isn't it as well you know we we do need farmers and we need them to operate um and it i think this is a great example of sustainable tourism too isn't it so yeah yeah really great so oh sorry that writing's really small there i'm not sure why it's been so small what do you think the future of agritourism looks like uh future is very bright because the day by day the urbanization is going to grow all over the world if you talk you talk about the matter of india the the the rate of urbanization in india is at least almost 57 percent so 57 percent of the population and the cities have become urbanized in india and as and when the urbanization is going to grow the activities like agritourism will be in great demand and uh that is the reason that is it is because as i told you when we did the survey in 2003 we found 43 percent of the urban tourists or urban citizens they don't have relatives left in the india or the villages uh it is now 2021 so almost 17 years have passed when we did the survey last so today it must have i mean as close to 50 percent so one person uh in one person in two you know two person they don't have you know the farms and the relatives in agriculture so where they go where they will go and see the agriculture where they will go and see the crops where they will go and see the soils and irrigation methods and where they will see and go and play with the animals domestic animals sit on the buffalo drive the bullock car drive the cactus so and hence the agritourism has a very very bright future uh uh in india and across the world because uh we are actually uh are having uh like the last month in may in the month of may on 15th and 16th may 16th may as considered as world agritourism day and on that day we uh conducted a conference on international conference on agritourism and the theme was uh the ruler uh woman sustainable entrepreneurship development through agritourism so we got good response across the world almost 25 countries participating in that and 12 countries uh speakers were there assembled to speak on the ruler woman entrepreneurship opportunities through agritourism and that uh that uh the conference was hosted by uh uh uh uh ca revati taurei murkute and it was a very very internationally you know accepted conference and very well and not done in a professional manner so to answer your question agritourism has a bright future not only in india not only in asia but throughout the world and i think that's really great to hear because it is such a a a great form of tourism that helps not only environmentally but socially as well and so i think that's really great to hear and hopefully we'll see good things going into the future so if there is anybody who is thinking about maybe taking an agritourism holiday or maybe they want to go work in agritourism is there any advice that you would give them yes uh advice is that because um uh as in the last almost 30 minutes we are saying that agritourism has a bright future so for the farmers yes definitely uh agritourism has a bright future come into agritourism if they have the piece of land start the agritourism activities now it will give you a sustainable income it will give you a sustainable employment and it will give you a sustainable life for the urban tourist because if you see the covid 19 situation or covid 19 pandemic situation all over the world i think next one and a half year you are not able to travel across the world and go for the international holidays so agritourism has opened the doors for you you as a city dweller and staying in urban countries come go to the farm see the farm see the farmers life a new like a farmer work like a farmer eat like a farmer and enjoy the agriculture traditions and cultures what you know that farm has to offer uh the countries like india because it is more than 5000 years of civilization and mainly every india is the agriculturalist country so in every 12th mile we have different cultures we have different traditions we have different you know crops so there is so much of to see in india because we have we have a jungle we have a sea we have snow we have traditions we have so much of history so much of geography so much of nature to showcase as far as india is concerned because agritourism will actually our great great leader uh respected mahatma gambis used to say that the india lives in its villages because that is where the traditions lies that is where the true india lies and we have more than six lakh villages uh uh in india across the across india right from karsmir to karnakamari so uh when you when you come to the farm and when you want to considering the holidays we welcome you with the both hands open arms come to the farm and be with us and learn the traditions and more importantly uh learn where the food is coming from the the everyday food what you eat on the table uh just come and see on the farm how much time for a week to grow and come to your table how much time it takes for a rice to sow and to harvest and to come to your on on your table for the milk for the crops for the vegetables so how much time it takes how much water it takes how much efforts it goes in the farming come and see by your own eyes so that you will start respecting the farming community across the world because mind you if farmer doesn't do the farming there is no pills in the world it has been developed that you will take one pill for the breakfast two pills for the uh you know lunch and three pills for the dinner so farmer has to work on the farm and then and only you will get food on your table to fill up your stomach and pull up fill up so respect farmers that respect when it will come you when you will go and see the farming when you'll go and see the efforts you know put in by the farmers so agritourism is not only about having the income or sustainable employment it is way of traditions it is way of life for the farmers to work in the farm and to see it so farming is the only community or the farming is the only sector which has been left out by this pandemic otherwise if farmer would have stopped working in pandemic believe me what would have happened all us all of the citizens who are staying in our money urban cities so there is an opportunity for everybody either you are either you are a you know the tourism teacher either you are a marketing professional either you are a farmer either you are tourism students everybody has the opportunity uh in agritourism because agritourism sector is so vast tourism itself is so vast agriculture is is itself is too vast so both this sector they are the primary the biggest sector you know across all sectors uh business sectors so it has uh you know many fold many uh capacity to absorb uh everybody's you know needs and demands so to uh to to sum up what i can say is uh uh as i told you because why everybody wants to do agriculture or agritourism is to keep farming the family and family in the farm and i think that's a great way to sum it up thank you so much i think that i think it's a really interesting topic and as you pointed out that the pandemic has it is perhaps limited international travel but one thing that it has done is it has encouraged people to embrace new and different types of tourism and the outdoors a lot more and to to appreciate the great outdoors in a way that people didn't necessarily always appreciate before so i i agree with you that obviously within india it's going to be um probably just domestic tourists for now um but whether it's domestic or international there's definitely a a new desire to kind of move in that direction i think and so hopefully we will see good things coming from the agritourism industry and it's it's definitely something to keep an eye on and now i know that nearly 10 000 people are searching for this a month i think i should probably write a blog post about it so i will add that to my checklist and uh i'll have to run it past you to check that all the information is accurate because obviously you are the expert in this field not me so thank you so much for the talk um do you have any any last comments or anything you'd like to make i think uh dr heli i must uh from bottom of our heart i thank you for this opportunity uh given to us to speak to your audience because uh uh uh farming farmers and farming community is seen as the the last man in the row so you have actually uh you know hold up our hand and you have bought us in the in the first man in the row and giving this opportunity uh you have allowed us to uh uh talk about agritourism and you have allowed us to uh share our agritourism knowledge to rest of the world so uh thank you on behalf of all the farmers in india uh for giving this opportunity to us and as i told you uh we want to do or we are doing agritourism uh just to keep farm in the family and family in the farm oh well it's my it's my pleasure to
