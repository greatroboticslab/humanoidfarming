 What's the best tractor? Dream tractor. Dream tractor. So my dad and I bought the John Deere 8110 together. I don't know what the best green tractor is. I am not a tractor geek. No. For instance, shout out to Kinsey. You know, like they make a heck of a planter, right? They do. But you don't want to run that planter because it's blue. All we're doing is hurting ourselves because if we continue to consolidate, you know, and go to one of these, you know, if there's no spice, we're losing. You know, if we don't have options, we lose. If you ask me what's the better tractor, it's going to be the red one. You know, row crop tractors, probably going to lean towards green. You know, what do I think the best combine is? I really kind of like them yellow ones. I really kind of like the yellow ones. Chore tractors, I will say that if you're a cattle guy and that tractor is going to die on your farm, Kubota.
