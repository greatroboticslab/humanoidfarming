 Hello! Are you a farmer who has just sourced new stock of animals at your farm or you are getting ready to receive a new stock or batch of livestock at your farm? If you fall within any of these two categories or even not, still this video is for you because you are going to need that information. And by the way, you are watching Farming in Africa YouTube channel also on Facebook, on YouTube, on Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, all the social media platforms. We love the world of agriculture but particularly the livestock industry. In today's video, we are going to show you how to receive new stock of animals at your farm. The preparations you need to have ready to have those animals. I am Nadia and I am not going to be doing this video alone because I am right here at the Semeshire Learning and Development Farm and obviously I have my farm manager Godfrey right here with me who is going to walk us through what you need to get ready to receive your animals. As always, I do hope that I will ask all of the questions you have on your mind but if I don't, let's engage in the comment section because I always come here and I will come get all of the answers to you. Okay? We love you and let's do this together. Hi Godfrey! Hello! The sun! Chale, chale, chale! You're welcome! I'm good! I mean, what am I supposed to say? Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! And I'm going to be able to get to the The sun is desirating me. How is everything? Yeah, we are doing fine. Nice! So today when we walked in, I saw a fulfillment center as we call it or even sometimes a sales yard. Yeah. And my first thought was, why? Why have you intentionally allowed this to grow so high? Yes. So, this serves as a sales yard or fulfillment center also as quarantine. Oh, nice! To get new in case we have new goats on the farm. We keep them here for some time for about two weeks, three weeks. Monitor them to see how they are doing in terms of feeding, their health. Yeah. Before we move them to the main farm to add it to our goats. Wow. So, yeah. So that's why we have this. And this serves as grazing food for them while they are here. So, yeah. That's why we have it there like this. That reminds me of something we've been advocating for that always have your feed ready as a livestock farmer. Before you enjoy Yeah. So, yeah. You can reduce your animals to their place. Yes. Very true. Very true. So, if you're a new farmer that you want to buy goods from us or even if you are sourcing the goods from anywhere. Yeah. You need to get their feeding ready. Mm-hmm. Their paddocks, where they will go and graze everything should be ready. Yeah. So, as you can see like this, we have this grazing field for them. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it. Don't worry. Yeah. So, this is about 15 by 25 feet square. 15 by 25 feet square. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. And how many animals can this paddock sustain? So, this paddock is just about seven to ten animals. Not too many. But at the back, we have a larger grazing field for them. I see. So, yes. But this can just hold about ten goats. Now, let's play with some numbers. Yeah. If I allow 15 goats in here. Yeah. How long will it take before they level all of this I'm seeing? So, they can take about just two weeks. Two weeks? Yes. About just 14 days and everything will go down. And if you see it, it will be like even with it. Wow. It will graze it to the very down. Wow. Yeah. Roughly on the average two weeks, everything would be down. Yes. Yes. Yes. That reminds me. If you think that you've seen this at your farm, so you are covered for the next six months and you have less than 20 goats, please, it's not going to work at all. No, it's not enough. It's not enough at all. Average two weeks, all of this would be level. All of this, yes. Yes. Wow. Anyway, there is something you mentioned about quarantine, depending on where you are watching me from, I don't know. But talk to me about that because I know we usually advise that when you receive new stock, don't immediately add them to your existing or old stock. Yes. Please, throw more light on that for me. Yes. So this, as you can see, is a quarantine pen. Okay. It depends on the situation that we are in. If we are ready to sell, we bring them here. If we don't have any more, but we have new stock, we keep them here as quarantine. So with a quarantine, you actually need to train your goats when they come to the farm meal. You need to what? To train them before you move them there. Wow. Training in terms of how you feed them. Okay. How you actually be with them, you manage them. So you need to be training them and giving them the right feed at the right time, letting them know when to go out, how many hours they spend outside and all of that. Oh. So this quarantine is also says as like training them, giving them some sort of training before you move them. Hey, they're just a very multifaceted center. Yes. They are in a new environment. Yes. So you need to let them adjust to that, to what, the environment that they've come. Talking of adjustments, what are some of the peculiarities you observe with new stock? I'm just curious. So when they come fresh like that, some of them are a bit very slow, shy. Okay. So by two weeks, one week, two weeks, they will start being okay with others because maybe they are not from the same farm. Yes. Yes. So when they need to be... Oh, so they know themselves. They will get to know themselves with time. I was saying, those who were both from the same farm, when they see themselves. Yeah. Yeah. They will see them. Mostly when they come from the same farm, they will be together. Okay. Yes. You see them sleeping together. Yeah. So when they come fresh like that, some of them become a bit shy. Yeah. So once you are feeding them and when they are shy or when they don't want to feed with others, they will just isolate themselves. It means you need to put it back to where they are feeding so that they will all feed together. Wow. Yeah. And have we encountered instances where some of them came and they were very weak because of the distance they had traveled? Not too weak, but they wanted to relax. They wanted to relax. And then gain energy. So when you see them in that state, what do you do to revive them, to give them some energy? Yeah. So when you bring them first to the farm, you need to give them glucose solution so that they can gain the energy that they've lost whilst either on the track or... Is it a standard practice for a farmer who probably is looking forward to receiving a new stock? Is it a standard practice? Yes, it is. Yes. You should get the glucose solution for them because they've lost energy because they've been in a track or even in a plane for some time. Okay. So you need to get that solution for them so that they can just regain their energy. Encourage everyone of you out there, full of farming in Africa on TikTok, YouTube. Please, if I subscribe to the YouTube channel, then you'll get a lot of knowledge. Thank you and remain blessed. Okay. Yeah, but they don't come really very weak like they cannot even walk, but you can see that they are tired. Yeah, tired. Yes, I think tired is the word. So, yeah. So glucose solution. Yeah. And you give that, they drink it, you change it, you give them again for about three times before you move them to fresh water. So by that time, you will even see that they are not taking the glucose solution again when they are okay. Then with that, they will arrive and get their energies back and then they come back to the fresh water. Wow. That reminds me also of something I have heard you talk about before that when you receive new stock as a farmer, typically don't feed the animals fresh forage. Yes. Now, you just mentioned water and in my head fresh forage also has water. Yeah. So can you throw more light on that and what exactly you meant by that? So it's not advisable to just give them the fresh once they come to the farmer first. You need to start giving them with the hay because with the hay is dried and then you start moving them to the grazing field with time. Like not, it should be gradual. Yeah. It shouldn't be like, once they come to the farm, you move them to the fresh. You should start giving them with hay for some time and then you move them gradually to the fresh. That can also, you can have times to that. You can do the first day 30 minutes. Then you move to one hour. The next day you can do one and 30 minutes to see how they are doing with the fresh. Because the fresh has a lot of water, a lot of moisture in that. When they take it too much, they might start having diarrhea. Yeah. So you should be gradual process. Wow. Before you move them to that. Wow. Talking about fresh, you know people ask us, is the Semencia grass the only fresh forage we feed our animals? Today I want you to just follow us around a bit, okay? Before farm manager Godfrey Devin comes in. As you can see, this definitely is a paddock purposely cultivated with Semencia grass. Yeah. But here at our farm, we also allow some of the natural plants and grasses around us to thrive. If you can see where my hand is, these are all different kind of forages, right? Yes. Do you see the goats munch on them? Yeah, they do. So with the grazing field, they can have… Oh, let's go there too. Yeah. If you are planting for grazing and there are some other weeds, once the grass is established, you can leave those weeds. If they like to eat it, they will eat it. Oh, please repeat that. Yeah. So if you plant purposely for paddocks and there are some weeds, once the grass are established and there are some different weeds, Yeah. If they would like to eat it, they will eat it and then if they will not eat, they will leave the rest. Wow. So once the grass is established, you don't need to be weeding in between the grasses again. So if I am a farmer and I have purposely cultivated, let's say, my cementia grass, but alongside there are other plants, what you are saying is I should allow the plants to thrive. Yes. And see which ones the animals would eat. Yeah. So through that selection, then I can weed off the ones the animals don't like. Yes. And even if it is very soft like this, when they graze on it and it goes very down, that one will go off. It will die. Anyway. Then the cementia grass will take over. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This particular grass, I have seen it at a couple of places. Is this something the animals like? Some of them do eat it. Some of them. Yes. Some also do not eat it. So that's why we left it. When they come, if they will eat it, they will eat it because it's also fresh for them. Yeah. Yeah. Because we're asking is it only the cementia grass that they eat? No. If you have any field that there's grass on it, they can still graze on that. They can still graze. I mean, at the end of the day, they are herbivores. So like Godfrey said, let the plants around you thrive and let the animals select which ones they want. Yeah. You would you would see it, right? Yes. Anyway, remember this video is actually on the preparations you need to make as a farmer to receive new stock or to welcome new stock. What other points or measures come to mind? Yeah. If I'm going to receive new stock. Okay. So your pen, you need to disinfect the pen. Oh, so you need to clean the pen that they will be in for the next two to three weeks. Disinfect it with disinfectants before they come in there. I see. Is that particular disinfectant? So we have patolite that you can also use to mix it with water. Then you just spray around. Wow. But the last thing I would ask you about is how long should a farmer quarantine fresh stock or batch of animals before we add them to the existing flock? How long? Yeah. So they can be in the quarantine for about seven to 21 days. Wow. Yes. That's two about from a week to like three weeks. So between a week and three weeks. Yes. So all is how you study. Let's face this way. You study to see, to see the adjustments to the new environment. Oh. And then if you see they are all doing very well. Yeah. Even after two weeks, you can move them. But first, when they come to the farm fresh, you need to isolate them from the old flocks. Yeah. And not even necessarily because they are carrying diseases, but because like you said, you need to train them. You need to train and monitor them how even they are feeding. Yeah. Before you move them to the other. Beautiful. Oh, thank you so much for the knowledge shared. I know you've shared a lot, but still the last thing I would let you tell us is that one thing the farmer should look out for between the one week and three weeks or between the seven days and 21 days. For me to say that, okay, I am confident that now I can move this flock to join the existing flock. Yes. What's that one thing to look out for? How they feed. How they feed. Yes. Wow. So you need to really monitor how they feed. Okay. If they are feeding very well. Because no matter how heavy they come, if they have like 100 kg and you don't feed them very well or they don't eat well. Yeah. They will gradually, their weight will reduce and their immune system will become very weak. Yes. It means they will be easily attacked by diseases. Yes. So how they feed should be your number one point. If they are feeding with what you are giving them. Yeah. They should be feeding with it so that they can actually maintain their weight and even grow above the weight that they came with. They came with. Yes. Oh, thank you so much. As always, there is no end to the knowledge that I receive whenever I visit this farm and especially farm manager Godfrey. I love something you said about how you feed them. It's very important. Look at, look at that very well. Yes. Make sure the weight they came with. Either you've been able to maintain that within that observation period or they've even exceeded that. Then you can tell that you are doing a good job. Yes. It reminds me of something Fred always says that if you don't give them proper feed, you would end up feeding them medication, which is not what we want. Very true. We have all the medications for livestock, but hey, we are the ones who will tell you that focus on feeding them properly. Else you end up giving them medicine as food. My name is Nadia. And today I came to talk once again from the knowledge of farm manager Godfrey, who lives here at the Semeshire Lending and Development Farm. Guys, let's engage under the comment section. And hey, don't forget to subscribe. Yes. To the Farming in Africa YouTube channel. Also follow us on Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok, Instagram. Yes. These platforms are not just for entertainment. There are people there searching for knowledge to do certain things right like this. So, hey, let's do it together. This is Godfrey and he shared what you learned today with you. We love you. See you in another video. Bye bye. Bye bye.
