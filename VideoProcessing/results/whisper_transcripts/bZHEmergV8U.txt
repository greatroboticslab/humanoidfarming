 As far as the commodities, Tim, the agricultural commodities, I think that the future, the long-term future, and I'm talking about from three, starting in about two to three years and going out eight to ten years from there, I think the long-term future of the agricultural commodities looks good, even though they tend to be a little bit of a hedge against inflation as well. But there's other factors in consumption. There are fundamentals to agricultural commodities, like people want to eat, like shortages around the globe due to floods, hurricanes, droughts, so on. So there's some fundamentals going back to supply-side economics and supply and demand kinds of things that there isn't in gold. So I like commodities. I like commodities. They've been beaten up for a long time. We had a good run for the first five to six months this year. That's fallen off a little bit. But nonetheless, I like agricultural land in particular, but I like agricultural futures for the long term. It's not a short-term play, in my opinion. So that's kind of where I am on that.
