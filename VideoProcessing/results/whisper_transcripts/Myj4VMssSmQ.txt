Howto & Style
 All right, well this hill has a slope. Slopes don't like water because water likes to run off of them. And the water in this case is running down the hill, onto the sidewalk, and into the drain. And it's carrying with it my topsoil, it's carrying my nutrients, the fertilizer I just put down, and that fertilizer, instead of helping my plants, is going into the ocean or you know into the storm drain. It's not doing me a whole lot of good down there. So I want to stop that and the way I'm going to do that is by installing the dirt lockers. And the dirt lockers will create a level planting area for individual plants or a whole series of plants that will go across this this slope and will be able to maintain the water all along this slope. And as you can see, this is just one small area. Look how much water and dirt loss we're getting here if this were a heavy rain or something like that. So the dirt locker is going to keep the water where we want it. It's going to keep the nutrients, the fertilizer, and soil at the plants and growing, helping to grow what we want to grow here.
