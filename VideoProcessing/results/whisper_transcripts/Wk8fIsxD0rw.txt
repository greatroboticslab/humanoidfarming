 so this will be a little bit of a different video than my bee videos but don't worry those will still be coming out every friday but i wanted to get some more videos of farming slash homesteading and this is something i've really needed to do for quite a while if you can see all the weeds behind me this is my upper pasture and it is weedy now i haven't gotten the cows on it until very recently that's why it's so bad partially but i also haven't brush hogged yet this year it's well overdue and i'll be taking care of that today as well as going over a few hacks to help keep your pasture well maintained and abundance of grass for your animals to graze on one thing we do is i always leave at least roughly 16 feet between the fence line and the tree lines um there's actually more most of the way around but minimum i keep 16 feet between the fence and the trees and that's just so i can get around with the brush hog all the way around my fence it makes maintenance far easier and you can see here the line where i brush hog today and the long grass outside the fence there i uh keep enough room so i can mow this with our zero turn mower i weave in and out of the fence line and that way so i never really i almost never have to weed whack around our fence line the mower can do it in like five ten minutes it would probably take me an hour or two work to do with a weed whacker so it's a major time saver and i'm a lot more motivated to do it with the lawn mower than a weed whacker because i hate weed whacking all right hack number two kind of obvious but mow your pastures you have to think of it this way if you were a cow what would you rather eat this tall two or three foot tall thorny weedy grass mixture or this nice short at eight to twelve inch tall green luscious grass almost weed free uh easy pickings the cows mainly graze right around the fence line where i mow because it's all grass it's weed free and they don't have to be picky or choosy where if they eat through any of this you'll see spotty areas where they graze some where they found a nice plot of grass they'll eat that and then leave the grass around the weeds that are mixed in so it's a lot more work for them to choose where if you mow it and brush hog it and you keep it eight to twelve inches tall um six minimum then it'll grow back faster more lush and you'll have a lot less weeds and the cows will uh get a lot more out of your pastures than uh what they are right now so hack number three brush hogging and maintaining your pastures will also keep out invasive plants that could be dangerous to you and your animals so behind me right here these yellow flowers uh i grew up calling it hogweed but my wife had corrected me half a million times that it is wild parsnip and you do not want to get that on your skin mostly when it's daylight outside the uh oils in it will actually burn you so keeping your pastures well maintained will also get rid of that i've seen it grow anywhere to eight feet tall and uh it's pretty nasty stuff you want to stay away from but maintaining your pastures keeping them nice and short for the grass to grow will also keep out some of those invasive species you really don't want to mess with so hack number four split and rotate your pastures now your grass will grow back much faster if you only graze it down to six maybe four minimum but i believe the standard they look for is six inches if you keep your grass about six inches and then rotate your cows off that pasture to a new one your grass will actually grow back within a week or two and you can graze that pasture again so putting cows on 12 inch grass grazing down to like an average of six obviously your cows aren't going to be too picky and pull out a ruler to measure where they've been grazing um to make sure they hit that minimum and then move on so just walk out on your pasture if you're still looking like most of the grass is eight to 12 inches tall keep them on it it looks like you're getting down to two or four inches across your whole pasture move those cows to a new pasture as soon as possible because depending on weather that pasture can bounce back pretty quick but if you over graze and graze it down to nothing that pasture is going to take several weeks and you just lost a ton of grazing in that pasture for that summer so now since i just got done telling you not to over graze your pastures hack number five don't be afraid to over graze your reclaimed pastures so this pasture here was far worse than the pasture i just mowed it for uh weeds but this was my sacrifice lot over the winter nobody told the cows that hey pasture season it's over stop grazing so this was over grazed down to absolutely nothing just an inch or two of grass but doing that they also ate a lot of the weeds when they were first coming up as little baby weeds now the grass was able to come back pretty strong and take most of this over i do need to brush hog this and take up the rest of the weeds and kick the cows off it for a while so it can really truly come back as good pasture land obviously because angus and forest can hide over there behind that burdock's bush right there just fine and you can barely see them so weeds are a little tall but they're few and far in between because this pasture was over grazed and in doing so actually reclaimed this as a pretty nice pasture for future grazing now bonus tip and thank you very much for watching my video uh just do the best you can because in the end any maintenance is better than no maintenance at all just do the best you can mow a little bit of your pasture or weed whack around the fence line the cows will clean it up maybe even just over grazed pastures and rotate them um it will hurt your overall yield in the end but if that's the best you can do that's what you have to work with and that's what you have to do so go from there
