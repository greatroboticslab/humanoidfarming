 Let's see what we can harvest from the backyard tonight. Let's start with eggs. We got six today. A dozen eggs in two days. I have a potato plant here that I did not plant. I did plant potatoes here last year. I feel like I left a potato from last year and I got this volunteer plant. Nice. Look at this little guy. Two, three. That's a wonky one, but four. Okay, I'm thinking that's it. Honestly, they're pretty decent size too. Next up, let's check on the corn. Look at that. Half a dozen here of corn. Cheese. In my last video, I told you guys how I typically give all of my sunflower heads to my chickens, but I'm actually going to save this one and roast these seeds. This is honeydew. Oh, and this one cracked. This one also cracked. We keep having influxes of rain. That one cracked really bad, so I'll probably just save this for the chickens. We actually got three honeydew. We got two cucumbers and we might actually have a loofah. Let's rip this off. What a beautiful loofah sponge. I know I have a few tomatoes. Those are some pretty tomatoes. I'm gonna grab all these cayennes that are ready. All of this off of 2,000 square feet. Bye, guys.
