 ...taps to any forest use. I think we're all familiar, you know, that these are complex issues. There's a lot of details when we look at people's perceptions of forests and people's use of forests and how they feel about this type of indigenous administration and use. And now you have land invasions, cattlemen coming in and taking, seizing or buying land from those people. Sometimes they call them invasions. Other people are mad because they say, well, the tribal people or the tribal leaders are actually selling these lands. Okay? Behind their backs. Okay? And then you have the old versus young. Something we really have to deal with, I think, the distrust of the elders, the problems with communication. The elders also are mad at the younger people saying they don't communicate well with us. They go to school now. They speak Spanish. We don't. We don't trust them. There's a language issue here, too. These are two tribal leaders here. The man in a blackish coat and the other man in a striped shirt. Talking with each other about possibly tapping these truths for resin used to make turpentine in the United States. The prices and whether to do it or whether not to do it. A couple guys from the university there in Noé and Yadar who helped me out with this. And Noé and Yadar are here talking about this. And as you can see, there's these ugly plastic bags tapped to the trees there. They're tapping these for resin. This is an Easter tap, along the plant trees for resin in the United States decades ago. This has come back to a significant area near the Honduran border of Nicaragua. And people are really confused about this. About the health of the trees. They're not satisfied with the money. But there's a great deal of poverty in this area. Poverty is very acute. And you have these camps here. Okay, well I'll have to finish that. We have these camps here. Very interesting situation. And charcoal making too, again, for urban areas. Brady Watson, by the way, who reportedly passed away rather young, planted and reforested some of these pine forests. And there's your deer meat right there. So, to sum up here, we don't have time to go into the Mayatna. But they're dealing with illegal timber sales. The same thing. Some are practicing agroforestry. And we have some heroes such as Art Pence here, right here. I guess I'll finish with her. She's working in her fabulous home gardens and forestry systems. And hoping some of these resources will come back in the areas where the villages are growing and how the human populations really grow. So, these growing human populations had a lot of socioeconomic change having to do with the forest and their lives. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. The year of climate change, or three years ago, they always name it. Each year in the country they give a specific name. People think that changes in tree fruiting, changes in vegetation now may be due to climate change. And obviously these people are very observant, much more on these plants than we do. It's interesting that the lack of fruit production recently in these stands, these common common trees, which are very productive fruit trees, fruit that people eat and sell, people are saying this is caused by climate change. So, we don't really have any studies to link this to climate change. But it shows how aware people are. Of course, they're very, very aware of their environment. And what's been happening is changing markets. This happens all over, I think, in places that we work. Fiber used for traditional weaving of fishnets or hammocks or strain and rope is used now from this Chambira tree. This is common in the western Amazon, completely absent in the eastern Amazon. The really superior, really strong fiber here is used now for tourist elements. We see a lot of this, I think, in areas we work now. Efforts to conserve the forest or green products, ecologically friendly products. These, of course, are not native traditional practices. These are things that are making for markets in the United States. You can go on the internet and see these things. This is the way they market them. And again, we have to deal with it as concerned people here in this society. How do we market these things? I think it's important. And how do we, the real contradiction, trying to sell something and trying to tell the truth. I'm not a very good salesperson. I'm a horrible actor. In terms of agroforestry systems, here's my economic body here. Of course, I have a lot, but this is Jorge Sapleen-Sutha, who unfortunately is no longer a problem here. Agroforestry systems like this, that have 55 different plant species, are becoming more scarce. People are urbanizing, young people are urbanizing. Young people are not terribly interested in this. I think young reed-ranials would rather be here at this conference than working in a field like this. It's easy, it's too easy for me to say I'd rather be there. There's 55 different species in this garden. I took this photograph probably about 30 years ago, maybe longer, when a hill post was being built out in a village. And this man, you know, who, though Lucas, who passed away too, was angry that a hill post was coming to the village because he said, Look, I know all about medicine. I don't need these silly doctors who wear white clothing and have these bandages and tape and do all these stupid things. I can cure you. And he asked me to do it. I got some notebooks and some pens and pencils and some bottles. And he bought Lucas remedies here and started readying out all the people that he visited and all the people that visited him. And I said, Look, I can be a doctor too. You know, we don't need these people. And, you know, it was so interesting with Lucas and several others. When we talked about deforestation and we talked about scarcity of resources, he would always get a twinkle in his eye and say, It's out there. Those plants are out there. I know a few of us know, but not too many of us know. He was well aware of the fact that the younger people really didn't know or maybe didn't really care about these medicinal plants. They were more interested in going to the city and going to the disc attack, as we would say back then. So they recognized scarcity of resources and they recognized skill, which I think is in finding them, which of course is incredibly important and needs to be documented. What's been happening recently, both in these two areas I'm presenting, the Western Amazon and in Nicaragua and Central America, is urbanization, the need for cash, and the creation of charcoal, a non-tamor force product. We were just talking about that. These prices are going up and charcoal just competes with fossil fuel, basically kerosene prices for fuel. Charcoal also compared to traditional agriculture is much less labor intensive. Two people can make 100 sacks of charcoal usually in less than a couple weeks of labor, or roughly about two weeks of labor, and it pays fairly well. And what's happening is charcoal is being made in the floodplain. You can see the river in the background, that's the Twyla River. Coombs and Burt did a nice, really nice study on charcoal making, and they kept referring to it as an upland activity, and how the upland areas produce better charcoal, have better tree species, better conditions for making charcoal. But actually, if you go to the floodplains now, they're making charcoal all over. These are just two species. This is the termalia, we call them yellow charcoal in the foreground there. A really good species for charcoal. So charcoal making has really changed in terms of where it's going. It's simply more ubiquitous, it's simply more common. And people will use very inferior species too on the floodplain. These Inga species here on the other on the left, it's a cheap type of charcoal. But again, it makes you quick money. The other species on the right is a very good quality wood, good quality charcoal. And part of the problem in this area of the western Amazon is this interesting but also sad mix of the drug trade and cocaine, violence, the military, but also the creation of a lot of protected areas. A lot of restrictions, a lot of tension. This is the according of the Sula National Park, which was created basically without anybody's knowledge. We have deliberate strategy, political strategy to get through legislation in this way. In the Biago River Valley, you're probably familiar with the drug trade coming out of there. That's gone up and down from a great deal of eradication of cocoa plantains to malage resurgence. There will probably be more eradication than there will be another resurgence. People have become really desperate, but unfortunately too they become confused and distracted about the role of the forest and the actual resources in their lives due to this type of conflict and politics. And young people go to the cities. This is one of the few photographs I could take in this village in Biago River Valley. A very tense situation. People are not happy to talk to you. People are not happy about their life. These men are idle, basically doing nothing. Their kids are brought to the cities and they're hoping to return to the coca trade because it has been that way for so long. The war on drugs has failed. In desperation, people turn to making piassava balloons. Piassava is a kind of generic term in the Amazon. This is the Fondra Natalia. This species here, which is I think stronger and better than a common piassava that you see in Brazil. Their grandparents, their parents did this and they consulted them. Just a few people who were still alive suggested that they make these brooms and they start working on broom making with these fibers. This is food aid on the right there. I don't know if you can see it in those white sacks there, but it says USA right on there. Sacks of rice, cans of oil in the boats there, the brown sacks that have oatmeal. In fact, the driver of the truck told me not to take the photograph. He said, this is secret. Get rid of your camera. And I simply, maybe I was rude or maybe I was unethical, but I said, I'm a U.S. citizen and this law is passed by Congress. So I think I can take a photograph of you even if you don't want me to. Am I correct? I'm not sure. But I am sure. We are a law on this water drugs. And that food came from the U.S. That's the Yaga River there. Really beautiful area that's really fraught by conflict, which has really disrupted people's lives in terms of their identity, their indigenous identity, forest use, and how they feel about the forest. To call it a distraction, I think, is unfair. It's far more than a distraction. And by the way, they're not making money producing these brooms, which are hundreds of thousands or millions of these brooms all over Peru. Now they're going to call it a Brazil. But they're just getting by doing this like this kid here. You know, if we move to Nicaragua, we see some really positive possibilities. Forty percent of the country is autonomous territory, mostly indigenous. And if you go into the eastern areas on the right there, the eastern side towards the Caribbean, you'd really be amazed at the indigenous governments and the indigenous control and administration of the area. It's very tightly controlled. You have the Mesquite, the well-known Mesquite tribe, some perhaps 200,000 people. The Mayatna may be about 25,000 now. Both of these populations are increasing. And you see a lot of forests like this. High forests, very poor soils. And this is the distribution here. I think it's more abundant in Nicaragua than this map shows here. Just a great deal of debate now over this forest. Are they burning it too much? Are they hunting it too much? Also, problems with the tribal elders. Corruption, what are the prices they're receiving? This is all tax. I think they're gonna go down here to become a lane
