 How to Prune the Fruit Buds So we're just talking a little bit about pruning trees and I was just explaining to the group the difference between a fruit bud, which is a big fat bud, for instance. Here are some fruit buds here. And the difference between a vegetative bud as well. So here we've got some extension growth from last year. This is last year's growth. And sitting really, really close to the stem are these little vegetative buds. So these are going to grow leaves and these little fat fruit buds are going to grow blossom and then a little cluster of apples. So that's the difference between a fruit bud and a vegetative bud. And one of the things that you want to think about when you're approaching a tree to prune it, first of all you're looking for diseased wood and branches that are crossing over. So what we've got here is we've got a bit of canker on this tree here. So the canker is here. And I'm going to just, and you can see it's come out to this branch as well here. So I'm going to travel back as far as I can. I might even actually take this branch out altogether. Now that when I chop here, like that, that's actually called a thinning cut because the sap can pass along the branch and carry on to this branch here. And it's not going to, it's not, this is not going to regrow. Now the opposite of that would be a heading cut where I've got a branch like this growing out. Now here's some more canker here and I might want to just, if I just took that off like that, there's a, there's a bud here and this bud is going to break out and grow out here. So that's called a heading cut. And heading cuts are really useful when you've got young trees where you want to create a series of choices that you can make the following year. So you might have three branches coming out of here and you might want to choose one or two of those branches. And that's why heading cuts are useful in young trees. As trees get older, you're tending to want to do more thinning cuts because this cut here, which was the thinning cut, is not going to produce any more wood coming from there. So what you're going to end up with is a nice clean branch with some fruiting buds on the end here. And that's going to not present complicated pruning decisions next year. So what would you do with the wood you just cut off with the canker on it? Yeah, I shouldn't have dropped it on the floor. I'm going to take it home and burn it because it's diseased wood. Okay. Good question. And I also don't want to leave this like this. One of the things with canker is if you can come back quite away from it, you're likely to get clean wood. In fact, this was clean wood here. There's a possibility of canker in there with that little discoloration there. So you've got clean wood there. Now the other thing that I should be doing with canker, and I haven't got this with me, is that you should disinfect your secateurs when you've been cutting close to canker. That's ideally. But I have to say with a thousand trees, when you've got canker, it's quite tricky to disinfect at that time. So would you recommend having some sterilising cloths you can take, you know, the little tear away ones? You can either have a blow torch and just put some flame over it, or you can disinfectant. We have little squeezy disinfectant bottles that we sometimes take around in the orchard. So that's the canker, and I shall take this home with me. Wellington Rotation Romulo Are they Прид ?
