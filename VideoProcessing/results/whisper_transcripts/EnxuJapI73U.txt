Nonprofits & Activism
 It's been a very very eventful day yesterday with a lot of key sessions and I think there's been some fantastic takeaways from every session. I do hope that this session also brings a lot of solutions because what is important is how we move forward from here. How do we build on the knowledge and the practice and the richness of experience that's available in the room and take it forward? A woman farmer on the field is the most intelligent scientist. She's the first one who notices the test. She's the first one who notices something wrong with the field and then she passes on the information to the household and then what needs to be sprayed gets decided by the man in the household or whoever is taking the decision. But she is the one who's noticing these changes on the field. So how do we kind of if somebody who comes with innate knowledge and technique and skills which we don't recognize but she has never yes. How do we empower that one person to engage better is by breaking the structural stereotypes and breaking and working on the structural inequalities by creating markets or creating innovations which are gender-aware, gender inclusive and gender transformative. The important thing is about that we should address about that to our target audience what kind of technology affordability accessibility as well as about that in the case of about that what kind of capacity they can use. So we should use about that physical digital mode to use that various communication mode to reach the communities. It may be about cable tv, it may be radio or maybe it may be mobile or maybe even in that outbound call for that button phone and etc. How we can use these various communication tools to bring that various information from that this knowledge providers to the community. That's the one very important. Sensitizing the key stakeholders through the evidence that we have and integrating like social inclusion when we look at not just men, women but then the vulnerable young boys, young girls so that they will be able to take agriculture forward. So that's what we learned from our work at the local community. So how we can take the side and how we can correct agriculture, nutrition, gender, health, environment etc. How do you bring the people into the public private partnership and make it bottoms up, make it community participatory driven, community led rather than stakeholder and you know the people in the public private partnership. So I think there are two three things. One is that the videos or those advisory that is given should be by the farmer for the farmer, lead farmer. Also there are increased that and other agencies or groups who have such advisories so those should be bubbled up. So I think credible groups and farmers should create such practices and advisories and that should be good. So in that sense both the agency and the right advisory among number of organizations must avoid, must cooperate and produce mutual こきnych人 is one of the most important things that are available in that country, so it's important, as part of the community in terms of improving the观ence 벽 iMTA, is also working with the state collectivelyizers are the a lot of all greeting and people surveying it.
