Howto & Style
 This is how I prepare strawberry plants for hydroponic growing. So I picked up these strawberry plants at the garden centre in the reduced section so they need a bit of care. First thing you're going to do is get rid of all these weeds and moss, dead leaves, bits of muck and stuff out the top and then I'm just going to stick it in this bucket of water and give it a really good wash and that's going to break up all the soil and leave me with a really nice root ball at the end. And I'm just going to take this inside and give it a wash. Next I'm just going to use the tap to rinse off all the loose bits of soil and stuff and get rid of any more bits of muck from inside the roots and really loosen them up. And then now I've got a net pot, I'm just going to stick that in there and push it right down and that's going to hold the plant in place and the roots will be able to grow out through the bottom. And then they go straight into the NFT system where the roots are constantly in contact with flowing water and nutrients.
