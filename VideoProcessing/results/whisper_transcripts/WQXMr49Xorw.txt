 So we've got continuous grazing, you've got a piece of land, you're letting the animals graze wherever you want, they're overgrazing the good stuff, not eating the bad stuff, the bad stuff takes over, blah blah blah, right? Then you've got rotational grazing, which is you've broken your land up into some set paddocks, you're moving your animals around, and a lot of people conflate rotational grazing with amp grazing because they are moving their animals around, but it might be a week, two weeks, three weeks. Amp grazing, you're setting much smaller paddocks, you've got a higher stocking density, and you might be moving the animals three times a day in the growing season, or at least every day. That's why it's called adaptive, because all of this is strategic, and with rotational grazing that means that they're moving their livestock in the set size pastures with permanent cross fencing, you know, maybe once a week at best, most of the time, once a month, to once every few months. That is not adaptive grazing at all.
