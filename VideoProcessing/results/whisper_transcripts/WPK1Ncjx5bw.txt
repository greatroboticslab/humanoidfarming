 How We Haul 26,000 Square Bales By Hand After baling, we drive along with a pickup and trailer. The bales go into this loader, and it brings them up to the guides on the trailer. Then you pull the bale out of the loader and take it to the stack. There's a certain way to stack it so it doesn't fall apart. We have two people on the back that rotate on grabbing the bales. Once we have several stacks in the front, we start putting them on the back of the trailer so that the front and back meet in the middle where the loader is. Then we finish out the middle part. It gets a little tight towards the end, and it can be scary sometimes when the field is rough and we're going fast. But after 250 bales, it's always so satisfying to put that last one in. Then we drive it down the road to our shed to unload.
