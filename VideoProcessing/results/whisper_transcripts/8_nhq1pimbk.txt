Welcome back to another fucking vegetable video. Check this shit out here, pimp. Last time we showed you guys, we had just transplanted these ladies. We've got some boomage going on, dude. This thing's looking killer. The old squash. It's blooming a couple more fucking little squashies. The onion's looking alright. It's not looking the best, to be honest. I don't know what's going on there. Fucking watermelon's looking killer. Is this the cucumber's looking good? It's even wrapped itself around the little fucking... That's cool. I'm surprised because this shit's really hot. I don't know why it would do that, but... The tomatoes looking really fucking bomb.com. We've got a couple little other maters growing right now, too, which is fucking sick. The bell peppers are looking dope as fuck. Super fat fucking peppers, man. Super, super fat, which is dope. We're going to have to probably pluck those pretty soon, but... Mint's getting super sweet. I think the strawberries kind of stopped growing, but... I think they're out of season is why. Broccoli's looking killer. Kale is massive, dude. Absolutely fucking huge. I don't know what this is over here. These are both melons. Melons and what's that one? These are both melons. Two different melons? Yeah. Oh, okay. That's a cantaloupe. Is this just like a melon? A melon, I think. I don't know. Oh, shit. Well... I could be wrong. They're looking super fucking fire. I think we lost the tag on this one. It's gone. She's gone. But we're going to be coming through, Pimps, watering. I kind of wanted to just give you a small little update and see what the old guy of green is doing on the old vegetables. It's not only for the old cannabis plants, Pimps. This shit works on every single grow. So we're going to go ahead and set this up, do a little time lapse of us watering. Let's make this shit fucking happen. Fuck yes. Damn. This one's getting long. All right, Pimps. We just went ahead and watered. Check this shit out, dude. We got like one long fuckered squash cracking right now. Honestly, looking fucking decent. I don't know when you pluck the squash, honestly. I don't know when the squash is ready. My mom already came out and ate all the strawberries, which is just fan-fucking-tastic. We got three mango-ass peppers, which is probably what I'm most hyped about. Those things look fire. I'm excited to eat those things. Our broccoli looks really good. The kale looks... Like, I don't see what... Like, where does the broccoli at? This isn't the broccoli. Is it in the ground? You don't pull the broccoli out, do you? Like, where's the broccoli at? It's got to grow a little bit hungry. All right, well, I didn't know. I've never done it before. That's why I'm asking. I don't know. Obviously, the kale is all right here. This is all fucking the kale right here. This is what you eat. You clip that. Mint smells fire, dude. I really like this tray because I get to go ahead and bottom water, which is exactly why these are so good-looking. Tomato, I don't have a pot or a base plate, I should say. I need to go ahead and grab one of those. Same for the watermelon and the onion. Along with the two fucking melons. This melon kind of has, like, a built-in one in the actual tray itself or the pot, which is dope. I'm fucking tired, Pim. So, we just got done filming a bunch of fucking videos, watering all of our plants. I'm obviously not trying to really show you guys the other plants because I'm not trying to have this video get age-restricted.

Yeah. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
