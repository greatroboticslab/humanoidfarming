 Folks here is a super nice John Deere 458 round baler. It has a good set of gathering wheels on it, good belts, tires are in decent shape. It's logged 3073 total bales but it actually I used the wrap button on the monitor sitting here with no hay in it and it actually logged the bale so it should be at least one short of that. Anyway very very nice baler you can barely hear it run behind the tractor. We're gonna have this one for sale right here. It does make a 4x5 bale. It's twine only. If you guys have any questions give one of us a call. Alright guys. Thank you.
