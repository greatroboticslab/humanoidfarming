Howto & Style
 Did you know if you grab a red onion, roughly dice it up, put it in some kind of container or bowl, then grab two garlic cloves, dice them up, and add the milk. Add one teaspoon of cayenne pepper, fill it up with water, stick it in the fridge, and let it sit there for about 12 hours. The next thing you want to do is strain the liquid out, and then pour the mixture into a spray bottle. Close it. What you have right now is a homemade, all-natural, non-toxic bug spray. This is going to keep away aphids, slugs, spider mites, and other types of insects away from your plants. Spray it directly on the leaves of your plants and watch the magic house. So don't buy those crazy expensive insecticides at the store. Just make your own right at home.
