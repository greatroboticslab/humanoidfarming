 I dare you to show me another zero turn mower that can handle a ditch like that, turn at the bottom, cut that thick heavy stuff that is almost big enough it needs a brush cutter, mow at 15 miles per hour, and have four wheel steering. It doesn't exist. You can click the link on the screen to see the full length version of the mower demo on this machine.
