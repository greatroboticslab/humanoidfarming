 Music My name is Chris Wharton and I'm an associate professor in the nutrition program at Arizona State University And I'm extremely excited to have Jean-Martin Fortier here to offer this incredible workshop on profitable small-scale farming This is a collaboration that's been months in the making With a lot of organizations and I want to just call some of them out now so Kelly Young for example at U of A Cooperative Extension Helped put this on along with steadfast farms and Eric Schultz And a number of other folks are contributing to this event So I just want to make mention of one of the other organizations involved in this workshop It's called the food systems transformation initiative, and so this is a new organization at ASU It's one that I direct and it's really focused on Broadly equitable participation in the food system, and that means we really care about food security and people's ability to have access to healthy Oftentimes locally produced culturally appropriate affordable food, but it's also about ensuring that people can have livelihoods in the food system And so this event is really an important piece of that we really care about having an integrated and diverse food system And allowing people to have the opportunity to be producers and participate in the food system from that perspective as well The other part I want to get into so there's fertility That's one part The other part is again soil structure Okay, so you need to take care that you're doing intensive spacings You might having more than one crop you will be having more than one crop per year three or four in this kind of climate So fertility matters, but also soil structure Okay, so we haven't worked the soil for more than ten years With a rotor tiller and I'll talk about that and when we did the soil analysis Two years ago. It was amazing. We had 12 inch of really nice brown soil No layers Okay And our best teacher has always been the earthworm Thinking in terms of if I if I was an earthworm would I like this right now or wouldn't I? Okay, and these guys Have Given me the scope of trying to move away From mechanical tillage and go towards biological tillage Trying to see if the way we work the fields Could not destroy their habitat And back then my idea was that could we figure out ways to do things where we would count on them to do that work? That's what really was behind Some of the tools that we've Took into our system the first one being the broad fork Everybody knows what the broad fork is? Does anybody know what it's not? Or That was a funny way of saying things Okay, so the broad fork is a big U-bar that you plant into the soil And it has tines that allows you to open up the soil but without overhauling it without turning it over So you bring air into the soil you decompact it you loosen it up But you're not destroying the habitat of the earthworms You're allowing deep tillage but in a very gentile way Okay So broad forking on an acre and a half broad forking 100 foot beds A lot of people say you know JM that's It's a lot of work and then they'll have problem with the broad forks Broad forking it's so hard not sure it's I'm not sure it's a good tool You're having problem broad forking you should be broad forking it, okay? The tool is not the issue Okay Rotor tillers When we started market gardening that was the only tool that we had okay? We thought it was amazing You put a rotor tiller on a BCS two-wheel tractor And You go and you'll have 10 inch of really Loose soil You can stick your whole hand into it And you're thinking wow if I was a root I'd be happy It's a perfect system for intensive spacings One thing You take soil that has nice aggregates Okay You know soil is formed by balls and soils that has structure You're putting everything in a blender And you're pulverizing it into finer pieces So At first glance Soil is loose Come back a week or two later What happens? Compass This is physics So you're taking soil that has structure And you're destructuring it If you're using the rotor tiller once a year And you're putting a lot of organic matter It's not a big deal But if you're cleaning up your beds And if you're preparing three or four beds a year And that's the only tool you'll have It won't take long for your soil to be really, really dry I wouldn't say dead That's not the right word But Really compact And really hard to work into So we've quickly moved away from this tool And replaced it with a harrow A power harrow Which has tines on a vertical shank So instead of mixing You know Of turning the soil upside down It mixes Like that Okay So you're not inverting the layers And you're not bringing seeds from the bottom up Which is the other thing The other drawback from the rotor tiller So a harrow On the first few inch of the soil When we were looking for one Super expensive back then For a small tractor That's how we paid And it has a roller in the back Or harrow That allows to firm the seed bed And allows to quickly adjust The depth Of Of our Of the work We want to be working on an inch Sometimes two inch When we're transplanting And we want the tines to work really slow Okay Are you getting the nuance here Between the tiller and the harrow Not saying that you should have this Absolutely And the tiller is bad Not saying that Saying that if you want to be sustainable On the long run It's a good option To have another approach Than just tilling Because there's drawbacks To using the tiller Okay Perfectly conditions the seed bed By leveling By firming And by mixing the first layers Really really great tool So One of the great things about these walk behind tractors Is that you can change the implements So You can have Many different tools Some fit in the front Some fit in the back You can play with your spacing This is a quick attach system It takes a minute to change the tools So You have A versatile Power unit Which can motorize Many different tools You can hang out And go to town Go make your deliveries that way These are really popular in Italy Because they have Small space And they have hilly slopes But again Working on permanent bed systems 30 inch It's going to be hard to find better than that They're very different from some of the old Rotor tillers That used to be around Because you can swift You can swing the hands Mars from one side to the other And lastly And I always need to be careful About how I say things Everyone on the farm can use it Okay? So even the girls Not supposed to say that It's not too heavy You can maneuver it And it does make a difference Because And again In a traditional setup It's always the guys That are running the tractors And you know tractors They're not so It's impactful To be driving a tractor And you know Looking in the back And clutching Over many years So not saying this is better Just saying this works Okay? And you can get a tan While you work Okay I forgot that was there That's funny All right So we used to make our beds With a shovel You know When I started the farm We did 180 beds With a shovel But I knew I would only do it once To shape the beds But every other year They tend to settle down So we need to re-raise them And now we use What's called A rotary plow So it's a big screw That just shoots the bed From the aisles The soil From the aisles Onto the bed Rotary plow And so We re-raise the beds We use a harrow And then we have Permanent beds That are ready to be Seated in Transplanted Whatever If you look at the picture though It looks pretty damn clean And you would wonder How did you do this Did you Did you rototill everything Did you Did you put herbicides You know It looks pretty damn clean And the answer is Here We use tarps To prepare the seed beds And I came across this A bit by chance Many years ago I was tarping Some of my beds In my hoop houses Because I didn't want to have Weeds pop in While the beds weren't used I was covering the soil And what I noticed Was that The beds that had been covered With a tarp Had a lot less weed pressure In them Okay Growing two crops Side by side One crop Didn't have any weed pressure And the one had more And the explanation Is pretty simple The tarp creates Perfect germinating condition It's dark It's moist And it's warmer So all the dormant weed seeds What happens They germinate And then what happens They die Because there's no light So this is called Occultation And it's an amazing way To get rid of the weeds Because you're not doing anything I got pretty excited about that And so I bought Some big kick-ass tarps And started to cover Whole field blocks Thinking I'll get rid of the weeds So one thing leading to the other We noticed that When we would remove the tarps Man, the beds were ready to go All of this All of the leftover residues All of the weeds Everything had disappeared This was bare soil Ready to be planted And it hadn't been worked And that got us really excited Because there we were We found a solution To preparing soil Without overhauling it Without disturbing the ecology Of the soil Yes So We use the tarps For two to three weeks Depending on the temperature Sometimes it's four weeks When it's a cold spring And it also depends What's coming afterwards Or what's coming next So it's We've tried to systemize this As much as possible On the farm But sometimes You need to have a window Between two crops But it works really well And it also allows us To have Most of the site Under control And I'll talk more About that later on Okay So permanent beds Tarped Broad fork For deep tillage Without inverting the layers And using a machine To shallowly prepare the soil For the seed beds Without Playing With too much soil You remember There was $260 Of gas For the BCS That's That's how we go about it Just by using these techniques We don't rely On big machines To prepare soil Yes Well we don't use The BCS For every bear That we prepare I'll show you What the sequences are Okay So these are the tarps They're UV treated Silage tarps So they're food grade They won't degrade In the sun They'll last for You know I've had them For more than 10 years And And they work Okay Try it at home You'll be flabbergasted Makes a big Makes a big difference The only drawback Is that they're heavy Okay So Need to move them around It might take a long time What we've come up with Is just to buy more of them So each field log Has its own A tarp A 40 by 100 tarp Can cost 200 300 dollars It's going to cover 7, 8 beds It's a worthwhile investment Okay So tarping We could be called A tarp farm Because we do a lot of that It's just like Putting a cover crop But you're doing it Boom One shot And you're leaving it For two or three weeks So this is the sequence Of the bed preparation On our farm Okay So I We're pretty My crew is pretty fast So the beds Are tarped So they're clean No more work to be done Now Every other year I want to raise them Again So I'll use my Rotary plow Connected to the BCS That's not too far I want to raise it An inch or two Okay So just to make sure That my soil Is really deep And loose I'll use my broad fork Okay And you see how fast It goes in the soil That's when you have Good soil structure Broad forking It wasn't like that When I started Okay But because We've been Developing the biology In the soil By not turning it over And because we're using The broad fork To create the right Conditions For the habitat We're populating The soil Okay I don't remember That's been That's two years ago Okay So now We've moved away From relying On a lot of compost Because our soils Are really Filled with organic matter And we're using Vermicompost So usually I'll put two Or three buckets So vermicompost Worm casting Is very potent It's a rich way To fertilize Has a lot of Microorganisms And then The last step Before putting The crops in Is to use My para harrow And just Perfectly condition The seed bed Mixing in The soil amendment Firming it Leveling it See how there's An offset So I'm not Walking on the bed Here And this is Working on An inch Or two Okay So that's how We do the bed prep On the farm And This is Not a No-till system But it's Definitely A minimal Tillage System And if I was An earthworm And I was there During all that Video Life is not So bad Okay The other thing That I've learned Through my research About tarps Is that You're also Creating The perfect Habitats For earthworms Because Earthworms They want to Have soil That is covered Because they Don't want to Get pecked By birds They want to Have moist Conditions And that's What the tarps Do And when you Remove them If you left Something for them To eat Organic matter Crop residues Whatever They're there They're there And You're enhancing Their habitat By tarping So then If you do this Then you don't Want to be Destroying it Right afterward Using a tiller So this is Our approach To it And in the Greenhouse Since it's not Really easy To maneuver With the walk Behind tractor We use What's called A tilter Which is A battery Powered Small cultivator That works On the first Inch or Half inch Of the soil So same thing It was tarped It was broad Forked And then I'm firming The soil You know Leveling it And mixing The amendments Using this Battery powered Tool No That's from Johnny's Johnny's Selected Seeds Makes that Tool $500 So if you Have a home Garden That's an Option The tool Is 15 Inch So Two pass 30 inch Again Standardized So that's How we do The bed prep In The greenhouse In tunnels Okay Questions For that So it's a Very different Way of working The soil But it gives Good results Yes Which one You said The rotor Yeah It's like A screw And it Yeah Okay Okay So it's a Great question Occultation Solarization When you're Putting clear Plastic What you're Doing is Raising the Temperature Of your Soil To the Extent Of your Destroying The weed Seeds That's why You want To do That Okay So if You put Clear Plastic In the Summer In your Climate For four Weeks You're going To cut Out on Lots Of your Weeds That would Be a Great Thing To do In the Summer Here Especially If you're Growing In the Winter Difference Between Occultation Is that When you're Solarizing You're not Creating Hospitable Habitat For the Life Because Obviously You're Going To fry Them So They're Migrating Down They're Probably Going To Come Up But When You're Tarping It's Like Mulching You're Just Creating The Right Habitat For All The Micro Organisms In The Soil So Sometimes It's Better To Solarize Sometimes It's Better To Use Tarps It's Just Different Tools In Your Toolbox And Then It's Up To You To Figure Out Is That Clear With Everyone Okay So This Is The Flail Mower We Use This Tool To Destroy All Of The Cover Crops And To Cut Up The Green The Crop Residues So Instead Of Working Like A Lawn Mower With A Blade Like That It Has Lots Of Blades Working That Way So It Chops Up The Residues And Just Leaves A Mulch In The Back This Is Important Because We Want To Get Rid Of This Material And We Want The Biology Of The Soil To Get Rid Of It And If We Shred It Down Into Finer Particles We Speed Up That Process Okay It Is Going To Be Digested Faster So For Many Years You Know I Don't Know If You Noticed The Nuance But I Talked About Cover Crops And Most People Will Talk About Green Manure Okay Because If You Are Growing Legumes They Fix The Nitrogen From The Air Bring Into The Soil And When You Bring That Cover Crop Or The Green Manure Those Plants In Your Soil You You Are Adding Nitrogen To Your Soil So We Never Relied On Green Manure To Fertilize Because We Using Compost And It Has Been Working Great For Us And I Was Always Concerned By The Fact That If I Need To Integrate The Plant Material In The Soil Using Rotor Tiller Then I I Tilling And Destroying The Habitat Of The Soil So On One Hand There Is A Benefit Because You Are Adding Green Residues Into Your Soil But On The Other Hand You Plowing Or Rotor Tilling And So I Was To Instead Of Incorporating Into The Soil We Simply Burying The Green Manure With The Soil From The Isle So We Go With Our Rotary Plow We Take The Dirt From The Pathways And We Shoot It On To The Green Manure And We Leave It To Decompose There Yeah And So By Doing It This Way We Getting The Benefit Of The Green Manure But We Not Disturbing The Ecology Of The Soil Okay We Want To Keep Our Isles Clean Because Because Of Our Raised Beds Our Tool Our Flail Mower Doesn't Really Work Well Here And Sometimes These Are Hard To Destroy So At One Point We Leave Them Bare And This Is A Picture Of I Thought There Would Be The Green Manure There But They Are Not So Forget About This I Have Another Drawing Where All The Green Manures Are Systematically Put Into The Crop Planning Calendar Okay So It's New But I'll Propose That We Go On For Another 15 Minutes Before The Break Are You Guys Cool With That Are You Guys Cool With That In The Back The Guys Are Preparing The Food 15 Minutes No If We Go On For 15 More Okay So We Talked About The Margins In The Morning 45% A Big Part Of It Is Because Our Overheads Have Been Pretty Small We Rely On Most Of The Work Me And My Wife So We Don't Have A Big Crew But Also All The Tools That We Use Were Bought The First Year And Basically They're Inexpensive Tools So Simple But Yet They're Well Designed And They Do The Work In A Great Way So This Is A Break Up Of All The Investment That We've Made The First Few Years First Year Actually We Bought Everything Once And It Came To Under $40,000 Perhaps These Numbers Are A Bit Off Now I Don't Know But The Fact Was That We Borrowed $40,000 On Five Years At 10% Which Was Around $8,000 A Year Payback And We Were Grossing Close To $100,000 So Really It Wasn't A Lot For Us To Get Going Worth While Investments So Some Of These Tools Perhaps Some Of You Guys Know These These Are The Seeders That We We Started With The Ertway Pretty Versatile Cedars It's Not Very Efficient It's Not Very Precise A Lot Of Thinning Goes Into Using That Cedar There Is Another Cedar Called The Glazer Both Of Them Are Sold By Johnny's Collected Seeds And The Glazer Works Really Well With Small Seeds Round Seeds Carrots Turnips Which Really Don't Work Well With This Cedar The Small Seeds They Tend To Jam In The Mechanisms So But These This One Works Good For Big Seeds So Both Them Together For Under $200 Or $300 You Can Go Around And Direct Seed Pretty Much Everything This Is Another Seeder Called The Jang Cedar Made In Korea It's A Definitely Better Seeder More Precise More Versatile More Expensive Takes Longer To Calibrate So If You Have Five Or Six Different Crops That You Seeding You're Going To Spend A Lot Of Time Figuring This Out As You Go But If You Need To Buy Only One And You're Doing 100 CSA This Is The Seeder That You Want To Have When We're Seeding We're Always Measuring How Much Seeder Because You're Going Like That And You're Hoping For The Best But If It Didn't Work Or If It Jammed Or If It It Shoe Is Open Too Much And You're Dropping Five Times More Seeder It's Going To Take You Two Weeks To Figure It Out When Things Pop Up Or Don't Pop Up So What We Do Is We Have A Little Protocol Where We Measure The Seed Packet Before And After We Seeded And That Gives Us The Amount Of Seed That Was Put In The Ground And We Have Targets That We Know Because We Planted Carrots On 100 Foot Bed And We Figured It Was Perfect Spacing Measure The Amount Of Seed That Is Our Target So If I Put Too Much Seed I Have An Indicator That Tells Me I I Need To Calibrate It Better If I Had Not Enough Seed Then I Know And I Do A Second Pass Simple Stuff But These Little Details Make A Difference Six Row Seeder We Use This For Intensive Salad Spacings For Mesclun That We Grow On The Farm So It Has Six Rows So It Will Be 12 Rows On 30 Inch And This Is A Picture Of A Roller That Also Is Sold By Johnny This Is An Important Tool If You Don't Have A Roller In The Back Of Let's Say A Harrow Or Something Because For All Of These Seeders To Work You Need To Have Soil That Is Really Loose So All The Big Clunks Need To Be Disintegrated That Why We Are Talking About Shallow Cultivating Has Traction And It Needs To Be Leveled So That You Won't Have Dip Where Things Grow Faster Or Shorter And When You're Harvesting Because Uniformity When You're Harvesting Is Important So This Ensures That You Also Want To Be Marking Your Rows They Don't Need To Be Straight Rows But They Need To Be Parallel Like Let's Say These Are Not Straight Because Probably Somebody Was You Want To Be Seeding In Parallel Rows Because The Next Step Is To Be Cultivating For Weeds And You'll Be Doing So With Hoes And You Need To Make Sure That When You're Cultivating One Row You're Not Destroying Seeds That Are Emerging In The Other Rows Everything Needs To Be Symmetrical And That's Really Important Because When You're Cultivating With A Hoe And You Want To Do It Efficiently You're Eyeballing Only One Row To Go Fast And You Need To Assume That You're Not Destroying Because Sometimes We Do This When The Seeds Are Only Starting To Germinate
