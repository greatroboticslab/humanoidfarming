 Remember, you don't have to buy rooting agent. You can make it. Any flower you raise will burst into pots. First add 500 milliliters warm water to the cup, 50 grams brown sugar, 3 grams yeast powder. Stir evenly. After sealing and storing for 24 hours, it's done. Using this formula allows plants to take root quickly, improve the soil, promote flowering and fruiting.
