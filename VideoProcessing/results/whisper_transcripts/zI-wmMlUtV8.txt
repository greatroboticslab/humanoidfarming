 hey there hobby homesteaders welcome back to Peaks Peak today we're gonna talk about feed stores I am actually about to take the farm car because I don't have my truck because cameras driving my truck because guess what the Subaru is gone but we have a new feed store that just started doing business about 10 minutes from the house maybe and when I have the opportunity to support a new local business especially when they have good hours and their prices are affordable then I'm gonna do that over going to rural king or tractor supply or whatever so that's what we're gonna do today here's the thing small business is hard anyway it's hard to be competitive when you can't buy the volume of supplies that a large box store is gonna buy and get the kind of deals that they get so it's hard to start a business but you know what it's nice to have good local businesses this feed store being much closer to the house is gonna save me a lot of time so if they succeed then that's to my benefit as well so we're gonna head on over to M&R Hardware and pick up some feeds I know a little bit about small business because my wife actually used to own a ladies boutique and the coven era kind of shut that down she had actually just got set up in a new storefront move from one location to another and invested everything and getting all set up and the week that she intended to open is the week that they basically shut everything down and you can't pay rent if you don't have any money coming in so that's how volatile small business can be and that's tough you know people invest a lot in trying to you know start their dream and get it going so when I can support somebody who is living out their dream definitely want to do that one of the things that I often run into when I'm trying to support small business is that they don't keep the same hours as most of your big box stores and all of that you know I've had hardware stores that you know I'm off on a holiday from work and so I have time to work on a project or fix a plumbing problem I have or whatever and I'll run to the local hardware store and they're closed too because it's a holiday now good for them for doing what they want to do with their life but at the same time when you're a hardware store and you know a lot of your customers are going to be at home doing their home projects and those are the people who are going to support your business you might have to make the sacrifice and and be open on those days I don't know what the answer is to that but I do know that it can be frustrating when you try to patronize a small business only to get there and their hours are not normal hours and so you end up having to go to the big box store anyway what that does is ends up driving people straight to the big box store because they don't want to waste waste time coming to the small store and it being closed but it's Saturday morning I'm thinking this feed store will be open so we're gonna go find out all right guys we're here at MR hardware and actually I've come in and I'm surprised they've got all kinds of stuff in here good hardware and you know little things that I might need if I'm doing projects around the farm or whatever so that's nice they're open which is a great plus and they actually carry some things that your local rural king tractor supply they don't even have they have show cattle feed up front umbarger show cattle feed that you have to drive a long ways to get so they've got some things that you can't get at just any any location so I'm kind of going to look around here and see what all they've got but super friendly folks running this place they've already got my order and taken care of me so I'm gonna pull the car around and get loaded up here in a few minutes but it's kind of wanted to take a look around and see what they have you know when I need some barn chain oil or you know lawn mower blades whatever you know I can run it I can run over here this is a whole lot closer than than tractor supplier rural king for me too so I'm I'm excited to have this in the community that's great you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you all right guys well they got me all loaded up and taken care of and i am super happy that i decided to run down here this feed store this morning man super nice guys in they're running this um you know just people from the community but uh opened up a small business they've got a little bit of construction company and stuff on the side or well that's their main business and so they opened up this hardware store and started selling feed they're big into horses so they carry a lot of horse feed and horse shoes and attack and all that so you know something that we don't have around here anywhere else so i think they're going to do well they've got good hours like i said they had great service and i think they've got a really good product from what i can tell too so i'm pretty excited to have them less than 10 minutes from the house i think it took me seven minutes to get here so this is great to have in the community i'm glad they're here so if you are in the kentucky ohio

another feed store that i used to support that was about 20 minutes the other way out the highway but it was pretty inconvenient for me it was the opposite direction i was normally going and it was a lot farther away and they went out of business um i tried to support them just because they were a local feed store but they didn't make it so i made this video basically just to share that hey you know there's guys out there trying to live their dream and and start their own business and yeah they have to make good decisions and uh keep the right kind of hours that work for everybody and have a good product but it also is good for us to have those businesses in our neighborhood helps us out makes life a little more convenient and you build relationships i went in there and ended up talking for a long time and uh you know learn more about some of my neighbors and all that so uh all in all it's it's a good thing to support local business so look around your area see if you can find you a
