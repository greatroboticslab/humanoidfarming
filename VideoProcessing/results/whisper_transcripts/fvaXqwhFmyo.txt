 Can animals sense disasters before they happen? Sounds like a myth, but there's real science and stories behind it. In 2023, before the turkey earthquake, locals reported dogs barking non-stop. Birds took flight in panic. No one knew why, until disaster struck. In 2021, goats on La Palma became restless hours before the volcano erupted. Goats left their usual spots early. In 2009, toads in Italy abandoned a pond five days before an earthquake. Dogs can be trained to detect cancer, seizures, and blood sugar changes. They're not perfect, but the science shows it works. Animals pick up on vibrations, electric fields, and chemical changes. They don't predict the future. They react faster than we do. Have you ever seen an animal act strange before something big?
