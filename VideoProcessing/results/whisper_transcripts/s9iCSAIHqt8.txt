Education
 Welcome to Crofternomics on comparing farmyard manure with bagged fertilizer. Input prices have been rising dramatically. Ag inflation has been calculated to be 30%. Farmyard manure has many benefits. It's good to recycle nutrients on croft, great for soil health, has micronutrients often missing from bagged fertilizer and reduces greenhouse gases from bagged fertilizer production. If you know what quantity of farmyard manure you're spreading then you can find out what nutrients are being added to the soil for this year and for future years. A 25 tonne hectare of application or 10 tons per acre of cattle farming manure supplies the following nutrients in the first year. Nitrogen 15 kilograms per hectare, phosphate 48 kilograms per hectare, potash 160 kilograms per hectare. At current prices this application could save you fertilizer around 288 pounds. For a grass silage crop being grown on moderate status soils for P and K you do not need to add any extra inputs. However not all crop nitrogen needs are met. This would need to be supplemented with either bagged fertilizer or a high clover sward. When planning next year's fertilizer purchases and applications think about soil sampling, what your estimated tonnage of farmyard manure, calculate what your grassland needs and what the farmyard manure can supply and if you need to buy in any inputs or to adjust your system. Don't think of each year in isolation as farmyard manure feeds the soil in later years too.
