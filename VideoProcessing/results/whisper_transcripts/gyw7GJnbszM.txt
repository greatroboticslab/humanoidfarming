 Hello guys, I'm telling you David is my name. I am on the Ruffian Yam project. Okay. And this, this 6,000 yam in sack project that we set up. Okay. Here. So basically just going around the field, doing a random check. Okay. To see that everything is in place for a very bountiful harvest. So I need you to stay glued as we go through this field, you know, point one or two things so that if you have also a major project going on at your end, you can basically know how to navigate through so as to get quality results at the end of this. Before we dive into this project, guys, if you haven't subscribed to my channel yet, punch on the subscribe button, turn on your notification bell and do what to give this video a big thumbs up. Because when you do that, this video becomes more available to people out there. Welcome. Like I said, this is the field after three months. The beauty of this field is that as you can see, we're sure that the field was properly steeped. The management of your field has to be top notch. The management of this field is top notch and that's why you can, you know, see that the field is looking very, very clean. Okay. And again, you can see the field is, you know, wheat free, which is great for the development of the tuba. So at this very stage of the yam, this is the tuberization stage. This is that period when the yams, you know, develop tubas. Okay. This is the time that we then determine if your yam is really going to develop very huge tubas or it is going to develop very not so huge tubas. Now, this is the first thing I want you to know. First thing I would like you to know is that your leaves sometimes, how beautiful looking your leave is sometimes doesn't always translate into very big tubas. Okay. Your leave growth could either mean that there's enough nitrogen in the soil and the leaves are doing well. Of course, if the leaves are doing well, that simply means that there'll be more access to sunlight and photosynthesis can take place. But now this is what you need to ensure. Okay. You need to ensure fine when your leaves has to be healthy and then you need to pay close attention to the leaves to ensure that there are no infestations. Okay. Sure. There are no infestations at all. Okay. You have to ensure that there are no infestation. As you can see, this field is not, you know, infested. But right now, if you look up closely, if you look up closely here, you'll see that the leaves are folding. Okay. So if you look up closely here, see that the leaves are kind of folding. So what we have to do is to also prepare our spraying of insecticide, okay, and fungicide on the field just to ensure that we do not encourage any buildup. So that is one thing you have to pay attention to. Usually what you should focus more on is the leaf on the field because the leaf obviously will tell you, you know, what is wrong with your plant in there. Since you can literally go into each of the leaves. the sacs to then see, you know, how they are doing. What you need to do at this point is to pay critical attention to the leaves. Next thing you have to take very seriously is the fertilization of your field. Because they are growing in sac, it simply means that the nutrient available to them is limited. They are only limited to the nutrient available in the sac. And that is when you have to then take your manure ring game very, very seriously. Usually, usually, we advise that you manual apply manual every single month. Okay, once every month, but you don't apply at a very huge quantity. Let's say your yang requires 12 gram of MPK to grow for six months. All you need to do is you divide that 12 grams by six to get the quantity of MPK you have to apply every single month. So what simply means is in this situation now you have to be applying two grams of MPK into your sacs every month because if you apply everything at once, you are going to, you know, damage the plant and eventually kill your plant while trying to help your plant. So, and that is why you also should go check out our video on how to properly apply manure into your yams and sacs. It's a totally different ballgame when you have them in sacs compared to when you have them on the open field. So you need to really, really pay attention to the details so that you properly apply your fertilization. So definitely you have to take your manure ring very, very seriously. You apply your manure manure every single month. You can do a combination of your inorganic and organic manure to get very, very awesome results at the end of the day. So what else do you need to pay attention to follow through as you go deeper into the field? The next thing you want to ensure you do not allow on your field is weed. You have to always, always take out the weed. So this field has just been weeded. As you can see, the weed has still very freshly cut. They've just been weeded. And on your field, you should not for any reason allow weeds to thrive on your field because once they thrive, they compete. Okay. But the most important place you shouldn't allow weed in is in your sac because that is where your yam is present in your sac. You shouldn't allow weeds to thrive in your sac. And why you have to ensure that the rules or the pathways are also cleared is because you want to ensure proper penetration. So when you get to weed your field, like we have done here, we are simply saying we want air to penetrate, which will then prevent any buildup of any soy bone disease that could, you know, affect the tubers as the developer that could even affect the plant as it grows. So we don't want any of that to happen. And that is why we have to ensure we keep our field, you know, very, very clean. Another major maintenance practice you have to also carry out on your field is sticking. We took our time to stick all of this field and that is why they are looking sharp. Okay. And that is why they are looking sharp. Look at the stakes. So these are binding wires who had to, you know, connect and these binding wires helped us to, you know, have a very, as you can see, and that is where the device are resting on, on the binding wires. And that is what we have here. Okay. So you need to properly take your field because you want to ensure that these vines, these yam vines have adequate access to the sunlight because the more access they have to the sunlight, the more they are able to process their food through photosynthesis. Okay. And then that would also help in the development of the tubers. So the staking of your field has to be done very, very early in the first month of your establishment. In fact, immediately you establish your field, you need to start making plans for staking because once they start, the vines start, you know, developing, they definitely want a place to climb. And if you do not provide them with stakes where they can easily climb on, like we have here, where they can easily climb on and have amazing access to the sunlight, it's really going to affect their development. And why you also don't want them to crawl is because you would trample on them. And also it wouldn't allow you to properly manage your field. Imagine if we had all of this vine squalling on the floor, then it would be very, very difficult to weed this field when we try weeding the field. So these are things you must always ensure you do on your nyam and sark field or basically any field. Okay. All right. So I'm also going to be showing you some of the things you have to pay attention to as a maintenance practice when you are also weeding your field. In trying to weed your field, you have to be very, very careful. Like we have here now, we have a damaged, okay, vine. We'll have a damaged vine. This was obviously done when this place was being weeded. Okay. We'll have a damaged vine. And if you pay attention, the vine is drying off. It is drying off. Okay. It simply means all we have to say at this point is add you to the vine and also to this plant because obviously it cannot start developing new vines because it was really caught from the root. Okay. From the root. So you have to be careful. You have to ensure you supervise these guys properly when they are, you know, trying to commence with the within of this field. You have to always ensure you do that. Okay. You also need to always go around to check so that you properly arrange your sacks. Okay. Because definitely they would always fall from time to time if they were not properly arranged from the cerebral here because of what we have here. You can see these guys have been properly arranged. So we don't be having, you know, any major falls and all of that on this field. But even at that, we could still have them filled, you know, out a little bit like we have here. But this is not a major issue. Okay. Another thing you have to also look out for on your yamming sack field. These, you want to look out for any torn sack. And also you want to look out for, you know, any shooting out of your tubers from these sacks. So you properly cover them. Okay. You properly cover them. Okay. So you want to always look out for that. So for now, we wouldn't be having any, any major issue on the tubers shooting out until around the fifth to sixth month. That is when we then start having major tubers shooting out. Okay. So for now, all we just have to ensure we apply our manuals properly. So all these things are things you have to ensure you do or carry out on your field. Okay. Do these management practices. And then at the end of the day, you are definitely going to get quality results from your field. I can assure you that. Do this. And definitely we are going to be bringing you progress report of this very project.
