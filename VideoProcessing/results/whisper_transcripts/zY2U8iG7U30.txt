 More and more farmers are planting cover crops like those you see behind me on their farms. So what are cover crops and how do they promote soil health? Cover crops include oats, peas, turnips or radishes that break up the corn-soybean rotation and increase soil microbes. So that living root longer in the system is helping to build soil aggregates, helping to increase water infiltration. Cover crops also reduce the amount of fertilizer use in crops. It's making our biomass or microorganisms increase in the soil so it's going to enhance our nitrogen cycling, going to enhance our organic matter. And planting soybeans into rye helps with weed control, especially resistant weeds. So if we can get a cool season grass in there like the cereal rye and it has some allopathy effects on those weeds, it seems like we can do a pretty good job of cutting back the number of weed seeds we see out there in those fields. All this improves the environment and promotes yield. This Heartland Consumer Report is sponsored by South Dakota Soybean Farmers and their Soybean Checkoff.
