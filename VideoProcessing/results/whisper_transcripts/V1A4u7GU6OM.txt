Science & Technology
 Did you know? In Thailand, farmers don't use pesticides to kill insects in their farms. Instead, they bring thousands of baby partridges from the farm and leave them in the field. This helps eliminate insects from the farms as these partridges eat the insects. After a few months, when they grow up, they are collected from the field and sent for sale in the market. What do you think of this eco-friendly farming method?
