 Yeah I suppose one of the main changes over the last number of years is the whole fencing infrastructure that I've put in place. So I would have fenced under the TAMS grant both the home farm here which consists of 17 hectares and the out farm which would be equally the same amount of ground another 17 hectares and I've increased the number of paddocks permanent paddocks so for instance this farm here would have something like five or six fields or permanent paddocks back many years ago and in recent years I've introduced a lot more permanent paddocks so there will be 12 paddocks here on this farm alone and then during the year as needs be those paddocks will be split according to what I would need for the demand of grass and in order to utilise and manage the grass as best I could. Most cases it's all permanent sheep wire fencing you can see in place here in all the paddocks and the main reason why I would have put in these the permanent fencing was to manage the paddocks better so basically if you go back seven or eight years ago the sheep decided where they wanted to go now I decide where the sheep want to go and it means that I can manage the grass better and I can grow more grass because I'm managing the grass better and better quality grass and also utilisation is a lot better just by just putting the sheep in or the fencing infrastructure in place it has improved the quality of grass just by that by them means alone. By putting in all the extra divisions I'm growing more grass but I'm also growing better quality grass by growing better quality grass that in effect has had a knock-on effect on lamb performance because I'm growing better grass for the lambs so it has eliminated a lot of concentrate feeding and then the yews are coming in behind them cleaning out them paddocks and the yews are also in better condition so it basically what it means is there's more money in my pocket at the end of the day because my concentrate bill would be down from what it would have been.
