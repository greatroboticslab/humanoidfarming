 Eurobale delivers two main products, Eurobale regular and Eurobale multi-pack. The multi-pack differs in that it is made up of small bales in one package. This particularly facilitates the easy feeding of large numbers of horses and giving them the correct portion size. Here we have the standard Eurobale. This is our mainstream product, it's an 80 by 70 bale, weighing approximately 240 kilograms and this informs the bulk of the business. Recently Eurobale invested in an American hay drying system and we now consistently can produce extremely high quality, dust free, green hay that you would struggle to beat by importing it. The hay drying system works on the principle of fetching the grass in from the field early before it's lost its nutrients and lost its colour and forcibly drying it with high pressure air that is warm to lower the relative humidity. This produces mould free high quality hay. All Eurobale is delivered with our own lorry that has its own ride on forklift truck. The product is fully palletised and can be stored outside. Eurobale delivers everywhere within the UK but it doesn't end there. Eurobale is delivered to Germany, France and Ireland. Eurobale supplies a variety of customers not just the racehorse industry. Eurobale has supplied the Metropolitan Police in London for the last 15 years and surprisingly they take up to 500 tonnes a year and the deliveries include Kings Cross, Great Scotland Yard and Wandsworth. Not only that we also supply two big horse sanctuaries in Red Wings and Hillside and a variety of eventing and hunter livery yards. Eurobale sees itself as the premium producer of forage in this country. We want to grow within our means organically. So what we want to do is not overgrow, not over trade but we want to carry on supplying our existing customers but we're also very pleased to welcome new people on board.
