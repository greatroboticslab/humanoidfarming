Thank you. Thank you. Get these bells over here. Yep. Now I've got to get the tractor off the field. Thank you. Once we get this done, we get to go sell this property and go get us another piece of property and get some more money rolling in. We've got to pay back some money. Now I've got to figure out where I'm going to put up my shop and all that for all my vehicles. Eventually. Whoa, geez. Why is that over to the side like that? Okay. Something I must have did earlier, trying to figure out how to jack the trailer up. One other day. Every night we'll get our're cheap. A gak kind of jóie. вони shattered me. Isso. Thank you. I guess I got them all. I got all bales. I did not mean to hit that mailbox. Can we not? Can we not? Can I not get rid of some of these? Can I not get rid of none of these? None of them? Can I not get rid of the fence? Hmm. Can I get rid of that? Nope. I cannot get rid of that either. What is this? I don't know what this is. Can I get rid of that either? Salt. I mean, that's a pretty big field right there. Hmm. Hmm. The biogas plants right here too. Well, I'm going to have to figure out where I'm going to set up because I do not like being crammed over here in this one little area. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Now, I do not know what it is. Hmm. I don't like it. I don't like it at all. I guess that's a... cowboy. Can't get rid of it either. I don't know. Can't get rid of that. Well, let me see what the map looks like. Oh. Of course, it's going to save. It's going to save. It's going to save. Trying to figure out what I want to do. I could take that one that I had grass on and build my own farm there. Or I could do it on 90, 82. That's a pretty big field too. 91 is not as big as... That one is... That one is 254,000. This one is... 512. So, guess what? And this one is... 89,000. Oh, what is this? I don't even know. I think it's something I probably need to go over and take the harvester and go harvest. It is barley. Yep. I need to get that barley harvest. No more. This one is... There you go. Yeah. Yeah. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. Do not.ン They're in GO All o'clock. All o'clock. Billy. Yeah. Let's go. You everything? wow mmm Look at this harvested and I need to get this filled here 87. Yeah 87, filled 87. Alright, let him do his thing here. I gotta get the truck. We'll hook it back to the trailer. Ah, of course I'd run into the fence. I'm an idiot. I'd run into the fence. I'll take this truck back over here. Hook it back to the trailer so we can go unload the harvester. I'm gonna say it's a horse pin. I'm gonna say it's a horse pin. Yeah, I don't like where this is crammed at. At all. At all. It's a shimρι. It was justこんにちは, there was no one, so it's good enough tomin' drive him on the roof. Very nice. Yeah, just interesting. I need all this. Okay. See you next time? I'll tell you about this from now. Oh boy, so. You see a bear of me. You only keep on dreaming. You see a bear of me. You see what I mean? You want toอ Sand beside me on your face like this? I have to look at acreages and see what field is bigger. I think this field over here is bigger with grass on it. Okay, where'd the combine go? Oh, he's on the backside of this hill, that's why I didn't see him. Um, let's see what we can get for alfalfa bales. We'll get rid of those bales. Oh, garlic. I haven't seen that before. Garlic. Hmm, interesting. Uh... Wow, there's whiskey on here. I didn't see alfalfa bales. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. I didn't see half alpha bales that's how far for hay but that's not bales there's hay I don't know if there's gonna be anywhere to sell them bales chemical shed fertilizer seed warehouse okay nothing under that factory selling points here we go biogas no no what the no bales no bales no bales bulk selling stations mmm the dish all filled tight see you can see bales there just about everything under the kitchen sink animal feeder I bet that I bet that I bet you can sell bales there I bet selling point you can sell your harvested and produce good produced sorry produced good used to be hmm let's try it well biogas plants 120 120,000 hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm great crushers hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm I don't know. Sawmill. Spinnery. Brie Crusher. Tailor Shop. Copper. Rope Maker. Tailor Shop. Dairy. Potatoes. Soup Factory. Spinnery. Bakery. Carpentry. Cement. Dairy. Grape. Greenmeal. Oldmeal. Hmm. That I don't know. Hmm. That I don't know. Hmm. That I don't know. That one's got bales. But I don't know. I don't know if it'll sell grass. If I can sell grass there or not. I don't know. I don't know. I hate to put it down and not be able to throw anything on it. What is on this field right here. I think I'm going to turn this into my area right here. Is that field right there. I think that's what I'm going to do. I think that's what I'm going to do. Uh. It's in here. Stuff. I can put it in somewhere else. Oh. It's got a chicken coop attached to it. Eh. What is this? Oh yeah. This is that one thing I didn't even know nothing about. It's a clover. I think it's going to be with the regular harvester. I think. I'm going to try something. I don't know if this is going to work or not. Move this truck out of the way for now. Oh. Alright. Oh. He's full. Where's the orange truck? I guess we'll go around the back side. Okay. Looks like another farm set up over here. Okay. Okay. Looks like another farm set up over here. Okay. Yeah. I know you're blocked by an object because I'm right here unloading. Okay. Okay. Okay. Unloading. Give me two seconds. Give me two seconds. Oh, I ran to a tree. Just over here out of the way. Is that another grass field right there? What is that? Yep, grass. And of course, it's gonna save. Gonna save. Alright, um. Trying to think, um. Let's see what this grass field looks like, where I'm at. Oh, it's right there, 93. There's supposed to be some more stuff over here. Tell you what, I don't know why that's cut, and I'm gonna go over and visit. Go over and visit. And of course, that's in the way. In the way. In the way. In the way. Okay. This is a little more open, but I bet you can't get rid of none of this stuff on here. Okay. If... Just look. I don't see anything worth messing with. Hmm. Don't see anything worth messing with. Go down here and look. There's... Open Mont 145. Visit it. I was down in a ravine. I like that. I don't like that at all. Um. There's another open lot. Let's see. Visit. I don't like that at all. I guess I'm gonna go down here. I just... I don't know. I'm gonna go down here. I'm gonna go down here. I have a very good idea. I'm gonna go down here. I'm gonna go down here. I'm gonna go down here. bad but I bet you if you laid anything down it would uh... paraform everything to death. Let's go visit that. This is like a horse ranch. I haven't really been around this map that much so I don't know where everything's at. Upper mess of Sipu. Oh that's on. Upper Miss... River Missis... Upper Mississippi River Valley. I don't know why I could not say that. Open lot. Now that's more flat. I bet I could put some... some sell points down there. Um... Forest. There's another open lot right here. What's this down here? Is that a gas station? That it is. Fuel station, gas station, something. Huh. I wonder how big this open lot is. Let's see. 142. How many acres is it? It's not going to tell me. 18 acres. Forest. 70 acres. Oh wow. Go ahead and cut some trees now. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. I think it probably wouldn't hurt to take over that 91. forest 70 acres oh wow go ahead and cut some trees now i think it probably wouldn't hurt to take over that 91 just put my stuff down over there where i want to where i want to do it at just take up field 91. i think that's what i'm gonna do in a vehicle oh what is the ai doing what is he doing now he's backing all the way back up the hill i don't know sometimes i wonder about the ai in this game it is better though they are better than what they used to be 22 are really bad oh i know what i was after now i had to think for a minute what i was after oh now we don't count watch us window tent oh that's right uh i'm gonna go blank and exhaust black hot long main color we'll go i'll do green and we'll go sign color i think this is why i did that other one i can't remember yep there's that and then the next one this one was the yellow vulture there we go yeah that was like a setup that i had last time uh I don't know what other design color it is. Oh. I don't know about that. That's a little bit much on the yellow. Yeah, that works. A little bit much on the yellow. Yellow. Yellow. Yellow. Um. I got a rice header. Cool. Transporting wheels. Yes. U.S. Dang. Now let's put brands on there. Main color will go green. Design color will go yellow. There we go. Let's go yellow. Green color. Yellow. Yellow. Yellow. Yellow. Yellow. Yellow. Green color. Black. There we go. So I know that goes to that. Ooh. Don't quite have enough. Don't quite have enough. Eh. Just lose it for now. Fine. Now where'd he go? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Nope. Full. That's what I thought. I thought it was going to be full. Alright, here we go, here we go, here we go. Here we go. Ah, that's emptying. Alright. Oh. Alright. Oh. The bus turned on its yellow lights. Oh yeah, this thing is super fast. Super fast. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I don't understand why this is not out more away from the combine. It's a little bit too. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh my God. Oh. Oh yeah. Maybe it won't hang up. I don't know. See, it hangs up and then it throws me for a loop. I don't understand. Stop. I'm booking it down the road. Whoa. I don't know if this harvester is going to work on that. I've never seen that crop, so I don't know. No one took it over here and tried it out. What up, Patrick? Patrick. Just doing a little late night farming there, buddy. Well, this thing will pick that up. There it goes. I don't know if this is a new crop type I haven't seen before. What the? I'm hung up. This is clover. I don't know what the hell clover is, but I'm going to try it and see if this works. Yep, it does. Not ready to work, this build, or already worked? What do you mean it's already worked? Oh, it's not ready to cut? I don't know. Weird. I don't know. Something weird. Let's see. It shows it's ready to harvest. Obviously, you don't use this header on it. I don't know what I just did. Oh, I goofed something up. I don't know. I've never seen clover, so I don't know what it's used for, Patrick. I don't even know what the hell to cut it with. Hold on a second, Patrick. Let me see what I can do here. Um. Maybe it... I don't know. Maybe it takes the rice header. I don't know. I hate not knowing what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. I need to mow it. Oh. Okay. It needs to be mowed. So you can bale it then, I guess. So it's a type of grass. Oh. Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. I understand now. I thought it was some type of thing used to harvest her on. Wasn't sure. So. Never seen it before. I don't know how far it goes back. It says I own this acreage back here. I wonder how far it goes back. I wonder how far it goes back. Let's see if I got room to drop something here. Drop this one rower. Oh, I should have pulled up more. Let me go get the mower attachment. Oh, the mower is right there. I'm thinking a butcher HQ is good. I think it'll have been a Caribou that枝 is great. For the 50... the primaver, asor the bad thing is muscular! Yeah. Thank you. Oh, dang, man. Whoop, whoop, whoop. I'm in the way. Yep, he's mowing it. Yep, you're right. Mow, mow, mow. It's hard to, I did two fields already mowing. Mow, mow, mow. Mow to mow. At least you got it figured out. Oh, I did not want to do that. Yeah, I'll be flipping out too. Why is that jumping? Oh, my God. I actually don't need this right now anyways. Mark it right here. This must be a pig born. Must be a pig born. Hmm. I wonder if... What is... Uh... Clover. What's it going for? It's down right now. It don't sell to Ohio until January. I need a... I need a trailer to pick it up. Hang on Pat. I'm gonna get you in chat. Uh... Hang on. Bear with me. Y'all. Watching. Where am I? I wanna see if I can... Uh... Patrick if you can hear me jump over to... Razor's chat. It should show up. Without me having to mess with too much. In his general over in his discord. I think it'll pick you up without... Having to mess with too much stuff. What it racks? My mic. I'm gonna turn my mic down a little bit. Cause it's peaking. Uh... Uh... Let's see. Yep. I can hear you. I'm looking to see if it's going through on this end. Say something again. No. No. It's not. It's okay. I'll figure it out real quick. Okay. I'm gonna turn it off. It's okay. I'll figure it out real quick. Okay. Let's see. Yep. I can hear you. I'm looking to see if it's going through on this end. Say something again. Test it. Hello. Yeah, it's working. It's working.

Yeah, not in the middle of a dead winter with snow on the ground, but still could have been worse. Well, yeah, I mean, if it happened in the wintertime, I wouldn't have heat. Yeah, well, you know, if you had to, you could get an electric heater and plug it up. I mean, you could survive. You've done it, you know. Not really, I don't got the money thrown in. Well... Yeah. Oh, this is going to be a fun one right here. I can already tell. I'm playing on the 4X map, Montana. Yeah. I have to play GTA. We didn't have many games to play. Kind of in the mood for the story part. Yeah. Of course, I can't do online stuff for PlayStation Plus. Right, right, right, right, right. You know, I've just been forming, bro. Of course, I didn't think about that. I was like, I was sitting, and I finally got... I don't remember what... What I did. And I'm like, oh, yeah. I need to try... No, there's a new... A new update on the online part. They actually got... You know... A deal to where... You can... If you got the... You run a... You're... Like, weed business or whatever, and the cops start paying attention to you. You can actually... Own, like, the car wash and run a legit business. Hmm. Take the heat off of you. Yeah. You have a neat aspect to take the heat. You remember... You remember Buddy Simple, right? Yeah. Thanks, Bill. Um... He's on a PC, but he's on a laptop. And I'm gonna try to see... I'm gonna try to see if he can... Maybe try to get farm sims. See if it were on his... Laptop. Laptop. Because... My buddy Cajun that I watch... I talk to all the time... He runs it off of a laptop. And it runs just as good as it does off the PlayStation. And he ain't got... He said he ain't got a very expensive laptop. It's just an old cheapo laptop. And Farm Sim 25 runs off of it. So we might see Simple in here. Yeah, we got it. It... Before... What I would recommend before he spends the money... Is to look up the specs... And make sure the specs are gonna... Oh, he didn't spend the money on it. And he's got a friend that they let him... They let him borrow their laptop... Because he's watching their house. So... They let him... No, I meant on the game. I guess... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. You gotta make... You wanna make sure that... It's at least a minimum. Yeah. It's not at least a minimum. The old run of the call. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, it runs 7 Days to Die... And it runs... And 7 Days to Die is pretty demanding on my PC. Even on my tower is pretty demanding. But it runs 7 Days to Die... And he said it runs it pretty well. So I don't know if Farm Sim would run or not. But if it does... I'm gonna try to get him on there... And start playing Farm Sim with him. Because... He's... You know... Me and him used to run 22 all the time. Me, you, him, and... Razor. Razor's over there... I think he's playing Repo or something with Embers. The Embers. They were playing Repo. I don't know what they're playing now. But they were playing Repo earlier. The Gamer 19. How's it going? How's it going? Sorry, I didn't see that earlier. It's going. Could be better, could be worse, you know. We're just, uh... Cutting some wheat. Cutting some wheat. I got this harvester running... I got this harvester running... And I've got the other one running. I need to keep an eye on it. I don't know what the other one's cutting. To be honest... Patrick, I don't even forgot... I don't remember what the other one's even cutting. You sound like me. I got too much stuff going on at one time. I got too many harvester and stuff running on stuff. I tried playing farm time again, but it kept crashing on me. Oh, did it? Yep. It kept crashing on me. No. Go ahead. Patrick, sorry. I was talking to somebody in chat. I think there's definitely something wrong with my hard drive. I don't know if you ever had this happen on yours. It... It blue screen... Mm-hmm. It... It... It blue screen... And then... All of a sudden, it popped up and done the whole deal like it had been... Like, well, earlier when my power went off and it... Yeah. When it... It... It... It... It... It... It... It... It... It... It... It... It... It... It... It... It... It... It... It... It... It... It... It... Yeah. It... It... It... It... It... Yeah. It... You know. It... It... I don't know. No. The gamer... Uh... How the gamer... Uh... I don't farm in real life. I'm more of a mechanic more than I am a farmer. Never... I don't know much about farming. I was fishing for me. Not doing the farming. I was the truck driver. I've done a lot of stuff. Worked on cars and stuff a lot more than I've done anything else. Worked on old cars, new cars. And, of course, he stopped. Of course. Yeah, I didn't end up getting my toenails done. I got all the way in there. Doctor, that's what I want to done. And I told him, he said, we don't want them to kill it for. They didn't grow back. He said, they don't do that. That's what? Yeah. So, they told me, they actually, I was a foot doctor here in the town, so they told me about him. I called him. Yeah. And, she said they had to check to see if they actually took the insurance and they don't take Medicaid. Did I get your name right? Did I get your name right? Is it TyTheGamer19? I'm trying to see it. It's so small on my screen here. Yeah. I got to tie the game. Maybe. It must be on Twitch. You don't see it. Yeah. It's on Twitch. It's supposed to be showing up. My chat's supposed to be showing up, but it's not showing up. I don't know what happened to it. Well, I've seen my stuff when I typed it on YouTube on your screen, but I didn't pay an attention that it was on YouTube, but I can't play it on YouTube. I don't see if you can't do that. Well, I'm on Twitch, too, so if you can switch over there to Twitch, it's fine. Because I can't pause it or turn the volume off. Well, you can watch it on Twitch. If I'm over. I got it up on Twitch, too, so. So, I hear you twice. Yeah. Okay. I just want to make sure I got it right. I'm not good with names. I'm not good with names. Oh, yeah. This guy's done. Get this guy off the field here. Oh, there goes that airplane again. The airplane kills me. Hey, Ty, since you're in the chat, can you hear the tractors and stuff? Is the sound still good? I'm pretty sure y'all can hear Patrick and the other end. I just want to make sure everybody can hear the sound. Because I messed with sound a little ago. I want to make sure it's still working. Hmm. Hmm. Where'd it try to go there, I guess? Yeah. So, anyway, I called. I got a... I was going to call the insurance to find out if there was any meeting around that they covered. And then their little chat deal on their app online. The lady sent me three names. Yeah. So I called the first one because it was the closest one. Yeah. And they said, well, we just got told like two weeks ago that we don't take it because we had trouble with it. They do the services and then the insurance is turned out. Right. Now I got to go all the way to Topeka, which is over an hour away. Hopefully they'll actually go ahead and do it. We'll go do that Friday. I don't know if you're hurting or not. I'm glad because my left one started hurting. We just knock over a sign in the middle of the road. That's fine. It's all right. Anyways, I was going to say, Ty, tell you thank you for making sure that worked. Appreciate that. Okay. Okay. Now I got to get the baler. No, I don't need the baler. I need to pick her up or anything. Not the baler. I got to go get one. I don't need the baler. Yeah, Ford wagon. I do hope I don't get a freaking bunch of spam calls if I'm trying to take a nap tomorrow. I'm going to have to have my ring on so I can hear my phone go off. Well, I might. I don't hear much. I hope I don't have to. I hope I can stay awake. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. What was that about? Huh? What was that playing in the background? Oh, you're playing GTA. Yeah, I got you. I got you. I don't I'm trying to figure out what just happened it was the Yeah, I was ordering a taxi normally the the Volume where they talk on them through the remote that time to come to the TV, and I have no idea how I guess nothing may I don't know if we play state what's going on I don't know it didn't work in volume I had to Turn the game off and I Went ahead and reset my started my PlayStation Is the I couldn't get the radio to work in the game I don't know those I have no idea I haven't met GTA in forever I have no idea I Didn't they could been that long just played it going back in February apparently I don't remember any of that I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I Hang on Ty, give me just a second here. Let's see what you said. Do you have a modded engine in your tractor? Yeah. Yeah, it's a mod on ModHub. It's in the actual ModHub of the game. It's the case. That's a great case that's in the ModHub. 125. 125. This thing's got a twin turbo set up too. Mine don't have the twin turbo now. I slowed it down. The other twin turbo, I think I talked about at 125. I don't know if I told you that or not, Patrick. Well, I see your combine going that fast. I didn't know the tractor. Yeah, the one that Razor put in the tree. Yeah. Yeah, this is the same tractor. Yeah, they had that one in 22 too. Yeah. Oh, I told you. Did I tell you they finally... Somebody finally got my this Nordic case. Yeah, I think you told me about that, yeah. You got two doctor's appointments coming up for them. You got to go on the... I think it's the 7th. To see the regular doctor. And... I'm like the 23rd, 24th. I'm like that. I got to go see the... Oh, you got to go see the shrink. Yeah, for the mental... Yeah, yeah. Basically, it's the mental health part. I asked the lady that... was doing my case through... through... I was handling it to help me out with paperwork and everything. Yeah. Yeah. She said that basically just the... the... with the... depression and that kind of stuff. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. She said they'll ask you a bunch of questions related to that. Yeah. And like... I get a hope it's none of that other... mental gymnastics stuff I had to do before... when I had to do all the meds... that... that stuff made my brain hurt. Yeah. It'll probably make my brain hurt... I don't want my brain to handle, so... really... it. Ty, you got it yesterday, huh? I drove my car on into it late. Yeah. I've done there... been there, done that. Well, I didn't drive it in late. Hey, I drove it in late. It's 122 and I spent hours trying to get it out. Yeah. Is this the first time you've played 20... or farm sim, Ty? Or have you played it before? I'm assuming he can hear me. Yeah. They can hear you. It seemed... it seemed like when 25 came out, it seemed like there was a lot more new players. from your seed. Yeah. No, he played 22. Say hi to him. Oh, okay. So, I played 22 too. Before I played this one, so... See, I started on like... Did it not... ...15 or 17? Pick that up? What is going on here? Oh, I'm full. No wonder. Okay. I'm an idiot. I was like... Yeah, I started back in like... 15 or 17. I don't remember which one... One of those two. back in like 15 or 17, I don't remember which one, but one of those two. Actually, I need to go look. I just thought of something. Now I'd have to... I don't know. I'll have to do it. Now I would. I haven't. Let's see if I brought my... When I moved up here, if I... I had a couple of game discs. I don't remember what games I had. I don't know if I brought them up here. I had 19. I can see it's one off. No, it's not in that box. I guess maybe I didn't think of it. You played 09. I didn't know there was an 09. I played 22. That's when I first started playing. It was 22. I played... I played a little 19, but I didn't play much. It was... very little. It didn't really pique my interest. And then 22 came out and... A buddy of mine... Said get it and we'll do some farming. And I got where I learned the controls. That was my biggest thing, was learning the controls. Once I learned the controls, it wasn't that big of a deal. I've been playing it. I played a lot of it in 22. I saw... a tornado on this game... last night. The first one I've seen in here. I've been playing it. I've been playing it. I've played a lot of it in 22. I've been playing it. I've played a lot of it in 22. Ahem. I saw... a... a tornado on this game... last night. The first one I've seen in here. I saw a tornado on this game last night. The first one I've seen in here. I've seen it last night. There even comes up a little icon over there, Patrick, on the top up there where it's got the sun at. It shows that when there's a tornado coming. Yeah, it's like in the forecast. Alright, John Deere, you're going to have to move. You're in my way. That guy, Dash, I told you guys about in the past. We got one! We got one! I'm going to have to move. I'm going to have to move. I'm going to have to move. Hey Ty, I appreciate that. The tornado will tear them up. Yeah, I turn it on visual only. If you want to watch a lot more content, I have over like 800-900 videos over on YouTube, too, Ty. So, I've got a lot of stuff on YouTube. I know I don't have a lot on Twitch, but I've got a lot of stuff on YouTube. I've got like 800 different videos. I've got a lot of stuff on YouTube. I appreciate the follow though. I appreciate that. I appreciate, appreciate. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. I'm full again. I don't have to pay more attention to my, when I'm full. Yeah, you're like me, you just get to going. Yeah. Everything else just kind of. Oh, did I tell you what happened the other day with SnowRunner? You remember I had to do that update, right? Yeah. It took like a week or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. I went to, I was going to play the golf game and I got fired it up and it needed an update. So I needed done that update. Well, the only thing I can really play while I'm doing an update is SnowRunner. Mm-hmm. So I went to fire SnowRunner up and all of a sudden, poof, SnowRunner is added to the download. It was redoing the update I just did. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You told me that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Crazy. I've never seen that happen before either. Wait a minute. Yeah, I literally just did it like a week ago. It might have been, they might have done two, they might have rolled two updates out too. It might have been a hot fix. No, it was the same one at 38, 30 something megabyte. Mm-hmm. If it had been a hot fix, it wouldn't have been, it wouldn't have been nothing near that. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Hopefully my disability comes through so I can get a PC, I don't have to worry about it. Yeah. Yep, yep, yep. That would be the nice part. Like I said, I don't have to have all that extra, spend all that extra money to play online. Like with GTA, I wouldn't have to worry about it. You could just play it. Yeah. Well that was another thing I didn't realize that. Simple's back. What's going on, Simple? Sub-Simple. Sub-Simple. Yeah, apparently one of the, there's the two, two different stock markets on GTA and one of them apparently, you got to be connected to the internet for it to actually work. Yeah. I guess I never realized that. Hmm. Alright. Headed home from work. Yeah, I see, I see a YouTube chat showing up on the screen. What moreøre's not showing up to Twitch? Well, I don't, whilst sit. It's probably just Bot Rex being stupid. It's probably just Bot Rex being stupid. Wait, come on, chip. That was the Jál Prince shooting janvady. Yeah. I. Nothing back. I was buying, I put them off going here. Or maybe I just missed it. I don't know. Eh, it could be just BotRix being stupid. If Kyle is in here maybe he can type something and I can see if it pops up on the... He was in here a while ago, so... I guess I could. I'm in there. God, maybe I do need to get a bug. Holy crap. Oh wow. Wait, what happened? Oh there it is. Oh yeah, sure enough, I guess it is. It just... It probably missed it. No, it's there, it just... I thought it was distinguishing on which chat was... No, I know why I missed it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what is going on? Stupid signs underneath me. Alright, um... Yeah, I've been trying to keep up where it shows chat on both ends, but... Well, I just assumed it was going to be in a different spot so you can see, you know, if they're coming through for different ones or... No, it does it all in one... It does it all in one thing. I know. I was just... I was just looking in a different spot, that's why I never even noticed it. Mm. Of course I am in... Yeah, you're on your phone too, so... It could be... I am in the place, so I just... I don't know why I would have to split up. Yeah, my brain just... Alright, well we got that field done now. Now I'm going to... Um... It's gonna pause, gonna save... I just hope I'm not having one of my good days when I gotta go see them doctors. Right. Cause I want them to be able to really see... What happens. Oh, my guy's full again. I got busy doing something. I got busy doing something. What's the bathroom? Go ahead of me, and... Where's the combine at? It's gotta be down here. Yeah, there it is. There it is. Where's the combine at? Yeah. There it is. There it is. There it is. Where's the KonBan at? It's gotta be down here. There it is. There it is. There it is. We did earlier, not like when it first came out, but the tree stuff is, they don't have the hitboxes on the trees are too big and the claws don't want to pick them up good enough. That's my biggest complaint about trees. Other than that, it's okay, it's just the way the hitboxes are on the trees, it doesn't do right. I still do them. I have done them on this map, because I just got this map and I just started on it today. This is Montana, the four times map. Judith Plains, four times. Look at all the fields, there's fields everywhere. I just started on this map today. So, I don't have none of my stuff set up or anything. I'm kind of surprised to see you playing it, because I know you usually don't do much with third party stuff. Well, this truck and trailer is third party. I had to learn how to do all that and I just don't usually want to take the time to mess with it, but it is what it is. Yeah, it's a different process, but there's different ways of doing it. I know there's a... You been to Montana? There's one. I ain't never been to Montana. I've wanted to go one day, but... What was you saying, Patrick? What was I saying? What was I saying? Oh, there's at least one person that I know there might be more I think there might be. It's got like an actual... I don't know if you really call it an app on a computer. I'm not sure what you call it, but it's a deal where you got a specific place for your mods to make it. What's going on? What's going on? Talk about it. It's just harder to deal with them. Yeah. There's guys that have made programs... Programs, I wouldn't call them. Yeah. ...that make it easier to deal with. Yeah. I just don't know what they are without my head. It's just a little bit of a fucker. Yeah. Yeah. I just don't know what they are without my head. I just don't know what they are without my head. What's going on, Mr. Shane? Appreciate you dropping by, Mr. Shane. This is a third party mod, too. There's plenty of good ones out there. Sometimes you gotta be careful where you get them. Yeah. Crowther's one that knows all that stuff. Oh, no wonder it turned off already. I had my thermostat in there. I don't remember turning it up. I had it. It might have reset it when you threw the breaker, Patrick. No, because the breaker had nothing to do with the thermostat box. Oh. I don't know. The thermostat box is actually a battery opera, I think. I don't know. I might have to check into that, because I don't remember ever checking. I haven't changed the battery since I've lived here, so. I don't know. I have no idea, bro. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah. Shane, we're on the... Hopefully it'll get back on here in a minute, because it's definitely gonna be cooler. I'm on the... I'm on the... I'm on the... I'm on the... I'm on the Montana map. Yeah. Montana, big sky country. And I've heard people say that it's actually... You legitimately... There's... That's a legitimate name for this place. You go there and you come back, holy crap, it really is. Oh, yeah. I've heard a lot of people tell me that. There's just something about it. Nothing. It's just... There's really nothing there. It's so wide open. Yeah. I mean, you wanna talk about a place you can go... You know, to be able to... They tell you, you don't realize how many stars are actually out there until you get somewhere where there's a mile of light. Oh, yeah. I've been in the middle of the ocean on a cruise ship. You can see a lot more stars than you can... Oh, we're here in town. ...than I've ever seen before. But they say you go to like somewhere in like Montana where you're hundreds of miles from any kind of light source. You see stars you can't even imagine. Yeah. I can see that. And you look up right now and, you know, say you're even like 10 miles outside of the city that I live in, there's still light pollution. And you see stars, all them spaces in between all the stars you're seeing, there's thousands of stars there that you don't even see. Yeah. That you can see in places like Montana. That's a big map. Shane, it's a big map. I can tell you that. That's a big map. What? That's a big map. You're not a big map. You're not a big map. You have a giant map. I mean, there's still a big map. But I can see a map. Yeah, I have a couple things on the map. Let's see. The only thing I don't like about the map is all of this stuff is permanent. Because I'm big on using my own stuff. Don't play in the street. No, no, no. Tried to, can't do nothing of that. I'm just going to take over where I cut that cover at, where I cut that at. I'm going to make up my own little farm area over in this area over here. Well, I don't know how hard it is because I've never actually done it. I've heard people say it's fairly easy to mess with. Get the download Giants editor. Yeah, I don't want to start messing with mod and editing and all that. No, this game mod, all you got to do is go into the file and remove it. I've heard it's fairly easy to change a lot of this. Yeah, I did all that crap in SnowRunner. That's what we kind of do all that. Well, removing barns is totally different. Actually making three mods. Well, that's what they used to do with in-game trucks on SnowRunner and go in there and change the value of the tires and do different things. and it does my head in until I can figure out a way to... until I can figure out a way to learn. There's plenty of people on YouTube that that video is very detailed on how to do it. I never watch it. I don't have a way to do it. Crap. I got four again. Some of the cars are in this game. Doing the taxi deals, I got the one guy that's like a redneck passenger. I just run over and wrapped it, grabbed it and the guy that asshole deserved it. On Maple Pool, huh? That's cool. That's cool, Shane. I'll have to check it out when you get it or come by. I drop by sometimes and you may not even know them there. I just drop by and I'll see what you're up to. And if I can, I'll try to leave you up in the background whenever you're streaming and I'm streaming. And leave you a like over on YouTube. On the old YouTubes. Maypole Farm, huh? That's a name. I always like that. What was it? I want to say 19. I have no idea. It was come out. It was one of the most recent years. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It was one of them. I don't remember right. I think I'm thinking of the right one. Yeah, Crofter got me, Shane got me downloading third party mods. I download this map and this truck and this trailer. You think you have problems with doing stuff on the computer? Just wait till I end up getting a PC. I'm going to be like a freaking kindergartner or something trying to learn how to walk. Yeah. I figure out how to do all this stuff. Because I've used computers before but I've never gamed on computers. I don't know any of this stuff about it. Right. Anything. I know absolutely zero. I can turn a computer on and go to different places but you know. how much is that? How much is that? I think that feels a million dollars. It is. Well. That combines working on that field. It is. Well, that combine is working on that field. I might just... I got another truck, but oh yeah, I hooked up to the other trailer. I don't have another empty. I really should be in bed right now. What do you think the odds are to actually show up early? I don't know. Depends on what their schedule is. What they got going on. You know what I'm saying? You could be down at the bottom of the list or you could be at the top of the list. You never know. Maybe if I stay up long enough, maybe I just sleep here on the couch and then... I don't know. I just don't want to miss it because I don't want to end up having to wait like another week. Mm-hmm. Don't get me wrong. The worst thing I got to do is heat up the water on the stove and dump in the bathtub to take a warm bath. Mm-hmm. I just don't want to pass because I don't feel like you get clean in the bath. Mm-hmm. Because you wash off and you rinse off and you feel like it hurts. And then you get in your body, you're just rinsing your body out with dirty water. Right. And soapy water. Right. Right, Shane? Dagnabbit Crocker. Yep. That's true. All right. Let me figure out where my... You're streaming thing. I might go over there and give him a call when you're streaming. Oh, Shane? I don't have... Yeah, I don't have... I don't have his... I don't have my stuff set up to where I can... It's... Shane, you... I don't know if you can... You're not a moderator. No, I'm a mod on YouTube. I can go to... Yeah. Yeah, go to his channel and check him out. He does a lot of... A lot of bigger maps than what I run, usually. Yeah, I'll give him... Yeah, that's something I like about being a mod on YouTube. You can actually go to... Yeah. People's pages. Okay, where is my other comment? I'm buying that. Yeah, I wouldn't give him a call over there. Support anybody. Is he done? Yep. He's done. I think... Yeah, it's done. Okay. I'm just tuning around doing my taxi thing. Can't really do the story mode while I'm... I'm messing with you because when the... I've got to be able to pay attention to the... Yeah. When you're chatting. To the dialogue, so... Yeah. Yeah. That's why they're... You know, you see all these people. Even C's would do it where he played games. Where there's like a dialogue. There's no way. I can't. I've got to be able to pay attention to what's going on there. I can't. Yeah. Did you find it? It's Hobby Corner. I don't know if you found it or not. Yeah. Yeah. You go to his... When I clicked on his name, the first thing that popped up was the link to the overdue. Yeah. Yeah. It's Hobby Corner. I couldn't remember... I gave him a message that I subscribed. All right. Just put him in. Go to you. That's it. Man, that guy's full again. Must be a big yield off that field over there. There's a small tank on the combine. We had one. Maybe it was just the one that was in here. The other base game one? I don't know if it's a base game or not. I don't know if it's been modded or not. But it was the one I got with the starter farm. I don't know if it was a base game. I think it's hard to tell. I'm not sure. I don't need a modern stuff on it. It's likely probably... If not base game, it's not... Not nothing like the Colossus where it's got like 5 million liters trying to pull all out. Like 10 or 12,000 liters. So... Mm-mm. I didn't even turn it up that high. It don't take long to fill it up. I didn't even turn my Colossus up that high. I only turned it up to like 250,000 liters. There's more than that. I just didn't turn it up that high because... It doesn't make sense. I don't want a tap because I... P jurisprudence... It doesn't make sense. Oh, God. There he is. This is aimage. There he is. I'm considering a juice. Thanks, guys. I guess I said quite too much about my ACX. Not like it did. The other racers don't even have an ACX. Mm-mm. Not right now, he don't. I think he's got somebody coming. I thought he told me that he... I thought he said that... Appreciate you, Shane. ...he just spent a bunch of money, so he wasn't sure. I thought he said he had somebody coming. I can't remember. He told me one time the other day, but I can't remember if he said he had somebody coming. I thought he did, because we got to talking about the AC or something. Jane, have a good night, bro. I know he... Later, Shane. I know he talked about looking into possibly... Somebody mentioned that portable one. I thought he might say, hell, if anything, I would just shove a damn window unit in there just in the living room where at least you can have some type of air. Dad, or like I said, one of them mobile ones, I... You know, if there's something with a... I was worried about the... Lady that owns the house. I'd ask, you know. It wasn't hard to ask, but it's gonna be a lot cheaper than... Probably a repair job on the other one. At least be something. It's only better than nothing. That's why... The way my body is, I could... I could deal with anything. There's no way. Yeah. Dude, I didn't even go out and check the mail the other day when it got up 100 degrees until like midnight. It was still like 80 degrees. Mm-hmm. Midnight. I'm like, yeah, this shouldn't help. Way too frickin' hot for this. Oh, yeah. Of course, I can just be sitting down on my couch and start sweating, so... I had trouble earlier with that other tray. I don't know where the hell I'm gonna sell my damn alfalfa bales. I was trying to look that up earlier. I'm trying to see here. Let's see. Alfalfa bales. See, I didn't see alfalfa bales on this. Well, if it's something the mapmaker put on the map specifically, then they should have put a place where you sell them. I would have thought. I would assume it would be the same place where you sell the grass and stuff. But... I don't know. I'm gonna go take them over there to the animal dealer and see if I can sell them over there. You didn't find it on the list? Mm-mm. Well, didn't they make that list? Um... It's not the same as modern stuff today. Mm-mm. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'm gonna go take them over there to the animal dealer and see if I can sell them over there. So, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I think it's the same one. I don't know. I don't know. I think it's the same on modded stuff. I don't know. I don't know. It could be. But this place takes alfalfa so I'm pretty sure it should take bagels. I don't know. I don't know. I think it's the same on modded stuff. I don't know. It could be. But this place takes alfalfa so I'm pretty sure it should take bagels. The animal dealer takes some. I don't know. I don't know. Well, dealer thinks that's one of the main places on pretty much any map that they failed. If there's one place that should take them, that'd be the place. Yeah. I'm gonna run down here and see. Really? Oh, it must be on a plane. I was just gonna say, somebody trying to pass me running 60? I didn't. The other thing was amazing. I think it is reallybroken on the event Lets pass my hand Yes What you got? Just mad Your one What should we get happen to Ah Yep. Yep. We're all gone now. I'm not the biggest fan of this trailer. Oh, is that that modern one you were talking about? No, it's... Yeah, this is a different one. It's the one that I've got... Um... Shoot. You can lower it down and lift it up. But it just seems like it takes too much weight off the... Truck. Earlier I had an issue... Making my truck spin. Can you... Has that truck got the option where you can adjust it for a quick deal? Mmm... One of them does. I can't remember. I think this one did. I think that... I don't remember. I don't know how to wait. Well, it's just like it was... It doesn't come up enough to keep weight on the truck. Unless I push this fifth wheel. I can't remember if the fifth wheel moves on this or not. I think it does. ... That's... I don't know how to admirable. Anything that does not mean, which will make me more... Than a job. She ny programs full of times. This is very rare. From a non- system time result of the massification. Alright, now what are we doing? I want to go check the other combine. It's done. Now I've got to find my truck. There it is. I'm going to get empty into it and then... I'm going to get empty. I'm going to get empty. I'm going to get empty. I'm going to get empty. I'm going to get empty. I'm going to get empty. I'm going to get empty. Alright. I've got 91,000 liters of barley. When 5000 advisers chin home.oney Alright. I'm gonna get this barley and then I gotta see what I've gotten Whoa Rich I got 100,000 liters of clover 100,000 liter er got 68,000 liters of wheat 59,000 liters of Canola and then Where that's weird, but all right Okay, so it's moving it up, okay, so Barley's gonna have 91,000 and wheat's gonna have 68,000 and canola's 59,000 I saw it make some money Oh you heard about the Strike we did on it on Iran.

I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I don't remember if I told you or not, but World Warships are coming to PC Legends. Yeah. Yeah, you'd make them hit. Yep. I'll be able to play it on my PC. Better graphics. I don't know yet. Won't know until it gets to late. They haven't even done the second beta yet. Beta test. No. They've only run one beta test on it. So. I thought it was closer than that. Nah. You're probably looking around fall, maybe Christmas time before it ever gets on PC. Oh, let's see. What else can I do? What else can I do? I'll do it. Oh, let's see . I thought it was coming here. see what else can I do oh it's saving it's saving oh yeah I gotta go get this harvester that's why I knew there was something I was supposed to be doing and go get this other harvester oh you must have hit a sign all the AI every time they hit a sign they stop yeah yeah probably try to get some sleep I don't know what time I just hope tomorrow like one of the days that I get get bombarded by spam calls because they're gonna be calling between the gas companies so I'm not gonna be able to ignore all the calls and they won't leave a voice now if they just call twice you did I hope it ain't today for spam calls I don't end up missing their call because I gotta answer anyone that I don't recognize tomorrow I don't know I don't know what's this I don't know what's this field down here I don't know what's this field down here I don't know what's this field down here I don't know what's this field down here I don't know what's this field down here um let's see I'm not gonna worry about these itty bitty fields what's on here though I'm curious it's grass I'm not gonna worry about grass grass grass canola what's this one oof that one's higher than the other one a million something I say it was million 386 um um I think um wonder how much more money I can borrow to get that other field or not what's it could do is check to see if that field's got a contract on it maybe we can make a little better money that way yeah good do it it's you make more money doing it yourself than you do messing with contracts if you're wanting some quick money moving stuff I don't know how they I know I know I've seen some of the maps and some of the bigger stuff some contracts they're pretty good mhm and with the AI like it is now it's a lot easier to do yeah they don't put they don't put my combines in the Greek they haven't yet anyways no cause you don't gotta go in there spend an hour cutting the headwinds so they don't crash into anything and then even when you do that they're still crashing into stuff mhm alright I got 2.5 million now there we go there we go there's bar the money and then I'll pay it back when I start selling selling that other stuff mmm where is it where is it where is it tch tch tch tch tch I wonder I wonder, this medium. Special. Sleep like that. Exhaust. On pipe. Let's see if I can do. Nope, it's, it's, I don't like it. So let's see. Change main color. Oh. Oops, that is not what I wanted to do. Yeah, I don't know if I like that or not. Um. Hmm, I don't look good either. I might just put it blue too. I guess I'll blue chrome. wat meio mou oftentimes. But I'll be peeking forward. Voices raightодもおります Savedlas? Yes. Is the Gretelofral получить?author? Yes. People go down. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Big blue combine. I actually like that blue. Yeah, it's a blue chrome. That's what they call it. I think if it was me, I'd be figuring out how to get a hold of the mod at that pod. See if there's something they could do. If they made that header that goes with that combine, it should not be collating like that. It shouldn't be that hot. It shouldn't be that close. It needs to be further away from it. Well, that too. But even when you extend that boom out, that header shouldn't be sitting that hot. I think there's a way to adjust it. That's a colossus. That just seems off for the person who made that before. I think it did that in 22. I think I was gropping about it in 22 and it did the same thing. I think it's too long. I think it's too long. I don't remember. It's been too long. I don't remember. I can't remember two hours ago or an hour. I don't remember. I think it's too long. I think it's too long. I don't remember. I don't remember. I was just wondering if I was going to get a hold of the other one. That's not too long. Alright, this field we gotta get out. I didn't want to jump out. I want to disconnect. I think I'm gonna need one more taxi running. Yeah, I'm gonna start getting my shop set up and then I'm gonna get ready to get off here after I get this harvester started. I'm pretty sure she said 8 o'clock in the morning. I thought she said 8. I'd better get up at 8. Hope I can stay up. Hope I don't gotta wait all the ringing to 8. Yeah. I'll drive this truck over cause I don't wanna put it in the shop anyway. I just hope I can actually wake up. I don't do very good while I have to sit in the car. I don't know if I can't even watch it. Yeah. Level 10 just need to shut it off and roll back over. Go back to sleep. Alright, construction. Oh yeah, I got enough. Oh, I seen that tracker remember something earlier. Of all the times I've played, I don't remember seeing it. I might have but I don't think so. Um. I heard the chase starting. And I caught up to it and the cop car was chasing a tractor. That doesn't surprise me. I don't think I've ever seen a car that's chasing a tractor on this game. Hmm. Probably just a regular car. Overlamps with another obvious reason. That shouldn't be too hard to catch. Yeah. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Um. Let's see if you can do the edit round around it. I can but I'm not going to try it right now. I'll just end up goofing it up. I wanted the... Oh, I should save it again. I forgot. I wanted the... You ain't got to do nothing fancy. You just got to use the smoothing tool. You can't really screw that up. It don't usually do much over. Where's the... I wanted to go into the construction. Do I have the... There's that one, but that's not what I wanted. I don't think I have that mod. I may have to go and add that mod in there. Park my trucks in. Yeah, I don't. I'll have to add that mod later. Where is that one? Oh. There it is. Lightning failed. I wonder how bad that is now. I could look and see. Well, the easiest way to tell how much it's going to tear for me is looking at the price. Because the price will change. The price will go way up instead of tear for the ground. Which is how I was able to tell if it's going to be. And I'm trying to remember. I think if it's going to be more than a few hundred dollars. Maybe like a thousand dollars. Higher than what the basic price was. I would... I'd edit the ground. It's going to be much more than that. Oh, yeah. This back... When you guys start getting all the ridges and stuff around it. Yeah, this back is... Really bad. I wonder if I can... I can flip that around. Yeah, that's what I need to do. I could flip that around. Put it right back in the same spot. But flip it around. Make sure when you delete it to level the ground up before you do it. And then it shouldn't. Pick a spot over right where the middle of the barn noise is flat. Level it out around that. So you get it all the same... Same... Same... Levelness or whatever. Start right in the middle of the concrete there. And work your way out. If you try to set it down now it's really good. Okay. Perfect. There we go. Perfect. There we go. Okay. Perfect. There we go. Perfect. Right, Rose-tick. Perfect. That's new. Perfect. The dark side. See it... I'm going to zoom in on the other. Okay. So you can keep doing that... it wins... All I need. This will happen. Oh PL Oregon pruebs. Yeah, that's gonna come in favesipixel. Let's do that. Go back in the wall. Okay. Perfect. OK, there we go. Right. Let's do that. Make sure you go out and ask where you're actually. Barn's going to be that way. You can always go out and smooth that, those edges down, half of it. That's what I always do if there's a maze like that, I just use the smoothing tool. You can easily get it pretty close to where it needs to be. Thank you. Yeah, I'm goofing that all up. What are you? What are you using? What are you using, sculpting? Actually, I need to do this. I need the smoothing one. I can't see the screen very well. So what? I'm going to do this. I need the smoothing one. I can't see the screen very well. So what? Oh, you're, yeah, okay. You were using the, see it don't show, oh, no, I can't see it now at the bottom. I think it's the bottom left one that's the smoothing one. You were using the raising lower. Yeah, it's stopping. That's it. It's stopping. It just takes that edge away. It softens your best friend. It just gets that edge, moves that edge right up. Yeah, I don't mind a little bit of a slope like that as long as it needs that real hard tip. That's a lot easier to do on PC too. It's easier to control a mouse and use that controller. Oh, I'm using a controller. Oh, are you? Yep. I'm sure if you. Yep. I don't use a mouse and keyboard. It depends on what I would do. There's certain things I'd do on there that I'd switch over to. The mouse is just easier to. Is it letting you go change that around that? It's already there. No. Is it not doing it? No. No. You get to look at it. If your money's not going out, then it ain't working. No. It's not really doing much. Yeah, sometimes it'll let you if you're, if you already got the building here. Alright, now I gotta ffff. Alright, well I think I'm getting the clock and I'm gonna come off early. Alright. Well, I probably don't gotta get up right at 8. I don't know that. I doubt they'd be there. Oh, why am I inside the, inside the barn? Oh. Yeah, I see it. Yeah, I just caught it right at the last. When you put it down, it was only like $250 more than the base price. Well, it wouldn't be adjusted that much. Yeah, see that didn't look too bad. No. Uh, this is gonna be a deal over here I'm gonna have to fix. Uh, I can fix that though. Yeah, I see if I, if I had it I'd be the one I'd get it. I got to get you. I could even do that, that sloping one. I got pretty decent with that. The only thing a lot of people I travel with is that one. I don't have any issues with the sloping one. The thing with the sloping one, the people that you gotta pay attention to is you gotta make sure you start and stop at the same spot and don't let off the trigger until you get to where you want to go because that's where people mess up. They try to start in the middle of the spot and start from the beginning and that's where it gets all screwed up. Oop, I went too far. Alright, I better put you up. I'm just putting the vehicles away so I'm just trying to do that right now. I'm gonna get up early. It's gonna be a long frickin' day tomorrow. I thought the cable company would be bad. I'm gonna give you three or four hours of time frame. This is frickin' twelve hours. Eight and eight. Yeah, I'm not far. Like I said, I'm not far either. I'm just... Oop. What the hell did I hit? Oh, I hit that pile of wood there. Alright, well they're clear. Alright, man. I'm gonna get out of here. I'm gonna get out of here. I'm gonna get out of here. I'm gonna get out of here. I'm gonna get out of here. I'm gonna get out of here. I'm gonna get out of here. Alright, man. Alright, man. Alright, man. Thank you. Thank you. Is there anything? Oh yeah. The windrow order is on. The windrow order is on. The windrow order is on. The windrow order is on. The windrow order is on. The windrow order is on. The windrow order is on. The windrow order is on. Thank you. Thank you. I know why I'm going through there. No way. No way. No way. No way. No way. No way. No way. No way. No way. No way. No way. No way. Yeah. No way. No way. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Come on.
