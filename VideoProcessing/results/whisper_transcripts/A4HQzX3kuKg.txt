Howto & Style
 Well we're back talking sheep. Last time we spoke about what to do to get your property ready for sheep and to prepare yourself to have a really positive experience. Today I'm with Gavin Wall, past principal of Marinda Limousin and Suffolk Sheep Stud, past president of the Australian Stud Sheep Breeders Association and international sheep and cattle judge and he's here to help you have a much easier time of bringing your new sheep home. Gavin how are you mate? Really good and today we're here to do the three R's. We're going to get right into it, the responsibility, rotations and relationships and a few other things to add on there as well. Mate there's lots of knowledge coming, guys strap yourselves in if last time was any indication we're going to learn a lot. Let's get into talking about what to do when you get home with your sheep. It can be a bit stressful when you get your sheep home for the first time and you wonder what on earth you've done and what on earth you're doing so today should help people out with some of the basics. We're going to aim to reduce that stress. Today's video is brought to you by Davos Fencing Clip. Designed, manufactured and owned in Australia this innovative little clip makes repairing or building fences super easy and satisfying. For timber, steel or plastic posts follow the link in the description to get yours today. Now Gavin before we get home you want us to stop and get something on the way. Yes when we picked up our sheep we read the sheep health statement and we noticed what drench they'd used. Yep. So we need to get an alternate drench to that on the way home and our area may be predisposed to barber's pole worms so we need to get a triple acting drench to make sure that we don't bring any new source of barber's pole onto the property. Now we know it's a triple acting drench because it will have three active ingredients listed underneath the brand name on the label. Correct. And we want to get actives that are hopefully different to the last drench that was used. Yes there's no point using the same old same old that that's been given to the sheep for any number of years so let's just make sure that we've got the right type of drench and we if we're small numbers we've only got a dozen we don't need to be going and buying 20 litres just get a small pack that will suit you for a couple of drenches and then rotate and maybe if you've got a good neighbour that you're working with and got a good relationship with you can swap drenches so that it makes it easier for you. And the other thing is when we get the sheep home and we drench them we're going to make a note of the expiry date the batch number and the product that we used and the date. Correct. All of that and you're going to lock it away in a safe cabinet so that it's safe. And you should keep all of your medications out of sun and out of the heat and you should try and keep them in a cool place. Correct. Now Gavin we're already making good use of the yards that we built before we even thought about buying sheep and we've got them all yarded up your suggestion is to keep them quarantined if you have existing livestock for a while. Yes now it's going to depend on the size of your property if you only got a small property it may mean that you're going to keep them in those yards for 10 days two weeks quarantine because of small property you might use up too much of that property in quarantine and then you're going to need that pasture in a rotation later on. So the idea about quarantine is not just quarantining them from animals that exist already on your property and preventing the crossover of worm burden and lice and various other parasites but it's also to stop the sheep from emptying out from weed seeds and things that the environment that they've come from and spreading those into your paddocks straight away isn't it? Correct yes it's ideal if they've been on a property that maybe had Patterson's curse there may be some seed in the gut and it will empty out on your property and you don't want a purple farm. Absolutely not so quarantine is not just about the livestock that you already have on the place it's also about protecting your paddocks and all of the work that you've put into the place preparing for your livestock. Exactly. So Gavin it's critical even though you've only got two or three sheep at home potentially that you understand your role in the broader scheme of things for stopping resistance to drenches in worm populations and there's a really good resource that you can go to to find out more isn't there? Exactly there is a resource called WormBoss if you go to that there's a lot of information there which will help you understand the internal parasite problems. And the link to WormBoss is in the description if you own sheep or goats or cattle you owe it to yourself and everyone else to have a look at WormBoss. If you don't have a basic set of yards like this you can just cordon off a corner of the paddock? Yes you could do that a small corner of the paddock so that you're able to quarantine without putting up elaborate fencing just to quarantine. What are some of the considerations that you'd make for animal welfare if you're cordoning off a corner of your paddock mate? Well the essentials water, shade, shelter and you're going to need to provide some feed so it might need to be supplementary feed. Now if we're buying feed and there's some cheap hay down the road what are some alarm bells that would come from that? As we've said in other videos cheap and nasty if the hay is cheap it's cheap for a reason it may may look good but if there's seeds in there weed seeds in there that you don't want and even some you know like barley grass or silver grass and things like that that you haven't got on your property then my suggestion is you pay an extra dollar or two and buy good hay either lucerne hay alfalfa if you're in America or sub clover hay. It will be a lot better in the long run. Now some retailers that sell to hobby farm market aren't necessarily going to give you a vendor declaration. How do you tell good hay from bad hay? Really good question without opening it up you it's hard to tell the hay from the outside but if you've got a chance to open up the bale and just have a look and good cleans at least second cut lucerne should be good quality and for sheep if it's real stalky they may not want to eat the stalks but if it's nice fine stem lucerne hay you won't get better the sheep will clean it up. Smells sweet, no mould and very little dust it's good. Now Gavin grain a lot of people with new sheep are going to want to give their sheep a little bit of a treat because it makes them feel good particularly hobby farmers they like to feed out a little bit of grain out of their hand in the morning. Be careful with that? Yes a little is okay a lot is not really good because some grains particularly wheat and barley may give the sheep acidosis or really bad indigestion and they may not recover from it. So you can basically find dead sheep in the morning? Yeah a little is better a lot is no go no go. And if you're going to change the diet of the sheep at all throughout the season say you run out of pasture in the paddock and you're trying to get them cross onto loosen and things like that you should do it over a period of weeks? Yes enable the sheep's gut to adjust to the new feed so if you know you're going to run out of feed pre-plan and make the transition gradual so that the the gut adjusts at the same time. Because what a lot of people don't understand is that the rumen of an animal is a really complex microflora all of its own we've got bacteria and protozoa and fungi in there millions of different species and they all adjust depending on the feed that the animals getting don't they? Yes and to increase the amount of grain will raise the acidity and we don't want an acid. And acid damage to the rumen is permanent isn't it? It can lead to something what they call laminitis where the feet actually come away from the hoof and they're very very lame for quite some time so by being very careful how you introduce any grains you can avoid those problems. Now Gavin the next thing that we're going to talk about is protecting what's already there now that you've got your sheep home you need to move them quite regularly over the grass and rotate them which is the second of our R's that we're talking about today. Correct we need to rotate for two reasons one is to look after your pasture and to minimise the worm burden build up in your pasture. If you graze your pasture down too short then it's going to take a while to recover as well as the sheep are going to pick up more worm eggs. I suppose the way I always think about it is that's a solar panel and if I want to feed the root system I need the solar panel to be generating energy so if I take more than that off the solar panel then I've got no resource for energy to regrow the plant have I? Exactly and a rule of thumb is if you've taken that much off the top there will be a corresponding volume of roots die off underneath. Now if you take that back too short then your roots are short and it doesn't have the power to regenerate. So as long as we don't take too much grass off the top a little bit of root die back on the bottom is good because it's actually putting carbon back into the soil and we've got plenty of leaf surface area to regenerate those roots quickly and rapidly and take advantage of that fertilizer that's been left there by the past roots. Absolutely correct. Now the grass length is also important with the worm cycle isn't it because it can take three days for eggs that are in the animal's faeces to hatch and turn into larvae and then the larvae climb up the grass leaves to reinfect the animal when they eat the grass and it depends how high the grass is as to how much larvae get to the animals doesn't it? Yes if your grass is eaten down really short then the worm eggs are right there and the hungry sheep are going to chew the grass and ingest the worm eggs as well. So by keeping our grass long we're keeping the mouths of the sheep away from an infection source and we're also keeping the solar panels in play so that we can regenerate roots and shoots rapidly and keep our pasture greener for longer. Yes that's all the many advantages of rotational grazing. Now on my small property here I've got seven paddocks what do you think would be the minimum number of paddocks that people should try and aim for? If you've got a very small holding then probably three but again you're going to have to assess what you can afford but certainly if you've got fixed grazing sheep are on the same spot all the time it's nowhere near as good as if you've got two three four five and more paddocks. The more paddocks you've got the longer your spell period in between rotating around. And people can use something as simple as a temporary electric fence to increase the number of effective paddocks in their one large paddock can't they? They can just move the electric fence every week. That's a very cost effective means of dividing up your property into smaller paddocks and and maybe in the cartwheel system where you've got one water point that you can utilize without having to move it. So that would be an option that I would recommend if you're in a small have a small holding and don't want to put up permanent fences use the electric fence because once sheep have been trained to it they will abide by it. So rotate rotate rotate keep your sheep healthy and more importantly keep your grass healthy because that's where all your sheep come from. Exactly. Now there's a great example of the benefits of ground cover that we've been talking about here as well Gavin. We've got some lovely plantain here and then we've got some bare soil right next to it and if I take a photo of that you know how I love gadgets and the plantain just here is sitting at about 34 degrees and the surface of the bare soil just there is sitting at just over 70 degrees celsius and that's within half a meter or less. That is amazing and it's certainly an example to show you why we need to keep ground cover and by utilising rotational grazing effectively we can keep our soil cooler and therefore less evaporation and here where it's cooler we're getting a lot more growth a really great example of why we need to rotational growth. And we can take that up another notch if we go back over to where we were where the trees are that grass is barely above 20 degrees and from my reading my understanding of grass is that it photosynthesises optimally somewhere between 20 and 25 degrees celsius. So trees are good for the paddock aren't they? Trees are wonderful. I've read information that says you can put up to 30 percent of your property in tree hedgerows etc and still maintain the same productivity off that remaining 70 percent. Because you're getting extra growth out of it because of the influence of the trees. Yes you've got less wind lots of things but in planting the right trees so that they don't have great big roots going right out into your paddocks that's another thing perhaps for another video another day. Let's do it. So Gavin there's a few things apart from just rotating your pastures that are important to know about them as well and that is that there are some weed species that can be quite toxic to your stock? Yes and that's going to vary from district to district and if you're not sure ask a friend ask the department which are the weeds that may be toxic. So the weeds that I'm familiar with mainly is heliotrope, ragwort I understand can be dangerous as well but certainly with heliotrope and Paterson's Kirsch you'll get the yellows and once they get a belly full of that you're in trouble. Now explain to me yellows because these are symptoms that are common to a lot of plant poisonings and there's something to watch out for aren't they? Yes it's where the toxicity builds up in the liver I understand and if you pull the eyelid down or open the mouth and look at the gums they'll either be white but certainly with the eyelid and the yellows is where I've seen it in the past. So they look jaundiced underneath the eyelid or in the mouth you know that you could well have a plant toxicity problem and it's best to get onto the vet quickly with that one isn't it? Yes I would suggest so. Now that may have happened at the property that you bought them from and you've got no weeds on your property so that's a difficult one. Now improving our pastures we all want to do it. I'm doing mine by having as many species as possible but some people will want to go to their local seed merchant and get some rye grass and things there can be some problems with that for certain species? Yes I think again it's going to depend on your rainfall your soil etc and if you need advice on that your agronomist or your feed supplier or your seed supplier they may be able to direct you to the right species because yes some of the rye grass do build up some toxicity rye grass staggers in sheep's not pleasant to have so yeah look at that. And that's caused by a disease called ergot isn't it and you can actually get varieties of grass that are more resistant to ergot than others can't you? I believe so yes. Now the last one I find quite fascinating and that is that you regaled me with a story earlier about pine needles can you tell me a little bit about pine needles and their effect on pregnant sheep and cattle? That's a really interesting one in that I read I haven't experienced the problem but they tell me pine needles are high in manganese and it can impact particularly with cattle if cattle are in the late stages late trimester of pregnancy it can cause abortion in them and I imagine that would do the same in sheep pine this is green pine needles I believe not a very palatable uh they'd be running out of food to go for them wouldn't they? Exactly and again if we're rotating and they're not the feed's not short they're not going looking for those things that may become toxic to them. All right now our sheep are home we know that their paddocks are safe for them we've given them a drench we're isolating them we've got them in quarantine we want to do an inspection can we go and have a look at the sheep and just take us through how to inspect your sheep? Just a basic yes. Perfect let's go. No worries we'll catch one and have a quick look. Okay we just need to be gentle we don't rush in there and frighten the sheep so just position yourself so you're going to be able to control the sheep so let's try. So you do the head on approach there Gavin one hand either side of the eyes? Yeah just mesmerise them and do it gently so what we're looking for any sign? No beautiful clear eye so no yellows there it will be quite yellow and if they have a worm bird which we wouldn't expect because we've drenched them again their gums will be really white and here we've got lovely pink gums healthy she might need to use some of that fancy toothpaste but that indicates she's been eating green grass. So all good there so we're going to just check they haven't been rubbing so we're not going to expect to find any lice so we need to look on the skin on the shoulder and that's where you will find lice. Now if there's only a couple of lice there you might be lucky to find them but if after a while they're rubbing and it's ropey there you've you've probably got lice or maybe grass seeds so quick health check and then we just need to see them walking to make sure that they're not lame and we can't tell if they're lame there now so we'll let them out have a little walk. Okay now I'd like to point out that I have this cane here as a guide not to whack the steep sheep you just must not do that if you've got a yell or whack then reassess your sheep management this helps me guide the sheep in the right direction so we just watch those sheep that they're putting all four feet down and not carrying one like my dad used to say doing arithmetic putting down three and carrying one this surface is absolutely fantastic we can get a clear view of the sheep they're not slipping sliding and we can see that they're putting all four feet down so we know that they don't have a foot problem of any nature really important so come on girls and boys come on over there so we give them a clean bill of health ready to release into our paddocks and start the rotational process we've spent all of this time and money and effort worming our sheep and making sure that they're parasite free it's important to worm our dog as well isn't it? Yes if we've got a dog a guardian dog any type of dog we need to make sure that they're worm free as well so do them at the same time with a recognized product that will take care of the internal parasites within your dog. Now we've also set up our paddocks as well haven't we Gavin we've opened all of the gates in the right direction to facilitate easy movement of the livestock because we're going to put them in a far paddock. Yes always open the gate into the paddock otherwise you'll get the sheep coming behind the gate and you'll have problems maybe getting them through the gateway. So open the gate in the same direction the sheep are going to be moving. Exactly. Right let's go and move these sheep mate. Right on. Plenty of feed plenty of shade plenty of water what more could they want? Now last but not least Gavin there will be times where we want to give some feed to our animals which means we have to store it and we've got to keep our sheep and cattle feed away from what's called restricted animal material or ram. Can you tell me a little bit about that and why? Yes some of the other particularly poultry feed has some additives in it that we cannot feed to sheep and cattle. So meat byproducts and things like that. Yes so we just need to be careful that we're only feeding supplementary feed that is suitable for your sheep. And it's good for people to know with small hobby farms other people might feed their animals from time to time and become confused so the best way to avoid that is keep your chook feed in a separate building not just in a separate part of the shed. And label such. Now storage it's important that we store this right we don't want vermin getting in do we? No we ideally we need to keep it weatherproof and ideally we need to have a structure that is vermin proof. However we accept that that's not always possible. This is certainly not a vermin proof structure and we can see some results with a plastic container right here can't we? Yes certainly if you can store in a situation like this in a metal container then the rodents aren't going to get in but if you store in plastic they will find a way. And they will eat through a really solid bin lid just to get to the goodness within. Correct. If you do have a vermin problem there is always your backup plan of leaving some rat bait out or some poison for them but there are environmental consequences to that aren't there Gavin? Yes it is a plan b or a backup a means of last resort because the rat baits can impact the environment and particularly the owls etc that may feed on the dead rats from the rat bait. And if you've got a dirt floor like this that is prone to getting moist in winter it's best to keep your hay up off it even if that's just on a pallet isn't it? That's the ideal way of keeping it out of the moisture because if your hay gets wet it will go mouldy and then it's it's a real problem if you're feeding mouldy feed to your sheep. Real problems so be very careful of that. Well Gavin thanks very much for taking us through now the second part to this series and that is what to do when you first get your sheep home. We've learned a lot hopefully and we've got some great things to put into practice so that our sheep can be nice and relaxed. Exactly and that's what we want the whole experience to be as we said at the start form the relationship when they get the sheep home rotate the pastures rotate the drenches and any other thing that you need rotating. And be responsible. Be responsible and you'll enjoy the whole experience and we've got some good pointers where you can get more information don't hesitate to go to that and if you still hesitate just ask someone who can point you in the right direction. Well thanks very much Gavin it's been a wonderful experience again with you with someone that knows all about their sheep.
