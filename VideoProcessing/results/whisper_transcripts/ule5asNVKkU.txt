 and we have come to set up an agritualism farm as you can see in the background at this corner we shall be having our poultry project our drainage is going to be here if you have a small piece of land i urge you guys let us do something like this we are planning for 26 cows imagine on this small piece of land we shall all uh it will be an integrated structure meaning we shall be having cows down there is no space that you are going to improvise for hay independently that this one is is going to be for hay we shall get an integrated structure that will cater for hay and our animals this is what i've been telling you that if you have a small or a limited piece of land you have to make sure that you plan it properly be strategic be smart enough so that is why i'm telling you that if you do that proper planning and designing even you get contractors that know what to do they will give you something that is extraordinary agritualism is the way to go and i'm very happy that all our farmers some of them or many of them have really liked this model something that is going to give you money uh not focusing on that money that will be coming from animals but you will be focusing also on money that will be coming from those people that will come for a very small piece of land is where we are going to make sure that we make an educational center whereby we shall be inviting you guys to come and have different knowledge about different projects that will be taking place on this land we have done this before in ghana we have done it in nigeria a by by providing with our plans but in uganda this is our one of our first plans our farm layouts that we have implemented is my main emphasis is on those new god farmer aspiring god farmers i'm going to take you through each and every steps that you need to know about there uh there there I have been telling you that agritourism is the way to go and I'm very happy that all our farmers, some of them or many of them have really liked this model and today I'm standing I'm in the area of Kashenshero that is western Uganda and we have come to set up an agritourism farm as you can see in the background we shall be putting a poultry we shall also be having cattle, goats and everything is going to be here on a very small piece of land imagine so guys just wait as I'll be showing you what we are going to be doing on this land imagine this is the size of the land that is the boundary even the other one is a boundary then we move up as we'll be showing you a very small piece of land is where we are going to make sure that we make an educational centre whereby we shall be inviting you guys to come and have different knowledge about different projects that will be taking place on this land this is what I've been telling you that if you have a small or a limited piece of land you have to make sure that you plan it properly fine it will take some enough resources meaning that if you you need to do something that is unique you need to put in much more effort than someone who does show the things so that is why I'm telling you that if you do that proper planning and designing even you get contractors that know what to do they will give you something that is extraordinary something that is good something that is going to give you money not focusing on that money that will be coming from animals but we will be focusing also on money that will be coming from those people that will come for trainings so guys this is very nice and it is really very very important if you have a small piece of land I urge you guys let us do something like this we are planning for 26 cows imagine on this small piece of land we shall all uh it will be an integrated structure meaning we shall be having cows down then we put our hay there is no space that you are going to improvise for hay independently that this one is is going to be for hay we shall get an integrated structure that will cater for hay and our animals you understand so this is what I'm telling you that you plan you get people that will do that for you and don't hesitate to contact us because we are one of those people that know what they do when it comes to such a complicated setup because it is a complicated one if you get someone who is not creative enough I don't think that it is going to give you the right work that you would have got if you had used someone who is really knows what to do so this is the space for cattle our drainage is going to be here this is the drainage part of it then uh at this corner we shall be having our poultry project as well as um the goats you understand so it is going to be something that is unique and we hadn't done this before in western uganda we have done this before in ghana we have done it in nigeria a by providing with our plans but in uganda this is our one of our first plans our farm layouts that we have implemented and i'm very sure that after finishing this you'll be seeing the final product guys i know many people you're there you have limited land you have small pieces of land yet they are in a location that is very strategic why can't you do something like this why can't you do something like that something like that very durable that is going to give you a lot of money in the long run yeah do something that is going to last for 30 years i'm very sure you're not going to regret well
