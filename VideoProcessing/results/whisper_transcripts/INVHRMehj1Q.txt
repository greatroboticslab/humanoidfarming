 So what you need is a drill and just put four holes in the bucket, just yeah directly opposite one another. So you've got four holes all together, two short pieces of cane, feed those through the hole and cross them over in the middle. So tie them together in position in the middle. We've got the four canes to make the wigwam and then what I'm going to do is tie these together about a foot from the top. So all I need to do now is just place these around the outside of the bucket. Wrap your twine around both canes and make sure it's nice and tight and secure it with a knot. What I've done is I've tied them all to the same side of the cane so you've got an even split. Like I say it's quite a space-saving method of growing beans because you'll get a lot of beans just off the three plants or four plants.
