 We live in an off-grid home made of shipping containers and this is how much we spent on our complete solar setup. It's not an extravagant system, it's very much a practical system. All of the wood, concrete, and the panel brackets cost us $442. We have 24 180 watt panels from Boujard V. Total cost of all of our panels is $3,313. One cost that we didn't have to spend was wiring. We have an electrician friend who actually gave us more than we needed for wiring. The next thing would be our battery box. The total cost for the wood, stain, insulation, and roof was $120. We have 16 lithium batteries, so the total cost of our batteries and all of their cables was $3,532. Plus we have a battery monitor which was $70. And then our inverter was $781. Our grand total to $8,258, which was less than the power company quoted us just to run wiring, not including a monthly power bill.
