 Partnering with Innovation is a group of like-minded growers who are really focused on building soil health and on-farm productivity. Building soil carbon underpins productivity and profitability for these farms and as Bayer we see an important role in linking with expertise locally and globally to help growers on that journey of building soil carbon. So this year PWI features Bowen in the dry tropics in Queensland. The focus for this year's Partnering with Innovation is really around farming systems and how to integrate cover crops and specifically multi-species cover crops and how we handle those with tillage systems is really important. Yeah so we've hosted the first visit of the PWI group here at the Agave Farm this morning. Agave is a very interesting plant, it's relatively new to Australia on this sort of scale. It's a very drought tolerant plant that can grow in marginal country with little or no water. Here we're looking at production for spirit production but ultimately has a lot of uses beyond that which we're looking to experiment with down the track. So we took the group down to the other end of the farm where we've looked at some strip tillage equipment. One of our intentions here at the farm is to get involved in cover crops and look at improving soil health and strip tillage will be an important part of the tillage practices once we get the cover crops going. I was invited into partnering with Innovation at its inception and the idea was to improve soil health and improve soil health and a group of like-minded people to grow crops more sustainably. PWI has helped us to put a system together so we know about cover cropping, we know about composting, we know about the need for more biomass on our crops and on our fields and also together with products like Serenade Prime and some of the new biological products that are coming out, we were able to put a whole system together. To end up with healthier soil. The highlight for me today was the visit to VJKE produce which is Jamie Jurgens and CalFresh and some of the things that we visited their property six years ago and to come there today and see the advancements that they've made. The fundamental bit with PWI is working on soil health so we share that philosophy in our business so we're always looking towards innovative ways to try and improve soil health and that's fundamental to PWI. The benefits that that's brought for us is a lot better soil health just generalised, better soil tilth, we've got more biology in the soil, we believe we've got better water retention, better disease resistance in our plants. So Bayer invests in stewardship programs like partnering with innovation because I think it really does need to be supporting key customers for its future business and a part of that is it aligns with the global strategy of the company to invest in a broader portfolio of products including biologicals such as Serenade Prime and our new product Serenade Soil Active which are highly complementary to the soil health management practices these growers at PWI are instilling. I really enjoy being part of the partnering with innovation group because the growers are so open it's a really honest environment where everybody is wanting to come together and really learn about the importance of soil health. It's rather unique that a big corporation like Bayer is willing to invest in something like PWI and talk to separate farmers and take a stewardship approach directly. directly into our businesses and help us with our soil health problems and yeah with the great vision towards improvement of soil health and healthy food. With PWI if Bayer didn't lead that in the industry it just wouldn't happen you know to get effectively competitors all to come together and to share what they believe to be critical innovation. I don't know that I don't know that that happens anywhere else in the world and for it to happen here that's you know you're privileged to be a part of it.morning.com tonight tim tim your tim time it
