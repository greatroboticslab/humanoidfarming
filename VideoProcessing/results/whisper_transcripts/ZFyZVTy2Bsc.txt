 More from business as Mark Arnold Awadulo will be reporting in this particular update. Agribusiness Development Center, ADC, has commenced training of the first cohort of beneficiaries for its business accelerator program in Kampala. The first cohort targeted women-led agribusiness enterprises with an aim to impart various management and administration skills which make them profitable and bankable. Officiating at the launch of the ADC Business Accelerator Program in Kampala, William Sekabembe, DFCU Bank's Executive Director, highlighted the need for this financial literacy competence program to the beneficiaries. When I borrow money, how do I optimize this money that I have borrowed? To ensure I get enough profits to plumb up and also expand my business. That is very important. But also to make you more banking. I know some of you already are customers and some of you are not customers. But by any of this cohort, you must be our customers. Over 30 women-led agribusiness enterprises have taken on the ADC Business Accelerator Program hosted at the DFCU headquarters in Kampala. Some of the participants shared their business-related challenges they hope this training will address. For example, for pharmaceuticals, they are telling us that for us to grow big as a business, we must get a certification from a national drug authority. And then to the supermarkets, they are also emphasizing that we had to go to UNBS. So we have actually logged in our application to Uganda National Bureau of Standards. And so we want to formalize and make sure that we follow the compliant guidelines and also try to go as the regulations guide us. As a factor for business sustainability, DFCU Bank says that they are also looking at having friendly interest rates on loans acquired by agribusinesses. Whereas we are looking at empowering the entrepreneurs and their agribusinesses, we want to create an enabling environment that can facilitate financing for their enterprises, but also good governance and other good practices that can actually influence the growth of those agribusinesses. The ADC and DFCU Business Accelerator Program will see the same cohort take on weekly classes for four months until their certification, which will then usher in another. Wadulo Makanold, UBC News.
