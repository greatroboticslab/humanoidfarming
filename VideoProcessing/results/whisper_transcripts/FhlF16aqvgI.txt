Science & Technology
 With this device building a fence takes only minutes. While inventions like the Mansaver are great for permanent fences, the smart fencing system is ideal for situations where you need to move the fence frequently. Just place the pole in the ground and the system quickly reels out the fence. It can even be electrified with solar power. So while it may not be as strong, animals definitely won't want to touch it.
