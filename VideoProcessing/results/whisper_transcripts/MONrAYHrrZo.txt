 This cow actually got jealous that I was hanging out with the bison over here. He literally mooed at me. I could not believe my ears. I obviously had to go back over and pet him because I didn't want him to feel bad. And then, this was the funniest thing of the day. This goat definitely did not belong in here. I don't know how he got in there. They all just kind of wander around. Me and Joanne took some pictures over here because why not? But honestly, the whole vibe of just being on a little farm like this just makes me want to live with animals. It's just so peaceful. They're all just so happy. They're all happy to see us all friendly. Completely different environment than Central Park because when I went there, I thought that every single animal on the entire place wanted to kill themselves. It was depressing as hell. But the bunnies here running around happy. Goats chilling. Just wanted to be a pet. Even the sheep, the llamas, the donkeys. All of them were just the chillest animals I've ever been around. Not to mention, the scenery was just crazy. I hate the fall because I hate the cold weather, but the trees did look great. I guess llamas and donkeys must get along because they were just kind of chilling together. not
