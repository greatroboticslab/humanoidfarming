 Morning. Long time no record. So I don't think I've recorded a video in almost two weeks. But here we are. This is January the 14th. And it's just a slow season. So that's why there's haven't been much recording. Now that we don't have the big shop like we did last year, we're doing a lot of office work. Stuff that we have to do every year. It's just not very video worthy. But this morning we're going to take this tractor over to the grain bins. We're going to hook up to an inline ripper. It's not supposed to rain today or tomorrow. It's supposed to start snowing Sunday. Today's Friday. So we might do some inline ripping this weekend. We shall see. Now we also have a farm auction. One of our local neighbors, he just retired. So we're going to go to his auction. See if we can snag something. A couple things we're looking at. Dump trailer, a fuel tank, and possibly a semi. But if you've been watching farm auctions lately, you know that everything's going ridiculously high. It's more likely that we're going to go and eat some hot dogs, drink some coffee, and BS with the neighbors. But that's on today's agenda. So that's what I need. And it's parked in front of a gravity wagon in between two header carts. I don't feel like this was very well thought out. Okay. Watch yourself. Okay. Got it? Yeah, raise it up. I don't know if that's complex. Yeah, I think so. Do we need a different bushing in them bottoms, remember? Yeah, we do, don't we? Is that it? You came unhooked one time over there. Yeah, it's up there. Do we have it in the tractor or what? It might be in that toolbox on the steps. Yes. So what we're talking about there about bushings, the three-point links, the hitch on this tractor is very large. It's a high category hitch. You need a bushing basically on the ripper because it is meant for a smaller category hitch. Basically, it'll be able to come unhooked without those bushings. Been there, done that, in the field, fun times. And the bushings might be in the other tractor. So the other 1038, it is here hooked to the air seeder. We're going to see if those bushings are in that toolbox. Trying to figure out, trying to remember which tractor was hooked to it last. I think it might have been that one. So, go check that out. Get me some new Ariats. Square toes. If anybody else is an avid Ariat boot collector, or just goes through a lot of boots, check out the link in the description. You can get a discount from Ariat.

So there's dad's treasure. Big auction purchase. But hey, it's 2,000 bucks, so probably not a bad buy. Worked good for dragging through tree lines. But it's about time for some chili. It's cold. Cold and soupy. Cold and soupy. I think you made it. Jesus, look at the road. Good God. Pull up here so I can pull up. Slide that bullshit over. Pull up? Well, it's good. Okay. Okay, we got the ripper hooked up. We're going to take it over to the other farm. That's where I'm going to try to rip tomorrow while it's a little froze. So I'll take it over and we'll be ready to roll. Tractor's got fuel, got government juice. I think we're going to be good to go. So a lot of people have asked about our broadcasted wheat. Looks good. Looks good. We got a nice thick stand. Maybe too thick. But all in all, it looks pretty good. Let's go. So we did have this truck parked here trying to block some of this fertilizer from the wind and rain. But really the only thing it was doing was all that water was laying on the tarp and then running into the building. So we're just going to take this and put it in the barn. And yeah, I think the fertilizer will be okay. It's going to get a little damp, but it won't be too bad. It'll be the first piece of equipment parked in this barn. It'll be the telehandler, I guess. So we still don't have it for. This is the only thing we're waiting on. Now it's just too cold, I'm afraid. So what I understand about concrete, you want it to kind of stay above freezing at night and it's supposed to be like, I don't know, 15 tonight or something. So we've reached the point in the day where now we go to the office, talk on the phone with some people and conference calls, do some paperwork, and then call it quits for the day. But we'll pick up tomorrow. We've got some riffing to do, hopefully. We'll be right back.
