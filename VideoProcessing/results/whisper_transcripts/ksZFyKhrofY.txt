Howto & Style
 If you want to grow honest-to-goodness bulbing onions that look like this, then here's the number one thing you need to remember when you're transplanting your onion seedlings. Let me show you. Of course, you dig a hole about two to three inches deep. Lots of good roots. You want to cover the roots just barely with soil. Okay? That's the most important thing because the onion that we eat is really just a stem. It needs the daylight hitting the bulb itself. So that's the one thing to remember. Don't bury it too deep. Alrighty. Keep your hands in the dirt and your eyes on the stars. Have a great day. Cheers.
