 Winchester, England, April 24, 2022. A mysterious formation emerges in a field of mustard plants. The perfectly symmetrical design is a phenomenon known as a crop circle. And it is just one of many strange patterns that appear in the English countryside every year. Crop circles are basically features, designs, illustrations of high complexity in crops. They tend to be complicated designs of unknown origin. In terms of the patterns themselves, they've been undergoing this amazing sort of ramp up in sophistication. You can find these huge, what they call, pictographs that span hundreds of feet across a whole field and feature multiple components. And they're arranged with mathematical precision. Crop circles appear in more than 50 countries. And there literally have been thousands of them, maybe over 10,000 crop circles that we're aware of in the modern era. Today, thousands of people visit these formations, including researchers who take measurements of the patterns, collect stalks and soil samples, and record aerial images for further study. Documentation of these mysterious impressions may also include eyewitness accounts of strange lights and objects seen around the same time a crop circle appears. Such accounts have been widely reported since the mid-1960s. The first modern example of the discovery of a crop circle actually being made was by George Pedley in 1966 in Australia. What George Pedley saw was an object rising out of a lagoon. And then the object, he couldn't tell how they did it. The object actually made a pattern in the foliage in the lagoon, a geometric pattern from that object. He finds a circular area where the grass in the swamp or the reeds are matted down. This is reported in the Australian press. And they start labeling these UFO nests or flying saucer nests. While crop circles have been documented for more than 60 years, there is evidence that these mysterious formations have been appearing in farmers' fields for centuries. Hertfordshire, England, 1678. A woodcut pamphlet called The Mowing Devil is published that portrays a devilish figure creating a circle in a field of oats. It refers to a supposedly true story of a farmer that saw these mysterious lights in a field. And the next morning when he went out there, he found these circular depressions in his land, you know, actually within the crop. The stalks weren't broken, but they were folded over. And people even started to blame the devil, what was called the mowing devil. While the mowing devil Woodcut attributed the mysterious crop formation to an evil entity, 200 years later, English scientist John Capron applied his scientific analysis to what he witnessed in 1880 when he proposed that a cyclonic wind of unknown origin created perfectly circular patches of flattened crops. Capron might be the first person to connect crop circles to what we today call UAPs or UFOs, because he's describing some kind of a whirlwind that is coming out of the sky and is having this effect on the ground. It's creating what we call a crop circle. Ancient astronaut theorists suggest that these incidents, along with modern crop circle accounts, provide evidence that these strange formations may be connected to visitations by other worldly beings. The eyewitnesses who have reported seeing crop circles manifest have described some extraordinary phenomena. They describe tubes of light, swirling beams of light. Very famously, back in the 1990s, there was balls of light flying across a field that were actually seen to lay the crops flat. And within a space of only a couple of minutes, they were filmed actually producing one of those designs. Many researchers suggest there are now enough reports of unusual activity around crop circles to disprove a highly publicized claim made over 30 years ago that all such formations are man-made.
