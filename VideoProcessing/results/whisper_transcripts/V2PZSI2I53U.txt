 Okay my friends, today I'm going to show you how to plant into your cover crop directly. First step is to plant a winter rye cover crop and now is the time to terminate it because you can see the individual seed heads and when you squeeze it with your thumb a little bit of milky substance comes out. So I'm going to use the hedge trimmers to cut it as low to the ground as possible. Being sure not to waste this beautiful biomass, I'm going to use it to make some hot compost. In three weeks we will have compost from this. Next step is to take a string trimmer and cut it as close to the ground as possible. Being sure to leave the chives and the crimson clover for the bees. Next we're going to take the Iversky sweet roasting pepper and we're going to take a plug out of the soil. We never till, we never do anything like that. We're just going to remove a plug so that we can then leave the soil undisturbed and put our plant into there. We're going to terminate and replant in this same day. My friends, yes it is possible.
