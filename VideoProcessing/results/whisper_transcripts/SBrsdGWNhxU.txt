Howto & Style
 Here is the result of our six different seed starting recipes and I've also tested our soil block recipes so we're going to go over the difference between this recipe, this recipe and all six of these seed starting recipes. Have you ever been at the store getting all of your seeds and your seed starting materials and wondered which of these seed starting soils is the best one to use? Well here's the surprise it really matters which one you use it can make or break your gardening season. So I've tested six seed starting soils including four that you're going to find most commonly at big box stores and we're going to find out which one is best and which one was the worst. Let's go. We're going to start with the one that is the most ubiquitous which is the Jiffy seed starting mix and the Jiffy seed starting mix is usually very available big box stores garden centers it's mostly peat moss with a little bit of vermiculite and maybe some other things mixed in there. The next one that I'm going to be testing is another one that's widely available which is miracle grow seed starting potting mix. Yeah it's probably got like miracle grow in it which is not something that I like to use. I also grabbed black gold seedling mix this might be one that's very available for you too depending on where you are. Now remember this one is listed with the OMRI certification on it so that's always a good thing but contains peat. I'm going to be testing these side by side with two of my recipes. One is going to be the coconut coir based recipe using coconut coir coco loco and green sand and then the other one I'm going to be testing is our newer recipe that uses wool pellets so the newer wool pellet recipe and then the last one I'm going to be testing is a mix of perlite vermiculite and peat because you guys asked me to do that one. Now you know that normally I do not use anything with peat so it really it hurt my soul to buy a bag of peat but I'm doing it in the name of science. All right let's get to it. I'm going to show you how to fill these seed trays but I think all you care about are the results so just skip ahead a couple of minutes if you want to get to that point. These are the seeds that I'm going to be using to test. I'm going to do tomatoes in each one, three tomatoes in each one and three radish in each one. Radish germinate and grow really quickly and so do tomatoes and tomatoes are something that we grow a lot of and probably you do too. So these are two that I wanted to test. We're going to test all six of these using these two different seeds. These are from Botanical Interest, great company, check them out. Let's do a quick visual examination of our first one which is the Miracle Grow. Right out of the gate that there's peat because I actually really hate using peat because it's so hard to hydrate. It's so hard to get wet it just floats away in your tray. So um I'm actually going to take my Miracle Grow seedling tray. I'm going to fill this up and then I'm going to wet it before I put my seeds in because if you try to wet peat like once it's in these containers it doesn't work very well. What? There's a stick in here. This is a full stick. Black gold. This is Sun Grow, black gold, natural and organic seedling mix contains excellent germination. It says you'll love the results. Silicone enriched. Why do I want silicone and my seed starting soil improves resistance to wilting? Holds water I would guess but okay. All right visual exam on this one. Also very peaty. Uh definitely peat in this mix as well but uh less sticks also. There's not like big sticks like there was in the Miracle Grow. Next up we've got the Jiffy. Shout out to Adrienne. Thank you for lending me some of your Jiffy. Uh doesn't look like uh it looks like more there's vermiculite in here. Obviously very peat heavy as well. Jiffy. Jiffy man. Jiffy is what I started the farm on. Like I started a lot of stuff in their little rehydratable pods the first year. Although I do still find them still. They say those peat pods that you can get from Jiffy are biodegradable. Let me tell you they are not. Five years later I'm still finding them in my field. So don't believe the hype on that one. Okay okay next up I'm going to make the one that I was requested to make which is a mix of equal parts vermiculite, perlite, and peat. This is one that apparently has been floating around. I don't know if it was viral or if it was just popular in a popular reel but this is one many of you requested I try. So all right Pete. And this is equal parts by volume not by weight. This is not my recipe remember so don't come at me with questions. I don't know. To me my hypothesis is and I don't want to have confirmation bias which is why I'm testing these. My hypothesis is that this one does not have much going on in terms of nutrients. There's really nothing in this recipe to give it nutrient value so I feel like you're gonna have to be fertilizing this a lot. That's just my theory. All right so I've got my peat and my vermiculite. Last up is the perlite. Let's give it a mix. You all mixy-poo. It does hydrate better than the peat by itself. The vermiculite is good for that. Peat, vermiculite, perlite. If you're wondering why I make these faces when I have to work with peat and why I don't like peat it's because peat is the harvest of peat itself is really unsustainable. Peat is our biggest carbon sink. Actually peat sequesters more carbon in peat bogs. I believe it's something like five percent of the world's carbon is stored in peat bogs so when we harvest that it releases a lot of that carbon into the atmosphere. Okay the last two now I will say I'm doing all of these in trays because I don't know how they would do in soil blocks. Never tried it. If one of these recipes seems to work really well for soil blocks then maybe I'll try it. Actually you know what that's a lie. I won't because I don't want to start using peat anyway. So hopefully mine will be better. Now these next two recipes remember are my recipes that I've created. These work for trays and soil blocks. This recipe, these recipes. All right so this recipe here is four parts peat free coco loco potting soil plus one part wool pellets. If you want to watch more about this recipe go over to our wool pellet recipe but this is what the wool pellets look like. This has already been mixed together so I'm not going to remix this but this is coco loco potting soil and wool pellets. Four parts coco loco one part wool pellets. This last recipe is coco loco. So I've got some coco loco here. I need my green sand so it's green sand coco loco. My coconut coir. The downside of it is it can be salty depending on your source. It comes in a block like this that you rehydrate and then it gets kind of nice and fluffy like this. Very similar to peat. Coconut coir goes in. My coco loco potting soil gets mixed in with that. Okay so I've got that and then I put a little green sand in. Green sand is just from um it's an oceanic mineral. It's from the ocean and it has some like minerals and probably a little bit of a low low amount of NPK in it. All right mix that together. This is the soil block recipe with the coconut coir. Again you can use this one for soil blocks as well as trays. Coco coir slash coco loco slash green sand. So here we have our flat of all six of our different tests that we are running. I'm going to go ahead and seed half of these with tomatoes and half with radish. So each recipe is going to get three tomatoes and three radishes so that in case there's like a bad seed that doesn't throw off the testing. Okay it has been about four weeks. So when we're looking at our six recipes that we tried from here over these four are all our peat containing recipes. Over here we have non-peat recipes. So we're going to analyze these peat versions first and then we'll look at the peat free. Okay so if we are looking at our seed starting mixes I'm going to start with this one over here and this one over here actually surprised me the most because I have the lowest expectations of it. So this one is our Miracle-Gro. So the Miracle-Gro seed starting mix I actually have low expectations for. So this just goes to show you that you know it's not always what we think is going to be the best mix. Now Miracle-Gro does tend to have a reputation of having lots of salty fertilizers in it and so personally for me as a preference I prefer not to use Miracle-Gro as a soil in my garden because once my plants are out in my beds I want them to utilize the soil biology and let that be what is creating the nutrient mineralization versus relying on fertilizers and then the soil becoming dependent on that. So I don't like to use Miracle-Gro in my garden. Synthetic fertilizers have also been shown to really be detrimental to soil health and to soil life. So when it comes to putting things like Miracle-Gro into my garden or other synthetic fertilizers I stay away from it because I'm really trying to optimize my soil health and my microbes. So the Miracle-Gro however in a seed starting situation is not always going to be a horrible thing because these don't really have a lot of small microbes to pull from. When we're talking about out in the garden there's lots of microbes, mycorrhiza, fungi, bacteria that are present in the soil that are going to help these guys to grow. But when they're in a seed starting tray that's not so true. So that's why we tend to fertilize seedlings a little bit more often. So the Miracle-Gro mix actually for a peat containing mix is the winner. The next winner that I found was actually Jiffy. So here we have our Jiffy seed starting mix. This one is very common and easy to find in those big box stores and you can see that the plants grown with the Jiffy are quite healthy. They were fairly consistent. Now we are starting to see a little bit of yellowing of leaves so that's something that we're going to want to start to keep an eye on which we're really not seeing with the healthier Miracle-Gro or these ones over here that are we'll talk about these in a minute. But we are starting to see a little bit of yellowing of leaves so that could be indicating some nitrogen deficiency. Now I have not fertilized any of these seed starting soils so because I didn't want that to skew the results. I wanted to see okay if we're looking at unfertilized seedlings what are these results going to look like? So that could be why we're starting to see some of this yellowing of leaves is because the Jiffy mix is mostly peat and vermiculite and not much else. So there's not a lot of nutrients in this mix. So when we're looking at this one that's why we're starting to see some yellowing of leaves but overall I think this one would actually probably do okay if you gave it some supplemental fertilizer like our stinging nettle fertilizer or fish emulsion on a weekly basis. The third performer here of our peat containing soils was actually this was our mix. This was the mix of peat vermiculite and perlite. This is one that I've been seeing floating around the internet. Now you can see the tomatoes are doing fine. I mean the radish actually this one over here did not germinate um but I think that's probably a seed issue not a soil mixture because obviously these ones will germinate it just fine. You can see the difference uh these seedlings are fairly consistent but definitely not as big as their neighbors because there's really not anything in this mix is going to give these seedlings any kind of nutrients. So again we're talking about vermiculite, perlite, and peat. That's it. There's not much nutrients in any of those three ingredients. So this one really not performing super well but they're also not dying um I mean I guess it's okay. And the worst performer of our four peat based seed starting soils is clearly this one over here and this is our black gold organic seed starting soil. This is disappointing. I really had high hopes for the black gold. Um I was hoping that it would perform well. I'm suspecting that there's maybe some kind of unfully broken down organic matter in this mix or something else is causing some nitrogen robbing because you can see we have quite a bit of yellowing leaves especially on these radishes and while the tomatoes germinated that's pretty much all they've done. They really haven't grown at all beyond that germination stage. In fact they've just put on their first set of true leaves so definitely coming along slowly. All right let's move over to our peat free mixes. Now both of these peat free seed starting mixes remember are ones that I've done from my own recipe. So we're going to look at them in soil blocks as well as in the trays and I'm going to talk about what I think happened with my wool pellet recipe because it didn't perform as well as I would hoped and when we look at our soil blocks interestingly the wool pellet version performed better. So let's take a look. So if we zoom out and compare this recipe to the rest you can see it is performing quite well and consistently quite well. It's not just one or two seedlings that are doing well it's all of them here. So this is our coconut coir recipe and this is one of our first soil block recipes that we published and I've used this one for years it works quite well and until I started looking for alternatives to coconut coir because there are some concerns with labor usage and just miles that coconut coir is being transported we started looking for alternatives and that's why we kind of pivoted away from this one but as you can see from our tray it is performing quite well. I love the smell when you rub tomatoes you know that smell. So here we have our three tomatoes all of them germinated quite well they are growing and putting on leaves very healthfully in fact I think these ones look better than our miracle crow version. So this one with the coco loco the coconut coir and the green sand which is a mineral. So our radish also looking quite healthy here and these six to me look quite healthy I'll just show again that this is the coconut coir coco loco and green sand recipe that I've come up with and we also use that one remember in soil blocks. Now let's look at the this is our wool pellet based recipe now some interesting things going on here and I think what happened now we had fine germination uh and then but they did germinate slower and later than the other recipes and what could have happened is a couple things number one I had them on this heat mat which is kind of old I think it's heating a little bit unevenly because we're having the same problem with this soil block tray it's not germinating in a couple of spots and I think it's not heating as well but the other issue I think is that I need practice with growing in trays anymore because I mostly grow in soil blocks now I have kind of forgotten how to grow in a tray and the good and bad of the wool pellets is that they do hold on to moisture they are very good at moisture retention so this is a great thing in a soil block moisture retention is a really really good thing you can see our three recipes we're going to talk about those next but moisture retention when you're in a tray can be a bad thing so if this is too wet these are going to not perform as well and I think that's what happens that the wool is so very good at retaining moisture that these stayed a little bit too wet now we are I'm dialing back on watering them so we're going to tune back in in about four weeks and see how these are all doing at the four week mark but my theory is that these are going to be doing better once I stop watering them as much but between these two peat free recipes obviously if you're growing in a tray the coconut coir based recipe with the coco logo the green sand and the coconut coir is doing much better and I'll link that video in the description below okay so those were our results for our tray grown seedlings but I want to look at our soil blocks as well because if you're a soil blocker or you're dabbling in soil blocking I think it's important to show the difference so if you tuned into my last video where we were talking about the wool pellet soil blocking recipe you may have seen that I showed that that seedling and it was still fairly young at that point although we had tested this recipe already but one of the seedlings that was grown at the wool pellets was looking much healthier even though it was planted later it was looking healthier than the one started with leaves and it was even starting to catch up with the one that was started with coconut coir so I wanted to take a look at them today so here we have our three recipes this was the one that was started with the leaf the dried leaves you can see quite sad still it hasn't really caught up I mean clearly to the other one still quite different we have some yellowing of leaves it's starting to grow but it's still stunted compared to the other ones so as a reminder these two are actually started at the same time this is that coconut coir recipe that we said looks really good in the trays this is that coconut coir recipe in block form same exact recipe we just made it into soil blocks right using our handy dandy soil blocker if you want to learn how to use this we have roughly a million videos on it on our channel just hit the back button and find one and then this one was started 10 days after this one using our wool pellet recipe so this one uses coco loco and wool pellets and that's it so very interesting to me to see the difference in these seedlings and i'll show you the top down view because i don't want you to think that i'm just showing you like the front two seedlings and saying look how much better they look all consistently across the board the wool pellet ones considering they were started almost two weeks later look better than the coconut coir although they both look good they're both good recipes to use let's look at them from the top okay so here's our top down view same size soil blocks so these are the one and a half inch blocks and you can see we have some air pruning roots here starting to come out the sides these are ready to get planted one and a half inch blocks with the wool pellets and then if you compare them with our coconut coir base recipe now we just starting to see maybe some roots but also interestingly was that the wool pellet recipe seemed slightly less prone to algae and i think that was because we talked about the difference in the water needs when we're talking about trays and the wool pellets how the wool pellets retain moisture we don't have to water the wool pellet soil blocks as often because it retained the water so these ones actually had slightly less algae overall over the coconut coir recipes so i thought that was interesting but you can see we're starting to see a little bit of yellowing of leaves now again we haven't fertilized these ones either in the nature of keeping this test um somewhat scientific but starting to see a little bit of yellowing that could also just indicate that they're ready to get planted out but how much healthier started 10 days later these wool pellet soil blocks were okay so what does this mean well it means it's hard to judge you know i think sometimes we get a little bit um and this is myself too i get a little bit judgy maybe and uppity about thinking that you know a certain brand is not good or a certain brand is good just based on a label and the results are in the results um i tried to use those four that you know are the most commonly available to me in big box stores or garden centers when i tested these four recipes because i wanted this to be very helpful for you all um but again not always you know i would have thought that the miracle girl one was not going to do very well and i was wrong so who knows um i would have thought that the black gold was going to do very well and not very well at all so uh when it comes to i'm going to come back so you have to subscribe sorry please subscribe and like you know all the stuff but in order to come back and see because in four weeks i'm going to do an update and i'm going to do an update to show how these guys are all doing four weeks down the road again no fertilizer and we're going to see what's happening with each of them because i think that's really important just to see how the seed does on its own basis if we don't if we have a mix that we don't have to fertilize that's obviously the winner to me and uh yeah i guess that's it guys all right i hope you enjoyed this video if you did please please like and subscribe it really helps us a lot here at the farm and let me know what do you want to see next see you next time in the garden or the greenhouse
