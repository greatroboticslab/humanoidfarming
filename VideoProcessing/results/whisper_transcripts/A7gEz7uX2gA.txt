 Music Our farm is about 50 acres and on that we have about 20 acres of vegetable ground and in any given year we're growing actually about 12 acres of vegetables. We have a CSA and a farmers market and so we grow a wide diversity, wide variety of vegetables to serve our customers. One of our biggest challenge has been weed control and actually mechanizing weed control and so we made a decision to really start investing in mechanized weed control equipment. So we bought an Alice Chalmers G and along with that bought a Tilmore basket weeder which has been a real game changer for us. We also got a tine weeder, a three point hitch tine weeder which has also been a really great tool. Music I think Tilmore is going to change the small grower space simply by trying to focus on the small grower. And I think they're really sort of moving into this space that there really aren't that many other implements that can be belly mounted on a cultivating tractor or implements now that can go behind a planted junior or another walk behind tractor. And for me, I know a lot of other farmers are really interested in sort of building their own equipment and tinkering and that's not me. I am not interested in taking the time to put together a cultivating implement. So Tilmore is basically allowing me to farm, to be in the fields and not have to be an inventor.
