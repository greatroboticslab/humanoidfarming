Howto & Style
 What's up everybody it's Justin at S&K Greenhouse and today I wanted to give you guys a little bit of a garden center tour maybe some things to look out for at your local garden center or if you're local sure come on in but let's go ahead and start right off the bat with something that is very classic in the south a hanging Boston fern nothing says the south like a hanging Boston fern these are great for shade or part sun hanging off your porch you're like mm-hmm nothing looks like that green so come on over here if you're saying I have a little too much Sun for that you should highly look at the Kimberly Queen Fern Kimberly Queen Ferns grow more upright they take part or full Sun and they do not shed which is awesome and let me show you the asparagus fern this is a really great fern for Sun or shade actually it trails down it's got a lot of just a very unique texture to it a lot of people love these these are also great hanging off your porch now if you're saying I got blazing Sun you're in the south like us that afternoon Sun's just brutal nothing's better than a Diplodinia or a Mandevilla these are a little bit more climbing Diplodinia look at that red bloom this is an annual where we live if you're in Florida it might come back for you but just look at all the different colors of Diplodinia there's white there's pink there's red look how great that would look in a container they have a short compact bush form great and full Sun drought tolerant won't punish you if you forget the water now if you love hummingbirds check out this this is called hummingbird falls it's a type of salvia and we grow these in baskets we hang them up and hummingbirds will flock to them you got these gorgeous blue blooms and like all salvias yes it's great in part Sun or full Sun now when it comes to you're at your garden center there's the big three annuals that you're going to see all the time verbena calibrachoa and petunias this is a petunia there's all different shapes and colors and sizes this is most of them mound or trail this is a very pretty petunia by proven winners called raspberry rush it's a supertunia so if you see supertunia that means it's very aggressive now a good example of the calibrachoa would be this one by proven winners this is pink lemonade prism and these are great in containers or baskets excellent and if you want a great spiller throw in some potato vine with it potato vine especially the marguerite variety is very aggressive it'll trail down now I said there was three the other one is verbena you're gonna see these at your garden center verbena has a very distinct bloom they come in reds and whites and pinks and purples this is like a variegated white and blue again you can put this in the ground but very excellent in containers or baskets now if you look over here you can see how we've put together some combinations already look at that speckled petunia mixed with this white verbena absolutely stunning great for part or full Sun one more this is trail and vinca now vinca is another staple for full Sun just like the diplodinia this can take all day hot afternoon Sun and in this basket we have it mixed with chenille which is this fuzzy little bloom in that pretty cool and then Evolvius which is this blue flower and they'd go great together making a trailing basket now if you don't want to mix your own containers a lot of times you can find planters already made up these are a great example of that some of these are for shade like if you see impatience that's an impatient has a very distinct leaf better for shade or part Sun now in the top here is a Sun patient Sun patients are great because they can take Sun or shade if you see New Guinea in patience that's strictly part Sun or shade all right this is a great example let me find it it's over here of a lantana combination with sweet potato vine Sun patient and a dark leaf begonia darker leaf begonias can typically take more Sun so this container would be excellent for full Sun now sometimes you might already own a container you might say I got my container I just want stuff to put in it and I don't want to think about it too much well a lot of times at your local garden center you can find pot fillers pot fillers have multiple plants in one kind of cheap pot where you can just pop that out stick it down in your planter and you're good to go this one is for Sun it's an angelonia scavola lantana combat combination the angelonia is more upright gets kind of tall but the scavola again great for full Sun the lantana again great for full Sun they'll kind of trail down and use pop that in your container here's another good example you got the darker leaf begonia again great in full Sun you've got the Miso Miso is a trailing plant that comes down red blooms kind of matches the begonia red blooms another great example of a pot filler now this one over here is for shade fuchsia again fuchsia great for attracting hummingbirds this is hypoestes and a New Guinea impatient this combination is really great for shade so look for those if you need a shaded annual you pop that in your container you're good to go one more pot filler I have to show you these are gorgeous this is this is like a black petunia look at that velvety black you got biddens which contrasts off each other very well and then you have the white scavola good gosh that looks so good you just pop that in your container look I mean that what that's crazy that looks great all right follow me on back no don't you go that way you come this way because I want to show you and oh no you can go back this way because I want to show you these this is celosia intense this is a fabulous annual because it loves the Sun it can take the heat it'll bloom till frost and the blooms are just so unique look look at these little fuzzy fingers isn't that crazy again celosia if you want something a little different a little bit unique now come on back over here because I got one of the best shade annuals you could possibly put maybe you have a covered porch maybe you have a back deck that never sees the Sun let me show you what you can put in it caladiums no these are not elephant ears and yes they're an annual here in Shelby North Carolina zone 7b but you pop that in a container it'll give you some height maybe you put some other annuals around it for shade like begonias impatience that kind of thing and you have a beautiful let me show you a different color come on over here look at this color look at that look at the variegation in the in the red vein running through there can you see that that's beautiful all right now let's talk about geraniums geraniums are like the fern another staple in the south you see these on people's porches you see them everywhere now let me tell you something the tag will say full Sun but here in the south zone 7b our afternoon Sun is pretty harsh and I would keep geraniums out of the afternoon Sun I don't think I would put them in all day Sun morning Sun afternoon shade is a much better situation and they're gonna come in all different types of colors look at this coral color in a basket all right this is an old bloom let me show you real quick with geraniums pinch that off you're doing look how gorgeous that is pinch the old blooms off you don't want that falling down on your foliage and rotting your plant keep those pinched off let me show you a different example whoa almost lost my mic I gotta calm down gotta calm down here is a purple geranium it just poured all over my shoe because we water our plants at SNK greenhouse look at that that's an goodness gracious that's vibrant that camera might not even be able to pick that up it's so vibrant look we just fully stocked annuals everywhere over here some Sun ones over here some shade ones let's quickly go over some shade annuals like the Rieger or hemi-less begonias they are absolutely gorgeous great for a covered porch now if you want something trailing Swedish Ivy it's gonna trail down looks great in containers coleus let me just tell you real quickly about coleus there's all different colors this one's Indian summer this one is I thought it was redhead but it's inferno orange okay coleus love part Sun shade some of the newer coleus can take all day Sun put these in a container they grow huge most of the time there's some there's some kinds that stay sore sure but they grow huge most of the time and they look really good in containers your landscape you mix them with something like New Guinea and patience or Sun patience again look at the Sun patience Sun or shade on these absolutely gorgeous but in full Sun they will drink more water just know that now here's another annual for shade that is highly overlooked that is Tarina Tarina comes in yellows whites blues they make beautiful baskets that trail down perfect for shade now let's talk about some Sun loving annuals because a lot of you guys have Sun no trees around them lantana is a great one I planted this last year beautiful there's different types of lantana if you see a spreading lantana that's more suited for a landscape if you see anything like lucky lantana or bandana lantana those are more compact and great for Sun Mexican Heather is another great Sun annual or QFIA now dahlias one of my favorite annuals for Sun this one is called fireball look at the bloom on there any kind of dahlia you see there's perennial dahlias these are annual dahlias but they're all going to be good and that part to full Sun situation now come on over here this is one of my favorite annuals I already talked about it angelonia it's an upright annual great for giving you some height or beds that you have maybe have a walkway you don't want it growing into your walkway angelonia grows straight up and it gets fuller and fuller as the season goes there's white there's pink or a raspberry as they call this one or there's a purplish blue or there's let me see if I could get cherry for you there's cherry look at angelonia that is so beautiful great again part to full Sun let's walk on over here let's walk on over here my mic almost fell out of my pocket all right let me show you a plant that not only does it not burn in full Sun it burns the Sun it's stronger than the Sun scivola and lantana if you want something that truly takes the Sun the heat this is a great combination you can put it in the landscape or a pot this is in a hanging basket I love the gold and the blue off each other look at that just hanging that is absolutely gorgeous and great for Sun all right we've talked about this at the nursery a bajillion times this is Cufia or another name is Vermillionaire Cufia is great for attracting hummingbirds proven winners came out with their own Cufia called Vermillionaire these little orange blooms will absolutely drive your hummingbirds crazy I promise put one of these out and you're going to see hummingbirds now don't let this little plant fool you it gets tall and it gets wide and it blooms all summer and it thrives in heat Cufia again great for heat now we do carry a lot of supertunias and we love supertunias around here because supertunias again proven winter brand are very aggressive so if you have a big planter or a big landscape and you're maybe far away from the road and you want people to see you for miles and miles and miles and miles and miles away plant supertunias because they're super aggressive just make sure to feed them this one's called Vista bubblegum we plant this in our planters out at the road and people about wreck trying to pull in here now let me go back over here and show you another cool perennial now again this is a perennial for zones seven eight nine this is let me show you a better one it's really showing out Ruelia Raging Cajun now Ruelia blooms like an annual but it's actually a perennial look at those blooms this one it also attracts hummingbirds great in full sun part sun and just the way it looks in a landscape amazing and it comes back around here if you're in zone six probably not coming back for you more lantana again lantanas can come in a variety of shapes sizes this is the bandana one i was talking about see that if you at your garden center and you see bandana bandana bandana or one called lucky that is a compact lantana if you see one like new gold or spreading gold you can already kind of see the difference in habit this one's going to spread this one's going to stay compact better for containers and baskets better for the landscape lantana write this down great for full sun blooms all summer great for attracting pollinators great for planting around your garden and getting that squash and zucchini pollinated where it doesn't rot off the vine now come on down this way i know what you're thinking i heard you i already know what you're thinking you're saying i got a lot of landscape beds i need something economic i can't just be buying all these four inch pots well that's okay because flats or six packs exist at garden centers now this allows you to be economical and fill up large beds for a cheaper cost this is impatience shimpations again great for shade they come in six packs like this and then you buy a whole flat and you usually get a deal like you do here all right but come on over here look at this collius excellent for shade or part sun comes 36 to a flat over here you got dark leaf white begonias here's dark leaf red begonias check that out again if you want more if you got more sun go with the darker leaf if you got more shade try try the green leaf now again i got zinnias down there i got vinca down there i got some marigolds down there all comes in flats great for filling up large beds look for those at your garden center if you want to fill up a good space now come on over here i got way more to show you i'm just getting started here hang on to your tail this is a lantana combination again that's the compact one looks really great in a container and while we're on the subject of lantana now we sell a lot of lantana in the south just because it's so great this one's called miss huff now a lot of people ask doesn't lantana come back every year well sometimes it does and there's some varieties that are hardy than other this one miss huff is the most hardy that we have found it typically comes back but you better get ready because when it comes back the next year shabam it is huge i mean it turns into a full out bush now if you have an area look at the blooms on this this is a canna lily the variety is red golden flame all canna lilies are perennial for the most part depending on your zone what i love about canna lilies not only are they hardy not only do they spread they are great for absorbing water in sumpy areas you can plant it in well-drained soil but you can also plant it where it's not well drained and it'll wick up that water and you can't say that about a lot of plants now here's two baptizias i have these are proven winners there's pink lemonade and then there's sparkling sapphire baptizia is one of the most underestimated perennials because people see it like this and they're like eh i don't know if i want to plant that or not but when they plant it and it comes back the next year it's just ba bam they get full they're full of blooms they're great for just a gorgeous display it's a very hardy hardy perennial now let's come over here let me talk about allium now what i love about allium it's a late summer to fall bloomers so if you need some things in succession your blooms are running out this will start blooming at the end of summer it's very hardy this one is called millennium let me show you that there millennium has these little purple balls on top and it just looks beautiful it's actually in the onion family don't let that scare you it's still a great great perennial now let while we're right here let's talk about roses we sell around here sorry about the sirens a lot of knockout roses there's double red look at that knockout roses are highly highly disease resistant they're also very pest resistant there's not a lot of spraying and and pruning that you need to do check out the double pink very very pretty now maybe you're saying i don't want a rose that gets five foot tall i want something that stays low well drift roses might be for you drift roses here's the pink here's the red here's an apricot color now what i love about drift roses they're a ground cover rose they only get about a foot foot and a half tall but they spread two or three feet and this is a great great ground cover that's beautiful better than just like a plain old juniper even though i love junipers but this will give you some color all right i cannot walk by these without talking about invincibel wee white years ago brewing winners came out with invincibel hydrangea it's a taller huge hydrangea it's very pretty but then they came out with an invincible wee white which is a dwarf compact form this blooms all summer has very strong stems and i think you can pretty much grow this in full sun it's pretty rare for a hydrangea let me show you some hydrangeas that i love if you want to pop a color like bloom stroke now this is endless summer endless summer came out with a lot of different hydrangeas you're going to see them all over your garden centers this one is bloom struck and what i love about it it's purple check that out now the blooms right now are pink but that's because the soil is more neutral you throw a little acidifier in there make your soil more acidic the blooms will turn to purple same with these pink ones over here look at the texture on these blooms that's absolutely gorgeous this is another endless summer uh variety this one's called pop star i'm a pop star not a doctor look at the blue blooms on that white pot that's absolutely gorgeous this one's great for containers blooms all summer yes it's pink now throw some acidifier in there it will turn to blue now i've seen you creeping up on me but i got to show you one of my favorite day lilies this is primal scream now they call it primal scream because i don't know why but it's a big huge orange bloom again proven winners we could not find this one for years it's been out for a while but nobody's growing it around here so s and k decided to grow these this is s and k grown i think we potted these up bare root back in january and now we're to another perennial that i love this is cat's pajamas nepeta now nepeta is a great ground cover sort of it does continue to spread when you have a mass planting of nepeta it's gorgeous those blue blooms show up from a mile away they're about that tall they cover a large area they're very reliable these are going to come back for you every year but i'll tell you something that won't come back every year not in here maybe if you're in florida maybe if you're california but we are in the south and this is bougainville bougainville this is a very delicate looking flower there's not much anything like like it we put these in baskets they trail down some people training them up a trellis very very hardy for sun this makes the sun cower down come on over here let me show you some succulents that are hardy people want to grow succulents outside sometimes but you know the truth is with succulents outside if you're in this zone they freeze the moisture in the petals freeze and it rots the plant not on hens and chicks hens and chicks are tough as nails let me show you a couple of them there's a red variety and a green variety they're very pretty you can see they have multiple babies they will spread over time they grow kind of slow but they are hardy they can take sun or shade and those are great for if you kill things look at raspberries in containers if you see this brand bushel and berry they've come out with a series of fruiting shrubs that are all great for containers they all stay compact they got blueberries blackberries this one is a raspberry and it's called raspberry shortcake now i don't see any on here to sample for you that are right oh wait here's a ripe one look at that al a raspberry right off the vine excellent all right my favorite hosta not really it's just a good one some and substance this is a larger growing hosta if you see hostas at your garden center this is a great perennial for shade don't put this in full sun morning sun afternoon shade or total shade either way it's going to grow up be nice now this is a scented citronella or geranium yeah people don't know that citronella is a scented geranium this is lemony citrusy smelling and it repels insects and mosquitoes in a close vicinity stick this on your porch hopefully you don't get bit no there's no guarantees on that come on over here now a lot of people want a vine that blooms all summer can take full sun and comes back every year what might that be a clematis vine and clematis vines come in all different colors this one's pink mink there's another one called sweet summer love and this is one of about one bajillion varieties of clematis clematis vines that are out there some have big blooms some have little blooms some bloom a lot of little clusters some are just big blooms everywhere and showy i love them for trellises arbors pergolas fences you name it and let me show you i was going to show you this one let me show you a better one if you want a butterfly bush one that stays compact one that blooms all summer come on over here this is pugster amethyst now pugster amethyst is one of the most dwarf compact butterfly bushes on the market it only gets about two to three foot tall blooms all summer and amethyst is a purple variety much larger blooms than some of the other ones i love this one for a landscape or a container i just thought of something we got to come over here this is one of the most exciting plants i've had in a long time come on follow me this is lady banks climbing rose yes a climbing rose let me tell you what's special about this not only will it climb up your fences your pergolas your your trellises whatever this one produces at maturity during the season up to 50 000 blooms 50 000 yellow clusters of blooms very pretty nobody talks about lady banks it's a good one now let me show you this one over here from proven winners i'm going back to hydrangeas because i forgot about this one this is little lime punch now this was relatively new but what you get with this is white and red panicle style blooms and the thing about hydrangeas the panicle styles can take your sun your macrophyllis they're more the mop head keep them out of the afternoon sun especially here in the south look at the blooms on that absolutely gorgeous all right well i got to show you this one real quick this one is incredibly rare i don't always have it this is a dwarf leland cypress called shorty now a lot of growers don't mess with this one probably because it's too slow this is probably already seven eight years old it only grows a few inches a year excellent for the landscape or container you've put this in a container it'll last in there a very long time or if you're in the landscape and you want to soften up a wall or you just need something by a walkway that doesn't get too big shorty probably like a five foot by two foot plant let's go on over here look at this thing right this is orangeiola japanese maple very pretty it's a lace leaf this one's not going to get too tall going to grow wide some others to look for at your garden center is red dragon crimson queen tomukiyama and orangeiola because orangeiola is going to turn a bright orange in the fall it leaves out this burgundy orange i think i have one of these so i know this is one of the best maples out there well folks there's your tour i hope this gives you some inspiration to go out to your local garden center and just conquer it or if you're local feel free to shop here we're in shelby north carolina and until next time become a plant person you
