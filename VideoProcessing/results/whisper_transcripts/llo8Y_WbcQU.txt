 It's the anniversary of the launching of the first commercially successful milking machine in the world. It's something we Kiwis should be really proud of, and I'm certainly proud of my grandmother and I want people to know about him. The centenary is a great time to let people know about this wonderful achievement of an ordinary Kiwi farmer.
