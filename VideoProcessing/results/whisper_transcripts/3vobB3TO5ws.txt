 Hi there and welcome to Grow Your Own with Kyle Cushman. Feeding and watering your plants is crucial to a successful grow. It's just as easy to overwater as it is to overwhelm your plant with too many nutrients. Today I'm going to talk about different growing mediums, nutrients and water. How much to feed, when to water and how to be responsive to your plant. Let's start with the growing medium. You can choose from soil natural materials like sphagnum and cocoa. They can even be certified organic or you can grow hydroponically, which literally means without soil, using materials like rock wool or pea gravel. If you choose soil, you'll decide between something inert like Pro-Mix or a super soil with preloaded nutrients. Two great super soil recipes are subcools and my own veganic mix. After deciding on your soil, you have to choose your nutrients. There are many choices. I'm obviously going to suggest using vegan matrix or at least something organic. Do some research. If you're using my VSS veganic super soil for example, you'll still need to add newts, but only at 50% of the recommended dose on the feed chart. For subcools soil, you just add water. Let me say this again in case you missed it. Follow the feeding schedule provided by the nutrient manufacturer you're using. Your plant's needs may change quickly, so always make notes. Now, let's talk about watering. I found the best way to water your plants is to cycle wet to dry. There are certain times your plants will require smaller partial waterings, but I'll discuss these in the transplanting video. Cycling involves watering to complete saturation, then allowing the pot to almost completely dry before watering again. This will encourage the most prolific root system. Again, observation is key. Gain the ability to recognize the weight of both a fully watered pot and an almost dry pot, and the process becomes easy. Cycling keeps roots constantly searching and growing. Each time the moisture recedes, the root system will improve, creating a solid root ball. Adding nutrients can affect the pH of the soil, so check your inputs and runoff regularly. Optimal pH for soil gardening is around 6.5, so make sure your inputs are between 6.2 to 6.7. For hydroponics, optimal pH is around 6.2, and for cocoa, it's closer to 5.8. The pH balance of the soil affects how well your plants absorb nutrients. If the pH is too far off, you'll quickly notice signs of deficiency like yellowing leaves. Anything more than 3 or 4 tenths outside the optimal range, and your plants will struggle. Like trying to drink liquid through a collapsed straw. If the pH level of your nutrient solution is too low, adjust by using a pH up product, adding just a little at a time until you hit your mark. If the pH is a little high, as high as 7, I suggest you don't adjust. Organic media always acidifies over time. That said, if your inputs consistently come in very high, you can adjust down to 6.5 to 6.7. Another thing to monitor is the PPM, or parts per million, of your water. This represents the level of dissolved solids in the solution. Monitoring input numbers, and comparing them to runoff numbers, is one way to know if you're over or under feeding. Different stages of the grow have different acceptable PPM levels. Checking your input levels is easy, but you also need to check the runoff. Do this by adding a little extra water for the feed, and measuring the excess that runs out of the pot. If your PPMs are too high, alternate in a few plain waterings, and note the numbers as they fall. If it's too low, simply move up a notch on the feeding chart. In conclusion, watering and the application of nutrients is of supreme importance. Try not to overdo anything. When plants are young, they require very little of anything. Too much water or newts can really stress them out. The best thing you can do for your plants is to check on them regularly, get to know them, and the timing of their wet-dry cycles, and how this changes as they grow. Keeping the pH and the PPM levels as optimum as possible. Getting these details right will give you a far better chance of success. Remember, knowledge is power. In the next video, we'll look at transplanting. When and how to do it. See you soon. We'll be right back. We'll be right back. We're going to turn our weiter to go. We'll be right back.
