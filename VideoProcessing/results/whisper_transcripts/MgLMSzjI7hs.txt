 What does agricultural subsidies mean? Agricultural subsidies, to go back to the earlier example, are the desire to protect. What does that mean? Let's think about the manufacture of ethanol in the United States. Now, why would you want to manufacture ethanol? Well, there's an argument that says gasoline is too expensive, it's in short supply, it's going to run out eventually, and therefore we need to find substitutes. Well, we know, because down in Brazil they run almost all their cars off of ethanol, that you can grow it, you can grow corn and you can turn this into ethanol. However, there's a lot of corn in the world, and turning corn into ethanol is an expensive process, relatively speaking. So the farmers who do this will lobby for protection. That is to say they will want an agricultural tariff or a subsidy to protect that industry. Now, the argument is, of course, well, hang on a second, this just makes corn more expensive. This is a tax that goes from consumers to these producers. So is this doing anyone any good? Well, depends on whose side of the story you're listening to. According to the ethanol manufacturers, they can't do this important for the future thing without the subsidy to keep them in business, because it's not economic. If you talk to the consumers, this is basically just a transfer of money from them to these producers, and they shouldn't actually have it. So this whole thing is, as I've suggested earlier, about distribution. Who pays, who gains, who loses. And tariffs and agricultural subsidies are ultimately tied up with who pays, who gains, and who loses. Who wins, and who loses. Who wins, and who loses. Who wins, and who loses. Who wins, and who loses. Who wins. P
