 Today we are test driving a harvester that costs more than your house. This machine is massive. It is a self-propelled AVR that got shipped to us straight from the ports of Texas. I have no idea how this guy didn't crash. He was definitely not hitting any speed bumps getting here. This machine harvests four rows of potatoes at once. It's about three times more efficient than the current harvester that we have. The potatoes go up the conveyor belt here, the dirt gets spit out the back, while the potatoes go on what seems like a million different conveyor belts. There's also a storage hopper here that holds about eight tons and then we offload into the trucks. We were filling up a semi-truck of potatoes in about eight minutes, which is insane. Inside of the cab it looks like a space station here. This machine is so big that all the cameras are needed for the blind spots. Sadly we are not able to afford this harvester. We are not some mega farming corporation. We are just a family farm that has been around for a hundred years. Hopefully in the next few years we can save up for it, but until now we're stuck with this harvester.
