Education
 To collect a representative sample you can either use a hay probe or the scissors method. If you are using a hay probe then you should place it at the end of the bale between the two strings and insert it 12 to 18 inches. The hay is going to collect in the hay probe and you can just push it into the bucket and then transfer it to a clean bag. We recommend sampling 10 to 20 bales and adding them all to the same bag. This helps to get an average hay profile for your farm, accounting for any individual variation between bales. Join us in part two to see the scissors method and let me know in the comments if you've had your hay sampled this year.
