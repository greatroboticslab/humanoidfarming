 I'm here with my garden's new, natural, stylish, and productive design. But why did we switch to this system? What are these big chunks of what good for? And where does the soil come into play? I'm here to answer all the questions running through your mind. Friends, this system is called a raised vegetable bed. Once you build these beds, there are no extra costs and no need to buy fertilizer. So what do you get? Happiness, my friends. Independence. You create your own fertilizer using waste from your own garden. If you want to eat organically and your garden allows for it, this is an amazing method. Plus, since the bed is raised, working here is much easier on your back. It's best to use larger and thicker pieces of wood for the base. However, do not use unseasoned poplar wood. No one wants a tree growing right in the middle of their vegetables, right? We completely cover the wooden branches with tomato stems, straw, and corn stalks, leaving no gaps. If there are gaps, water won't drain properly, and plant roots won't be able to absorb nutrients. Next, we add 4 to 6 inches, 10 to 15 centimeters, of soil on top of the plant material. Finally, we spread animal manure over it. The reason we add manure is that the thick, not fully dry wood at the bottom takes a few years to decompose into the soil. In the meantime, the manure provides the necessary nutrients. As it rains, the manure turns into a natural fertilizer tea, enriching the soil. The taste and aroma of vegetables and fruits grown with this system are simply unmatched. I highly recommend it. See you soon. Take care. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
