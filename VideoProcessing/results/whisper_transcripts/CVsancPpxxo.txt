 Happy compost day! There are four major components of healthy compost. Browns, your carbon materials like leaf mulch or wood chips, and greens, your nitrogen materials which are your kitchen scraps like fruit peels, eggshells, or coffee grounds. Keep meat and dairy out of your compost. Create your compost by layering your brown and green materials, adding water, and making sure there is enough airflow so that it doesn't turn anaerobic. For our one acre farm space, we use this method. If you live in an apartment or small space, you can use a tote or bucket with small holes in it to create your compost. In an indoor compost system, always use brown materials on the top layer and use coffee grounds to reduce smells and deter pests. After a few weeks, you'll end up with some beautiful compost that you can use in your garden or farm space. Next step we will take care for you. SEVERAL yemek Primi Decir My whisk
