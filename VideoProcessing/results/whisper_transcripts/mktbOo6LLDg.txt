 Good morning children in this module we are going to learn about soil erosion and types of soil erosion let's start with it so soil erosion is the removal of the top layer of the soil and it is removed by different agents of erosion like fast moving wind running water glacier or ice and ocean waves so these are the agents of erosion so first we will see the types of soil erosion and here it is mainly caused by river that is running water so the running water leads to the soil erosion and the types are sheet erosion gully erosion drill erosion and steam bank erosion so let's start with soil erosion by running water the first one is sheet erosion so students you can see in the picture the land is devoid means the top layer of the soil is removed by the running water and due to lack of vegetation the top layer has been removed and like a sheet of soil is removed and this is a process of slow process of eating away the soil it is very harmful because top layer of the soil is removed which is fertile and therefore the land is rendered infertile and unfit for agriculture so there is one more picture this also shows that how the top layer of the soil has been removed and the land has been rendered infertile now it is it requires lot of fertilizers and artificial mode of irrigation so that cultivation can be done the next type of erosion is drill erosion in this type of erosion finger like rills appear you can see the grooves have formed on the land so this is basically due to the running water water has carried away the soil and because of which grooves or have rills have formed these are finger like depressions they have formed and over a period of time these fine rills increase in number and they also become deeper and wider you can see here these are this was like the width and as we are moving further it is becoming wider so with time this can also become wider and this is basically the soil is eroded from the top layer by the force of the running water and this leads to the formation of finger like rills on the landscape this reduces the area under cultivation and as well as the yield of area which is under the yield of crops means you can see this is agricultural field but this whole area has been rendered useless because rills have formed and they will also increase in width and depth if measures are not taken so this is rill erosion this is another picture that shows the rill erosion so you can see the finger like grooves have formed and this groove will widen and it might also deepen with time if it is not checked now students the next picture is shows the next type of erosion that is gully erosion so when the rills they become deeper or in an area where the running water is so erosive it's so powerful that it that it can lead to like deep very deep grooves on the land and these are known as gullies so gully erosion takes place on the steep slopes of hills you can see this is a hilly area and the steep very steep slopes of hills are affected by this erosion and the main agent is running water when there is a heavy downpour of rain the soil is removed by water flowing along definite path down to the slope in channel means in the form of channels narrow stream the water comes down the slope and you can see the landscape how it has been distorted by the erosive action of water and these are known as gullies and they become wider and deeper and when they become very wide and deep they are known as ravines they form ravines and such area if in a large area gully erosion has occurred for example the chambal river valley in madhya pradesh in india there you can see it's a best example of gully erosion a very large area has been this like destroyed or we can say the soil or the land has been left unfit for agriculture because several gullies have formed there deep grooves have formed and we call it bad land bad land here means land which is unfit for agriculture so this is the meaning of bad land so like this students gully erosion can leave the land unfit for agriculture we can see more pictures see this is another picture showing early erosion now students the next one is stream bank erosion so the river on its way also erode like in a in laterally means if it is widening itself it's a bank it's eroding its bank bank are the two sides of a river this is one bank and this is another bank if river erodes its bank and then it widens further and eats up the soil in its bank then it is known as stream bank erosion the banks of the streams or river get eroded every year by continuous flowing of water during flood the erosion takes place a serious form and gradually the bed of the river widens so during flood when the river overflows it eats up the bank the what the soil is removed from the bank and this is known as stream bank erosion so students these were the types of erosion caused by running water now next we will learn see this is another picture of bank erosion you can see the soil was still here but it has been eaten up by this erosive action of water and the bank has been eroded this is another picture of stream bank erosion now students we will learn how the soil is eroded by the erosive action of ocean waves or sea water so the sea water or ocean water they have waves and they are very powerful when they come and they start they strike the rocks on the shore the soft rocks are eroded and the you can see in the picture the hard rock is still durable and it is getting eroded slowly whereas the soft rock which was present all around has been eroded so this is the erosive power of ocean waves now students you can see the house this house or the it might be a hotel or a guest house is it was on the shore but it was not on the verge of the shore but now what has happened as this whole area has been eroded so it has come till here and now you can see the house is in a very vulnerable position it can collapse if further erosion occurs and if any measure is not taken you can see here this is also a very good picture showing the power of wave ocean wave which has eroded the land this another picture of ocean wave erosion or shore erosion this is you can see durable rock hard rock is still resistant so it's standing whereas the surrounding area has been eroded the rest of the area was also of this height but it has been eroded due to the action of water the next one in the list is wind erosion so the erosive action of what of wind is very active it is an active agent in deserts and semi-deserts and its power can take away the sand from one area to another so this is how you can see the marks of erosion caused by the wind see the wind has eroded this area and the resistant rocks are standing whereas the soft rocks have been eroded this is the another picture this area you can see the resistant portion is still uplifted whereas the soft area has been eroded this land form has been carved by wind wind as a strong agent of erosion this area and the strong agent of erosion so thank you students that's all in this module
