Planting Fruit Trees the Easy Way

 I'm going to show you exactly how I planted all these trees. The first step I do when I'm going to plant a fruit tree is I remove all the grass. Now I dug a hole. You want to make sure your hole is deeper than the tree's pot. We're going to add some bagged compost. So I've added about half a bag of the black cow to the hole. Then I like to add an organic granular fertilizer. The next thing I do, which I think really, really helps my trees adjust to their new spot, is watering the hole. I fill the hole up with a bunch of water and let it sink down. Then I do that again. Now I'll put the tree in the hole and make sure that the tree base is slightly above ground level. Once you have the tree in the hole, I'll add other half of the compost and the fertilizer to the top and around the sides. Yep, that's right. We are going to be watering again. I'll probably water these about every four days for a couple of weeks and then I'm going to switch to weekly. After we finish planting all the trees, we put down some pavers. The last step we have to do is add mulch.
