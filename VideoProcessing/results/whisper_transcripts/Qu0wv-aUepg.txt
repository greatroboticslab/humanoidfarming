 Why do the people in China bury fishes in the ground? Actually, the people in China are really dangerous. Whenever they plant ginger in the fields, they also bury fishes with it, so that the ginger plants get the required nutrition from the fishes. This leads to a good yield of ginger, which is then taken out from the ground and sold in the market.
