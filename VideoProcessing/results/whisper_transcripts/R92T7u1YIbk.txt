 Hello, welcome to Go Africa Global. We are here today to provide an overview of our rice commodity products and our rice production and processing operations in Kenya and East Africa via our subsidiary, Indigenous Go Africa, iGo Africa. For this three-phased initiative, we have partnered with the Kenyan National Irrigation Authority, which manages the infrastructure within all rice schemes, including Bunyala Rice Scheme, where the iGo Africa rice production operations are located. Via Go Africa Trading and its business-to-business operations and its e-commerce platform, we provide the global market's different varieties of rice products. We currently offer Sindano, Basmati, and Jasmine rice varieties in 25 kilograms and 50 kilograms sizes. Additionally, via Indigenous Go Africa, iGo Africa, a subsidiary of Go Africa Global, we have partnered with Magomf, Multipurpose Cooperative Society and Bidja Chamber of Commerce to drive sustainable agriculture and drive value addition for rice production and rice milling operations. It is a three-phased initiative aimed at increasing yield, improving quality of the produce, and promoting and marketing rice of Bunyala Rice Scheme. We endeavour to produce up to six tons per day of retail-ready rice products for the local Kenyan and East Africa markets. As part of Phase 1, we partnered with CFAO AgriGroup to produce and co-branded Baraka Fertilizer to ensure supply of this essential material in our rice production operations with our partners. Phase 1 has been successful and been underway for the past five months. As part of Phase 2, which is currently underway, we have partnered with CMC for tractors and Sanja Farm Machinery for the agricultural implements. The field deployment of farm equipment for the production and harvesting of rice has been underway for two weeks. For Phase 3, the implementation and operation of the rice mill is currently underway with support of our Kenyan financial partners, ABSA Bank, NCBA and Prime Bank. Our planned operational date is sometime in Q4 2021. At Go Africa, we endeavour to improve the countries and markets through sustainability and conservation initiatives. At Go Africa, we collaborate with our inspection, Q and A and compliance partners, Kenya Bureau of Standards, KEBS, CCICSGS, the USA FDA and the USDA to ensure the highest level of quality throughout the ordering, packaging, shipping and logistics processes. Go Africa has launched and implemented a comprehensive food health and safety programme, ensuring its suppliers and partner facilities are in alignment with the USA Foreign Supplier Verification Programme, FSVP, rules and processes, in concert with the USA Food Safety Preventative Controls Alliance.
