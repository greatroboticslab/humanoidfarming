Education
 So what's the most common question that I guess asked on my YouTube channel or LinkedIn? It's about supply chain education. How do I get into supply chain? And today we're going to be talking to Sarah Barnes Humphrey about that because Sarah is supply chain through and through. She came into supply chain through a family business. So that's coming right up. So Sarah Barnes Humphrey, you came through a family owned 3PL business. That's how you got into supply chain. If you were going to be giving some advice to people thinking of getting into supply chain these days, what kind of stuff would you tell them? Would you do things differently looking back on your supply chain career? Yeah, two important questions. I think I wouldn't get too hung up on the program that you're taking because I think that once you get into it, you don't quite realize how many different directions that you could go in. And I think, you know, trying out the different aspects of supply chain to really understand where you want to be is going to be critical to your career success. I would also, you know, talk about having some sort of understanding of tech in some aspect or another, I think would be ideal to anybody's supply chain career right now. As for me doing it over, so I actually got all of my designations while I was working in the family business. And I don't think I would, I don't think I would do it all over again. I, in any other way than I did it originally, I, I, you know, it took me 10 years. I got certifications. I got designations. I got, you know, I got to take different courses and programs. I got to take programs in freight and supply chain management and customs and the forum for international trade training, right? Like I got my designation in international trade. And the only reason why I did that was because as I was growing in my career and understanding the different paths that I could take and what I wanted to learn more about, that's when I signed up for the different programs and the courses. And there's so much amazing content out there right now. And, you know, courses and designations are going into micro badging. And, you know, so I just, I, I, I would take advantage of that all over again, especially now, you know, companies are looking for students that come out of supply chain programs to have on hand experience, or you're going to start at the beginning or at the, at the bottom to get that on hand experience. And so, yeah, I, I wouldn't change a thing. That's really interesting because, um, the, one of the most common questions I get is, is, should I go and do this MBA, this MSC? Um, and, and my advice to people very often is, don't get overly hung up on the qualifications. Yeah. You know, the fact that you're doing a supply chain degree and the major is this or that, you know, once you get into supply chain, your interests and your opportunities are probably going to take a different track anyway. Yeah. And it's interesting, you know, that you've, you've done that, you know, um, developing self-development, if you like, through your career, without having to sort of go off to university and do years and years of study. Um, my background was very similar. I was in supply chain for 10 years before I ever had the opportunity to get near a university. Um, and I think what was a great combination was that when I did get that sort of formal qualification, I had the practical experience to fall back on as well. And I think that's really powerful. Right. And people, I think, I think it might be a cultural thing as well. You know, in some parts of the world, people feel they have to have, you know, the first degree, the master's degree to be able to get on in the world. But I'm not sure that's true. What's it like in your part of the world? Yeah, I, I would agree with you on that. I mean, on hand experience is just as important. I mean, if you're going to be a lawyer or you're going to be a doctor, I mean, you do need those degrees to be able to pursue that kind of career. I think supply chain is a little bit different. I don't think you're really going to know where you, where you want to land until you get into it. Until you start, you know, I say this to my kids all the time, until you need to go out and try something. Until you try something, you never know whether you like it or you don't like it. And it could lead you on a completely different and unique path than you thought that you were going to go on. And most of the women in supply chain that I, you know, interview, talk about that in the interview is about their journey to success and how it was not what they thought it was going to be and how it took so many different turns. And that's where you get the opportunity. And that's what makes a career. You know, it's interesting. I was talking to an old friend of mine, Mark Powell, who he started off his working life as a coal miner. And he's recently, he's younger than me and he's just retired. He's retired as the CEO of a multi-billion dollar retailer. And I'll put a link down below to that video. But his approach was, it's almost like the Richard Branson approach, you know, if someone gives you an opportunity, go for it. And if you don't feel bad for people, don't worry about it. It doesn't matter. Just do it, right? Not to completely fall flat. That's all. That's the Nike, right? Just do it. Just do it. It doesn't matter. You're going to learn. Whether you have all of the qualifications or not, you are going to learn on the job regardless. Yeah. And I think for all those people who are saying, you know, which degree should I do? You know, it's great to have a first degree, you know, to get yourself into business. You know, it does lend some credibility. Absolutely. If you're looking at further study, I'd agree with Sarah. You know, wait and see what your interest is. You know, try a few things out, you know, in industry, in different parts of supply chain. And then start to specialize. You know, there's nothing like getting out there and trying it. And, you know, who wants to study procurement for three years and then six months into it, you discover you don't actually like it. Yeah. Or take a look at the associations and the workshops and the courses that they have in different aspects of supply chain. And take some courses, some courses outside of what you normally do in tech, right? You know, whether it's data, whether it's coding, something. You've got to understand something of tech in your supply chain career. Great tip. Understand tech. If I was going to add a second area, it would be finance. Yes. Everything in supply chain is around finance and the numbers. So you've really got to understand numbers. Okay. Well, that's a really interesting journey in supply chain for yourself. So what are you doing in supply chain now, Sarah? Well, I'm the founder and host of Let's Talk Supply Chain podcast. And I'm also CEO of Ships, which is a new tech platform that we just launched. So really exciting times. It's a great time to be in supply chain. I mean, you have to agree with me on that, right? Absolutely. Absolutely. I wish I could wind back the clock 30 years or something. I've been in supply chain over 40 years. It's getting embarrassing. You know, I think I ought to shuffle off into the corner. No, no. You bring a lot to this industry. I'm thankful for what you're doing in the industry and bringing value and bringing, you know, people like us together to talk about it. That's great talking to you today, Sarah. We'll put a couple of links down below to your podcast and to your tech company because people might want to check those out. So to summarize, if you're thinking of getting into supply chain, yeah, you know, qualifications are important, but practical experiences too. So maybe try and get the blend of both. Thanks for watching and we'll see you next week.
