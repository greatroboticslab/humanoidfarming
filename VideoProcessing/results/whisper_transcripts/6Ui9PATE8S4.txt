Science & Technology
 Look at this machine in China's cow farms for delivering leftover food to the cows. This machine throws all the husk in front of the cows. Then, when the cows defecate, manure is collected and removed using similar machines and dumped outside. Then, this manure is filled in bags and lined up in rows at one place. After a few days, mushrooms grow and mature in the bags. Finally, the mushrooms are harvested and sold in markets, generating substantial profits.
