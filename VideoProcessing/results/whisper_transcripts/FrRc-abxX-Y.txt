 Hi everyone, I'm Soju and today I'm gonna be showing you how to build this barn over here. It's pretty big and a little bit custom- customizable to be honest. I managed to fit a lot of animals in here, that's why it's so loud. But anyways, let's get on to the story. For the block pilot, I'm gonna be using mainly dark oak. I'm also gonna use tough bricks, but if stone bricks are more accessible to you, you can use those instead. And also some spruce. And this is the layout for the build. It's almost a perfect square and in purple, I marked the places where we're gonna be placing the pillars. So if you want to mark those, go ahead. So like I said, we're gonna be starting off with the pillars. We're gonna go 1, 2, 3, 4 on these and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 on the middle ones like this. And we're gonna repeat it on this side. So all of these are gonna be 4 tall and then these two middle ones are gonna be 6 tall. So I'll be back when that's done. Okay, so next we're gonna start off by outlining the roof. We're gonna start here on the middle ones. And with a top slab, we're gonna do this thing around the corner. And then we're gonna go up by one slab until we reach the middle like this. Once it's in the middle, we're gonna go down the same way and wrap it around. And we're gonna go ahead and connect this all the way across over on this side and do the same thing that we just did. So again, oops, up by one slab. Then go down and wrap it around and connect it all the way across. And then this one in the middle, we're gonna connect this like this until we reach this side. And now for the outer part, we're gonna do the same thing about wrapping this with a top slab. We're gonna go up by one. Then one, this one being one. Two, then three across. Then on that same one, one up. Then one, two, three across. Right before we reach this pillar over here. And we're gonna go ahead and pull that all the way to the back. Wrap it around and do that same thing. So one up like this. Like this until we reach this pillar. And essentially, we're just gonna copy this right over to the other side. So I'll be back when that's done. Now that we have the outline for the roof, we're gonna go ahead and fill this in using our tough bricks. It's just outlining. And then here, we're gonna keep it right under here. But yeah, I'm just gonna go ahead and fill this up. And I'll see you when that's done. So now that the roof is done, we're gonna go ahead and fill in the walls. Just let me, actually, give me a sec while I replace all of this. Okay, that's done. As I was saying. Okay, here, we're gonna use tough brick walls. We're gonna fill this in all the way across like this. One, two, three, four. Like this. Here, it doesn't connect. So what I do is just grab a slab and fill that in. And then here in the middle, we're gonna place two spruce fence gates. And that's the wall. And since all of them are essentially the same thing, we're gonna copy that all the way across on all of these until we finish. So I'll be back when that's done. Okay, so hopefully you have something that looks like this. It's just basically copy-pasted that same thing all around. And now everything that is left is just detailing. So to start off, we're gonna go right here in the entrance. We're gonna count one, two, three, four, five. And on the fifth block, we're gonna go across like this. And then here, we're gonna divide it in two. So one, two, like this. And pull that up. And we're gonna do this. Oop. We're gonna do the same thing on the other side. So one, two, three, four, five. Right here. And then in the middle. Like this. And from this block, we're gonna go across and fill it all in like this. And duplicate that on the other side. And we're gonna pull in these pillars like this. Just following the same pillars that we did on the outside. So right here, we're gonna do one right here. And on the other side, we're gonna connect it right there. And right here. I gave myself night vision for the time being just because it's a little bit dark. But we're gonna fix the lighting later. Right now, we're gonna go with this one. And pull it up until we reach the roof like this. And hopefully, you have like a grip pattern going on like this. So that's the entire frame all done. And we're gonna go ahead and place some of the details in. So right here on the corners, I'm gonna place some stairs like this. And then with some trap doors. And I'm also gonna grab a lantern and then place that right there. And then on all the pillars at the bottom, we're gonna place... I think we can leave that one like that. We're gonna place a fence here later. But we're gonna place trap doors all around the bottom of the pillars. And we're gonna do that with all of these. And then here at the back, same thing. Here on the corners. And then also on the side, just one trap door like this. So now to fix the roof. Right here in the middle, we're gonna go ahead and place some stairs right here on the pillars. And then using a full block, we're gonna place them right next to each other. Like this. And we're gonna pull in this slab right here. And basically making it a full block like this. And if you didn't fill it in like I did, we're gonna do this all the way. Making sure we get every single gap. And then right here in the middle, one final slab. Like that. Then on these bits, we're gonna place... I'm gonna place fences. But you can use fence gates if you like. You're gonna go ahead and fill these in. And then right here in the entrances, I'm gonna place a fence gate. But over here are some fences. And fence gate. There we go. And this, this setup, we're gonna copy it on the rest of them. So we're gonna go over here and do that same thing with the stairs. And we're gonna go ahead and place our trap doors like this. Once that's done, I'm gonna go ahead and place with some dark oak fences right here. Some lanterns on the inside. And then I'm also gonna go ahead and place one chain on either side. And then a lantern thing off like this. And I just noticed. I almost forgot to place these trap doors right here. There we go. So this is the part where it's a little bit more customizable. So we're gonna start off here. We're gonna place two fences on either corner. And then two fence gates in the middle. And then also right here. I like to place chickens in a smaller area. But if you, you can do whatever you want basically. You can have this divide on each one of them. Or you can leave it open like this. Just in case like for food, you need a lot of cows. You have the space for it or like sheep or something. But this can also work as a horse table if you like. And just keep one horse in each of the places. But I think I'm gonna leave this open like I did on the other one. Like this. And we're almost done. I'm gonna place a lantern right here. And then on this corner too. Right there. And we're gonna do that on the same side. On the other side too. I'm gonna do this right here and right here. And these are a little bit more optional. They're just decoration really. I like to place a path right through the middle. So I'm gonna go ahead. Actually I can just. Yeah. I'm gonna do it randomly basically. I am not really thinking about it. And then I like to go back with some coarse dirt. And just go around the corners basically. And put those all the way around. I also like to place leaves everywhere. So here on the roof I like to place just random. These are azalea leaves. And then I like to place these going down the sides like this. And then once I like how it looks. I'm gonna go ahead and replace them with the flowering azaleas. Like this. And maybe some on the side over here. So mine looks something like this. It's pretty random. And then I also like to go ahead and place some hay bales. Just dotted around like this. And just for some extra decor. I like to place some campfires on the sides. And then turn those off like this. Maybe one here. And I'm also gonna place some hay bales on the other side. And same thing with the campfires. And that's basically it. It's a really simple design. All that's left is to put in the animals. It's just gonna be really loud right now. Like that. Maybe we can place some cows right here. And some sheep. So thank god I'm in creative. I don't have to do this. But yeah. And that's it for the tutorial. I hope you enjoyed it. And as always. If you want to download this world. You can get this build. And all of the builds in it. It'll be down in the description. It's the super fat world download. So yeah. That's it for this tutorial. And thank you for watching.
