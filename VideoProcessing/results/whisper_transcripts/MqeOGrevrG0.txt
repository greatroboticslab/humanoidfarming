Baling my hay field for the first time after seeding.

 This April I seeded oats and alfalfa on 15 of my 50 acres. We got lots of rain this spring, at times a little too much. It's now middle of June and our first cut is ready as some of the oats are ending their milk stage. We used a 7 foot sycabar mower in John Deere 4020. The stand was poor in my opinion with bare spots and no alfalfa throughout the field, but thankfully very few weeds with the oats doing their job. We got the hay cut and wind rode and I made the decision to come back with a neighbor's no-till drill to help thicken up the stand with more alfalfa and grass seed. Rain came a day earlier than expected, so we were rushing to get done, with a neighbor round baling as we were interseeding. For new seeding, the first cut was light with only making 10 round bales on 15 acres. At least we got it off before rain and new seed was in the ground. Now hopefully second cutting will be a bit better and we'll see new germination in those bare spots of our new seeding. If you want to watch the full video, you can click the text in the box below.
