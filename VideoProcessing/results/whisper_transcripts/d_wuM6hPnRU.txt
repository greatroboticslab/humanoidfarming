 He was like, I had eyes and my heart skipped a beat for one girl. It's definitely eye-opening for sure. Taylor being like, he's only here for one girl. Get out, get out while you can. It was definitely very concerning. I feel like he really, you know, likes Bailey. Has he already found his girl and we're all just here for no reason? I feel like it changes like all our perspectives. It feels a little bit awkward, but I don't really care. Like I'm here for me and me only and I'm not here for friendships. I'm here for a relationship. Do we have any questions for Colton today? It's like, things are real.
