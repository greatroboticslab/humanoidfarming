 Hey what's up, I'm Boss and if you've been watching my channel you know that I like to grow food indoors using hydroponics all year round. But what if you could grow food outdoors all year round? I don't know if you can hear it right now. It's early April, I'm in Colorado at about 6,000 feet of elevation. The wind is whipping at about 60 miles an hour outdoors right now. It's chilly, no snow thankfully, but it's not exactly prime gardening weather, I thought. Then I got this awesome book. Four Season Food Gardening by Masila from Learn to Grow. So if you don't know Masila at Learn to Grow, pause this video really quick, hop on your Instagram account, go find her, follow her, and then subscribe to her YouTube channel when you're done with this video because she is an incredible fountain of information. I have learned so much watching her channel, following her on Instagram. I can't even put it into words. This isn't a sponsored post or anything like that. I saw she was putting this book out and I ordered it months ago. I got it the day it came out and I've been super excited. So Masila really focuses on teaching you all of the things you need to know about growing food outdoors for seasons of the year. What kind of planning you need to do, what kind of equipment you might need to build or purchase for season extending. She'll tell you what crops grow best in what seasons and why. She even goes back into her own story of how she got into gardening with her family and some of her unique experiences that drove her to be the incredible gardener and teacher that she is today. I'm saying all these things because I'm really, really liking this book. Not only does it contain a ton of useful information for any level of gardener, I'm not new to the game, but I only started trying to grow cool season crops recently. But now thanks to understanding a little bit more about how to manage your seasons, I've got my lettuce out, I've got spinach out, I've got carrots out, I've got my garlic growing strong that I planted last fall. And again, it's cold outside right now. A few things that I really like about this book is that she breaks it down in a very simple to follow format, but puts a ton of information in on each topic. The book doesn't just gloss over things either. It tells you the why and not just the what. So you get a really deep understanding of the techniques you can apply for season extending or pest prevention and all those types of things. She gets into propagating how you can take your plants and make more. She even talks about seed saving from different types of crops so that you can become self-sustaining in your own garden and keep that crop going year after year after year without having to purchase seeds. The photography is absolutely gorgeous in this book. Every shot looks purposeful and beautiful. I really like some of the how-tos on the DIY projects. There's a section on how to build trellises so that you can help support plants for vertical growing. All kinds of information that is really well written, really easy to digest, and very enjoyable to look at. All right, so I can say nothing but good things about this book. I could go on for the next 10 minutes, but really I would much rather you just go check it out yourself. It's on Amazon. I'll leave a link below. If it looks like something that you would enjoy or something that you could learn from, I highly recommend it. I don't do book reviews often. This is the first, possibly the only, unless another amazing book catches my attention. But this is one that I think every gardener should have on their shelf. I'll be back in just a few days with some new content and a new video series starting for my crazy gardening adventures. But until then, I hope you have a great spring. Get some of those cool weather crops going and we will see you next time. Peace.
