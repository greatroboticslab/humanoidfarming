 Did you get an orchid and have no idea what to do with it? I got you. No worries. Let me show you how to take care of it. Since you still have these beautiful blooms on them, there's no need to repot. Some roots coming out of your pot like this, or they might be coming out of the bottom just like that. These pots are great because you can see the color of your roots. Now when you do water, water thoroughly. Drown that hoe. Try not to get any water in the crevices. Any rotty crevices create brown rot. When you do water, avoid ice. They're tropical plants. Use lukewarm water. I will repot once the blooms fall off. I also have orchids that are in a pot like this, and a pot like this. Greenage is important. Give bright indirect light. Orchid can see out of the window and they can see the sun, but the sun cannot directly hit the orchid. Orchid fertilizer. Use orchid specific fertilizer about once a month.
