Gaming
 There is an easter egg on Luminous Cove. All you need to do is get one of each tier 5 mermonkey, so the Lord of the Abyss, Pop Sidon, and the final harmonic. As you do so, lights will appear on the back wall, and after all three are lit up, you tap it once to remove the seaweed, and tap it again to reveal a hidden section of the map.
