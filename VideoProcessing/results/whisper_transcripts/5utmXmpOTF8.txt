 Music As farm equipment continues to become more automated, tracking up and downtime to the hour, especially with leased machinery, can have a significant economic impact. For ag input retailers that offer custom application services and lease fleets of sprayers, spreaders and floaters, the ability to monitor machine hours, fuel costs and labor time allows for an accurate analysis of return on investment. Steve Cubbage, Vice President of Services at FarmMobile, a farm data company, suggests that equipment leasing could become an increasingly popular option for machinery dealers and also provide an opportunity to include or expand value-added tracking services. He shared an example of a recent product trial the company coordinated with an ag retailer in Wisconsin and the opportunity to improve tracking and performance monitoring of machinery. They actually had a machine that was on a five-year lease, 2,000 hours total, and it was coming to the end of their five-year lease. And it just so happened that they really weren't monitoring it real well, just manually. And they overshot that lease by 200 plus hours. It was over a $30,000 plus overage that they went over on a single machine. And we can basically do a better job of at least, you know, services around identifying where each machine stands at, you know, any given month or even any given day. Covage adds that for dealerships already specializing in or looking to expand application equipment leasing programs with ag retailers or farm cooperatives, the ability to customize tracking could be an attractive incentive to grow that business. Covage adds that they were at least now important añadization of customers to know for it. That is found in reality. Covage adds that we don't have high-p tanks without any direction in our future. It was the main topic probably for a hiçbir time. Stein on Facebook again. And certainly we did a very low-end어야 running approach to prominent imaging conditions for me!
