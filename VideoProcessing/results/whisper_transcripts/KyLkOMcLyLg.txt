 Thank you. I would like to start by saying thanks to Dr. Bowens and the center for this opportunity to share and also Dr. Yebo and Dr. Gitt for setting up the stage, especially for soils. So what I'll be going to talk today is about biological soil health management targeted towards sustainable agriculture. Okay, so I would like to start off by saying how the importance of soils have evolved with time. So we all know that soil is a dynamic natural body which consists of solids, gas, liquids, living organisms, and which can serve as a medium for plant growth. Now that is not the only function that soils provide. Definitely you know plant growth is one of the most important functions we get from soil, but there are a wide range of key ecological processes or ecosystem functions that soil provide to us which are vital for our existence and for sustainability. So there comes the concept of soil health which is defined as the capacity of the living soil to function. So you know there is an emphasis on the living aspect of soil, so on the organisms of present in the soil. To sustain plant and animal productivity. So we need to sustain you know longer term, think about the long term, plant and animal productivity. So along with plants you know animals are also dependent on plants and maintain environmental quality. So environmental quality would mean you know water and air quality. So we are considering, soil health considers the concept of environmental health along with plant and animal health. So soil health is this overarching concept which kind of fits in in the one health framework which considers you know health of the environment, health of the plants, health of the animals, health of living human beings. So soil health is an integral part of sustainable agriculture. Soil health measurement traditionally started with measuring soil fertility. So you know just like a soil test that we usually do. However, with time we realize the importance of the biological component of soil and how it regulates a lot of things that's going on inside the soil. So for example you know when there is any kind of nutrients which is supplied to a living soil, there's a lot of biogeochemical reactions or changes that occur in the soil. Those changes depend on how we are managing the soils and a part of those nutrients are assimilated by the biota. So biota means plants or organisms. So part of it is taken by them. The part which is not assimilated by the biota is lost into the environment and which could have serious environmental impacts. So these two things are related very much. So an example of environmental impact could be let's say leaching of nutrients from the soil or it could be emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. So affecting the environment. So my work has been mainly focused on managing the biological health of the soil and this for you know this is for the better understanding of the nutrient cycling carbon and nitrogen. So carbon and nitrogen are the central nutrients you know which regulate a lot of process in the soil and soil health is directly linked to these two elements on nutrients. Related to the soil fertility, and also the environmental impact. So we need to realize that when we are talking about soil health microorganisms are the key players. So any kind of soil health management, let's say you know incorporation of cover crops, having crop rotations, adding animal amendments or even reduced disturbance in the form of tillage, all these soil health managements are targeted to increasing the amount of organic matter in the soil or you know we call it soil quality. Right. Now what happens is in organic matter the carbon and nitrogen are coupled, means it comes together. So when the microorganisms decompose on these organic matter what is formed is ammonium. Okay ammonium is the inorganic form of nitrogen which which the plants can take up. This process is called mineralization. Again you know this is through microbial activity. So microbes are the key players and in this process carbon dioxide is released and I want to you know kind of point out that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. Now what happens to ammonium in the soil? Ammonium could get converted into nitrate by the process of nitrification. Again this is a microbial process. This occurs when there is enough amount of oxygen present in the soil and nitrous oxide is an intermediate product in the nitrification process. And again I would like to point out that nitrous oxide is a greenhouse gas which has 300 times more potent, it's more potential than carbon dioxide. Nitrate. And then nitrate. What are the fates of nitrate? Nitrate could be either immobilized which means that you know it can be taken up by the microorganisms or the plants and assimilated in their body. It could be leashed or it could be denitrified. Denitrification again is a microbial process of conversion of nitrate into nitrogen gas. Nitrogen gas in the atmosphere which is inert. Okay. No problem with that. The problem is denitrification is a very tricky process. If the carbon nitrogen and oxygen content in the soil is not in the right balance, the end product of denitrification could be nitrous oxide instead of nitrogen. And again like I mentioned, you know it's a greenhouse gas. Nitrate. So today I'm going to share a couple of my research activities, you know, which covers a wide range of soil health management practices through different in conducted in different agroecological regions in the United States. And again, you know, these are long term experiments. So the first set of experiments are located in North Dakota. Nitrate. The second set of experiments, long term field experiments were located at Washington. So these these were affiliated with Washington State. Nitrate. And then the third set of experiments were Nitrate. Located at Pennsylvania. These long term experiments were affiliated with Pennsylvania State University. So if you look at Nitrate. The range of different management practices which I compared in these sites. So for example, in North Dakota, we were looking at Nitrate. The difference in the intensity of tillage. So conventional tillage would be something let's say like a moldboard cloud versus no till which is reduced or just no tillage. In Washington, we were Washington sites we were looking in what happens if we have long term difference in the type of organic amendment we are adding. So we have compost versus broil and litter. In Pennsylvania, we are looking at what happens if the type of fertilization is different. So say, you know, we are applying manure versus synthetic fertilizer. So how these long term management practices are going to affect soil health. And for this, you know, we are doing that. And for this purpose, we conducted experiments at all three different scales. The field scale where we conducted experiments right in the field. And at the lab scale where we collected the soil, brought it back to the lab, and then conducted experiments in the lab. And then at the molecular scale where we extracted DNA from the soil in order to study what key microorganisms are present in the soil that are regulating the processes. So what did we measure? So what did we measure? We measured the biological indicators of soil health related to carbon and nitrogen cycling. So again, you know, this diagram is a repeat from the previous slide, but this shows the parameters that we have measured. And along with that, we also measured, like I said, the specific microorganisms, because they are the ultimate players. They are the organisms who are doing the process. So we measured specific organisms in the nitrification cycle and the denitrification processes. And we did that by targeting specific genes in the microorganisms. So what did we measure? So what did we measure? So what did we measure? We collected soils from this wide range of different management, long term management history from different sites, right, which was a very good contrast of what long term management can do to the soil. So what we did was we did was we maintained three different moistures, 40%, 60%, and 80% water filled pore space. Okay, so water filled pore space means the amount of pores that is filled with water. Why is it important? It's important because it's a good proxy to estimate the amount of oxygen present in the soil. Oxygen present in the soil. And I would like to mention that oxygen is very important because it regulates how the microbes breed and how they metabolize. Okay. And in field conditions, if you think of this wide range, it would correlate to a difference in the rainfall patterns. So what we did was we did is we added a lot of soil. So we added urea or we added beet tops. Now, urea is a very good representation of adding chemical fertilization in the field. And beet top residues is a very good example of incorporating leguminous cover crop in your plots. Okay. And both of these were N15 labels. So this is a kind of labeling. We do isotopic labeling in order to study the process. And I'll tell you how this was really good and how it told us about a lot of things, interesting things. And what we were trying to simulate in the lab is the period between late fall to early spring conditions. Now, the reason for that is this is the period where usually you don't have any crop in the field because you have already harvested your cash crop. And then you might have a cover crop and then you get started for your next season. Right. And during this conditions, most of the growers, they think that, you know, it's since the temperature is too low, nothing is going on in the soil and there's no microbial activity, but it's a different story. So I'll share the data with you. So I'll try to simplify this, you know, so this is a non metric multidimensional scaling or in simple words, the points which are closer to each other are saying the points which are far away from each other is different. So in a nutshell, what we found out was there was an accumulation of ammonium in the soil. OK, so if you look into this cycle, nitrogen cycle again, so the reaction stopped here. There was no nitrification going on because of the low temperature. So we were right there. OK, no nitrate is getting formed because the reaction stops at ammonium. However, when we looked into certain treatments where beetop residues were added, again, beetop residues simulated incorporation of cover crops, leguminous cover crop in the soil. We found a huge amount of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide coming out from the soils. So the question was now, where is this nitrous oxide coming from if you don't have nitrate? Because, you know, the reaction stopped over here. Right. And that is when, you know, using the isotopes helped us. So what we found out was. When you incorporate the cover crops in the soil, the nitrate in the tissue kind of bursts out, OK, because it's a legume. Legume has nitrate in that tissue. It bursts out. It comes in contact in the soil. And then you have nitrogen loss in nitrous oxide in the form of nitrous oxide or nitrate leaching. Now, even though the temperatures are low, that is a very crucial, you know, season when the temperatures are low and you can still have a good amount of nitrogen getting lost from your salts, which could have been utilized, you know, if you could have stored it in the next season. So how can you prevent that? Right. That's the big question. You can prevent it by building the carbon in the soil. OK, so if you remember, I spoke about the sites in North Dakota where we had a tillage difference, right? Conventional versus no till. It was only three years that the tillage difference was implemented. OK, so not a very long time. What we found out was there was no difference in the global warming potential. So global warming potential means you're considering both carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, both the greenhouse gases. There was no difference in the intensity of tillage when you look into the global warming potential. What is the reason? The reason was because that three years of tillage difference was not long enough to have significant effect in the total carbon presenting the soil. However, when we looked into another site in Washington, which was 12 years difference of tillage and amendment, we found out that the plots where compost was added had significantly lowered the loss of nitrogen in the form of nitrous oxide. Again, you know, compost is carbon rich. When we looked into the carbon in the soil, we found out that this 12 long years actually impacted the carbon in the soil and increased it. And we had significant difference in carbon. OK, so the take home is it takes time to build soil carbon and it takes time to build soil health. But when you have that, you will be getting environmental benefits and not not only environmental benefits. You know, when you are storing that nitrogen in the soil, you are making it liable to get decomposed in next season and, you know, provide nitrogen. So that will significantly reduce the amount of fertilizer you need to buy. So that will be the same. So that will be the same. Now, the problem with total carbon is that, you know, sometimes total carbon is not a very good indicator because it's not very sensitive to to a short difference or a short duration of management change. So for that, what we did was we focused on a very specific part of the total carbon, which is active carbon. Now, I like to mention this is a fraction of carbon or a test which is widely used by the Soil Health Institute and the NRCS. OK, what we found out that this fraction correlated very well with the carbon and nitrogen mineralization. Or in other words, this is the carbon that the microorganisms can sense and can feed on. OK, so it's a very sensitive indicator of soil health. We also looked into some DNA based novel soil health indicators. I'm not going to go in details, you know, about the measurements. But for for this talk, you know, what I'm going to say is certain microorganisms are sensitive. So if you if you actually identify and analyze them, you can see that they respond to the to the changes in the management. And that's what we found with ammonia oxidizing archaea and ammonia oxidizing bacteria. If you have any questions about this, you know, feel free. We are not going to go in details for the sake of time. OK, so what what what did we learn? We learned that nitrate in the cover crop residue, especially if it's a leguminous cover crop, can contribute significantly to nitrogen loss during late fall or early spring, if not managed properly. We also learned that only reducing the tillage without sufficient carbon addition, you know, so you need to return the residues back to the soil for a long term. Do not build soil health. So you need that time. And at the same time, you need to add that carbon. And the novel biological indicators like the specific genes and, you know, the active fractions, they responded very well to management effects. So they could be actually, you know, I'm not talking about the genes, but active carbon fractions could be actually used by farmers. It's a very simple test. There are certain kits which you can take to the field and you can get a rough estimate of these fractions. OK, so we spoke about cover crops, right? We'll speak about another soil health management practices, which is adding manure to the soil. Now, I'm going to talk about a specific process, very interesting process in the nitrate cycle, which is DNRA, or in short, we'll call it nitrate ammonification. Again, you know, what it means is this is a process by which you can reduce nitrate back to ammonium. OK, now, why is it important? It's important because nitrate then will have less liability to be lost by leaching or get denitrified into nitrous oxide. So you're actually protecting that nitrate to be nitrogen to be in the soil. OK. Now, how do we track the microorganisms? We track again the microorganisms by looking into specific genes. What we found out was the bacteria or the microorganisms that could do this process are presented in manure. So technically, if you keep, you know, on adding manure for a long term, you are actually adding this bacteria to the soil. So one of the things we are interested to see is how the manure handling techniques and storage techniques impact these microorganisms. And our big digestion is a process, you know, is done in a lot of places in the country. You know, this was specifically in Pennsylvania because it reduces the fall order. It generates biogas. It stabilizes the manure carbon and it also increases the ammonium. So in simple words, you know, we are increasing the fertilizer value of manures by digesting it, anaerobically digesting it. So our objective was to see, you know, how these microbes are affected by the handling process, which is anaerobic digestion in this case. So we collected, you know, samples before and after the digestion process from five different farms. So we collected, you know, we analyzed the microbes by sequencing it. We found really exciting data. What we found out was this digestion process. So the way you handle your manure or store your manure not only changes the physical and chemical properties of the manure, but it also changes the type of microorganisms present in the manure, which in turn will change the type of functions or processes that occur in the soil. Okay. So now, how am I doing on time? You have five minutes. Okay. Thank you. So now I'm, I'll be talking on, you know, cover crop and manure management. So what happens when you have both these sources of nitrogen and, you know, these are organic sources of nitrogen, right? So one of the, like I mentioned, one of the ways of improving or increasing soil health is to add manure and cover crops instead of chemical fertilizers, right? Because these are organic sources, which will build the soil health at the same time, provide nitrogen to the plants. So this was a specific, you know, experiment we did in the field where we were looking into corn. And then we were looking into two different sources of nitrogen. So we cover crop mix and then raw dairy manure. These are the two sources of nitrogen, which were added to the soil. I would like to mention that the cover crop mix was a mix of leguminous cover crop, which is hairy veg and triticale. We had a 90% of hairy veg and 10% of triticale, which is a grass. And I'll tell you what's the significance of that mix. So like I said, we were interested in looking into the nitrogen losses, right? So we designed a microplot experiment in the field where we either added manure or removed it, or we added cover crops or removed it. So if you look into this pictures, you know, cover crop exclusion. So these are the plots where we did not incorporate the cover crops. Manure exclusion are the plots where we did not add them in. Okay. And we got this four plus and minus manure and cover crop combinations as our treatments. And this was exciting to see. What we found out is, so on the x-axis, you have those four different treatments, right, of manure and cover crops. And then in the y-axis, you have nitrous oxide, nitrogen loss. What we found out was if you remove, or if you don't incorporate the cover crops, or if you remove the cover crops and just add manure, you have less nitrous oxide emitted from the soil or lost from the soil versus if you add both manure and cover crops. Again, you know, these are done all on equivalent nitrogen basis. Okay. So same amount of nitrogen was added. Only the source is different. So what we found out was avoiding above ground cover crop incorporation caused 60% reduction of nitrous oxide with only 10% grain yield reduction. Okay. That was very significant. Again, you know, I'm not going to go into this, but we did some isotopome analysis to find, you know, what was the source of nitrous oxide and it was denitrification. So again, the take home from this part is manure digestion has certain benefits, but might contribute to increased nitrogen loss after soil application. Manure handling techniques can modify the type of organisms that has the potential to regulate nitrogen losses from soil. So you see the animal, you know, component getting integrated in the farming systems, right. And then leguminous cover crop incorporation into the soil might increase nitrous oxide emission. So, you know, I'm not saying, you know, cover crops are bad. What I'm saying is, you know, we need to move forward looking into more depth. What is the quality of the cover crop? What type of cover crop are you having? Are you having a large amount of legumes or are you having, you know, good mix of legumes and grasses? So a mix is very important because if you don't have that mix, you know, you have a greater chance of that nitrogen to get lost if you don't have enough carbon in your soil. So if you don't have a healthy soil, in other words. So the overall take home message is basically soil ecology matters. Okay. So the environment matters. Soil environment matters. And you can regulate soil environment by managing your soils properly. So, for example, in order for a particular soil function to occur, you need three different things. One, the right microorganisms to do the job. The right soil management to create those conditions favorable for the microorganisms to act, to function. And the right climate, because climate is not only, you know, rainfall and temperature. It also regulates the type of crops you grow in the region and the type of biomass that is incorporated back into the soil. So it's a compact, you know, interrelated story. Okay. This is my last slide. So here at A&T, you know, we've one of the areas of my program is also on industrial hemp because we, the small scale farmers are really interested. And we have a great stakeholder, you know, input in this field. So we were looking in, we are looking into, you know, CBD hemp. CBD, as you all know, is a, has medicinal value. And hemp is an emerging crop in North Carolina and other parts of the world. So we are looking into best management practices for hemp. So we're looking into, you know, different varieties, different fertilization rates, different ways to grow hemp. And we're also looking into organic fertility requirements because remember, we need to be sustainable. So we are looking for ways to, to, to provide nutrition to hemp by adding, you know, cover crops and manure. And then we are also looking into the impact of hemp on the soil microbiome, which is the microbes and the environment. Because hemp is a very interesting crop, you know, it absorbs a lot of carbon dioxide compared to a normal crop. Therefore, you know, we are finding ways how we can capture that carbon dioxide or carbon and then add it back to the soil to improve the soil health. Thank you very much. And I don't know if we have any time, but, you know, you can type your questions. Thank you. Thank you, Doc. That was a good presentation. And we are at the time for the break. And it is a 10-minute break. So for those that have questions, please type them in the chat box.
