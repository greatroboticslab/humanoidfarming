 Hi there my name is Fabian. This is my father Michael or brother Paul. Welcome to the Melbourne Christmas Tree Farm. Today we're going to give you a bit of an introduction on the best way to choose your tree when coming to the Melbourne Christmas Tree Farm. Okay so we've got about 45 acres of trees out here so anywhere between 40 to 50,000 trees on the premises. So we've got a huge variety of pines out here. These trees that we see in front of us are your typical trees that are going to be ready for Christmas this year. They're around four years old but if we're going to be looking for the most perfect Christmas tree we've got this beautiful looking tree here which is a five-year-old tree and we can just tell that it's got great features in it as far as good density, nice and green, great symmetrical shape. This is the perfect tree that people are after every year. Trees do start from $30 and then they're priced on the density, the overall quality of the product, a little bit on the height but it's more we focus on the fullness. We'll distinguish between different types of prices on the tree. So here we have our optional Christmas tree stand which is a Synco Mate. This stand here holds trees up to six feet in height. These are the most affordable ones. These are retailing at $40. We've got the next size up which is a $60 stand which holds trees up to ten feet in height and then we've got our jumbo stand which holds massive trees up to twelve feet in height. Very easy to assemble we highly recommend them. The Melbourne Christmas tree farm is located 319 Leakes Road Plumpton. We're about 25 minute drive from the actual city of Melbourne and based in the Northwest. We're open from the 24th of November through to the 24th of December. Seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. We have Santa Claus here for the kids the first two weekends of December so come on down and bring the kids. We've got Santa handing out lollies and little gifts to the kids so come on down you'll have a great day out.
