 Sometimes the dreams that you want to live are just at the tip of your finger. But also sometimes those dreams are somebody else's life that they're living. Just be careful of the life that you dream and make sure it doesn't cost you. Because you don't want it to cost you what would be outside of God's will for your life. Chase your dreams. But remember, your dreams are not always what God has in store for your life.
