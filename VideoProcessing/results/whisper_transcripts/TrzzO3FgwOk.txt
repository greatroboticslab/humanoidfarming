 Welcome to Euaponics Videos. In this video we will be discussing aquaponics kits. By using an aquaponics kit, an aquarium is easily converted into a living ecosystem, where plants and fish coexist in a symbiotic environment. We will be discussing the different types of aquaponics kits currently on the market. But before we do, let's spend a couple of minutes talking about aquaponics. Aquaponics is one of the most amazing systems used to grow plants. It's similar to other hydroponic systems because it does not use soil as the growing medium. However, there are some key differences with aquaponics systems. Primarily, that aquaponics uses fish to help grow plants. When you combine the aquaculture element of raising fish with the hydroponics element of growing plants in water instead of soil, the integrated system of aquaponics is born. While other hydroponic systems rely on application of expensive man-made synthetic fertilizers, aquaponics uses fish waste as the nutrients. In a nutshell, an aquaponics system works like this. Fish eat fish food, which becomes ammonia-rich waste. The ammonia-rich waste is then pumped into the grow beds. Bacteria, which is cultured in the grow beds and the fish tank, breaks down the ammonia into nitrites, and then into nitrates. Plants absorb the converted nitrates as their nutrients. These nutrients become the fertilizer for the plants. Water in the aquaponics system is filtered through the grow medium in the grow bed. In addition, the plant's roots naturally filter water, so this helps to keep the tank clean. Aerated, clean water is returned from the grow beds to the fish tank reservoir, and this process repeats. So while aquaponics has many similarities with other hydroponic systems, the major difference is hydroponics uses man-made fertilizers to feed the plants, while aquaponics uses organic fish waste as the fertilizer. The benefits of using aquaponics kits. While many aquaponics hobbyists build large-scale systems for the purpose of raising edible fish and growing lots of plants, most aquaponics kits are made of a much smaller scale. They tend to be small and easy to manage. This makes them accessible to anyone, from beginners to more experienced growers. Because aquaponics kits include just about every component you need to get started, minus the fish, they are much easier to set up and operate in comparison to building your own system from scratch. Most kits include a pump, timer, and grow media. Some include grow lights and the aquarium itself, while others do not. Overall, buying a kit makes aquaponics a lot easier than building a system on your own, because it's much easier than buying all the components separately. Aquaponics kits are a fantastic educational tool for a classroom, because they're a tangible way to show how symbiotic relationships of an ecosystem work. They also make unique decorative displays in homes and offices, and require very little maintenance, when compared to most other systems. Besides being interesting, fun, and attractive, and easy to operate, aquaponics kits also grow wonderful plants. Here are a few of the key benefits of using aquaponics kits. They're extremely easy to set up and maintain. More chemical chemicals, less water used, and less pesticides.

Since fish tanks use electricity to operate, there will be some costs associated with that. Lastly, make sure no chemicals enter the aquaponics ecosystem as this will ensure your fish will die and render the system non-operational. Fish do not like chemicals. What types of aquaponics kits are available? There are various aquaponics kits to choose from. Option one, if you currently have an aquarium or a fish tank, there are aquaponics kits which can retrofit to your aquarium to instantly transform it into an aquaponics system. Option two, if you don't already have an aquarium, you can buy one separately and then add an aquaponics kit to your newly purchased aquarium. Feel free to view the uponics page aquaponics aquarium for a comprehensive list of fish tank options. Option three, another option is to buy an aquaponics kit which includes an aquarium with the kit. We will show you examples of each option when we review the kits. So with that said, let's look at some of the most popular aquaponics kits available. We will review a few of the aquaponics kits for standard 10 and 20 gallon aquariums, then show you a 140 gallon kit for a larger scale aquaponics. And for those of you who are interested in a tabletop aquaponics kit, we'll highlight several of those options as well. Let's start with kits for 10 gallon aquariums. Aqua Sprouts Garden. The Aqua Sprouts Garden is one of the newest and most popular aquaponics kits on the market today. The idea behind Aqua Sprouts is this. Since many people already have a standard 10 gallon aquarium, why not make the most of this aquarium, which you already have, by adding aquaponics capabilities. This kit provides most of the components you will need to easily convert your 10 gallon aquarium into an educational, productive, and self-sustaining ecosystem. Included are the planting bed, light bar, 160 gallon per hour pump, timer, grow media, and instructions. A grow light is not included, so your plants will either need plenty of sunlight or you must purchase a grow light separately. If you don't have an aquarium but still like this particular kit, simply buy a 10 gallon fish tank and then retrofit the Aqua Sprouts kit later. Springworks Micro Farm Aquaponics Garden. Springworks offers another great 10 gallon aquaponics kit. Unlike the Aqua Sprouts Garden, the Micro Farm comes complete with the 10 gallon tank. Also included in the kit is the grow bed, lid, clay pebbles grow media, pump, timer, and all the necessary fittings, as well as organic, non-GMO sweet basil and oregano seeds. Another thing the Micro Farm includes, which Aqua Sprout does not, is a grow light. However, the light is more like a standard tube light than a grow light. It should be sufficient for stimulating growth in small plants like herbs, but you may want to upgrade to a more powerful grow light if you wish to grow a larger plant. Either that or keep the system near a sunny window and protect the aquarium from the sun, as algae buildup will contaminate the water and kill your fish. Overall, the Micro Farm is a great complete aquaponics kit. It's compact, easy to assemble, and can be used in any indoor location. EcoCycle Aquaponics Kit. If you want something larger, check out the EcoCycle Aquaponics Kit for 20 gallon aquariums. Like the Aqua Sprouts Garden, the EcoCycle is another retrofit aquaponics kit, which does not come with a fish tank. However, it does come with a high quality dual T5 grow light, as well as an adjustable light bar, 7 watt LED tank light, and lighting fixtures, grow tray, filters, net pots, expanded clay pellets, water pump, and other components. So just add a 20 gallon aquarium and some fish, and you'll be ready to start using the EcoCycle, which is our top pick for 20 gallon aquariums. Genesis G12 Aquaponics System with Kit. For those of you who want to dive headfirst into aquaponics, the G12 Aquaponics System by Genesis offers a great product. It sports a massive 12 square foot grow bed, resting on top of a 140 gallon fish tank. While the high price tag of this particular aquaponics kit may cause some to cringe, consider this. The G12 Aquaponics System can grow up to 120 pounds of vegetables and 25 to 30 pounds of fish per year. That's impressive. After several years of use, this kit can become cost effective and allow you to be more self-sufficient. The Genesis G12 Aquaponics Kit includes air and water pumps, 140 gallon insulated fish tank, all the plumbing and fittings, filters, clay pebbles, seeds, and even oyster shells. But for those of you who just want a simple tabletop aquaponics kit, there are plenty of options for you as well. Fin-to-Flower Aquaponics Kits. Fin-to-Flower manufactures well-designed aquaponics kits. Models come in three different sizes, mini, mid-size, and large, and two different colors, black and white. Everything you need to start your system is found in the aquaponics kit, including the aquarium. You just need to add some plants and fish, then plug it in. The Fin-to-Flower models are attractive little aquaponics kits and very effective at growing plants. We also love the waterfall feature, which adds a serene, audible element to any indoor setting. The large model features a two-tier acrylic tank with dual waterfalls, while the smaller models grow plants on a single tier and have one waterfall. Here's a breakdown of the models from the Fin-to-Flower. The mini aquaponics kit has a two-gallon tank, three planting sites, and one waterfall. The mid-size aquaponics kit has a five-gallon tank, four planting sites, and one waterfall. And the large aquaponics kit has a five-gallon tank, six planting sites, and two waterfalls. While a grow light is not included, Fin-to-Flower is meant to be placed near a sunny window so the plants can absorb sunlight. Since Fin-to-Flower has designed their kits using tiers to block direct sunlight, algae buildup inside the aquarium should not be an issue. You can certainly add a grow light and keep your Fin-to-Flower system away from windows as well. EcoCube Aquarium. If you're looking for the ultimate low maintenance tabletop aquaponics kit, check out the EcoCube Aquarium. The EcoCube is designed with ease and efficiency in mind, so it makes a great aquaponics kit for a beginner. This kit is perfect for a desk at the office or home because it's compact, self-cleaning, and extremely low maintenance. With this system, you won't need to change the filter or even change the water. So how does the EcoCube work? You simply buy a small fish or two, add a plant to the top grow site, and plug it in. The aquaponics filter absorbs the fish waste so the tank is always clean and the plants are automatically fed. Once the system is set up, you only need to feed the fish to keep the EcoCube functioning properly. A small LED grow light comes pre-installed on all EcoCube models and an optional wireless remote control for turning on and off the grow light. The grow light and a UV sterilizing tank to get the aquarium water super duper purified are available for the higher price point units. Basil seeds are included as is everything else you need to start operating the system. The downside is the tank is only 1.5 gallons and you can only grow one plant at the time. So the EcoCube won't put lots of food on your dinner table. However, it makes a great little tabletop aquaponics kit. It's innovative, clean, and super low maintenance. Back to the Roots Water Garden Fish Tank. Lastly, the Back to the Roots Aquaponics Kit. This is another popular kit probably because it's inexpensive and easy to use. Back to the Roots has a simple design. It features a three gallon fish tank and is completely self-cleaning. Like the EcoCube and Fin to Flower Mini Aquaponics Kit, this is a small kit. However, Back to the Roots still manages to pack in six grow sites which will allow you to grow several herbs or small plants. The Back to the Roots Kit comes with just about everything you need to get started including a three gallon fish tank, radish sprout and organic wheatgrass seeds, fish food, a silent submersible water pump, grow medium, and gravel for the bottom of the aquarium. In summary, the tabletop aquaponics kits are inexpensive and easy to use. They're great for beginners as gifts or to use in an office or home. However, you're limiting how many fish you can raise and how many plants you're able to grow. A standard size 10 or 20 gallon tank gives you the opportunity to grow more plants and have more fish. The 10 and 20 gallon retrofit kits are great options, especially if you already have a fish tank. And of course, the Genesis G12 is an aquaponics kit geared towards someone who wants to be more self-sufficient and raise edible sized fish and grow a large number of crops. This kit is more expensive and requires more of a time commitment, but these large kits can be a lot of fun. So choose a size that fits your indoor space, budget, and time constraints, and aquaponics goals.
