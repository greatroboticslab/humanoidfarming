 Hey there! One of the things that you should do in your garden every week is cultivate the top of the soil. So it's a term we throw around a lot as gardeners but some people don't know what it means and I get a lot of questions about it. It's actually really simple. You can take your trowel or Hori Hori or just your fingers and you just go through and kind of mess up the top of the soil and it helps keep little weeds like this one from becoming bigger weeds and helps keep moss and other things from growing on the surface of your soil.
