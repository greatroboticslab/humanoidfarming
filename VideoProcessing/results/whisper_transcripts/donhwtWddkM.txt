 Hi my name is Joey and with Perfect Gardens today I just wanted to go over the Fox Farm feeding schedule for you guys I see a lot of new growers that come into here and a lot of them go straight to Fox Farm because it's a very well-known brand it's essentially a household name in a lot of ways and people just like to use it because they've heard of it and they're comfortable with it because they have some sort of a knowledge of it the only thing I see though that is very common is people come in and they don't use it correctly and when I say that I mean more so they're not using it by following the instructions provided by Fox Farm now I understand that over time as a grower maybe you develop your own cocktail and you use a little bit of this and a little bit of that and you find whatever you like works best for you but I'm mostly referencing people who are very new to the industry who have no idea what they're doing or even why they're purchasing a certain bottle when you look at the bottles a lot of the times the first thing people will buy is a grow big because they see it it's a green bottle and they understand the vegetative and the flowering cycle so they figure well I'm going to get the grow big because that's what I need for veg and then they come in a little bit later and like all right now I'm going to buy the tiger bloom because that's what I need for bloom or sometimes it's I need the big bloom because I'm blooming now so I'm going to buy that a lot of people don't understand that when you're following their feeding schedule and you look at their feeding schedule and their instructions you're actually going to be using all three of these bottles at one point in your growing cycle so I'm going to go through the feeding schedule with you guys real quick just to give you an understanding of it if maybe you're new you've never seen it or maybe you just don't understand it so basically the first thing you're going to want to look at when you're looking at this feeding schedule is you're going to want to notice that the three bottles in the green area is the big bloom the grow big and the tiger bloom for the first two weeks or at least for the first beginning stage when you're a seedling or a cutting you're going to only be using the big bloom that's the only product you're going to be using at that time and then into week one of your vegetative cycle you're again only using the big bloom product so in the very beginning you don't necessarily need the other two bottles you only need the big bloom product of course you save money when you buy all three at the same time so if you can afford it I say just go ahead and buy all three then once you get into about week three or excuse me week two to week four of veg you're really just using the big bloom and the grow big product now so you're using two of the three bottles now so basically it's going to be the big bloom and the grow big for veg and it's going to be the tiger bloom and the big bloom for flowering but let's keep looking at the schedule to get a little more detailed so as you can see when you transition from veg to flower they recommend you do a flush and you're going to start using that next the next time around you're going to start using all three of the bottles at the same time so you're using the big bloom you're using the grow big and the tiger bloom all at the same time so that's why it's really important to follow the schedule and have an understanding of what they recommend then you can see that the next week you're only going to use the big bloom and the tiger bloom then you go back to all three then you flush then again you go back to the three then you only use the big bloom and the tiger bloom again until you get to the end of your stage so this is just a quick video to remind you guys and help you guys understand that when you come to use the fox farm you want to actually buy all three bottles you don't want to just use the big bloom or you don't want to just use the tiger bloom if you want to follow their instructions anyway maybe you've already been doing it the way you've been doing it and you're happy with the results if that's the case disregard this video disregard this information keep doing what you feel is right and keep doing what is giving you good results because at the end of the day regardless of what recommendations you get if you're growing your plants and the way you're doing it is working for you that's the most important thing if you want to improve or if you want to try to use things the way that they're recommended this is the the example I'm giving you guys so I hope it gives you more of an understanding of how to use the fox farm trio pack and if you have any questions please leave a comment down below and have a great grow
