Travel & Events
 Still, to be able to come back home and see things the way they were, but then also see things differently because you've been out, you've had new experiences, that's how I feel. I've had new experiences, gained unique insights, and I see some things here that are like, wow, I love the way it is. I see some things here like, wow, I wish we could change some of that, and I think that's natural as well. But just to be back on the farm is a wonderful feeling, wonderful experience for me. Growing up in this type of lifestyle is something that I've kind of wanted for my children to have, and I've pretty much done that, right? So our first farm that we had in Southern Maryland, Blair and I had a farm there with cows, old McDonald's farm type thing with cows, pigs, chickens.
