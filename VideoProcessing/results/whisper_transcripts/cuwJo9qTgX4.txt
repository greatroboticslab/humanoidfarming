 We're working on our combines, getting them ready to trade them off for the year. And one thing we added to a couple of our combines this year were the Demco hopper tank extensions. And we were just trying to figure out how we can get over a little more ground without having to stop and unload because a lot of times we're running multiple combines in a field. And it always works out for us. It's just the time it gives you to give you a little bit longer harvest time when you're going through the field not having to stop and dump. We actually put these hopper tanks on two combines and on two of them we did not. And that way it kind of made them really stay out of sync a little bit more. Next year we're actually probably going to run them on all the combines just because how easy it was to add on to. And honestly taking them off hadn't been too bad either. So it's just been a pretty easy process for us to do. And been a very good high quality product. Hadn't had any issues. When we bolted them on this is one thing we used that we didn't have to do anything to once we added it to the combines. And that says a lot nowadays. A lot of times you get stuff and it doesn't line up just right. Or you get stuff and it starts falling off because stuff right you know gets loose on us. But this right here bolted on from the beginning never gave us any problems.
