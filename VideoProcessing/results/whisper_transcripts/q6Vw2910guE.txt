 corner. Charlottesville Parks and Recreation is sharing a list of available garden plots for rent in the area. NBC 29's Jacob Phillips shows us how you can get growing. Charlottesville is teaming up with a city non-profit to give gardeners a place to grow. This is good for my health. I love my garden. Whether you're an experienced gardener. I work here at this garden almost seven years. Or not. We haven't actually been members of the garden yet. Charlottesville Parks and Recreation is providing spaces for you to garden freely. It is part of our mission is to provide recreation to almost every resident within the city of Charlottesville. Earlier this week the remaining plots went up for rent. We have plots all over our park system from Azalea all the way to Metacreek. The plots are $50 a year and are first come first serve for anyone living in Charlottesville. Once a plot is rented the space can be used to grow just about anything with proper upkeep and maintenance. Jocelyn Moore is a new renter and looks forward to using her space for larger projects. We're going to do tomatoes. I think we're going to do tomatoes and eggplant down there for sure and sort of move that down there. Moore and many others rely on this space for food security. Charlottesville Parks and Recreation has made it clear that this space will only be for personal use and not commercial. We as a city have this opportunity for residents to practice those skills if they do not have property. Charlottesville Parks and Recreation plan to upgrade these plots in the near future starting with Reeves Park. In Charlottesville, I'm Jacob Phillips, NBC 29 News.
