 First year I farmed, first two years I farmed, I think I lost money, you know, and I didn't farm that many acres. I think I lost $600 the first year I farmed. My dad goes, well, it looks like you're about to lose some money this year farming or whatever. And hands me my custom $1,200, you know, combine bill, you know, so there was no love lost on this deal. It's like I lived in the camper plugged into one of my dad's grain bins rent free. My only expense at that point in time was I paid for a port-a-potty. I think I made it all the way up until like November like 30th. And it got so cold and the heater didn't work in that camper. My dad's like, hey, I'm winterizing this camper because it's going to freeze. And I'm like, I'll see how much longer I can stay in there, right? Got so cold I couldn't sleep one night. Went to town, rented an apartment, slept on that apartment's floor the next day.
