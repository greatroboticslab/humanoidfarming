 This video is not a how you should prune your peppers, you need to prune your peppers this way. This video is just a how I do it. What I do is I cut all this bottom stuff off so I just get right up as close to the plant as I can and just cut off all that new growth. Then I don't have any of this lower growth. As the plant gets bigger and it gets bushier, this is all going to be easier to maintain. I won't end up with peppers touching the ground, attracting pests, rotting. Next thing I do is I cut off the flowers and the reason I do that is so that the plant puts focus into growing roots and upwards and bushy rather than growing fruit. Ants are a sign of aphids. I don't worry about them too much. I just hose them off. You can see we got a little something right there. It's probably an aphid. I can't tell. It's kind of small.
