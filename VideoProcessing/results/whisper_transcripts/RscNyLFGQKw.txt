These aren't your average, everyday cows. Oh no, these are the supermodels of the cattle world, turning heads with their colossal horns. We're talking about horns that can reach up to 8 feet from tip to tip. That's taller than most ceilings. So, if you ever thought about inviting one inside your house, you might want to reconsider unless you're keen on some unplanned home renovations. Originating from Africa, these cattle aren't particularly heavy, averaging around 1,200 to 1,600 pounds, which is quite light for their impressive horn span. But don't let their moderate weight fool you. They are as sturdy as they come. Owning one of these can set you back a pretty penny, often costing 3,000 to 5,000 US dollars. But let's be honest, who wouldn't pay a bit extra for a cow that could practically double as a piece of living art? 14. Texas Longhorn Texas Longhorns, with horns that could compete with a small car in length, are the icons of the American frontier. If cattle could star in western movies, the Texas Longhorn would be the lead actor every time. These cows are famous not just because they look cool in cowboy hats, but for their ridiculously long horns, which can span anywhere from 6 to 8 feet. That's right, you might need a wider barn door if you plan on inviting these guys in. The Texas Longhorn is not just all hat and no cattle. These animals are known for their rugged durability and ability to adapt to just about any harsh environment they're thrown into. Moreover, on to the wallet gouging part. Owning a Texas Longhorn can be as wild as a rodeo. The top price for one of these Longhorn beauties recently hit a staggering $700,000.

These cows didn't get their muscles from hours at the gym, but from a natural genetic tweak that makes them look like they're always flexing. This muscle mass translates into a ton of lean, high-quality meat, making them a favorite in the beef industry. But, as with all good things, there's a catch. Their hulk-like physique makes birthing a bit of a challenge, often requiring human assistance. On the scales, these cows are heavyweights, typically weighing in at around 1,100 to 1,300 kilograms for males and 850 to 900 kilograms for females. When it comes to cost, these cattle can fetch a pretty penny, especially if they're prime examples of the breed.

Panda Cow Moving on from muscle to awe factor, meet the Panda Cow. Yes, you read that right. These cows are so rare and adorable that they look like someone crossbred a cow with a giant panda. But don't be fooled, there's no actual panda in the mix, just some clever breeding to achieve those eye-catching black and white markings. The Panda Cow is one of the rarest breeds out there, with only about 30 to 40 of these cuties existing worldwide. Their scarcity and unique looks make them incredibly valuable. In fact, the rarity makes every birth newsworthy. Imagine being so special that your arrival makes headlines. They don't just bring the cute factor, they also carry a hefty price tag. One of these bovine celebrities' Ben is reportedly worth a whopping $30,000. Because who wouldn't pay top dollar for a cow that looks like a panda? 11. American Brahmin The American Brahmin cattle is known for their distinctive large hump over the shoulders and floppy ears. If the Texas Longhorn is the cowboy, the Brahmin is the Zen master of the cattle world, staying cool and collected in the face of heat and humidity thanks to their unique physiology. These cattle are basically living swamp coolers, with a skin that sweats and a hump that stores fat and perhaps some cosmic secrets. Brahmin cattle aren't just about staying chill, they're also incredibly resistant to pests and diseases, which makes them a favorite in places where other cattle might just throw up their hooves and quit. When it comes to buying one of these serene bovines, the price tags can vary as wildly as a monk entering a disco. Brahmin cattle usually fetch between $5,000 to $25,000 per animal. 10.

These cows are built to withstand the challenging tropical climates of India. In terms of size, Guzarats are no small fry. They usually tip the scales at around 500 to 550 kilograms for cows and up to 900 kilograms for bulls. Their large frame and sturdy build make them ideal for both dairy and draft work.
