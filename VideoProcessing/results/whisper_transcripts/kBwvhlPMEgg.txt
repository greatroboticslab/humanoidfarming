 That killing frost never really came and the corn was able to fill to its maximum. The corn was heavy, the yields were great, cobs filled to tips, so we didn't get any negative pushback from those late planting dates and that sort of makes us wonder if we can experiment with planting dates a little bit more and not rush to put the corn in on May 1st or May 5th, which it's not looking like we're having to do this year, but it's certainly something that guys are wondering whether they should be planting on May 5th now or if they can wait till maybe the 20th.
