 Hello, Carl here with Sustainability Theory News. We're over at HelloTractor.com, and they are a service that really connects tractor owners with people that need tractors in the developing world, mostly in Africa at this point. But they use these little walk-behind tractors. In North America, the common ones are BCS walk-behind tractors. And they have all sorts of different implements and seats on them anyway, so you can sit on it and provide a little plowing service. So you buy one of these devices, and you put it up for rent, basically. But you're not renting the tractor itself, necessarily. You are renting your services as the tractor operator. In an article I saw about them, they make about $75 per acre tilled or plowed, as well as harvested. Maybe they're harvesting potatoes or carrots, and they need to plow them up. So it's about $75 an acre. The tractor owners can make some money, or at least pay off the tractor pretty quickly, and provide a valuable service that can help uplift their community. Farmers can grow more food. They can grow it on time. It really could uplift an entire local economy with a couple of these devices, or at least improve some neighborhood's quality of food that's available to them. And you know what? You can read more about this very interesting organization in the link in the description. And if you'd like to see more news headlines like this, subscribe to my channel. Have a great day.
