 Hey, I'm DeWitt Harding, Homeworld Director of Farmland Preservation at the Department of Agriculture, and here with me is... Evan Davis, Farmland Preservation Director for the North Carolina Department of Agriculture. Today, we are releasing a new marketing and branding campaign for Farmland Preservation Division of North Carolina River Farms. We are celebrating the landowners, farmers, and foresters that have made the commitment to preserve their farms forever. Well, we wanted to protect it for future generations. We do have a son that's in with us in the farm, so we wanted to protect it. We have a lot of development around us, so we just felt like it was the right thing to do to protect our farmland and preserve it. The Black Family Land Trust, we specialize in heirs' property. We help families exist during their heirs' property situation, and we allow families to come together and perform assets, additional assets on their farm and different income streams on their farm. We are proud to be the leading organization that helps our families and landowners retain information to be able to help them with conserving their land and preserving their land. So, China Land Conservancy, we have four main strategic priority areas that we focus on. Farmland Conservation is a really important one. We also work on connecting people with nature, protecting natural habitats, and protecting people in drinking water. So, one of our main goals as an organization is we work with landowners to put conservation easements on their property. And these easements protect our farmland and our forests in perpetuity. And so that means forever. So, we're actually helping make forever farms. And so we work with North Carolina ADFP to be able to provide funding for these very important projects. Right now, we have over 16, close to 16,000 acres that we have conserved working hand-in-hand with our landowners in North Carolina. So, us being able to create that legacy, to be able to see these lands protected, this is what's going to provide for not just me, my family, but for yours too. Our Farmland Information Center, which is in collaboration with NRCS USDA, provides data that supports the need to keep farmland and protect farmland. And within North Carolina, it's estimated to lose a million acres of farmland just by the 2040. It's just such a threatened resource in our state. North Carolina has lost so much farmland over the last 50 years and is projected to lose so much more. And, you know, we just work with these landowners who have these valuable farmland tools to protect those for future generations. And Saving Family Farms is really a tenant of our organization's mission and we're thankful for partners like ADFP that make those projects possible. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. I'm Kaylin Kingsbury. I'm the Associate Director at Piedmont Land Conservancy, which is a land trust that is in the middle of the Piedmont. We cover about nine counties and land trusts do a lot of different things, but my favorite thing is farmland preservation. I've been doing it for 20 years and I have met the nicest people, the hardest working people and the most connected to their land people of anyone. And those are all farmers. And I am so happy that North Carolina has a program to help them get money to keep their farm apart. Because if we don't have farms, we don't have food. If we don't have food, we go hungry. And that problem is only going to get worse as we get more and more development. And we've always said there's a place for development. The state needs business. We don't have a problem with that, but we've got to protect farmland. It's good to see a celebration like this because we've been trying to get a program here in North Carolina for 20 years, establish and working wide open. And just wherever brand would make that come to another level of production of conservation of farms here across North Carolina. As we lose so many farms in North Carolina due to the growth and influence of new population coming to our state, it's very important to do so. Last July 2022, the American Farmland Trust released a report saying that North Carolina will lose the second most number of acres out of all the states across the country. By the year 2040, they predict that 1.1 million acres of farmland will be lost to development. Since 2006, the Agricultural Development and Farmland Preservation Trust Fund has preserved over 32,000 acres of farms and forests across the state. So today we're celebrating those landowners and those land trusts and county governments that have partnered in the effort to observe farmland. The
