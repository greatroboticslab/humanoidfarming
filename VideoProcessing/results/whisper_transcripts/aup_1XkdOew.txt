 I got these insane results using the sand propagation method to root my cuttings, and I used every rooting hormone that most people would use. The Clonex rooting gel, the liquid rooting hormone, Dip and Grow is a great brand. I really like it and it works well. And the powdered stuff that you can get at pretty much any big box store. And like I said, the method that I'm using is the sand propagation method. It's lightly moist play sand in a cheap storage bin, placed on a heat mat, and the results were consistent across the board. Roots on all of them.
