Howto & Style
 Cocosel zucchini could harvest between 8 to 10 inches. They're a larger variety. This plant has over 11 leaves. So we're going to prune out the lowest one and the male flower is finished. We're going to prune it out. You could eat both the male flowers and you could eat the leaves or you could compost them back. Growing vertically you save a lot of space. You could add fertilizer and you could water easy. Right here we're going to tie with a soft garden twine. The soft twine does not hurt your plant and we're going to use a six feet garden stake. This way you could grow more plant in a smaller area. Add fertilizer every two to three weeks. I say two weeks because it's a big plant. Water every two to three days.
