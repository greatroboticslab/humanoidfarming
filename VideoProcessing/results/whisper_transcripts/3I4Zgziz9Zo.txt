Pets & Animals
 Hey my little farmers this is farmer Jason over here at Cog Hill Farm and are you guys ready for a fun farm adventure today? Me too so let's go! Well little farmers we're up bright and early this morning because we got to take care of all the farm animals and I was thinking would you guys like to help us take care of the farm animals today? Oh thank y'all so much let's get started as most of y'all know we have a lot of farm animals here on the farm and it is a very important job for us to take care of every single one of them. Holla are you ready to help me take care of the farm animals too? Good! So let's get started with our first two farm animals we need to go handle. Do you know who that is? Well let me go show y'all. It might get a little loud because our first two animals we got to take care of are Gus and Loretta. Our two cooney cooney pigs. Hey Gus and Loretta. Miss Loretta gets quite loud sometimes when she's ready to eat. Y'all here. Okay we got to get your pans. Let's get your pans. There's one. We got to find the other one Loretta. Let's look for Loretta's pan. Do you guys see the other pan somewhere? Oh yeah there it is. Alright Loretta. Pan number two. Now our friends Gus and Loretta. They eat a food that is for pigs. Y'all want to see what it looks like? That's it right there. This feed here is just for pigs. And of course y'all know Gus and Loretta are pigs. So they need pig food. There's one more thing that I like to do to our pigs feed. And let me go show y'all. To make it a little bit easier for them to eat. I like to wet their food down. And the only animals that get their food wet like this are our pigs. And this is what the vet told us to do. The veterinarian. Do you guys know what a veterinarian is? If you said that is an animal doctor then you're right. And so the veterinarian told us to wet down our pigs food because it makes it easier for them to eat. Alright Gus and Loretta are you guys ready to eat? Okay get back Miss Loretta. Get back. Alright thank you Loretta. Okay here we go. Here we go. There's one. And here's two. Gus and Loretta are y'all enjoying your breakfast this morning? It looks like y'all are. Yeah. Oh there's one of our roosters crowing this morning. Hey buddy. How you doing? He's telling everybody to get up. It's time to get started. Talking about pigs. Our little buddy Farmeret over at Chestnut Hill Farmstead has got a cool fun fact about pigs. Hey Farmer Jason. I'm Farmeret. Do you know that the mother pigs sing to the babies while they're feeding? Bye. You know what Farmeret? I had no idea that mother pigs sang to the baby pigs. Now that is amazing. So the next thing we have to do for our two pigs over here, Gus and Loretta, is we have to clean out their waters and fill their waters up with clean fresh water. Loretta. Loretta you gonna help me clean your water out? Loretta. You gonna help me clean your water out? All right, we're gonna get your waters cleaned out here Loretta and Gus. Fresh clean water is super important to all of our animals here on the farm. All right, so we just got finished filling up Miss Loretta's water bowls. Are you happy Miss Loretta? Huh? Huh. You happy now? You've had breakfast and you now have some fresh clean water this morning. Oh my. Loretta loves to be scratched on like this. Yeah. Look at Loretta's big old ears. Oh Loretta. Loretta. You are some pig, aren't you? Okay, so we got some more farm chores we gotta do, okay? You guys have a wonderful day in this beautiful sunshine. Okay, Mr. Gus. Y'all have a wonderful day. And the little farmers and I are gonna continue on taking care of the farm and doing some more farm chores, okay? Okay, buddy. Well, little farmers, I see three more farm animals that we need to take care of. Are you guys up for it? Good deal. Well, those three are our big cow Moody right here and our two boy goats over there that are wrestling. Look at them wrestling and playing. Goats love to play. And you can see them just playing around. Isn't that funny, Moody? Look at the goats. Goats are very playful. They really are. And our two male goats over there are having lots of fun playing right now. And do you guys remember what you call a male goat? That's right, a buck. So let's get our two bucks fed and our one cow, Mr. Moody. So our big old cow, Mr. Moody over there, he gets two scoops of cow feed. So let's count them. There's one. And there's number two. And would you guys like to see what this cow feed looks like? Let me show you. Look at this. See that? And this feed here is made just for cows. Which means it has all the things that a cow needs to grow up big and strong. Now we have the cow's feed taken care of. Now it's time for the buck feed. And this is what the boy's goat feed looks like right there. And this feed again is made just for boy goats. And Moe and Joe get one big scoop of their feed. All right, you guys ready to eat this morning? I know y'all are. So let's get big Moody fed here. And now let's get the boy goats fed. Come on, Moe and Joe. Let's go eat. There you go, Mr. Moe. I hope you enjoy your breakfast this morning, buddy. You can tell they really enjoy their food, don't they? You can tell they're hungry. So now I have to fill up the boy's water right here. Moody and the boy goats. And their water doesn't get as nasty as the pig's waterer does. So I don't have to empty it and clean it all out every single day. The water is clean today, so we're just going to top it off with some more fresh, clean water. And I do that by just cutting on this faucet right here. And then it goes to this hose and fills their water up right there. Doesn't it, Mr. Moe? And then when I'm finished, I just turn the faucet off. And now you guys have some fresh, clean water today. And I hope you guys have a great day in this beautiful sunshine and I got more chores to do. Y'all can see Gus is already enjoying the pool. Like that, buddy? Miss Loretta, you're going to get in it too. So now we're going to walk over to our barn where we have other animals on this side of our farm. And eventually, when we get done with all of our fencing, all of our animals will be over here close to the barn. If you look over here, here are our geese. Hey guys, good morning. Yeah. I think they're telling us good morning back. What do you guys think? I think we're going to get to the bank. Also, we have two emus that live in this pasture. Goldie and Nugget. You can see there's Goldie way on the other side of the pasture. Now let's see if we can find Nugget. Here comes Nugget. Here he comes. He's over there by the geese. Well, there's one of our barn cats, Sylvester. Good morning, Sylvester. We need to cut the lights on, don't we, buddy? So let's get the lights cut on so we can see. All right. Hey, Bramble. Good morning, buddy. Now in this stall right here in the barn is our other pig, Peaches. Now she likes to sleep inside at night. Y'all want to see Peaches? Good morning, Peaches. Peaches, we're going to get your breakfast ready, girl. Yes, we are. But first, I got to let the goats out. Good morning, y'all. Now these are female goats over here. And I bet you guys remember what a female goat is called. You got it. These are our does. Y'all come on out this morning. Come on, guys. Y'all come on out. Come on. All right. Good morning, Miss Jessie. How you doing this morning, Jessie? Hey, Jessie. Jessie is our female miniature donkey. Hey, girl. How you doing this morning, hmm? And let me show y'all what the goats do. Every morning we let them out. They head straight to the forest area or the wooded area over there. Because what's happening is the leaves are falling off the trees because it is fall or autumn. And goats love eating leaves. More than they do grass. Hey, Mildred. How are you doing this morning? Hmm? Now, Mildred is our female cow. Okay, Mildred and Jessie. I have to go feed Miss Peaches this morning. Then we'll come back and see you guys, okay? Let's get Miss Peaches fed. Peaches, are you ready to eat? Hmm? All right. All right. Well, let's get your bowl right here. Okay. Hey, Biscuit. How are you doing, girl? Biscuit, I got to open this gate. Let's see. Let's step over here, okay? Step this way. There you go. Now, I didn't want to open that gate with Biscuit on it. So, Miss Peaches gets a mini pig feed. Very similar to what Gus and Loretta get our other two pigs. But Peaches is just a little bit different because Peaches is a breed or a type of pig called a potbelly pig. And she used to have a little bit different food than the other two pigs, Gus and Loretta. And let me show you guys what this food looks like. Look at there. And just like Gus and Loretta, we're going to water down our wet Peaches feed for her. All right, got Miss Peaches food watered down. I like to let it sit just for a minute. All right, Miss Peaches breakfast is ready. Here comes Peaches breakfast. All right, Miss Peaches. Here you go. Peaches, it looks like you're really enjoying your food this morning. Yes, it does. So we'll let Peaches finish eating and then we'll open this door and let her out. But in the meantime, I have something that I think you guys are going to love. Do you guys know what this is? Listen. That's right. It's a ball. But do you guys know what color this big ball is? Peaches. You got it. It's red. But I bet some of y'all don't know who loves to play with this big red ball. Do y'all want to find out? Good. Good. Because she loves playing ball. So come on, let's go. But it's not Peaches. Peaches doesn't love playing with this big red ball. Let's go find out who loves playing with this big red ball. It's not the goats. They don't like playing with the big red ball. And it's not Mildred our cow. It's Jesse our donkey. Jesse loves playing with this big red ball. You ready Jesse? You ready? Look here. Watch her. She kicks it with her front feet. You see her? Oh Jesse. That is so much fun, isn't it? Whoo. jaką Thank you. Do you guys like playing ball? Me too. I love playing ball. I like to kick it and run and chase it a lot like Miss Jessie does. Now how fun was that? Huh? Oh my goodness. Who knew that donkeys love to play ball, right? So the goats are headed back over to the forest area. So let's go over there and let me show you guys how they love to eat these leaves that are falling off these beautiful trees. Y'all see them eating the leaves? They really enjoy eating these leaves. Hey Miss Jessie. Hey Miss Jessie. Are you through playing ball? Hmm? Hmm? You sure like you had a very good time out there playing ball, didn't you? You sure did. That was so much fun. Running around, chasing that big red ball. You got a lot of exercise in today, didn't you? Yeah. Yeah. You sure did. Well Miss Jessie, guess what? I have some other animals I need to go take care of this morning. Yep. And then we'll be back later to come feed you guys. Okay? That's right. You are a sweet, sweet girl. Yes you are. Sweet girl. And little farmers, always remember to ask your favorite adult before touching or petting any animal that you don't know. Because some animals might get scared and are not used to being petted and loved on like Miss Jessie is here. Right Jessie? That's right. Mmm. So Jessie, the goats, and Mildred, their waters look clean. Oh, this one's got a little bit of sand in it. So let's dump this one out and get it cleaned for them. Well little farmers, look who is out here helping me fill these waters up. It's our barn cat Bramble. Hey Bramble. Hey buddy. How you doing? Hmm? How you doing Bramble? Uh oh, I hear Peaches knocking. She's ready to come out y'all. Okay Peaches, I'm coming girl. Come on Peachy. Peaches must be through eating this morning. She is. All finished, aren't you girl? Come on out. Oh, there's another one of our barn cats out here helping us fill up waters. Hey Sylvester. Hey buddy. Oh, I hear barn cat number three. Here comes Biscuit. Biscuit, you gonna help us fill up waters too, huh? Okay, this water here is just about full. I have one more inside this stall to do. All right. All right. And I noticed that the goat minerals is empty. So let's fill up the mineral feeder. Because our goats need special minerals to stay healthy and strong. And let me show y'all what their minerals look like. Look at there. See that? Look. It's almost like sand. So let's fill up the goat's mineral feeder real quick. All right. Now I think everything's done over in this pasture until later on today. And we'll come back and feed these guys. And I probably need you guys' help with that too. Is that okay? Good deal. Good deal. Good deal. So now we have to go take care of our geese and our two emus, Nugget and Miss Goldie. And so this is the geese food right here. And they get two big scoops. One. And two. And let me show y'all what the geese food looks like right there. Look at this. Okay. Now let's get the emus food ready. Emus get just one big scoop. And let me show you what the emu food looks like. Looky here. It's very similar to the pig's food. But it is different. It may look the same. But it is different. Okay. Let's go get these guys fed this morning. Okay. First up. The emus. And look. There's Nugget already here this morning. Good morning, Mr. Nugget. Got some of your food ready. All right. It's quite loud, isn't it? It really is. So let's get the geese taken care of. And they may quiet down. Or they may not. All right, Mr. Nugget. I got the geese feed right here, buddy. Oh, y'all look. Goldie's eating an emu feed. Okay, guys. Okay. We're getting y'all. Yes. All right. They're loud, aren't they, Nugget? Shoo. Those geese sure are loud. But we love our geese. We really do love having them here on our farm. And Nugget says he doesn't mind them either. Matter of fact, Nugget considers those geese his friends and pasture mates. Okay, little farmers. We have to take care of the barn cats real quick before we move on to the egg mobile. And typically the farm cats are over here helping me feel their feed up. But they are probably still outside playing. Nope. Here's Sylvester. Hey, Sylvester. Hey, buddy. Oh, here comes Biscuit. Okay, guys. And here comes number three, Mr. Bramble. Sylvester, Biscuit, and Bramble. So everything is taken care of over here in the barn. Except when we come back later today and feed Jesse, Mildred, and the goats. So next up is for us to take care of is the egg mobile. Our laying chickens and Cheese, the guard goose. Holly, holly, holly. You ready to help me with the egg mobile, girl? Hmm? You ready to help me with the egg mobile? Get the chickens taken care of? And gather eggs? All right. Let's go, Holly. Oh, oh. Also, also, little farmers. I'll show you guys my garden that I'm growing over here near the chickens. I see you, Miss Goldie, enjoying the sunshine. It's a beautiful day, isn't it, girl? It sure is. I want to show you guys my garden that I'm growing for the fall and winter. See, there are certain vegetables and plants you can grow that do well in the colder months, like fall and winter. And this is what we're growing here on our farm. We're growing onions. I got onions planted right here. And over here, we got radishes. And this is lettuce. This is broccoli. I'm sure most of y'all know what broccoli is. And then right next to it is a plant or a vegetable called turnip greens right here. And this plant here, you can eat the greens and the root. And the last one we planted is called collard greens. And we'll eat these green tops as well. You ready, Holly? You ready to go check on the chickens? We've got to fill that water up. And I put this bracelet on so I don't forget to turn the water off. See this? So if I was to walk away, I would see this bracelet and it would remind me, Hey, Farmer Jason, you've left that water on by the chickens. So that's what this bracelet's for. Sometimes I get real busy and I will forget. So this is just a good reminder. Good morning, guys. How are y'all enjoying this beautiful sunny morning? Jeez, it sounds like you're really enjoying it, aren't you, buddy? All right, y'all. Let's get y'all's feed filled up, okay? Hey, Mac. Let's see how many scoops it takes to fill y'all's feeder up. Are y'all ready? Let's count. One. Two. Three. Four. And five. Wow. Five scoops, guys. I also have a couple of more smaller feeders that I fill up for the chickens. Like this little pan right here. Hey, Ryan the rooster. You like that, buddy? Hmm? I'm going to sit it right over here, okay? Now. Now. Now I got one more feeder somewhere. Oh, I see it right now. Here it is. It's under here. Okay. Okay. Let's put this feeder somewhere for you guys. How about we put it right over here. Right there. Now. So, our main water over here for our chickens is this big barrel right here. And it holds 45 gallons of water. Have you ever seen a gallon milk jug? So, that's one gallon. This will hold 45 of those milk jugs. And it's got a little cup down here. Right here. And it's got this little yellow plunger right there. So, when the chickens come over here, they hit that plunger and the water comes out. See it? Right there. And then they can have them a fresh drink of water. But we also have a swimming pool over here for our guard goose cheese. And just like all the other waters, we have to make sure that this swimming pool stays nice and clean. See, this pool is very important for our goose cheese. And if you notice, we have a lot of other pools in there with our other geese as well. And that's mainly because a goose needs to be able to get his head down in the water. Because their beak and nose is different than a chicken. Or our emus. And they have to be able to clean out their beak and their nose after they get through eating. And watch Mr. Cheese do just that. See, he takes that water and moves his mouth like that and cleans all that out. So, that's why we have to have a pool over here for our goose and our other... And our other geese. Okay, little farmers. Now it's time for us to collect our eggs. So, let's look in the nesting box and see how many eggs we got today. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Oh my gracious! 11 12 13 14 14 15 16 Wow, y'all! We got 16 eggs today! Goodness! And y'all look at these beautiful, beautiful eggs we got today. We got some white eggs. We got some blue eggs. This egg is almost purple looking. And we got brown eggs. So now let's take our eggs over to the barn and carton these up and put these out on our farm stand where we sell our eggs to our neighbors and friends and everybody that lives around us. Hey girls, thank you so much for all that you do for the farm. Hey Moody! I just collected a big old basket of eggs. Do you know how many I gathered today? 16! We got 16 eggs today Moo Man! That's a lot, isn't it? Yes it is! Now I gotta go carton them up and put them out there on the farm stand for our friends and neighbors to come get. Now we do enjoy these eggs ourselves here on the farm. But there's no way that we can eat all these eggs we have. So we do sell them on our farm stand and that does help us out here on the farm. And helps us pay for the feed and our water and all the things that our animals need. Okay Holly, let's go get these eggs cartoned up girl, okay? Hey Goldie! Hey girl, guess what? We got 16 eggs today! 16! That's a lot, isn't it? Whoo! Do you guys like eating eggs? I love eating eggs. I like scrambled eggs. I like eating an omelet. We use our eggs to make cakes with. Or even a pan of cornbread. Mmm! Mmm! Alright, so let me show y'all what we do with our eggs. We take our egg carton and then we take this stamp that has our name on it. Just like my hat. Cog Hill Farm. See? Right here. There. And then we take this and we push it down on the carton like that. And look at there. That's our name. Do you guys know that a dozen eggs go in a carton like this? And do y'all know how many eggs is in a dozen? 12. That's right. So let's count 12 eggs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12. Look at there. One dozen eggs. So now we can take these eggs and put them on our farm stand so someone else can enjoy them. Since I only have four eggs left, that's not enough to make a dozen. I want to put them in our refrigerator. Now, let's go put these eggs out on the farm stand. But you know what? For some reason, I feel like I'm forgetting something and I'm not quite for sure what it is. Hmm. I just feel like I'm forgetting something. Do you guys know what I'm forgetting? Oh, my bracelet. Oh, my goodness. That means I forgot to turn the water off. Whew. Thank y'all so much for reminding me. Whew. So let's go turn the water off for the chickens and let's go put their eggs out on our farm stand. Come on. Holly, guess what? Guess what I forgot? I forgot to turn the chicken water off. Yeah. But thank goodness the little farmer's reminded me. So let's go cut that water off. Hey, Nugget. Look what I forgot. I forgot to turn the water off. You see that? You see? But thank goodness the little farmer's reminded me. Yeah. All right. We gotta go cut this water off. You have a good day, buddy. All right. Now, the water's off and I put my bracelet back on there. So that way the next time I cut the water on, I won't forget. Now we can take our eggs to the farm stand. All right. So this is our farm stand. I got a little refrigerator over here that I'm going to put our eggs in. And that way somebody can come on up to our farm stand and get some eggs if they want to. I just love our little farm stand. I got a little farm stand. I got a little farm stand. Thank you. Okay, little farmers. Now it's time to finish our last task for today. And that is it's time to feed these guys over here. The goats that live over here, Mildred our cow, and Jesse the donkey. Now we do these guys a little bit different. Let me show y'all. Since we have so many different animals living in this one area and they all eat different feed, I like to separate them out into these stalls. And this is what a stall is. Hey, Sylvester. I'm gonna show the little farmers what a stall is. This is a stall. It's like a little holding area. The animals can come in and eat in here, sleep in here, get out of the weather. What Mildred's doing. Hey, Mildred. We're fixing to feed you, girl. You all see, Peachy's is already gone to bed. Oh, Peachy. But I use the stalls to separate each animal. And believe it or not, we have trained animals to know which stall is theirs. So they will automatically start going to their spot. And then we can feed them. You see these three barrels right here? One, two, three. Well, these three barrels have three different feeds in them for the three different animals we're fixing to feed. This first barrel is goat feed. The second barrel is donkey feed. And the third barrel is cow feed. First up, let's fill the goats up. The goats get three big scoops. One. Two. And three. Let me show you guys what this goat feed looks like, because this is different than the boys' goat feed. You all see that? That's the girls' goat feed right there. Alright. Next up is Jesse the donkey. And Jesse gets about a little less than half a scoop. And I'll show you what Jesse's feed looks like. Now Jesse's feed is also called an equine feed. And that's another name for a horse. So Jesse is a donkey. And they're very closely related to horses. So Jesse can have horse feed. So this is what Jesse's feed looks like right there. And then the last one we're going to do is Mildred the cow. And Miss Mildred gets one big scoop. And let me show y'all Mildred's feed. It's just like Moo Man's feed that I showed y'all earlier. See there? Moody and Mildred eat the same feed. Which is for cows. Okay. Here we go. We got Mildred the cow ready. We got Jesse the donkey ready. And we got the goats ready. So let me show y'all how well our animals mind and go to the right stall when it's time to eat. First up is Miss Jessie. Hey Mildred. We're going to get you girl. We got to get Jesse first. Jesse is always first. Hey Jesse. Come on Jesse. Come on Jesse. Let's go. Come on. This is Jesse's stall right here. Come on Jesse. Come on. Come on Jesse. Good girl Jesse. Good girl. Good girl. Okay. Miss Jessie's done. Now. Mildred right here. She's next. So let's go get Mildred's food. Which is right here. Okay Mildred. Here we come. Here we come Mildred. Go get in your stall. Go get in your stall Mildred. Go get in your stall. Go. Go get in your stall. Go get in your stall. Good girl Mildred. Good girl. Good girl. There you go Mildred. Alright. Now. It's time for you guys. Y'all ready? Oh right. I know y'all are. Hey Peaches. We didn't mean to. We didn't mean to. To wake you up. But. I got. I got to feed these guys over here. Yeah. But. You going to fix your bed back up. And. Go on back night night. Okay. I got to go get the goats fed. Alright. Here. Comes the goats. Alright goats. Y'all are next. Alright. Goops. Y'all are next. Alright. Alright. So now. all of. The chores and feeding is done. Right. So now. Wow. And I want to thank y'all so much for helping us with this. And I want to thank you all so much for helping us with this. take care of the farm today. Y'all are the best little farmers ever.
