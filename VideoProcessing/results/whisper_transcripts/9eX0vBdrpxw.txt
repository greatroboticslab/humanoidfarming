 I want to share with you five secrets to a great milk supply. If you do these five things, your milk supply will likely be excellent. All right. I don't know if they're actually secrets, but I've organized these into the best things you can do for the best chance you've got. We're specifically talking to working moms in this video because that's who we serve in our coaching program and on this channel largely, but this should be helpful for anyone watching. Milk supply is one of the biggest questions that I get. And I think one of the biggest reasons that working moms reach out for help from us. Everyone wants a solid and predictable milk supply, right? We want that for you too, right? We've worked with over 200 mothers now, transitioning back to work and master their milk supplies within that first year postpartum. If that's interesting to you, or you want some coaching help like that, there's an application down below to fill out, but let's jump in. I want to give you five tips to mastering a good milk supply. Number one is to start early. All right. And I know if you're already a ways in and you weren't able to get started early or in the way that you wanted to, you might feel like you missed the boat here, but no matter where you are starting right now is better than starting three days from now. Okay. So take that with a grain of salt here. The best bet though, for a solid milk supply is that you need to start with frequent milk removal soon after birth. Okay. With a baby or a pump, just start your post-birth hormones will help you out a bit in the beginning. And, but supply and demand is key too. And I think I'll do another video soon talking about your milk supply regulation. We often hear that kind of 12 week mark is where your milk supply regulates and things come out, but you know, whatever, but your hormones are helping you out right after birth. So utilizing that and taking advantage is your best bet to establish a good milk supply. I know it's hard because early postpartum is exhausting. Okay. Birth doesn't always go as planned. And especially if your baby ends up in the NICU or isn't breastfeeding well, it can get really complicated. And the first few weeks though, make such a huge difference in your long-term milk supply. So start expressing milk as early as possible and getting on that schedule using a baby or a pump, whatever meets the goals that you're looking for. Start early. Number two is to express milk. Well, all right. If you're using a baby or a breast pump, you need to remove milk to make more milk. Okay. So whatever you're using needs to be working well to empty that milk. If you leave milk behind, your body will slow down production. And over time, this is what leads to low supply. All right. Cause your body's just trying to do what you tell it. So if your baby is breastfeeding well and eating a lot and removing the milk, your body's going to fill it back up. That's its job. Right. But if something is not right, either with a baby or a pump, whatever you're doing, and milk is being left behind, then your body's going to say, Oh, we don't need that. I'm just going to fill it up. And then we'll slow things down because we're asking for too much. This can be a good thing. This is what prevents you from having an oversupply, right? Which is not always a great thing. It's difficult. Well, I should probably do an oversupply video too, but it's not, it seems like, Oh, we would want extra milk instead of having not enough milk, but an oversupply causes problems too. And biology is designed to just make what your baby needs, right? So if you're exclusively feeding at the breast, if your baby's asking for not as much milk as you have, your body's going to reduce that. And it should, right? All that to say expressing milk well and emptying the breast is really important. Now do not go crazy here and start expressing every drop possible, everything available, catching all the milk that ever comes out. You can drive yourself crazy that way. And that's how we end up seeing some oversupplies that were not intended. And now we have to deal with them on that end. So don't go crazy in this, but it is important that things are working well. If you're exclusively breastfeeding or primarily breastfeeding, and they're not removing milk efficiently, then a visit or two with a lactation consultant is a really, really good idea, right? We have to help the baby learn how to do that. Well, okay, come up with a plan. I'm an IBCLC, but I don't do any of the breastfeeding help. So you find someone local to you or someone virtual, a lot of virtual visits happen now, and make sure you have a plan that we're helping the baby to remove milk efficiently. If you're pumping often, utilizing this tool to empty your breasts effectively is key. It's usually not as simple as like plug and play where you just put the pump on and go and it works. Sometimes when you're really early postpartum, it can be that way because you're just like a milk machine. There's just like milk everywhere. And anything that happens like a wind blowing through can express a bottle of milk, you know, but we find that the longer you go post birth, the harder it gets and the more important correct pumping practices are. So sometimes you can get away with incorrect pumping or like inefficient pumping in the beginning, but pretty quickly you'll start to see that that doesn't work as well as it used to. And that's when we really got to fix what's happening. Ideally, we're doing it right from the beginning. But I do see that pretty often. If you're pumping and you're not removing all the milk that is there, then your body is going to make less milk. Does that make sense? So whatever method you're using to remove milk from your breasts, make sure it's happening effectively. We have a lot of videos on this channel. If you're looking for free help and ideas, you can go down that rabbit hole. We'll put some more down below in the description for you. If you're a career driven working mother who's looking for more of a step by step plan and long term support from an expert. That's what we do in our coaching program. There's a link down below to apply and work with us. But this step is really important. Removing milk well is a key to a good milk supply, however you choose to do that. Okay, number three is to express milk frequently. Okay, this is huge. Removing milk often is essential to creating and maintaining and increasing a milk supply. Timing plays a big role as well. Let's just use pumping as an example here because it becomes a little bit easier because we can schedule it more. But the same thing applies to breastfeeding, although a baby's going to help you out with this part. So if you pump for 150 minutes in a day on average, Kate, that's a random number. Do not marry that number. You will not have the same results if you pump all of those minutes in a row from 8am to 1030am versus eight 20 minute sessions spread throughout a whole 24 hours. Does that make sense? So pumping frequently, I say pumping, I live in the pumping world, expressing milk frequently, whether that's a baby or a pump is really important. Okay, so we've talked about pumping schedules before and finding one that is unique to you is one of my favorite things to do. There's nothing set in stone or a gold standard. I know if you Google pumping schedules, you'll come up with some ideas or just a standard or there's a lot of stuff on Pinterest out there too. But you can actually create a schedule based on your current milk supply, your breast storage capacity, so how much milk your breasts can hold, where you want your milk supply to be, and then whatever barriers you have in your life that are making that hard. So actually, there's a good video, I'll link it down below called how to pump less. And I'm not saying pump less, because obviously this bullet point is to pump frequently. But it talks in there about breast storage capacity and how creating a schedule that works for you is a good idea. And who doesn't want to pump less? If you can, do it. This also includes expressing throughout the night. So in the first several months, whether you're using a baby or a breast pump to empty your breasts, having a really long stretch in the night is probably a bad idea for your long-term milk supply. It might look okay in the moment if you're like, oh, I cut out my night pump and everything's fine. But we have noticed that the earlier you cut out nighttime pumping, the more it affects your long-term milk supply, okay? There are a lot of good things that happen at night. And, you know, feeding a baby at night can be a little bit easier than pumping, I think, especially if breastfeeding is established. So that's what a lot of moms that I work with tend to do is to feed their babies at night. But if you're exclusively pumping, or if pumping seems easier for some reason, just to set a realistic expectation, we're probably not going to be able to cut that out at night very soon if you have long-term breastfeeding goals. I'm sorry. Number four is consistency. Consistency is key, okay? You really don't get to take a break. And I'm really sorry. Don't shoot the messenger, right? I know it's hard. It is hard. It's exhausting caring for your baby, managing your med supply, finding time to shower. And if you also have a job that you're returning to, or you're already back to work, it's a lot. There are a lot of things in life that make consistency really challenging. And especially for working moms who we're kind of talking to in this video here, your schedule is constantly variable. Not only do you have some days working, some days not. So you've got, you know, sometimes weekends are often harder to manage. I don't know. It's just crazy. But then you also have variables during your workday because you probably work for someone. Or even if you own your own business or something like me, sometimes my time is not my time, right? It's taken up by things that need done. And so you're also running on low sleep. If you have other children, I mean, it's just like, and then on top of all that, you've got to like balance all of your brain space and your brain power and managing all of these things. And then also remembering to pump. It's, it's a lot, but consistency is key. If you take a break, and I hear this sometimes, sometimes, right? And again, I'm not here to judge. I get that life is crazy. And if you took a break for whatever reason, sometimes this happens early postpartum when everything is just really overwhelming. Sometimes it's a vacation or a weekend that was really busy or something like that, or just a crazy week at work. If you take a break from expressing milk, your milk supply will decrease. It just will. Your body is designed to do what you tell it to do. So if you tell it that you need less milk by losing that consistency, it will make you less milk. I know it's really hard to push through the tough times. I coach moms through this every day. It's really hard. But if you have long-term breastfeeding goals, you have to do it, or you have to readjust your goals and kind of figure out what is most important to you. And then I really encourage you, I have this conversation a lot, but really just thinking through, are we making a short-term gain for a long-term loss? It's okay to do that. If you're okay with the long-term results, does that make sense? But what I really hate to see is a short-term, like, I'm done. I can't do this. And then a week later, you're like, oh, what was I thinking? I really wanted, I want this. You get back in, but now it's very difficult to, to get back even to where you were. I don't know. It's hard, right? Going back to work, managing a milk supply is complex, not only logistically, but mentally and emotionally as well. Every day can be a roller coaster of new obstacles and emotions. I get it. I've been there. I feel for you, but consistency is key to a good milk supply. Number five is to think big picture. We've already touched on this a little bit, but just make sure that you're not taking that short-term gain for a long-term loss. Early postpartum especially is where this happens a lot. Your milk supply can be really hormonally driven, so it can be tempting to kind of utilize that to skip sessions or to ditch night expressions early, but this will likely hurt you in the long run. If you're on maternity leave, it can also be easy to think you're set for smooth sailing. Things are going well, but by the time many mothers return back to work, it often is the same time that milk supply becomes heavily dependent on supply and demand. I think this is where we see a lot of mothers start struggling with milk supply, especially when we start adding in a new skill like a breast pump and we're relying on a breast pump part of the time to manage our milk supply, particularly when we've been relying heavily on a breastfeeding baby to manage the milk supply on maternity leave. The 12-week maternity leave in the U.S. corresponds very unfortunately with the time that the milk supply starts making that transition. So what I see happen a lot is maternity leave is going fairly smoothly. It always has bumps and ups and downs, right? And then when we go back to work, now our supply is dependent on supply and demand. The breast pump isn't working great and things just kind of becomes a disaster, either very quickly or kind of like a slow and steady decline into the pit of madness and despair. And that's what we don't like. But just think big picture. Prep on your maternity leave for back to work. Do what you can. Build a small freezer stash. It doesn't have to be crazy, but whatever you need to feel comfortable and confident about going back to work, get some help if you need it. Make sure you have a lactation consultant that you're working with. If you need some pumping help and coaching during this first year, transition back and managing your milk supply long term. That's what we do. But make sure that we're thinking big picture and not just in the moment, right? Just because you had one bad day doesn't mean that things are falling off the rails. Just because you had one good day doesn't mean you've solved all your problems. So just have a bigger picture thinking and know kind of the long-term goals. I know it can also be scary. I think I've talked about this in the video before. I know it can be scary to set long-term goals, especially when you're like, I don't know what I'm doing. What if this doesn't happen and I set a goal and now I failed and now I'm going to feel terrible about it. But kind of keeping the long view in mind, knowing that we may adjust and that's totally fine too. It's okay to adjust and life happens. It's okay to let that happen. But having a bigger picture view can be really important too. If you have a career or a job that's really important to you and you're working on a big project and it's being hard to maintain a pumping schedule, let's just throw that scenario out there. Having a big picture thinking is essential for you because it's like, okay, either I need to focus on this big project at work because this is the big picture thing that is going to make me happy in the end. Or do you want to focus on breastfeeding because you know you have these long-term goals and remember the why of why we're doing this. Remembering why this is important to you and to your baby and knowing that this work project will likely be short in the big picture. Does that make sense? And to be honest, it doesn't matter to me. I don't care how long you feed your baby. I don't care, you know, what choices you make that work for you. I only care about that you are making educated decisions and that you have all the information and that you're not making really narrow-minded choices and forgetting the big picture. Especially if you have long-term breastfeeding goals that are really important. It can be so easy to get stuck in your head, especially without some help there. So just to kind of summarize these tips and ideas that we've been talking about. Step one, we really need to understand how milk supply works by starting early, expressing milk effectively, and frequently. That's step number one. That's key. Early, effectively, and frequently. Okay, I think I just covered three points right there in that sentence. Step two for me is really understanding the difference between a baby and a breast pump. I think probably another good topic for a video. I'll put that on my list. But they're not the same. It's two different skills and we need to really understand how milk supply is managed with a baby and how it's managed with a breast pump and the differences there. Okay, because that's going to be important depending on how you choose to express your milk on what things need to be in place so that's working correctly. And then step number three is to adjust accordingly. The only predictable thing in your scenario is that things will likely be unpredictable. And I'm sorry, but it just is what it is. So knowing how to adjust and going with the flow is also how we manage milk supply long term. And not only just managing the amount of milk that we have, but managing our mental health and our anxiety surrounding milk supply. There's another video on milk supply anxiety that was really interesting to explore as well. There's really no secret sauce to having a good milk supply. Okay, I know you probably knew these things, but I hope you had some aha moments or I was able to phrase something in a way that spoke to you and helped you. It's not a secret. Okay, we know how milk supply works. We know what maintains it and what kills it. But I think the hard part is, is when you try and put these really science-based things into your practical life, that can be hard to know how these things are affecting the science of making milk, but also you as a person and your uniqueness and your unique milk supply and then your unique needs of your baby and how you choose to feed your baby. There's a lot of individualistic things that come with this process. So I hope that was helpful to you in figuring out how to establish a good milk supply. If you are a pumping working mom and you want some coaching and long-term help for this, there's an application down below. But good luck pumping. I wish you the best of luck and a milk supply that suits your needs. Happy pumping.
