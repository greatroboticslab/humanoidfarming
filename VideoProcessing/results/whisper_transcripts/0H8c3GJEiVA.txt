Interseeding Vegetables

 Our low single row beds protect the vegetables from a deluge like Tropical Storm Debbie. However, the water rushing down the pathways caused significant washouts and erosion. As soon as the soil dried sufficiently, we cultivated this small patch and interseeded a cover crop to protect the soil. This is what the living mulch looked like five weeks after interseeding. Fortunately, that was the only part of the farm that was not protected when the Tropical Storm hit. The rest of the vegetables were already well established with a single row interseeding of rye in the pathways like you see here. Tropical Storm Debbie dropped five inches or 12 and a half centimeters of rain in three hours. And although the water was pouring off the ends of this field, there were few signs of erosion. The single row interseeding of cereal rye works well with a wide diversity of vegetables. Planted in the summer, this winter grain stays small so it doesn't interfere with air circulation or harvest. And it doesn't compete with soil moisture, which is important for us because we do not have irrigation. We interseeded these fall vegetables three weeks after transplanting the brassicas, with the exception of the bare soil to the left, reserved for the last vegetables of the growing season. In this case, we formed the beds, interseeded, and planted the same day. Interseeding is just a matter of pushing the walk behind cedar down the loosened soil in the pathways. For vegetables planted during the heat of the summer, we like to form the beds well ahead of time to conserve soil moisture. However, this leaves the pathways vulnerable to erosion for a long period of time. So we've started interseeding these beds just as soon as we make them. Interseeding protected the pathways from the tropical storm. We use this old pull-type rotary hoe to loosen the rain-packed soil. Lightly tilling the bedtops is important for planting the vegetables as well as conserving soil moisture. For direct seeded crops, we use this setup to re-firm the bedtops and mark a row for the seeder. For our relatively low weed pressure situation, we have found that two 12-inch or 30-centimeter sweeps set flat work pretty well for cultivating. We should point out that when cereal rye is interseeded in the summer, it often will turn brown like this by the end of the growing season and die out over winter. This is simply due to old age or developing rust. And it's a little hard to see here, but we have seeded hairy vetch with the rye, which will survive the winter. We also use the sweeps for cultivating vegetables interseeded with a single row of hairy vetch. We love how this green mat of vetch protects the soil, but sometimes the vines need to be trimmed back. And the nutrient-rich moist conditions under this living mulch can stimulate weeds to grow. This is what it looked like before cultivating with the sweeps in the weediest part of this field. This is what it looked like after cultivation. Note that these weeds would not be competitive with the crop. We did not want to let them go to seed, which is an important part of our weed management. These carrots, interseeded with rye, did not require cultivation or hand weeding due to the low weed pressure achieved with the practices described in our video titled, Weed the Soil, Not the Crop. If weed pressure is moderate, more sophisticated cultivation systems would be required, and we would not recommend interseeding if weed pressure is high. For potatoes, we interseed right after hilling using a mix of rye and sorghum sudangrass. The rye and sorghum sudangrass protected the erosion-prone valleys from tropical storm Debbie. The sorghum sudangrass produced a lot of biomass, which we rolled down with this fork art. It may not look pretty, but rolling the sorghum sudangrass made it possible to proceed with harvest as usual. We can also interseed sorghum sudangrass between short-term crops like lettuce. However, this would not work well when the lettuce is interplanted between long-term crops like these brassicas. In this case, we stick with our old standby, interseeding with a single row of rye. Removing the lettuce opens up these nice harvest lanes for accessing the broccoli, cabbage, collards, and kale. And alternating rows like this between long-term crops and short-term ones improves air circulation, reducing disease in the brassicas. We want to thank everyone for your encouraging comments. They gave us the incentive to document our interseeding system before winding down our market garden of 43 years.
