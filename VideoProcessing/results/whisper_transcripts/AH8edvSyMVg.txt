 Did you know South Africa is the number one producers and exporters of apples in the whole continent of Africa? Every year, South Africa produces close to a million metric tons of apples, of which roughly 50% get shipped across the globe, from Europe to the Middle East. Now the interesting part. 80% of all that exporting and production numbers come from just one province, the Western Cape. In this video, we'll live in the city life behind and venture deep into this beautiful province, which is also known as the fruit capital of South Africa. We'll discover how a small yet mighty town within a large, fatter valley of abundance is transforming apples into liquid gold and meet a leading company that's at the forefront of future innovations in the world of apples. Hello, hoi emidak and welcome to Sirius. Sirius. Named after the Roman goddess of agriculture, Sirius has a population of just over 30 towns and people and apple farming is the major occupation of its locals. Why, you may ask? The town benefits from mountain-fed water, fatter soil and the climate that is ideal for food growing. As a result, some of the biggest food producers, like Sirius food growers, two-a-day and colourful, call this beautiful valley home. Hi, welcome to Luxonia Cider. How do you guys live in a paradise like this? I need someone to explain. Because this is like... Break-taking. Like, nah, nah. I feel like you guys just put us on the other side of the chaos and you choose the pain. I beg your pardon, but you guys there in Cape Town made Cape Town full and then we had to... Yes. We... you guys pushed us... While the drive from Cape Town to Sirius is an experience itself, I have to admit, before this trip, I wasn't a cider fan at all. How will all of this turn out? Well, let's both find out and learn more about apples and cider making from Lisa. Have you had our cider before? No. No. You have not had stone fruit? No. No. No. I'm going to blow your mind. Thank you for having us. It's a big pleasure. I know. To sit here and actually just take in the clean air and the space and the green and the mountains, the birds. This is really beautiful. Just chirping away every now and then you can hear a horse just... Oh my dear. It is lovely. It really is. It's relaxing. This is beautiful. I'm glad that you're a chef because... People don't understand... Cider culture in South Africa is very young. And you have no idea of the limitless opportunities that cider has. Nice. I have used it in soup. I have used it in dessert. I have used it for rib basting, for gammon basting. I've used it in spaghetti bolognese and I'm Italian and my grandmother is going to turn over in her grave. But I have done it. Yeah. So it is all... The possibilities are really endless. Endless. Yeah. Like anything. How do you sell a meal if you don't know what it tastes like? So in order to be able to sell something you have to be able to experience it. Oh, we could all sell something that we haven't experienced. Experience, yeah. But once you've experienced it, you can sell it with passion. It's passion that sells things. It's passion that drove this project in the first place. Yeah. So the Whitfield family have actually had 30 years experience in fruit cultivation and export. And Ali actually decided and persuaded her father that we have to try and make cider. And that's his daughter. So this was her initiative to start off with. And that's how she managed to make two old businesses. So yes, there was export of apples and production of apples. But then we started making cider and it wasn't that easy in the beginning. But once the first cider hit the shelves, everything just snowballed. And now we have eight varieties of cider and a beautiful world supreme champion, MTC. Whoa. So I absolutely love the MTC. But the cider, that's phenomenal. And we're gluten-free. We're vegan-friendly. So our philosophy is orchard to bottle. And that's because it's the shortest route from the orchard to the bottle. We grow the apples here. And from here, February to May, that is when we harvest. It goes to the pack shed. We decide which is for export and which is for cider. It comes down to us. We crush and press the entire apple with the bukho press. And that's how we maximize our profile of taste and aroma. Whoa. From the press, the juice goes directly into those large tanks over there that you can see through the window. They're 50,000 meters each. Fermentation takes between two to three weeks. Yeah. And then we blend right before we bottle. So it's a very quick process. Whoa. Yeah. So one wouldn't, like, I wouldn't think it's that quick. It is. Because the harvest season is quite short. The processing time is also very short. The whole, how do I say, um, an apple, if kept in the right conditions, like refrigerated, Yeah. It can last really, really long. I mean, January, you're usually buying last year's apples. Yeah. But we wouldn't know that though. No, you wouldn't. We wouldn't know. You wouldn't. But, uh, that's also what makes it great. Is the fact that we're also the only 100% true apple cidery in South Africa. So we have, we work with apple juice, freshly pressed apple juice. Um, this first one over here is Crispy Apple. Crispy Apple is our first born. It's our flagship. It's crisp green apples, crunchy pink lady, very apple forward and refreshing. It stands at 5% alcohol. In fact, they're all 5% except for this pink one, which we'll still get to. Please, it's an interactive game. So smell it. Smells like granny smells. Yeah. And it smells fresh. Okay, smell it. Come on. That would be that one over there. Okay. Give you a scorecard because if I'm finished with a tasting or if an ambassador's finished with a tasting and they get up and they leave, how must you remember which was which? But isn't it beautiful? It's the driest one in our range too. Are you serious? Yeah. So if you're telling me this is the driest one, then you're walking my way up. I can only imagine. You think, you think, you know how many people I've actually had sit here and say, well, if this is the driest one, I'm probably not going to like the rest because I don't like sweet things and they get blown away. No. Not me. I'm not one of those people. I think I know. Well, you clearly are someone who likes to experiment with your palate because otherwise you wouldn't be touring around. Definitely. Thank you. Whoa. But now wait. Are you serious? Like I should just slow my roll? Yeah. The next. No, please. Sorry, but I need to taste again. Okay, but don't finish it because that way when we're done, you can go back and make an informed decision. And it's so fresh. It is sweet. I love the fact that you can actually smell the gramecin about here on the nose. It really just makes for that fresh cider experience, a true cider experience. Wow. Okay, let's move on. Okay. Sparkling apple. Number two. Sparkling apple is our Prosecco-styled cider. Fruity, sparkling Italian wine. Yeah. Prosecco-styled, obviously. So when you smell it, it smells like a golden delicious apple. Go for it. I dare you. Tell me I'm wrong. Whoa. Okay, now this is very different from that one also. It is carbonated at a much lower temperature than any of our other ciders. And that is what creates fine bubbles, giving you a similar mouthfeel to champagne. Okay. Now bro, if I don't go back home after all of this, yeah, I'm sure I would understand why. This is what in the world? It's delicious, isn't it? It's one of my favorites. I have two favorites, that one. And we'll get to the other one. Okay. Lovely, hey? This is going to be a difficult one. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, I think it's... Why choose? I think it's going to be a difficult one because they all... Oh. I can... I'm going to run through the ciders and then I'll go back and I'll tell you what I've used them for. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I like that. All right. Next one is African Sundowner. We wanted to make a cider that's iconically African. It's not much more iconically African than the Baobab tree. Okay. Because it is known as the tree of life. Baobabs are full of antioxidants. In fact, that entire tree which can become thousands of years old has got so many functions. It's got so much life. The fruit is full of antioxidants. The bark gets used for creatures to live in and it's just... It is just a beautiful tree. And the Baobab that is blended with our Sundowner cider that has been fermented creates a very well-rounded cider. It's not too sweet. It's not too apple-y and it has a beautiful earthy finish. It's not too much. It's not too much. I get very excited about it. Okay. I can already... Like it smells different from this. Yes. Guys, come on. I'm just going to use this because the wind tends to grab the glasses. Okay. It's going to be a difficult one for me. I know why I'm saying this. Why? Because I feel like this already gave me a strong start and now it seems like everything else is just getting better. And now I don't know... The beauty about having such a big range... There's two beauties. Okay. Firstly, is there's something there for everyone's palate. Okay. And secondly, why should you need to choose? I agree. It's not a marriage. It's a drink. And there's something there for every kind of event. I like that. A nice hot day. Hmm. An occasion. A sundowner. Something sweet. Something fruity. Something original. Something sexy. Why would you choose? Wow. Why would you choose? Wow. I like the way it's just been categorized like it... Like, I feel like you're just giving me that narratives. It's religious to put it in front of me in that same way. Because... Wait till I start speaking about food. I'm going to blow your mind. Okay, let's go. Right. Next one. Blush. Okay. The lockdown brainchild. South Africa was hard for the whole country. Yeah. The lockdown in South Africa, it was painful. However, we weren't allowed to sell cider, but we were allowed to work on new recipes. And that's what we came up with. Created something new. Exactly. It got its name from that beautiful pink hue. Smells sweet and intoxicating. Doesn't taste as sweet as what you think it's going to be. And it has a lasting pomegranate aftertaste. I'm a sucker for anything pomegranate. It's like... It's like... It's like... This is there. Oh, I see what you guys are doing. Mmm. I get you. Now I see. Tell me what. It's like... This to this side. This to this side. But this one in the middle. Like this gives me a different aroma from these three. So I see that. Now we're going more into the blends. I see that. And I appreciate that actually. It's nice to see. I love the colors. I love the colors. Like I'm just here. Amazed. Can you see the... I told Buzz. I want a blue one. If I'll be honest, it blends very well. And I'm going to be genuinely honest when I say I love this. I still need to know how you guys came up with this concept. Yeah, you told me the daughter. Let's break away. Do something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I want to know what drove that initiative. The fact that they actually have the apples to begin with. So why not experiment? She's lovely. And I don't think the boss sleeps. He's always just coming up with new ideas. That's good. He's got such a busy mind. That's good. I like creative minds. If he goes overseas, he always comes back with ideas. Yeah, that's good. Whether it's marketing ideas or labeling ideas. That's good. A new initiative to implement within the side. That's good. Something new to experiment with. And that is progress. That's good. If we're not going to play, how can we feel fulfilled? That's good. If everything's going to stagnate, if we're not going to try. And progress is life, really. That's good. That's good. See, now, I don't know, but I feel like I'm almost drinking this all of it. Because I genuinely love the taste. I'm going to try to get a taste. Okay. I'm going to come back to it. Right. Guys. I'm going to try to get a taste. I'm going to try to get a taste. I'm going to try to get a taste. Stone fruit is our best cider. Stone fruit are your single-pit fruits. Peaches, nectarines. That smells like a naughty peach iced tea. But this is where the cider maker has to understand how to hero the apple cider while still bringing in the aroma of the blend. Oh, look at that face. I saw that. You were in love there for a while. Can I show you a trick? Show me. Hold your gloves. Put it directly against your lips and under your nose. And breathe in. You smell peaches? I do. Okay. Put your nose inside the glass and you'll smell nectarines. Are you serious now? Okay, now, how did you do that? I'm a magician. Who figured this out? The boss. The boss. I told you he doesn't sleep. This is like pure peach. Whoa. Guys. Yeah, that's my party trick. I love that. That's a unique experience. It is. Speaking of unique, the next one is pale amber. Okay. Pale amber is extremely unique. And a brain tease. Very high tannins. Okay. Let me hear it. So, this is our version of a beer stout style. It's obviously sweeter than a beer stout. Because it's made from apple. But like I said, it's a brain tease. So, on the nose, because the nose and the palate is different. Yeah. On the nose, coffee and toffee. Okay. Yeah, that's true. On the palate, smoky burnt caramel with an apple finish. Okay. How does it have a plane? It's almost like a mind game going on bro. Like, like, like, I like that. Science and magic is perfect. And that's why it is important to show the public that we need to to be able to make it to a bottle. And also, to be able to... We need to... ...wisen up with cider. Mmm. Cider culture is young in South Africa. You can't buy this and drink it out of a bottle. You need to drink it out of a glass. Because it's about pouring the cider, the oxygenation. Getting the bubbles going. And you just see. Yes. And then, being able to appreciate the colour. Yeah. It's that beautiful amber hue. You wouldn't see it in a bottle this same way. No, you wouldn't. The smell and the taste that is different from one another. You can't experience all the glory of cider if it's just being... opening the bottle and drinking it out of the bottle. So, is it right to say there is a huge misconception around ciders? Yes. 100%. Yes. And the versatility of it. Off-side. Yeah, you said so. In terms of... Okay. Yeah. That's also true. I mean, doesn't this just make you think poor? Wow. Pure garment. Mm-hmm. Exactly. Um... You're very correct. I know. I am. I'm always right. Ask my husband. You're very correct. Like, no second guessing. Like... Yeah. Yeah. Pure garment. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ooh. Okay. Well, the good thing is I just discovered something new now because I didn't know we can enjoy ciders this way. way this is what my journey is about like learning something new exposing people to something new because you said something so brilliant like we just buy open drink from the bottle but if you put it this way i promise you you want to sip and experience you know each and every glass you take and just enjoy absolutely wow the last one in our alcoholic range is our cherry apple cider so our cherry apple cider we actually call affectionately the syrus and white syrus is very well known for cherries and the apples it just makes sense to combine the two you've got that vibrant red and the sour profile of the cherry yeah combined with the sweetness of the apple it gives you a sweet sour cider sweet sour cider yes which quite frankly to me tastes like cherry fist pop lollipop whoa oh okay okay you know i don't know so much about cider making i'm not gonna lie like i want to be as genuine as i can but i i do feel like there is a whole lot of creativity that goes around this thing because we can again excuse me we can easily like just get confused or mix the actual um it's like there's a message you're trying to send across and you can easily miss it because you just assume oh they all look the same you know what but now this ain't the same with this so this comes from creativity and a lot of people actually say they like the pink one and then they said no but it's not this one it was then i said okay well is it the pink one or the red one oh the red one you see there's a difference because the pink is pomegranate and the red is the cherry although ultimately everything is out there that's the base now getting back to the food okay okay it's a marinade for the ribs it is really good nice sweet nice sweet tangy ribs just people man how do you guys come up with this creativity i feel like i'm okay okay now like it's it's gonna be difficult for me to tell people about this though like i think i feel like you see i spa tops checkers liquor you can pay liquor wool words it come in the can or just butter okay so it's not them but now like here are my scores i'm just showing you wow i've used sundowner in also in soup i used it in a beef and vegetable soup that i serve here for the record is it in winter yes this isn't a match you don't have it yeah you said so and you you you made it very clear and i'm hoping everyone watching this can also get that concept because it's not for anyone to choose it's really to find what suits your mood your style and go for it and whatever mood you're in pretty much it shows there is a variety that can cater for that mood let's say starting to plant the seed of an apple to invest in like um ideally how how long actually i can help you with that my parents are fruit and my family is fruit tree nurserymen so in town there is uh exclusive fruit tree nursery but there are quite a couple obviously within the country where they will grow either an apple tree from an apple seed or from a root stock so then they will graft graft a certain variety of apple tree onto a root stock yeah um and there are certain times in the year it's generally just after winter okay sorry then what they do is they will um um it's then it's tree planting time for the farmers and for the nurseryman it would be um tree taking out time yeah for lack of a better word um and so that's that's what happens so the the farmer will buy they will buy on large scale on wholesale obviously on contract your certain variety of tree they will plant it on the farm and then obviously it takes a few years before they have a harvest from it and then they have to nurture it and care for it and grow it up to a certain age and then it will start producing food wow it's easy for me to walk past this thing in the shop but now understanding what goes where it comes from what goes into making this it just helps me appreciate it more every year they have to prune the trees and not only you know what it's it's so much bigger than that because of um the the work that becomes available on the farm for other people because you need teams to true true teams to be able to harvest you need irrigation teams you need all sorts of teams and that's not necessarily the people that are living on the farm so then we get other people that come and work other workers to come and do these these jobs so it is actually such a big creation of work opportunities opportunities for for more than just people that are in our town it is actually an intensive thing and it is climate related and weather and everything so it is it is a big thing wow people tend to think milk comes from a carton but they forget milk comes from a cow yeah same with an apple it doesn't come from pecan pay it comes from a farm and there's a lot that goes into making it that's true wow let's say the um you guys do um international export i believe we we all have started with that yes okay um but nationwide you deliver like you ship around the country and we have online orders as well so it's not just in stores it's also online online um like at an average just give give people an idea this would obviously make people understand when how you guys are able to make a variety like this like in terms of um production how much um apples do you guys invest um let's say yearly um we lost donia is not the same company anymore as the farm yeah um it was actually sold this year okay but gosh on average will it help if i tell you that we pressed 180 bins wooden bins of apples wow 180 yeah yeah so you guys have wow and you guys are open to the public to come do tasting enjoy wednesdays or sundays understanding the struggles about everything because life is beautiful but there's struggles sometimes understanding the struggles help us under um appreciate you know the beauty like i said me just coming here and seeing this like i'm blown away um if there's just one struggle or two struggles that really come with you know having such um a beautiful place a collection or a variety what would it be the summers are blistering hot um over 40 degrees the winters are exceptionally cold and wet we've had floods here that you couldn't see the lawn whoa serious yes that you couldn't see a paddock serious the last winter the marquee blew off wow no uh the climate climate factor is very extreme so we've got in the 40s and minus degrees in the winter we're in a valley so all the mountains are snow-capped yeah in winter other than that the biggest challenge for us would probably to remain true to our roots honesty reliability trustworthy and to stay true to our initial plan with our cider where we're we're we're vegan friendly we're gluten free we're very much for sustainability yeah um i run the garden the garden is all plant life from our area so that we can try and and keep the animal life that belongs here to remain here our apple pulp yeah is expelled after our pressing yeah we have a specialized apple apple compost heap oh where the tractor takes it to and then once that's finished composting it goes back into the orchard oh as well as we try and stay away from plastic as far as we can with our packaging and our bottling so that we can try and keep our carbon footprint as small as possible okay sustainability is it's huge for you guys very very big for us our entire cidery is run on solar oh nice and then the roof is actually built at a at a at a slant so that on the other side you can it's obviously more noticeable the entire roof is is full of solar panels wow so we try really to be as kind to the environment as what we possibly can because after all when what are we leaving behind for our children what mess are we leaving behind what beauty are we leaving behind that is yeah it's up to us to really decide and this is now like the time we have to decide it's now it's now it's right now well thank you so much um again saying um yeah you said i was going to be blown away but i don't think i i was setting myself up for this i'm amazed like um i'm grateful that you were here i'm grateful i'm grateful that i am able to make an impact on you with regards to our product thank you so much
