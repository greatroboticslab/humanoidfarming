 And I'll run into people that had no idea I played with the group of Alabama. And I don't tell them. So by the time 88 rolled around, a friend of mine from New Zealand came through and kind of showed me pictures of them rotational grazing. And I just thought this makes sense. Then we realized that we didn't have the genetics it took to actually perform in that kind of operation. Amp grazing, especially in the hot south, needed a whole new breed of animal. Low to the ground to do great on grass and light colored to beat the heat. Teddy was front and center in breeding this new line of cattle called the South Pole. We now have close to 100 breeders across the United States that have South Poles. Teddy's cousin Randy lived right next door where he ran a conventional grazing operation. Do you think we'll see a difference between your cousin's side and your side? I don't have no preconceived opinion. I shouldn't have. It is what it is, and I'll accept that.
