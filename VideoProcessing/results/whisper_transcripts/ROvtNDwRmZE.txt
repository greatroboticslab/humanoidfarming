 Conservation Reserve Program or CRP is where the federal government, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, pays a landowner to basically, over a term of years, 10-15 years, to retire that cropland and plant it back to grass. It started out as price control, like we had a glut of grain on the market, and it was a way to take those more marginal cropland acres out of production so that then the commodity prices, the crop prices, would actually respond to that and go up. How much did they pay? So back then it was about $30 an acre, and the land value was about $300 an acre, so about 10% of the land value per year. So over a 10-year period, basically, you could basically pay for your land. That's a really important point there. And it had a huge enrollment. I mean, that really took off. It changed the prairie chicken population. It changed the mule deer population. I mean, it was a really big deal.
