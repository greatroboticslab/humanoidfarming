 Maya farmers began working in the fields as soon as it started to get light. It was important to do as much work as possible before noon, when it could get very hot. When they arrived home in the early afternoon, they would always take a well-deserved bath. In the evenings, a farmer spent time with his family and took care of his handmade stone tools. There were no metal or mechanical tools. Everything was done by hand. It was hard work, but the Maya were very good farmers. They used maths, star charts, and weather predictions to plan where to plant and harvest their crops. The Maya had three main farming methods. Raised fields were best in places where the ground was wet and boggy. Farmers dug canals and piled up the soil to make raised fields where they could plant their crops. Terrace farming made it easier to farm in mountainous regions. It also increased the amount of land available to grow crops. Farmers built walls along the mountainside, each one further up than the next. Then they flattened off the earth to create huge steps of farmland called terraces. Slash and burn, or shifting, was the technique used to clear space for new crops. Farmers chopped and burnt down sections of the rainforest. The leftover ash was high in nutrients and crops grew well for a while. When the nutrients ran out, farmers moved on to another patch of rainforest and let the old patch regrow. Most farmers had their own fields where they grew crops such as maize, beans, chile, and squash. Extra food was stored in local warehouses. The farmer's wife took surplus crops to the market to trade for other goods. Some of the surplus was given to the poor. Some of the surplus was given to the poor. Thank you.
