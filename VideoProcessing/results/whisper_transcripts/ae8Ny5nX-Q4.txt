 With a new baler and dry hay, keep the density pressure set at 50% or below for the first 100 bales. Reduce pressure only if friction from the sidewall or clutch slippage is excessive. Check density pressure after the first 10 bales and adjust for desired bale density. To set the bale density on the Atlas or Atlas Pro control system, touch the bale setup icon to access the bale setup screen. Touch the minus or plus icons to adjust the bale density setting. Touch the back arrow soft key or the home icon to save settings and return to the previous screen.
