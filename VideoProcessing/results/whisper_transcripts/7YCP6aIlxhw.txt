 Welcome everybody and in 2D's video I will be showing you how to get summer coins really really quickly in Growl Garden. So if you want to get yourself summer coins really quickly I will be showing you the new best method to get summer coins really quickly. So this is pretty much guys what you want to go ahead and do to get summer coins the fastest way possible. Before we do get started guys make sure you like and subscribe to my channel because in 2D's video I'm going to be giving you any fruit any pet what you want. If you want to get yourself the exotic summer seed pack if you want to get yourself the summer seed pack whatever you want whatever pet you want the raccoon comment what you want and I'll give it to you for free. Even the Fennec Fox which is going to be the new pet what we've gotten but update. Okay comma 1 is what you want and I'll give it to you for completely free but anyway let's get started by showing you the best way to get summer coins in the new update. Because this method is actually going to be absolutely insane and please watch all the way through because you'll be getting prismatic rewards like it's nothing. So let me tell you why. So the new pet what we need to get guys for this method is the Aluxalittle. The Aluxalittle is the new pet from the Oasis Egg. There's a 7% chance that summer type fruits will stay after collecting. You know what that means. So if you are taking part of the summer harvest event what will basically happen whenever you harvest a summer type fruit it will stay after collecting allowing you to duplicate. So there's going to be almost a 10% chance that the Aluxalittle will duplicate summer fruits. That is going to be extremely high especially if you are harvesting a ton of small fruits like the strawberry. The best method for getting harvest points really quickly right now is the tomato, the blueberry as well as the strawberry. So what you want to do guys is get the Aluxalittle pet. The more of these pets you get the better because if you do get a whole team of these. If you get 8 out of 8 Aluxalittle pets there's going to be almost like a 70 to 80% chance that summer type fruits will stay after harvesting. Allowing you to get unlimited summer harvest points. Like I'm not even joking but it's absolutely broken. So then if you harvest like this every time you harvest one there's an 80% chance it will duplicate. There's almost a 100% chance it will duplicate over and over again and then all you need to do is put all of those points guys into the summer harvest and you'll get a ton of points like it's nothing. So I'm going to be giving it a try guys in today's video and yeah I'll show you guys how much points we get and I'll show you how much summer coins we get by doing this method. There's also going to be a mega harvest event that will give you double summer harvest points. So there's actually going to be a brand new weather guys which is called the mega harvest event. By taking part in this weather you'll be able to get yourself double summer harvest points quicker than usual so it's going to be very OP. There's also going to be something called the mega summer harvest. Whenever this event does start guys you'll be given 2 times more than normal amount of summer points. Allowing you to get yourself even more summer coins. So make sure that you guys are taking part in the summer points event. It's going to be called the mega harvest event. Whenever a mega harvest event does start hop in the game and then you'll be getting yourself double summer points which is going to be very OP. Summer fruit event has now started so what I can actually go ahead and do is get as many points as I possibly can to prove to you guys that we can easily get prismatics. So unfortunately we don't have the mega summer harvest that will give us double points unfortunately. But what we can actually still do is harvest all of the berries that we've got as strawberries or blueberries like this. And as you guys can obviously see we can go ahead and just get a ton of points. So I'm going to try and get prismatic rewards guys to see how much summer coins you get for prismatic. But yeah the best method to get summer points quickly is by doing the method that I'm showing you right now. So I did just put all of these points in. I got 353 guys which is unreal. So just to let you guys know as well. So I'm currently doing this. I don't really have a lot of strawberries in my garden. And tomatoes and blueberries. And if I'm going to be honest with you. I'm still getting quite a lot of points guys. Not going to lie. Guys know I'm doing this solo as well. I've got 2000 points. I mean I don't really have a lot of summer fruits in my garden. But I still got rare rewards. If I was in the mega harvest event. You'll be getting double that. So 4000. So whenever it's a mega harvest. Make sure you go crazy. And if I got the aluxa little pet right now. Which I don't have in my garden. I will be getting even more summer harvest points. If you guys don't know as well. You can also stack seeds in top of each other. If you know what I mean. So it's best to explain like this. So if I do go ahead guys. And get myself a seed. So let me just look through all of the seeds that I've got. So I've got 100 kiwi seeds. I'm just going to do it with a carrot seed. So a lot of you guys don't know this. But what I'm going to do right now. Is turn off my wi-fi. And I'm going to turn it back on right. So I'm going to disconnect from my wi-fi. Now I'm going to wait a few seconds. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. And I'm going to reconnect. I'm going to place down all of the seeds right here. And as you can see they're stacked on top of each other. So if I do water this now. This can be your strawberry seeds. Your tomato seeds. They're stacked all on top of each other. You can do that by disconnecting your wi-fi. And get an auto clicker. And it will stack them on top of each other. To save you a ton of space. Very sorry. But I honestly can get a lot more points than this. But unfortunately I'm literally on the pet server. I don't really have a lot of seeds guys. But I'm just explaining you the method. What you can do. Which is literally going to be matter. I showed you guys a mega harvest event. I even showed you guys pretty much the best method. So the best method. Is get yourself strawberry seeds. Blueberry seeds. Tomato seeds. That always aren't stuck in the seed shop. So you want to do this with all seeds. So those three seeds. What you can see. The strawberry seed. The blueberry seed. As well as the tomato seed. You want to do that method. Do the stack method. By turning off your wifi. Get the unlocks a little pet. And as long as you do that. You'll be getting these points. Like it's nothing guys. As long as you harvest them really really quickly. You can literally get yourself a ton of points. But unfortunately. I'm doing it solo. This method is going to be good solo as well. But I'm literally on the test server right now. So unfortunately. It's not going to work best for me. But the summer harvest does end really really soon. The more points you get. The more summer coins you get. Just so that you guys know as well. So it does end in a few seconds. If I'm going to be honest with you. Let's see how many summer coins we get. Guys. We've only got two summer coins this time. But you still get something. The more. Let's just say guys. The more harvest points you get. The more summer coins you get. If you do the method that I showed you. You'll be getting more harvest points. Unfortunately. I didn't get a lot there. If you do the method that I told you. You will be getting a lot more than what I just got. And yeah. Hopefully this video helped you out. And peace out. Let's listen to the method.
