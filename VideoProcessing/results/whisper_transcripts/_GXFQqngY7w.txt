 Demeter is the goddess of the harvest in Greek mythology. She was part of the first generation of Olympian gods, the sons of the Titans Kronos and Rhea. Among all the Olympian gods, Demeter and Hestia were considered the kindest and most benevolent goddesses. As the goddess of soil fertility, she was particularly worshipped by farmers. Without her blessings, the land would be as barren as the desert. Demeter particularly favored those who produced grain, whose wheat was consecrated to the goddess. The ear of wheat is one of her symbols. Fruits and cereals were offered on the altars, where sacrifices were made in her honor. Demeter has some children. One is Pluto, the god of abundance. The goddess was chased by Poseidon, who wished to be with her. The goddess became a mare in an attempt to dodge the god. But Poseidon turned himself into a stallion and possessed the goddess. From this union, the legendary black horse Arian was born, as well as Desponia, the goddess of winter. But the most famous descendant of Demeter is Persephone, the fruit of the union between her and Zeus. Persephone, the goddess of spring, was Demeter's favorite daughter. When Hades, the lord of the underworld, abducted Persephone, Demeter wandered the world looking for her beloved daughter. The goddess started to neglect her tasks, the soil became infertile, and the world was desolated by winter. After finding out that she had been abducted by the god of the underworld, the goddess threatened to make the world infertile forever, if her daughter were not to return. But the bond between Hades and Persephone could no longer be broken. With the gods intervening, it was agreed that Persephone would spend part of the year with Hades, and part with Demeter. Whenever Persephone re-encountered her mother, the flowers started to grow and the soil became fertile, but when she returned to Hades, her mother fell into dismay and the world became cold and infertile again. This well-known myth was used by the Greeks to explain the seasons and the Eleusinian mysteries, ancient rites of initiation, symbolizing the endless cycles of death and rebirth. The goddess is also quite important in the story of Erisicton. The man who dared to cut down the goddess' consecrated forest was cursed for his acts. Demeter forced that man, who boasted an unreasonable ambition to be consumed by an endless hunger. His condition would lead to his ruin. The goddess of agriculture was venerated throughout Greece, since, according to the myths, she was the one who taught men to sow and cultivate, so they learned to settle, abandoning their nomadic origins. For this reason, Demeter had a decisive role in the appearance of the first cities. In the arts, the goddess is often depicted holding ears of wheat and narcissists. In the arts, she also holds a torch, which she used in her quest for Persephone. In Rome, Demeter was known as Ceres, the goddess of cereals. The goddess Demeter had an important role in the unfurling of Greek society, and her benevolence towards humanity made her one of the most beloved goddesses in Greek mythology.
