 Here come the worms. One thing affects another thing. Alright, let's go. Welcome back to the channel guys. We are back on the farm. Finally. Back to making videos for y'all. It is July the 6th. And I hope everybody enjoyed their fourth vacations or whatever you did. It was really nice on our end. And now we are getting back after it. We've got a tropical storm coming up through Florida right now. And it's going to turn and kind of go up the east coast. Kind of on the Georgia side. We're expected to get some rain today, tomorrow, and the next day. I don't think it's going to be a lot of rain. But it's a good chance every day. As you can see outside it's already overcast. But what we got going on today. We got Mark and James are putting the row crop fenders on my row gator. We'll get some video of that. Of them putting it on. Josh is spraying actually over in the valley. I know it's not the best time to spray. But I think we got a couple hour window of no rain right now. So anyway he's doing some spraying on the beans. Dad's in a meeting. Wayne's cutting grass. And I've actually been riding around with Ron from BH Genetics. He came over here this morning. We went and looked at some of the corn. He's got some of their varieties. And also that is where I get all the Panergetic. The deer deterrent that I've been telling you all about. And we went and looked at some soybeans over there where I had it out. And I saw some really good stuff. I did not have my GoPro. So I'm going to run back over there at some point today. And y'all will get to see that footage too. For anybody that's interested. But right now we're going to go over there to James and Mark. And see if we can help putting fenders on the Rogator. And then we're going to get on to some other stuff today. So y'all come along and we'll see what we can get done. So y'all come along and we'll see what we can get done. So y'all come along and we'll see what we can get done. Let's go. I'll show you what Mark and James are putting on in the time-lapse. this is the crop shields crop vendors crop shields whatever you want to call it um this i bought these whenever i bought the rogator i went ahead and just bit the bullet and bought these crop shields and um they were really expensive i mean like don't quote me but i think like fifteen thousand dollars for these four and um anyway i'm glad i bought them because they are they really help if you're going to be going through those crops late in the season um has minimal crop damage when you go through there believe it or not i was very impressed you couldn't even tell that i had been through there with the rogator in cotton you know this tall um what these fenders do is you just imagine the crop right here you'll have a row on this side and a row on this side and so when it crop goes through here where it's over at the middles it just hits the spender and follows this and then just fluffs out like that when i'm going through there at like 12 miles an hour or whatever because i don't go quite as fast um when that front tire goes through there it actually opens up the in between the rows and by the time this second wheel right here hits uh the crop has not even folded back so it kind of hits about right here so pretty neat how it just moves it out of the way and then this back tire goes by it and just closes back up but that's what they were putting on it uh doesn't look like much but it takes a while because you have to take off a lot of brackets and stuff um what's really hard is you have to hold it up the easiest way i figured out how to put these things on is actually james figured it out but he hangs a uh motorcycle strap ratchet strap right here well right here and he hooks it to this frame anyway that helps hold it up well you don't have to have two people on each side holding it up and then he puts a jack under here and uh uses the floor jack to kind of level the front or whatever um and then it just bolts on right here and then you just got a bearing right here you got to make sure it doesn't go out but that's basically it like i said it doesn't look like much but it really works good if you're gonna go through those crops because if i didn't have these on it would break off all the limbs on each of those rows uh all the way down the field anyway i have not had to put them on james and mark have learned how to do it and so i just let them do it every time they help me out big time okay we're out here in one of the soybean fields that i did a video on where i put the panergetic and i got off the rogator and showed y'all some of the damage well we're in that same field but what i found in this field which is pretty cool um we're going on day 22 since i've put out the panergetic and we've had i know we've had three inches of rain on it may have had four inches but um anyway 22 days possibly three to four inches of rain and uh what we found in this field is pretty cool which i'll show y'all you'll see the old damage and then you'll see all this new growth where they have left it alone and i'll show you like right here where the deer they walk through the field and you'll see tracks like that where they walk down the road but they did not eat the soybeans uh which is kind of crazy but uh let's get into the damage okay like right here you'll see where they have bitten off some of the stems a long time ago and then we've had all this new growth after i put the uh panergetic out and uh you'll see right here that's where they've bitten it off a long time ago and then i've had new growth from here all the way up and and you can go down the row and you can find it this is where they ate 22 days ago right there down toward the bottom bottom of the plant see where my fingers are and then you've had growth from from here up it's kind of hard to uh kind of hard holding the gopro and showing all that i hope that's coming across on the camera but i mean you can go to each row and see it you can pick anywhere in this field see right here see right here that one that one that one that one that one that one that one that one that one all that is old where they've bitten off uh 22 days ago and then i've had growth from here up so basically what i'm getting at is they've left it alone um but i will show you we walked the field pretty good we did find where they are eating a little bit over here uh which i'll walk over there and show you but uh this was pretty amazing um only thing i've done is put out the panergetic i'll keep doing trials with this stuff but i'm pretty impressed so far what it's done i mean this is the real results right here but here's another spot boom boom boom then you have all this they left it alone see right here now this has been freshly eaten on i mean this is at the top of the plant um some of this was done probably last night like that one that one um but it's it's not everywhere it's just in just certain little rows you'll find where they decided to eat on it um like right here it's not bad you'll just find if you really look you'll find where they they have eaten a little bit right here and then you take one row over and there's no damage a little damage a little damage a little damage right here one eight i don't know this is where the heaviest pressure is in this field and um i was expecting them to be eaten all the way to the ground but uh they're not i lost them alone for the most part uh especially if you walk out there a little bit in the field but like i said i don't know that's all i can say i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i plant you know emerge out of the ground pretty much same day but most of everything we looked at today and did a kernel count I mean it was anywhere from 18 rows 38 around and then we did see some 16 35 rows I mean 16 rows around 35 length so it's not gonna be a big year to to get some high yields but what we saw what I liked was the field was consistent every stalk pretty much had an ear and they were all the same height so if you can do that your yield will be a lot better than what you think it is down here at the gravel pit looking at the cotton one of the main things we're looking at to see if we need to picks it by fixing it that means your growth regulator you're slowing it down and making it not grow tall like a tree fruit or whatever you wanted to fruit quit growing up so we're gonna walk out in here and take a look at it but so far the cotton looks good what you do is you're looking at on the stem the nodes you're measuring between basically the node and you're looking at the root is this branch to this branch and you want about three to four fingers and see I'm five fingers between this branch of that branch five to that one to that one yeah this should have should have been fixed earlier fire ants are eating the aphids one case the fire ants are doing you good yeah they're working on them aphids are these little microscopic little bugs I don't know if you can pick them up they're little bitty little things on there they're sucking the nutrients out of the leaf there's one of the cow killers big old ant there he goes that's a cow killer big old ant cow killer probably not the right name but that's what we call it here in Alabama her dad calls it anyway cotton is uh anyway the cotton should have been picked where from this branch to this branch should have been a little closer that one definitely should have been closer it should have had one right here we looked at it earlier in the year and it was okay like down here from this one to that one that's what you want from that one to that one we were okay right here this one to this one but then right here from here on up there on up it really took off growing and that was these lower branches probably were uh uh when we were in that 30 day drought or whatever um now it's getting plenty of rain and it's taking off so we'll definitely have to put a heavy shot of picks on it to slow it down and make it fruit more but all in all it looks looks good let me show you real quick what a bloom is this is a bloom and that bloom that flower will fall off and make well let me find one let me find one then that flower then that flower will fall off and that's what you got a bowl that's a cotton bowl so that is the final final product of uh getting cotton getting the actual lint you'll have a flower bloom that dies and then that turns into a bowl and this is what will hold all your little cotton this will be a cotton bowl that i just wasted there's plenty of them out there so now that we have a game plan for the gravel pit i know what needs picks and what rate and uh what herbicides we're gonna put out um got the shields on so we can go through there that's why we were putting it on to go through that cotton uh now i have to do is clean my rogator out uh i gotta rinse it out because last thing i was putting out was uh roundup enlist liberty zidua that's the main one zidua uh putting it out on the beans over there in the talkville uh putting it out on the beans over there in the talkville for the vacation and uh you cannot spray zidua sc over the top of cotton don't think i have any left in here but just to make sure we're gonna do a clean out and we'll let it sit overnight do a decontamination rinse it out in the morning we'll be ready to spray cotton tomorrow with weather permitting you know with the hurt with the tropical storm coming through haven't got any rain yet but it's been kind of going all around us all day i think black was being i think it just got a shot of rain but uh we have missed it all right here so we'll see what happens tomorrow and uh maybe we'll get to spray but first clean out the rogator all right we have rinsed out the uh tank three times and stirred it with tank cleaner rinse it through the booms and then we filled it up the fourth time tank cleaner again and uh it's full and we're gonna let it decontaminate overnight and uh we'll rinse it out again in the morning and then we are ready for cotton so done with the rogator for today uh next on the list is i think i got time to um hook up that trailer and start getting the chemical loaded on it what we're going to use at the gravel pit so in case we get a small window in the morning um in between the tropical storm and these rain bands coming by if we can get a load out or two and finish the gravel pit um at least we'll be ready we'll have everything loaded in the morning and uh all we gotta do is cut here hook up the trailer to the truck and then head on up there to the gravel pit get the rogator up there and we'll be ready to spray so uh i think we got time to do that and uh one other thing is dad is bringing the water trailer from sugarberry pa ran out of water so if we have time we'll help him fill up with water and then he'll have that trailer ready for pa in the morning so let's see if we can finish this day up so let's see if we can finish this day up so we'll take theó so here Thank you.
