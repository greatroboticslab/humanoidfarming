Howto & Style
 Rocky Mountain Permaculture presents Permabits. Deep in the forest wilderness of western Montana, Rocky Mountain Permaculture explores Paul Wheaton's farm laboratory. Welcome to Wheaton Laboratories. Let's get to work. This crazy looking box here, the idea is that we have 41 grains of Sepp Holzer's grain. He calls it Russian corn. And it's such an amazing plant that we wanted to make sure that we didn't lose any of the plants because it's taken us years to get this. So we planted 21 of the grains just about a week ago. And by we, I mean Richard did. Richard's our seed commander here at Wheaton Laboratories. And this is Richard's creation to protect the newly germinating seeds from the deer and the turkeys. We have a lot of wild turkeys and a lot of deer, elk, moose. We got lots of things that want to eat these plants. So we're protecting them. This particular grain will grow in horrible soils. The most miserable, pathetic soils there are. Eight and a half feet tall. And so it's a massive soil builder and generates huge amounts of organic matter from practically nothing. What an amazing, amazing plant. Now, Sepp Holzer for 50 years, maybe even 60 years, has been planting this and keeping the seeds from the best looking plants on the worst soil for 50 years. And this is the result. We have some. So it should grow out of the top of this thing and beyond. And when it gets to be a couple of years old, we'll be able to harvest more seed and start our own collection of seeds. Now and half the seeds in early spring. See which planting time does the best. So here they are. There's one bed made. There's a row down it. And we got perfect germination. All 21 seeds came up. So, so far so good. And this cage here was made just to keep the animals out. Deer and then turkeys. Lots of turkeys running around. We don't want them eating it. Cause I mean, it's not something you can just go get more seed. It's pretty precious. So yeah, there's this little gate in here. Go in here. So yeah, the row is here. This, this part of the cage will be where the row is planted in the early spring, probably sometime in March. And I'm guessing the stuff planted in the fall will do the best. Cause that's how I think that's when I believe Sepp plants his. But I mean, just in case there's some issues with the winter or something, then the rest of it's going to be planted here on this side of the cage in the early spring. What I remember reading about it from Sepp is that it like grew at different, depending on the climate, it took different amounts of times. And in harsh climates, it could take several seasons and then he, but the same grain would grow like somewhere like Columbia or Venezuela or something. And just like grew to maturity in like six months. So I'm not sure exactly what it'll do here, but I mean, I know there's, I think it's most related to like wheat and rye and those sorts of things, just an ancient variety. And I know there's plenty of winter wheat grown in Montana. So the, that heads up the next year. So I think there's probably a long enough season here for it to, to get seed from it next year, but I'm not sure. I've never grown it before either. It's pretty unusual. I'm not sure how many people in this country have it. I mean, I know Sepp's distributed around in Europe and places, but yeah, probably one of the only ones here, but hopefully get a bunch of seed and be able to plant a bunch more and, you know, not have to worry about it as much. Cause there'll be way more seed and then other people spread around the seed too.
