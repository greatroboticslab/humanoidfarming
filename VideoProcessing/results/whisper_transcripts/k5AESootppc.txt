 Here is how you can grow a date from the store. Take a date and enjoy it. When you get to the seed, take that seed and put into a cup of water. After 24 hours take it out and drive into a wet paper towel. Give it a good squeeze. Throw it into a container and leave it into a shady spot. Two to three weeks later you will see a little tiny root like that. On the first week the root is longer and stronger. Take the seed and plant into the soil and tap the soil down lightly. After that give it a good soak. Few more weeks later you will see this cool looking leaf coming out. Now you have a baby date tree and it will continue to grow. You're gonna need a male and a female so plant a lot of them. Make sure to follow me for more video and updates on the plant. I'll see you guys later.
