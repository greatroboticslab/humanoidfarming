 . . . . . When I was a child, my dad always take me with him on his work. . My little cowboy. . You want to be a farmer? . . My name is Daniel Wolf and I'm a cattle farmer. . We are in the center north of Brazil, very close to the Amazon forest. . . The city that we are located is Nova Canaã do Norte, in the state of Mato Grosso. . The biggest producer of meat in Brazil. . Most of our neighbors, they work with cows. . More cows than people. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . �� . to plant a tree was yesterday. We planted 85 hectares for the first time, and now last year we did 35 hectares integrating system. My father was one of the first people to start this silvopasture in this region. We are producing cow, we're producing crop, and we produce tree. Crop, cattle, and timber work together in this system to increase the productivity of the same amount of land. When you integrate the system, you increase the fertility of the soil. And when you do that, you can put more cows in the same amount of land. The cattle, they produce CO2. But in this system that we integrate, the carbon are fixed in the wood and in the soil. We have this battle, food against forest. And I think that's not only in Brazil, it's all around the world. You don't have to have deforestation to have a farm with cattle. My name is Sinido Costa Jr. I'm a researcher at Imaflora. I try to understand the impact of agriculture and climate change. As the population is growing, of course, the tendency is to grow our impact. There is no doubt that silvopastureal system can really change the agricultural production picture of Brazil. The researches that we've seen are showing that implementing silvopastureal systems, you can produce meat with negative carbon emissions. It means you sequester more carbon than with meat producing the same amount of meat. I believe farmers can do good for the world. I think everyone has a hold in this fight for a better world. Every time that I wake up here in the farm, I thank God for the birds' songs, for the sun that are raising, and the rain sometimes when we have. The best part to be here in the farm is the opportunity that you have to have a very peaceful life. No traffic jams, no crowds, but a lot of work. My dad is a hero for me and for our family. I'm proud of what he has done and how much he works to produce food. And he, my mother, and my family, they are very important to the next generation, and actually for me and my family as well. See how friendly they are? If you treat them well, they will treat you well as well. I think that people that blame the farmers, they don't actually know what are behind this work. We are all together in the same world. Give me five. My good boy. Yes. We are taking care of the planet for the future.
