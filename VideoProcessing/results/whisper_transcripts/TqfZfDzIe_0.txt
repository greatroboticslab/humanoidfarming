 hi everyone well my strawberry is doing really well this year i'm very excited about it and i'm growing them in four different ways so today i want to take you around show you the different ways i'm growing berries and also the key to getting your berries to produce really well so let's go take a look at the first spot where i have them growing the first spot i have my strawberries growing is in the strawberry crate tower definitely one of my all-time favorite ways to grow berries super easy so if you've got a small space the tower will work really well for you it's basically just three plastic crates stacked up and you line the plastic crates with the smart pots crate liner so it's porous it's made from the same fabric as smart pots and what i've done is i've cut holes in the sides of the crates through the little holes in the in the slats here and poke berries in all the way around i could definitely could add a couple of more but the berries really love the aeration they love the drainage keeps them up off the ground away from pests and critters and it's a great way to grow a ton of berries in a small space on a deck or a patio perfect for the spot here and you might remember the video we did a couple of weeks ago on waking up your strawberries for the spring super important the key to growing a lot of berries is regular feeding i feed them about once every seven to ten days with some vermisterra vitality and fish fertilizer and look at how the berries are just popping up and i'm so excited to harvest these this is actually my very first strawberry harvest of the season you know that berries are ripe when they're a nice red color all the way around at the top and they kind of have this nice little sheen to them like these do oh they're just so beautiful and so delicious so you just grab them in both hands pull them off drop them in your basket and they are ready to eat so fun to grow harvest and eat strawberries from our own backyard here we're going to put these on top of a nice little yogurt bowl for breakfast oh here's one more let me just dig in here and see if we've got any more that one has a little white on the top we're going to leave that but there are a ton of green berries in here so really the key is regular feeding of your berries look at all these berries coming on and look at the size of these plants the second way i have berries growing is in raised beds and they're very beautiful to grow in raised beds because you can plant them along the edge like i have here and they just kind of spill over the raised beds and make a really beautiful presentation in your raised bed so this is smart pots 2x4 urban raised bed and berries are strawberries are actually perennials so they will overwinter they'll die back in the winter and then they'll pop back up in the spring just like these are and again i fertilize these with fish fertilizer and vermistera vitality they are just taking off now the berries on the end here are actually transplanted from another spot that was getting a little bit too crowded so you definitely can transplant your berries and they will produce the first year that you transplant them i've got some flowers coming on but again the key is feeding them regularly every two weeks in your containers every three to four weeks in your raised beds now something you need to know about berries is there's there's different types of berries june bearing berries produce early in the summer they produce one crop they're pretty much done for the year they tend to be a little bit larger berries they only produce one crop a year and there's everbearing which produce two to three crops one in summer one mid-summer one in the fall tend to be a little bit smaller berries there's day neutral which produce small berries all season long also the key to getting a lot of berries is planting a variety of each type so that you have berries to harvest all season long the third way i'm growing strawberries is in containers now here i have some growing in a five gallon container you could grow them in a one gallon container but you only want to put one berry or two berry plants in a one gallon here i've got them in the cali kim five gallons there's a lot of berry plants in here and a ton of berries coming on would you look at all of these berries absolutely crazy these are beginning regular feedings every couple of weeks you can tell these are still have a little bit of white on them so they're not ripe yet you really do want to wait till they're nice and red for the maximum sweetness but in here i've got several plants and that is something about containers is that they can get kind of crowded you can definitely pull the berries out dig them up by the roots transplant them into another container or into your raised beds and you'll see in here that there's several different berry plants and tons and tons of berries in this container so another key to growing a lot of berries is actually rooting the runners so over the winter time when my berries were done producing they produced a lot of runners which is a stem that comes out from the mother plant and kind of runs over the side and what i did is i just rooted the runners you just poke them in the soil if you want you can secure them with a bobby pin or a landscape staple then they take root here in the soil and form a brand new plant then after they've been growing and established for a couple of weeks you can clip the runner from the mother plant actually this one is still attached so you can go ahead and clip it or break it and it's a brand new plant so during the winter time i established three or four or maybe five or six brand new berry plants which will produce a ton of berries for me this spring and summer the fourth way that you can grow berries is in hanging baskets and this is also one of my favorites because it really packs a punch visually it has a beautiful appearance and it's also really fun to put a hanging basket close to your house or your kitchen for easy access you can just pop out here pick a few berries and you're good to go so these hanging baskets are lined with the smart pots basket liners they really are very durable they're aerated again made from the same fabric that the smart pots containers are made from and here i have them interplanted with some beautiful flowers for visual appeal they're just doing fabulous i couldn't be more pleased ton of berries grit coming on oh this one's ripe got to pick that one it's nice and shiny oh i can taste these fresh berries now super super delicious now one thing that's good to know about hanging baskets is they do dry out very quickly they're hanging so all the water drains out very quickly so you want to make sure that your hanging baskets don't dry out especially with berries you want to keep the soil nice and moist not waterlogged but just make sure you have them on a regular watering and feeding schedule now my hanging baskets i do feed about once a week because all the nutrients and water drain through and they definitely need that extra feeding and strawberries by the way are not a super super heat tolerant fruit so they flower and fruit up to about 85 degrees once it gets over 85 degrees what i do is i cover my baskets and my berries with shade cloth really helps protect them in the heat and keeps them producing all summer long well i hope you found this helpful whether you have a big space or a small space you can grow berries so many different ways four of my favorites are the crate towers the five gallon containers the hanging baskets and spilling over raised beds let me know how you're going to grow strawberries this spring and summer thanks so much for watching we'll see on the next video
