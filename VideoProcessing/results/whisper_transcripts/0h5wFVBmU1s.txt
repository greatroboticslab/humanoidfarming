 Hey, Connor here. Welcome to NeverSync Farm. And talking about something really fun, which is market farm tools. These are fuel tools that are essential to my farm, NeverSync Farm, that we use constantly. So I'm just going to go down the line. And these are obviously all ones that I manufacture, but it doesn't mean they're the only ones. Of course, those are the ones I have. So I'm just going to start on this side. And these are gridders. So in order to plant straight, you need some way of laying things out. Now, I know people, some of you rake with like hoses on the ends of them, which we've done. You know, that's not very straight. Then there's like rolling dibblers, like they punch a hole. But they only work in soil that's very easy to punch a hole in. If it's that soft, you can make your own hole anyway. So I don't know. But those punching ones are good if you're going through plastic, I think. But on regular soil, especially one that's been smoothed with an iconoclast cultivator, it just makes a really nice straight line and grid for planting. And they're all standard sizes for a 30 inch bed. Right. So, you know, just like, you know, you have two rows on a bed, 30 inch divided by two, that's 15. So each crop gets 15 inches. So you don't need adjustable. Right. It's grab and go. And you can see I have a handle for each one because I don't even want people waiting for a handle. Right. Someone's planting some beets. Right. On a three by three. Right. And then someone's going to do maybe charred on a two by two. Then they both can be planting at the same time and no one's waiting for a gridder. I actually have the same set down at the other tool rack. I think everything is duplicated on the other tool rack. Yeah. And I give you a piece of advice with that. I think it's better to pull it. You know, it acts as a rudder and goes a lot straighter than pushing it. All right. And the next is a iconoclast cultivator. This is the new pro version, which is indestructible and very easy to maintain. Kind of the reason for the chump. We wanted something really indestructible that, you know, even using with rocks that it wouldn't break. And is there's only four bolts and the thing comes apart. You can change the chain chenzener and all of that. Just incredible tool. But I use this mostly for compost. Make your own compost. Comes out a little bit chunky, not smooth. Plus, you know, you're trying to just dump it down the bed quick. And this, you just come and you smooth it out. And another great thing about the pro version is it doesn't leave any ridges. So it's a very flat bed. And that gets rid of the need for a roller. So you're going to get a nice flat bed. Don't have to roll it. No ridges. Really, really nice. We just changed the way that this, the engineering on this so that it does that. Really cool. Okay. Then we go to cultivators. And three most popular here is the stirrup for hardcore weeds. Collinears for underneath hoses and pads where we can't run a wheel hoe. Then we have wire weeders, which we use 90% of the time. We have every size. And we even have them in toolbars and set up for, you know, two rows on a bed. Well, it's actually three rows on a bed. Right. So we'll do it different, different size heads so that we can go in between crops really easily. All right. And then these are just extra heads. Right. Because we have extra sticks. And just a word of advice, always keep a head in it. Right. You know, because birds like to nest in here and they're going to poop inside your near. So we have zippers, which we use for planting. We use for adding fertilizer to long season crops and also for fixing any paper pot situation, which leads me to paper pot. Right. I mean, the really important tool on any farm. This is the subversive, which is my version, which is indestructible, indestructible. You're not going to be able to break this. It's going to last for many years after years after years of use. And it's, you know, affordable. It's a more expensive tool, but in the world of transplant, it's a very affordable one. And used for spinach and for cilantro, for dill, for lettuce. Onions, really great for just really speeds things up on the farm. And then a flame weeder. One thing I always recommend with a flame weeder is just once a week, if you have open beds, use it. Right. Because you're going to be beds that haven't that have maybe just been turned over. You're going to kill any weeds that were left behind from the turnover. If you just seeded, you're going to get some pre-emergence flame weeding. And if it's just a bed that you're waiting to plant, might as well just kill any weeds. So it's a great way to just do it weekly. Obviously, in the spring, you're just going to go around and water, fertilize, compost, and then go around and flame. And make sure you start the season off right. So it's just a really nice way to go. And you don't have to worry about it hurting your soil life or anything. Soil is an excellent insulator. And even seeds that are like a millimeter or two under the surface are not going to get hurt. All right. Because a seed will die like above 140 degrees. And so this isn't going to even raise it to that temperature. So they'll be fine. And last and certainly not least, the thing that we use probably the most is sprinklers. So this is an aquifer sprinkler stand, a wobbler. And I always recommend wobblers. This is a stand that's ready to go, comes in as a kit. You know, some people make them themselves. But if you're making it yourself, one thing is avoid PVC. It gets very brittle over time. Okay. So this is, I find the best thing to water the field with. Because it works in many more situations than drip would. But you need a good water source. Each head is going to be about two and a half gallons a minute. So for 3,000 square feet, I recommend 12 gallons a minute or more on your water source. That's something you can talk to a plumber or your well installer or whoever about your system. But that makes things easy and productive and efficient on a farm. All right. So that's the tool racket. Never think of the essential field market farming tools for us. So I hope you found that enjoyable. And thanks for watching. Until next time.
