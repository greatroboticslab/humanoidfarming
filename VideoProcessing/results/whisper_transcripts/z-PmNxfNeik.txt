 Music Hi, welcome to the farm in Stouville, Addiction Treatment Centre. We're located in the rural part of Stouville, just north of the City of Toronto, about 40 minutes. Hi, my name is Yonah Budd, and for 40 years I've been rescuing kids from themselves, and from the perils of drug addiction and alcoholism. The farm was created for the purposes of therapy, rehabilitation and recovery. Simply the finest place for you or for your loved ones to come and overcome the disease of addiction. Every one of our therapists, from our holistic psychotherapist to our psychiatrist, have been handpicked by me. These are people who care, who know what they're doing, and whose simple focus is to help you or your loved one get well. So call us today, don't delay. Give us an opportunity to talk to you, I will talk to you, and share with you the opportunity of being free of drug addiction and alcoholism. So please, give us a call, call the number on the screen. I'm glad to talk with you, and I promise, in a 15 minute conversation, you or your loved one will feel better about the opportunity of recovery and rehabilitation. Thank you very much for your time, and we hope to see you at the farm soon. Thank you very much for your time, and we hope to see you at the farm soon.
