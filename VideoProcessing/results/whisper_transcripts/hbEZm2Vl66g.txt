The most epic comment. I'm going to grab this here. And... I... You have to see who this is, too. Okay. Let's see. All right. So... Yeah. This is... This one is just a half to share. All right. One second. We're doing this on the fly. Because this is the way we roll. Quick. You guys are going to... This is worth it. Trust me. This is worth it. All right. All right. Yep. There we go. Here is the comment. And... And... And here is... Who is it from? Okay. So... The Dalai Lama... Stopped by... And left me this comment. This is on my... My... Video... On... On... Keeping your greenhouse heated. You know. Keep your plants alive through the winter. So... We're going to make this here. See the Dalai Lama. But we want to be able to read this, too. This is very important. Okay. The Dalai Lama writes... Why don't you use glass? Glass windows or huge sliding doors. Made with... Wait a second. No. The Dalai Lama probably sung this. Yeah. I definitely sung this. Why don't you use glass? Glass windows or huge sliding doors? Made with glass so the sun rays get into plants. In winters. And put huge fans for this big indoor farm. Made with glass doors sliding. And even the roof glass. Double glass roof throw at his trunk. To hold even the snow. And the sun rays are going through. Put a heater, too. To keep warm inside. For winters. 77 degrees. 65. Lowest in winters. And in May 25th. Or beginning of May. When the weather gets warm. Slide those glass doors. Craft roof doors. And let nature take its place. From May to September 5th. That is warm enough. Summer tropical weather. Always use the side doors. When the weather is 79 degrees. And all of them, too. And even though it's all day in spring or winter. The side doors are so easy. It will run you some electricity. What about if you've got solar panels and get free electricity? You have a golden mine. A golden mine. You can grow mangoes or even bunning trees. You can grow palms and even grow coconut palms trees. Sell it all at markets. Tropical farms in Massachusetts. Wow. If I had a big land in Massachusetts. Especially in Cape Cod. I will make a tropical farm. And grow bananas and mangoes and coconuts. And other tropical foods. Plants and fruits. The rip is, believe it or not. Show a beat of my farm. In Massachusetts tropical farms. And get cold at free. Electricity from wind and solar panels. Provide electricity to get peters and fans running. And winters inside glass sliding indoor farms. That's like opens the glass doors in summertime. When the weather is tropical for four months. From May 15 to September 15. The weather in Massachusetts is warm. 75 degrees average. Even 85 in June to August. It makes it 12 months. Tropical weather. Tropical elephants provide wind and air and heaters. Warm in winters. You can grow a lot of mangoes and kiwis. And bananas and coconuts. In that fertile land of Cape Cod farms in Massachusetts. I wish I had this thing. I would be so dedicated to this farm. And live in Massachusetts Cape Cod all my life. Wish someone helped me get a farmland in Massachusetts. And alone do this. All the fruits will be sold at supermarkets. Who wouldn't buy mangoes and bananas and kiwis. Et cetera, et cetera. Tropical fruits. From Massachusetts. The people of Massachusetts would be shocked and curious. To see tropical fruits. Made in Massachusetts. For Christmas. Eat a mango or kiwis. Ready at Christmas. When it's snowing outside. Inside the glass made farm. Indoor farm. Is growing tropical fruits. In Massachusetts. In Massachusetts. Dalai Lama. Thank you very much for that comment. That is the best comment I have ever received in the history of comments. I am going to pin that. Thank you very much. The Dalai Lama is so cool. I was like, wow. This is so cool. I mean, like, well, first of all, I have never had a world-renowned religious leader comment on any of my videos. So far as I know. Except for maybe that lady with all the cats. And I don't know what religion that was. But, man, that's so cool. The Dalai Lama. Yeah, the Dalai Lama actually stopped by and left that. So, namaste? I don't know what you say. But thank you. The Dalai Lama, man. Can you imagine the Dalai Lama in Cape Cod? Massachusetts. Oh, Massachusetts. I did not practice this song before the stream. That was off the top of my head. It is a dubious gift. One that I would not wish on anyone's spouse. Yeah, Carolyn Smith says, very cool. You are on the radar. If the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama. Why does he write in all caps? I don't know. He's wearing glasses. The Dalai Lama's getting old. I mean, don't pick on him. Yeah, the Dalai Lama. And the dollar signs, too. I like the dollar signs at the ends for S's. That was so cool. Wow. Wow. Very good.
