 So it's somewhere around the corner, I imagine you're drinking a little bit more iced coffee, but did you know that climate change is threatening your beloved drink? So ever since coffee was discovered in Ethiopia over a thousand years ago, it's played a role in cultures around the world, and it's had a crucial economic role in many regions, but climate change puts that at risk. In Tanzania, for example, production has been cut in half since the 1960s because of warmer temperatures, which means increased costs and lower bean quality for consumers. And diseases that intensify with warmer weather, such as coffee rust, are increasingly affecting crops, which just goes to show that climate change has global ramifications and could even affect your next cold brew.
