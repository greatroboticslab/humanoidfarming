 Salmon from farm to fork When the salmon are about two years old, it's time for them to enter the food chain. They are transferred from the floating pen in the sea into a well boat like this one. Being moved from the floating pen can be slightly stressful for the salmon. So once they are inside the well boat, the temperature of the water inside is gently cooled, which makes them feel more relaxed. Next, they are transported by the well boat to a processing factory. Inside the well boat, a flow of water is created and the fish follow the flow of water up pipes like these. The pipes lead the salmon to the harvesting station, where a machine stuns and kills them almost instantly. Once this has happened, the fish then go straight into a tank of ice and water, which is below 2 degrees Celsius. It's important to keep the water this cold, so that the fish are kept as fresh as possible. The whole fish are then transferred to another part of the processing plant, where the insides are removed by a machine. These are not wasted, but taken away to be used as fish meal, which is used to feed other kinds of farmed fish, such as sea bass and sea bream. The salmon are now ready to be taken on to the next part of the process. At this factory, the salmon is now ready to be taken on to the next part of the process. At this factory, the sides of salmon are being portioned into smaller pieces. The temperature inside the factory is kept nice and cold, so that the salmon stays fresh. Once the whole salmon and the salmon fillets have been packaged and labelled, they are loaded onto a refrigerated lorry like this one, and delivered to your local store.
