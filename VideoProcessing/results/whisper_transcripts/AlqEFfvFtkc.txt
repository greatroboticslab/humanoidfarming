 You know what's growing down on the farm? GMOs, or genetically modified organisms. Among the GMOs available in the U.S. right now, corn, soybeans, canola, sugar beets, cotton, alfalfa, potatoes, summer squash, apples, papaya, and pink pineapple. A farm-raised Atlantic salmon and pork from a type of pig have been approved for food use, but you may not see them in the market because they are not widely available. Most GMO crops are used in food for animals, but a few fresh fruits and vegetables are available in GMO varieties, including GMO apples that don't brown as fast when you slice them, and potatoes that don't bruise so easily, summer squash, there's a GMO papaya, and a pink pineapple. But these GMOs aren't widely available. Still, a lot of GMOs end up here, in your local grocery store, in packaged foods. GMO soy oil and protein are often used as ingredients in foods. There's even a GMO soybean specifically developed to make a healthier cooking oil. And GMO corn is often used to make cereal, crackers, and other snacks. Certain types of GMOs have a disclosure. That lets you know if the food or ingredients you are eating is a bioengineered food. Oh, and that sugar in your iced tea? There's a good chance it's from GMO sugar beets. So you see, GMOs are all around us. From farm to table, they're a big part of our food supply. Med�로.
