Howto & Style
 Hey everybody I'm here with Tara Buff in the Aspen Valley of Colorado and we've been looking at some of her gardens earlier today and one of the things that I noticed was that she has amazing amazing hay racks and containers and so I thought maybe we could talk a little bit about how you how do you get those looking so great and how do you keep them looking so great so Tara tells me it all starts with planting so I'm gonna let Tara show us how she does it thanks so for a full sawn hay rack and I get the hay racks from Kinsman I use the cocoa fiber liner which typically comes with them you can't get it without and they do sell a replacement liner every year that you can do it so and then they also have hooks that you can use to attach it to a banister or whatever it may be but we're just using zip ties today so it all starts off with the cocoa fiber liner you can get away with just planting the top of it and eventually it will cascade over and be full that way but I like to go the extra step and also plant the front of it so what I do is I take I find that kitchen shears work best and I just kind of cut down about one shear length and then I kind of create a little V as well and that way the plant stem has a place to sit oh yeah okay that makes sense good yeah so then the next step you know before I get into the planting I usually set up my design so that it's real easy to just grab on the ones that we were talking about earlier they're quite large so they take 64 plants so it can get a little confusing especially if you're doing more than one right so I set up my design but for the sake of today I'm just gonna kind of grab you can start at the beginning at the middle of it or you can start on the edge if you prefer I always make sure to count how many slots that I have because some of them this one has an even number that we're gonna be doing but for the larger one it's actually a odd number oh okay so again it's one of those brain teasers yeah you want to do the odd number and you put one plant per per gap here and you cut one hole per gap all the way around okay yeah got it or one slice one slice and I for the Sunwans I really like to use the four-inch plants give them a quick cleanup before I put them in and then something that can be a little bit shocking to a lot of people I then wash the soil off the root just take it all completely off I try to yeah so then you can do use a hose or you can just get your hand in there and really work the soil off of the roots and why do you why do you choose to do that I think it just makes it a lot easier to plant they just um in these little tight in the tight spaces you're not fighting all the extra potting exactly exactly and then it also helps when planting the top row as well okay for plant material I really like to use a lot of contrasting shapes and colors making sure that I've paid attention to my color wheel to ensure that the reds and the pinks are the correct hues and all that good stuff so you don't have orange reds with blue reds and the orange pinks with blue reds I guess and then yeah yeah I like to keep it kind of on the harmonious side but you know it's personal preference so go cool or go warm exactly yeah yeah sense so then um to get the plants in I just kind of push it back a little bit pull the roots in this way and then because we've got that nice little slit the plant can just sit in that spot there oh yeah look at that and so I've put a little bit of soil in here already so you start with it about half full maybe exactly okay yeah so then that way I cover up the roots in case you know if you're in the bright sun you don't want the roots to get baked right um and then you can use this to kind of anchor it in as well exactly yeah and so when you're doing this you know we'll do a petunia next again I always like to kind of give it a quick clean up are there are there certain plants that you don't use in that like you choose to use in the front um I mean I know this is an ivy leaf geranium so it kind of tends to naturally trail and drape some exactly do the same thing yeah you can use whatever you like um it's kind of along the same theory as doing a container where you want to have your spillers in the front fillers and your thrillers and all that good stuff so your vines and trailers and those kinds of things would go in the front you wouldn't put a spike in the front exactly yeah you would save you know a grass or something like that for the centerpiece so again and um I kind of recommend right now I'm just wearing normal gardening gloves um but if you're doing this you can also grab a pair of rubber gloves which kind of helps um but you know you can get I tell uh a lot of people plants can take a lot more abuse than what we think that they can so then going in here and again just putting this guy in and then kind of wrapping it around and then you can kind of give them a little intermingle and the first couple days it's going to be facing a little bit downwards but within a couple days they start to really perk up and they start to go up toward the sun then exactly okay and you'll notice there's a little bit of a gap that kind of forms and that's okay um they're not going to fall out um they again it's kind of one of those things where it is a lot stronger than you think it's going to be I really like that you're cutting down from the top I think some that I've seen in you know and I we've probably talked about this before is that you know sometimes people cut a slit right in the middle but it just makes it really hard to plant because you're jamming the roots through this hole instead of having more room and then just kind of sealing the liner back up around the exactly around the roots I think this makes a lot of sense yeah and I've seen them done that way as well um and I just feel like you can get more plant material in this way as well yeah and you don't have to worry so much about the soil falling out yeah that's true um because you need a big enough hole to get the root ball through and then it can also fall back out again exactly yeah yeah so then um we can even use the um namesia in it it'll stand up and really kind of fill in the gaps and so again you know just trying to go with the contrasting textures to really make it pop once it's all flowing together like it does for the full sun containers I like to use just a nice organic matter potting soil some that's got some peat so it's going to have some water retention to it and all of that so the same basically the same container mix you'd use in almost any container exactly um and um you can throw in a slow release granular um fertilizer if you want as well during this step um that works really really well and that way you don't have to keep uh keep fertilizing it all season long kind of gives you a little step do you feed them after they've planted typically um I give them a couple days to kind of you know planting's kind of like surgery for the plants they need some time to yeah yeah so I tend to give them a few days um to a week to kind of get established let them start to perk up and face the sun um and then I'll go ahead and start fertilizing them and what's your uh full strength once a week or every time you water or half strength or how do you do that everyone yeah um you know it kind of depends on the season this season it's been really really warm and I did a full strength fertilizer in the beginning of the season and I ended up burning which I've never done because it was so hot because it was so hot yeah um so I've kind of switched to having more of a instead of two scoops using one scoop um kind of more often uh feeding schedule and then um yeah so you just keep building it like that going around the edges you can plant all the way into this little corner I tend to save that corner because it can be a little bit difficult then to plant the top of it ah yeah that makes sense um and so when you start planting the top of it you just once again lay out your design and you know you pull off these overgrowing roots and you and it doesn't hurt the plant to do that it's fine no it's fine especially in containers um you know these plants have been hanging out waiting for a purpose um a little too long so I like to break apart the roots so that they can kind of tell them hey guys it's time to start growing and stretch out into the new space I'm so sorry guys um but they've been patiently waiting for their purpose and so you know make sure they're not root bound and kind of stretch it out and um so if you want to do you know your back row and you don't always wash them off in the back row I don't I don't really feel the need to do it in the back row simply because we are um just putting them in and especially stuff like this that is for the taller things then it kind of gives us the ability to um fill in some space and that way we don't have to buy as much soil either right which is always good right so yeah and then um you know you've got your tall in the back row um but I will probably rinse this one off a little bit because if I sit it in like that it's a tight squeeze in there exactly so back in here just kind of tickling the roots like that give it a little shaky shake and so you know the plants get a little bit dirty but at the end of the day you just when you water it in you just give it a really good soaking and water it when you just wash it all off exactly so then because that one's like that so then you just put that guy like that and I oops sorry guy I broke it um it'll be fine yeah so so you really do kind of have your uh spiller filler thriller kind of exactly yeah yeah great and yeah I've seen I've done ones that are just all petunias it really just depends on the effect that you're looking for if you want something that's more rounded um then you can go that way if you want something with a little bit of height to it then you can add whatever you like in it back yeah this is really interesting yeah um so this is the full sun so once it's all planted up you'll um top it off yeah you fill in any gaps I like to water it in let the water the soil settle a little bit and then if I feel that there's a few gaps then you can go ahead and do a little sprinkle of soil here and there um but yeah and you can even do a little um you know I have some smaller cell packs so if you want to really and if you want to pass me the dahlia too sure um you know and again these guys are pretty root bound so I'm going to go ahead and break this up a little bit um but you know you can really it's really up to you how many plants you want to use in it um I've just packed them pack it don't be afraid to pack it full I kind of really enjoy the instant gratification yeah and that's kind of what containers are all about right exactly you know they're only around for so long so then you just kind of keep building them out like that and you know maybe we on another one of these is coming around the front and then it kind of all blends together and really and it's nice to have a bunch of different textures and um habits exactly anyway there's just a lot of with the spikes and the grassy forms and the big petunia forms and yeah lots of different options here and you can use different color petunias together and you know literally whatever you want so then you've topped it off and then you water it all in and wash off the um wash off the plants and yeah good luck guys yeah and so then would you water every day after you get started would you say or yeah I mean it's kind of site pacific so specific yeah um um so yeah it just kind of depends on where you're at I have some places that I like to water every day because they are in full baking sun and other places where I just water it every couple days it really just depends on so you just check it I mean you just check the soil and see what happens yep you can check it you know um you can't really check these ones by weight like I do with the containers but um you know if you're unsure always just grab a moisture meter from yeah stick your finger in it and see yep yeah that makes sense well so this was a technique that you use for more sun containers and then you have a different technique that you use for some of your shade containers for some kind of specific reasons let's take a look at those next so Tara this is another method that you use um to plant up uh hay racks why why do you have a different method so for the um the shade plants they're just a little bit more tender so I can't be quite as tough on them as I am I still wash the roots and all that good stuff but um and this is also the original way that I learned how to do um this is this is the old school this is the old school way yes so my mom taught me how to do this and um gosh when she taught me this back in the early 90s um she used chicken wire oh wow which was just as you can imagine very difficult um so what I use is a bird netting and so I tie it in with the green plant tape um and I know it seems like there's a lot of tape here but it really does just kind of disappear once it starts to get planted and then I take so you line the hole inside with um with a bird netting kind of wrap yeah and so I start by doing it just through all the front ones and I used to try to get away without doing all the front ones but you find that it starts to poke through while you're planting because the goal is to hold this um the sphagnum exactly in place mm-hmm yeah and so um I do the top row and then I do a few down here and then I kind of move around to the back of it and then up to the top now when you're planting these do you um for for all your hay racks do you plant right in place you hang the rack in in its final spot and then you plant right in right there yeah that makes sense that way I don't have to worry about transportation I have such being in Colorado such a short growing season that um it would just be devastating to me to have you know some places have six hay racks and to have one get broken would just be while you were on your way there exactly yeah it's a lot of work yeah that makes sense so how do you get the what do you how do you get the the sphagnum in so the sphagnum moss I just buy bales of the New Zealand sphagnum moss um and then I soak it overnight in a bucket of water okay until it's all nice and loose and then I just start hand packing it so we start in the bottom and then I move around to the front of it and you don't have to be really really thick with it or anything like that as long as you can't see any gaps um and this will this will hold the soil all into the hay rack exactly and um I used to always squeeze mine out some but I don't see you squeezing it is it better not to squeeze it out um it doesn't really matter yeah I have just always done it yeah it's just um I think it sticks together better if the wetter it is probably it's definitely messy yeah um so be prepared but so yeah so just kind of go around until I reach uh about an inch or two before the top and then this can be a little bit tricky and sometimes it's a little bit easier if you have a second hand of course luckily you do yeah what can I do um so I'm gonna hold it okay well here actually I think I can get this up here you want me to hold it yeah so the nice part about working with a small bag um and sometimes if I'm alone and I'm working with a larger bag I'll put it in a bucket ah um typically for the hay racks that are going to be in the shade I'll use a high porosity soil um and that way it just doesn't hold quite as much water um less of a risk of over watering it because especially with some of the shade plants that you you really like to grow like begonias they hate to get wet or they hate to sit yeah be wet for a long time yes right and as we know one of the biggest problems that we have is that we over love our plants yeah more things more things suffer from over watering than under exactly um so I run that risk with um if I don't have a chance to water and I have one of my amazing crew members do it um it just kind of helps with the I think it's wet but I'm just going to add a little bit more water to it just in case and then a week later you're like oh no um so I do like to tell all my crew members for shade plants that if the plant has kind of a dull color to it that means it needs water um but if it has kind of a yellowy color to it that means it's going to be over watered if you add just a little bit more to it makes sense that's a good good rule of thumb yes so we just keep moving all the way around um it's okay if some of the soil gets on the outside and then to start doing the planting so you do um sort of halfway up with the moss and then fill it up to that level and then you add more moss after that exactly so now we have it all lined and filled with potting mix and so it's time to start planting right yes so for the shade containers I like to use a little bit smaller size um so I use the two and a half inch as well as the four uh four pack size or six packs any of the cell packs work um same theory we want to come in break up the roots on these poor root bound guys give it a little swishy swish swish swish if you really want to go super super colorful because we are using the two sizes the smaller sizes we can do a two in one oh yeah so being a little bit more careful with the impatience and the begonias because they are such brittle stems exactly yeah um and then I just kind of will hold them like that okay but first we need to take and cut a hole in our netting so and do you do that between every um each bar yes for the containers too okay just like on the shade on the sun ones I will go in and just cut a couple of them get my finger in there kind of feel it out see how it is make sure it's big enough exactly um if you cut a hole that's too big like sometimes I accidentally cut a huge hole um you can just back stuff it with some sphagnum that's the beauty of using the sphagnum it's really flexible exactly so we've got one in there and then we'll put the other guy in just being really careful with that one is but with the impatience especially exactly and you know there's going to be there's a little bit of space here so I'm just going to take a little bit more sphagnum and pack around it to make sure yeah and it doesn't matter if the sphagnum gets on the roots or anything like that it all kind of grows together yeah eventually anyway and so we just keep going down like that way and using um different textures and varieties of plants um again this is a three and a half inch size so it's a little bit bigger but I just love this fuchsia um I think it gives a really great effect with its red veins and oh it is pretty chartreuse leaves and you'll also get the fuchsia flower as it goes along and will this be in the on the front this is a trailer that you're planting in the front yeah oh pretty so I'll put it in the front and it kind of goes a little bit wild and gives you a little little funkiness so cut the hole I put the fuchsia on in and then you know you can make him hang out with the other guy and at this point you can keep using the same color of the impatience if you want or you can switch it up with maybe a white one and um you know there's thankfully there's really no wrong combinations with plants yeah so some of your favorite shade plants for hay racks impatience fuchsias yes um fuchsias um we have this fabulous begonia here this one's especially great you can put it in front without issue because it's got a definitely sturdier stem than what the non-stops have interesting so and the ones that I showed you before the shade containers these ones are right front and center and they do yeah they do really well they do great and then um beautiful terrinias here yeah this is such a great blue um I've used lobelia in them um I've used vinca I used coleus in them as um the thriller so oh right yeah again back you can have the um have a spiller on the edge like this great guy here because he's on the edge you don't have to go all the way down to his roots um but he'll mix in great and then you can put the coleus in here right behind him so I think that's really interesting the idea of washing off uh especially the front row of plants or the the ones that go in the in the facing the front face of the um container but then whatever you need to to get them all packed in as much as you want I mean just really they all should be just packed in as tightly as possible I I um I like to think of when I'm planting containers that I'm placing the plants more than planting the plants um and I really like to have that wow factor right from the get-go right and it just makes so much sense that's the look we're all going for in our hanging baskets and hay racks and containers and it's just it doesn't always happen a lot of times it's because we're just not using enough plants yes and but you know in different environments you have the luxury of the heat and the humidity and a little bit of extra time but you know june 10th my safety date for frost um so and can't do a lot before that with these plants many of these would just yeah make it yeah and by mid-september you know so I really only have three we got three months to really enjoy them right so I like to go super close together but if I was back in Ohio or somewhere like where I grew up I might place them a little bit further apart because knowing that they'd be there longer together so exactly exactly and that way I wouldn't have to buy so many of them yeah so many great tips today this is really really helpful and really fun too oh thanks I've really enjoyed seeing all of your containers and getting all of your ideas and I hope you guys have enjoyed it too thanks a lot Tara thank you it's been great
