 Hello Paleans! Welcome back to this squishy cozy corner of the Palea economy. Today we're ranking every single crop in Palea by how much gold you can make just from selling their seed bags. That's right, this is your ultimate seed profit guide updated for 2025 and the Elderwood update. So if you're running seedmakers or trying to figure out which crops are actually worth turning into seeds, this is the video for you. This ranking is based on how much profit you can earn in a full 30-day end-game cycle which is equal to 30 real-life hours of gameplay. Why 30 days? That's the longest cycle for any crop in Palea. Looking at you apples. So it gives us a consistent window to compare everything fairly. By the way, if you want to compare this to the raw and processed crop profits instead of seeds, I've already done a full breakdown in another video and I'll link it right here on the screen and in the description and comments below for you all. This guide is only looking at how much gold you make from selling the seeds, not the time it takes to process them, not the crop value, just the pure seed profit from 30 days of in-game planting and harvesting of a particular crop. I'm hoping to cover seed maker time efficiency in a future video so make sure that you all stay tuned for that. Alright, let's jump into the top 15 crops in Palea ranked by total gold from seed sales over a full 30-day harvest cycle. Now we technically have 16 total crops in Palea if you include lettuce, but lettuce was an accidental introduction at one point in the game. The seed value is unknown so we're going to leave it out of the ranking for this video. A brand new crop recently introduced in the Elderwood update. Pumpkins are adorable and festive, but seed-wise? They're kind of flopping this year at number 15. If you refer to my other video, ranking every crop in Palea by profit, that calculates the raw and processed profits there. You'll see that selling the processed form of pumpkins through the preserves jar is likely a more profitable use of time over the 30-day period in-game rather than selling the seeds. The max star yield over 30 days that you would get is 384 pumpkins. The seed conversion rate is one pumpkin for four seed bags and that would leave the total star seed bags produced being 1536 bags. The star seed bag sale price per bag is 37 gold, which would make your max profit around 56,832 gold. Spicy pepper seeds are coming in at number 14. Definitely a decent sale price, but the loss when converted from the crop crop form into the seed form is likely what makes up for this being at such a low ranking on the list as you get only two bags of spicy pepper seeds for four spicy peppers. The max star yield over 30 days is 1152 peppers, the seed conversion rate being four peppers per two bags of pepper seeds. The total star seed bags produced would be around 576 bags. The star seed bag sale price would be around 127 gold each, which would make the max possible profit somewhere around 73,152 gold. At number 13 we have blueberry seeds. Again, another crop that when converted into seeds results in a loss of crop since it takes about four berries to make two seed bags in the seed maker, which is likely why it's towards the bottom of the rankings. The max star yield over 30 days is 960 berries, the seed conversion rate being four berries for two seed bags, and the total star seed bags produced being 480 bags. The star seed bags sale price is 168 gold, which makes the max profit around 80,640 gold. At number 12 we have apple seeds. Definitely the crop in the game that results in the most total crop loss since it takes a whopping 10 apples to convert into just one seed bag in the seed maker. So even though it makes a decent profit from seeds, its best profitability over 30 in-game days would probably be turning it into jam. However, the max star yield over 30 days would be 864 apples, the seed conversion rate being 10 apples for one bag of apple seeds. The total star seed bags produced would then be around 86 bags. The star seed bag sale price is around 1050 gold, leaving the max profit somewhere around 90,720 gold. At number 11 we have carrot seeds. The max star yield over 30 days for carrots would be around 2430 carats. The seed conversion rate being 1 carat for 4 bags of carrot seeds. The total star seed bags produced being around 9720 bags. And the star seed bag sale price per one being about 10 gold each. That would leave the max profit around 97,200 gold. At number 10 on our list we have napa cabbage seeds. They are pretty unique because the seed conversion rate is quite high. The max star yield over 30 days for napa cabbages is around 1215 cabbages. The seed conversion rate being one cabbage equaling six napa cabbage seed bags. The total star seed bags produced would be around 7290 bags. And the star seed bag sale price for one bag of napa cabbage seeds is around 15 gold. The total star seed bags would be around 7000 gold. At number 9 we have onion seeds. That can make you a pretty penny. The max star yield over 30 days for onions is around 1822 onions. The seed conversion rate being one onion per four onion seed bags. And the total star seed bags produced then would be around 7290 bags. The star seed bags would be around 15 gold which would then make your max profit about 109,350 gold. Onion seeds are tied with napa cabbage seeds. Kind of for the number 10 spot. But that is why they are at number 9. And number 8 on our list is tomato seeds. The max star yield over 30 days for tomatoes is around 20 days. The seed conversion rate being three tomatoes for tomatoes is around 2916 tomatoes. The seed conversion rate being three tomatoes for two bags of tomato seeds. The total star seed bags produced would be around 1,944 bags. The star seed bag sale price for star tomato seeds is 60 gold which would then make the max profit around 116,640 gold. The total star seed bags. The total star yield over 30 days for the gold. The total star yield over 30 days for the gold. Tomatoes are not the greatest I would say for making profit off of seeds. Especially given the fact that if you were to take the 2916 tomatoes that you would harvest over 30 days and turn them into pickled tomatoes. You would definitely get a higher max profit than you would for the seeds. Especially given the fact that with tomato seeds you lose a great deal of your tomatoes through the seed conversion. At number 7 we have corn seeds. The max star yield over 30 days for corn is around 1458 corn. The seed conversion rate being one corn. Equalling around 4 corn seed bags. And the total star seed bags produced then being around 5832 bags. The star seed bag sale price for each bag of corn seeds being around 22 gold. The total star yield would then make the max profit around 128,304 gold. Number 6 in our rankings is wheat seeds. The max star yield over 30 days is around 1822 wheat. The seed conversion rate being 1 wheat seed bags. The total star seed bags produced would then be around 7290 bags. And the star seed bag sale price for 1 bag of wheat seed is around 18 gold. So that would result in a max profit of around 131,220 gold. At number 5 on our list is cotton seeds. Coming in at a pretty decent profit. The max star yield over 30 days for cotton is around 1458 cotton. The seed conversion rate being 1 cotton. The total star seed bags produced would then be around 4,374 bags. And the star seed bag sale price for 1 bag of cotton seeds is around 30 gold. Which would then result in a max profit of about 131,220 gold. We have another tie here with cotton and wheat seeds coming in at a very similar max profit. And at rank 4 on our seed list we have rice seeds. The max star yield over 30 days for rice is around 2430 rice. The seed conversion rate being about 1 rice equaling 4 bags of rice seed. The total star seed bags produced then would be around 9,720 bags. That's a lot of rice seed. The star seed bag sale price for each individual bag of rice seeds would then be around 16 gold. Resulting in a max profit of around 155,520 gold. And for the number 3 third place prize we have potato seeds. The max star yield over 30 days for potatoes is around 1458 potatoes. The seed conversion rate is about 1 potato to about 4 potato seed bags. The total star seed bags produced would then be around 5,832 bags. And the star seed bag sale price per 1 bag of potato seeds is about 30 gold. Which would then result in a max profit of 174,960 gold. Potatoes are definitely a worthwhile seed profit maker if you are interested at all in potatoes. And at number 2 in the silver spot we have butterfly bean seeds. Butterfly beans are a newer crop that arrived with the elderwood update. The high sale price of 1 bag of butterfly bean seeds definitely knocks it up in the ranks to the number 2 spot. The max star yield over 30 days for butterfly beans is around 1440 beans. The seed conversion rate being a 1 to 1 ratio of 1 butterfly bean equaling 1 butterfly bean seed bag in the seed maker. The total star seed bags produced then would be around 1440 bags. And the star seed bag sale price is a little higher around 135 gold. Which would result in a max profit of 194,400 gold. So if you are interested in using butterfly bean seeds as a way to make profit in palea, it's definitely your second best option if you didn't want to have to go for the first one. And our number 1 seed making profit in palea right now is bok choy. Bok choy? Bok sleigh. Consistently bringing in the most gold from seed bags over a full cycle. This is especially because of its incredibly short growth cycle of just 3 days. Which over 30 days will give you 10 full harvests of bok choy. And in return help you make an absolute ton of bok choy seeds. The max star yield over 30 days for bok choy is 2,430 bok choy. The seed conversion rate being 1 bok choy equaling 4 bags of bok choy seeds. The total star seed bags produced would then be somewhere around 9,720 bags. And the star seed bag sale price for 1 bag of bok choy seeds is 22 gold. Which would then result in a max profit of 213,840 gold. So those are the most profitable crops for seed making over a full 30 day farming cycle. But what if you only care about how much gold you're making per hour of seed maker time?
