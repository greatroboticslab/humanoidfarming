 So starting out, you know, I couldn't afford nice equipment. When I farmed, I would say it was like going to battle every day. Stuff was breaking. Getting into this game, I realized the leasing game was our game. It allows you to have cash flow. It allows you to get into a nicer piece of equipment, do more, and get more done. And at the end of the day, have a nice piece of equipment so you're not fighting that piece of equipment every day. Pretty much everybody that gets onto our program, you know, after a year, they're thanking us on that program. We've done hundreds of leases. I think everybody that I've ever talked to has worn all these leases. So it's a good program.
