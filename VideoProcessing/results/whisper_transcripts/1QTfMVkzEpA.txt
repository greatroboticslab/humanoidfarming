We're joined by Dr. David Hooker. Thanks for having us Dave. Thanks for being here. Hey you've been doing a lot of work on long term crop rotations here at Ridgetown and Elora. Let's talk about the objectives for your program. Yes well these long term experiments, one was set up in 1980, the one at Elora was set up in 1980 and the one at Ridgetown in 1995. And the main objectives of this research was to answer the long term type of questions. Like we have lots of projects that would answer short term type questions like for example fungicide responses, corn hybrid responses, comparisons. But the long term questions, they need to be answered with long term experiments. Experiments have been set up for a long time. Now the first thing we talked about was, I guess maybe the leading emerging story here, is the impact of rotations and wheat in that rotation. You want to talk about that? Yeah sure. So the Ridgetown experiment, it was set up with five rotations and Elora was set up with a number of rotations as well. And each one of these sites are a little bit different. So at Ridgetown we have continuous corn, we have continuous soybean, a corn soybean rotation, and a corn soybean wheat rotation, and a soybean wheat rotation. And within the corn soybean wheat rotation, we have those split up between red clover under seeded and no red clover under seeded as well. So, and then each one of those rotations is split up between conventional and no tillage. So this has been going on for a number of years now. And just recently, in the past five to ten years or so, we've begun to see trends in the data. And they tend to be tied directly to changes in the soil quality. And that in turn affects the crop responses. So we've seen tremendous value, especially, of wheat in the rotation. When wheat is added, for example, to a corn soybean rotation, wheat certainly adds value to both corn and soybean yields in the rotation. So, first of all, I'd just love to show you some data. In the past five years, we have some good solid data on how wheat in the rotation, how it improves both corn and soybean yields. So let's take a look at some of the data. Okay, so here we have four years, the past four years, at Ridgetown. And let's just focus on 2009. This is the continuous corn. These are the continuous corn yields. 133 bushel to the acre. And then in the continuous corn, corn-soybean rotation, we have 150 bushel to the acre. And then when we include wheat in that corn-soybean rotation, our yields go all the way up to 178 bushel to the acre. So the story in 2009 was, including wheat in a corn-soybean rotation, we increase our corn yields by 28 bushel to the acre. Okay, and so now in 2010, we look at the same situation. We include wheat in the corn-soybean rotation. Our yields jump from 156 to 186 bushel to the acre. So 30 bushel increase due to wheat in the rotation. 2011, 2011 was a very late year for us at Ridgetown. We didn't get our corn planted until June because of wet conditions. And it just seemed to nullify any rotation or tillage effect. But in 2012, we have another very consistent, again, about 19 bushel to the acre increase when we include wheat in the corn-soybean rotation. So the corn-soybean rotation does offer some yield increase, 5 to 10 bushel to the acre over the continuous corn situation. But when we include wheat in the corn-soybean rotation, our corn yields seem to be quite consistently increased by about 20 to 25 bushels to the acre. Okay, so that is corn. And now when we look at soybeans, and again in 2009, this is continuous soybeans, and then a corn-soybean rotation, and then a corn-soybean wheat rotation. And you can see when we include wheat in the rotation, in a corn-soybean rotation, our yields increased by 5 bushel to the acre. So 5 bushel to the acre increase in a corn-soybean wheat rotation versus a corn-soybean rotation. 2010 yields are a little bit different, but when we include wheat in the rotation, 4 bushel increase there. 2011 we had 7 bushel increase in our soybean yields when we have wheat in the rotation. And in 2012 we have an 8 bushel increase in our soybean yields when wheat is included in the rotation. Okay, so just excellent data that we have seen so far from both Ridgetown and Allura sites. So the number one thing here that we have seen is that including wheat in the rotation, we improve our corn and soybean yields. And it is very consistent across years and between two environments at Allura and Ridgetown. And also I should mention that as rotations get more complex, the effect of tillage decreases as well. So by far the biggest effect in a rotation tillage system is the rotation effect. That is by far the biggest crop responses in the rotation effect rather than the tillage effect. And the more complex rotations are, the less tillage that we need to generate those high yields. Plus a three- Grant ball this one gives rise in the rotation by the type of cropasing.
