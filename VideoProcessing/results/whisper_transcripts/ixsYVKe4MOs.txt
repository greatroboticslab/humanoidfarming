 Top 5 best cold hardy fruit plants for your garden, let's go. First on the list are figs. The flavor profiles range from sugar to melon to berry, so there's really a fig for everyone. They're extremely drought tolerant and with the right varieties you can grow them down to plant hardiness zone 5. In tropical climates they're a tree, but in our zone they're a bush. Next we have the jujube. These are like mini apples that have a caramel flavor in my opinion. You can eat them fresh or allow them to dry on the tree and they become more like a date, which is why they're also known as a Chinese date. They're cold hardy to planting zone 5 and do well in a wide range of soils. Third on the list are may pops or hardy passion fruits. It's a vigorous growing vine with a beautiful flower which gives way to a pineapple guava tasting fruit. This vine is cold hardy to planting zone 5 and covers unsightly areas quickly, making it a productive part of your garden. Fourth on the list we have a pawpaw. I love pawpaws, they look like a mango and they taste like a mixture between a banana and a mango. They're cold hardy to planting zone 5 and when they're ripe they fall on the ground, meaning you need to beat the animals to them, but it's well worth the space and it's a very unique fruit. Last but not least we have cherries. This is a tarp variety known as North Star. It's dwarf and rarely gets over 10 feet tall. Cold hardy to planting zone 4. It gives massive crops of fruit every year and you only need one for massive crops.
