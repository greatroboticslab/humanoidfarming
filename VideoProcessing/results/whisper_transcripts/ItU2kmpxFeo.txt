 Here's a very simple, small worm farm system. It's two buckets, one fits inside the other. The top bucket has holes in it. So we drilled holes to allow this to drain. This is actually the worm farm, and the large bucket is the worm juice, the worm liquid receptacle. We have a small piece of shade cloth, folded over once, twice, making four layers of shade cloth, blocking the holes. The shade cloth then stops the worms going through, and we load the top bucket with our manure, then our worms, then our daily supply of food waste. And the bottom bucket receives the liquid. When we want to use the liquid, we just pull out the top bucket, drain off our liquid, top it up continually in the top. And it just looks like two buckets, one inside the other. In fact, that's all it is. But it caters for a small supply of food waste and gives you a nice supply of solid and liquid fertilizer.
