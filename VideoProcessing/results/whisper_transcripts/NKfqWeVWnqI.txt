 Autotrophic Plants How do plants produce their own food? Plants also need food for their growth. They can produce their own food. With the help of sunlight and chlorophyll, plants make their food in their leaves using water and nutrients from the soil and carbon dioxide from the air. This process is called as photosynthesis. 6CO2, that is carbon dioxide, plus 6H2O, that is water, in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll gives C6H12O6, that is glucose, food, plus 6O2, that is oxygen. 7CO2, that is oxygen. 7CO2, that is oxygen. Plants convert light energy into chemical energy and store it in the form of food. Water, minerals and salts are absorbed by roots from the soil. The stem transports them up to the leaves. The leaves have microscopic openings called stomata, through which they take in the carbon dioxide from the air. The chloroplasts present in the leaves contain chlorophyll, which absorbs sunlight, helping to convert carbon dioxide and water into food. Oxygen is given out in this process. Besides leaves, photosynthesis takes place in some other parts, like green stems, too, as they contain chlorophyll. Quincy and alkal прям Wit, we release the Cyrusit. And the brсь will take the poo7.
