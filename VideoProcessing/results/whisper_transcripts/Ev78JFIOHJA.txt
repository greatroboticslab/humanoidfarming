Education
 Once a breed is lost, it's gone forever and we can never get it back. Dad was a great fan of rare breeds conservation, breeds that had gone out of fashion. And he saved many of them from extinction and he started the Rare Breed Survival Trust. We all felt that the rare breeds world had to have an organisation of its own to do its own job. And this is really why we formed the Rare Breed Survival Trust. And I've taken on his passion and continue his legacy. And what's important about these indigenous British native breeds is that we look after them and preserve them. They're part of our living heritage. They're stacked with stories of where they come from and the landscape they've shaped.
