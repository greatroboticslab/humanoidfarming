 What kind of sustainability practices are you putting in place to make what you do sustainable and also to keep producing the product? One of the key sustainability practices we put in place is a rotational grazing system where the animals are used in large mobs to provide a short graze period followed by the required amount of rest and then we vary the amount of rest depending on the types of seasons we're having and so one of the key benefits of that is that we can manage the pastures to their best level which is best for the pastures which is then also best for the livestock because it's linking livestock performance with ecological health.
