 Building a grazing table for 50. So first we're going to lay down our parchment paper to create that barrier and then we're going to add all of our carbs and our dips are going to go on it. Next we like to put all the vegetables in to just kind of give it a little bit of color and then we're going to put in all the cheeses. This table has 22 different kinds of cheese so then we're going to take our salami and our meats and we're going to kind of fill in those large gapped areas we have and then we're going to top it all off with the nuts, the fruit, the florals and voila! Lunch with a few!
