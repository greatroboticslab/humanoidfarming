 Oh hey my friends, oh really it's hey it's me handyman Howe. I hope you're doing absolutely awesome today we're here at Williamson Hay Farm in King Street South Carolina. I'm gonna be learning all about hay, where it comes from, what it's for, and how to collect it. It's gonna be a great day. Well hey come on let's go. Alright here we go. Safety first. Seatbelt. Let's see there we go. Got it. Let's tighten it up. Let's see here. Oh perfect. Got that on. Let's see. Oh we need to turn on our hay baler. Oh there it is. Oh it's working great. Okay let's go. Clutch in. It's got all kinds of really cool stuff in here. Let's get our clutch in. We need to put it in that first gear. And we're off. Oh yeah here we go. Oh this is gonna be so much fun. Whoa. Oh yes this is great. We've got a big day of hay baling ahead of us. Let's do this. Oh wow. You see that? That is a wheel rake. And it is taking the cut hay and it's making it into rows. And the rakes are in the v-shape. They spin really fast and they pull the hay together. Awesome job. We're doing such a great job. And you can see them all over there. Look at all of the bales over there. Oh yeah. This is great. Oh wow. My friends. Check it out. This is it. This is the hay baler. Oh wait. This is just a tractor. But it's actually attached to it. Come here. Look. This is the hay baler. This is a round hay baler. Let's see. You've got square hay bales. And you've got round hay bales. And this is what makes those gigantic round bales of hay. Oh wow. Oh. Check this out. So it's operated off of hydraulics. And this awesome drive shaft. Look. There's the drive shaft. Yep. We've got all our hydraulic hoses. It's connected to this amazing piece of machinery. So this is how it works. Down here. Come on. Maybe you've got hay down here. This is called the throat. It's like a gigantic mouth. Oh. And you see there's pickup teeth. You see those? Oh. Mouth, throat, and teeth. That's pretty awesome. So those pickup teeth, they rotate around and around and around and around. And that's what picks up the hay. And it sends it straight up into this gigantic compartment. It's called the hay chamber. Oh. And what happens is the hay goes all the way in there. And it starts to form a big round cylinder bale of hay. Oh. Maybe we should open up and check out the inside. Yeah? Come on. All right. Here we go. We crawl up here. Open our door. Okay. Let's see. All right. We've got to twist this. Oh. There we go. Okay. So we've got that part. And now let's open it. Oh, look. It's opening up. Oh, wow. Look. It's opening. Can you see? We've got to be really careful. You can see all of the pickup teeth that are spinning. And then it spins right up into here. Look. Look at all these different belts that spin together. And that's what creates the big round bale. Oh, look. See them? Let's see. There's one. There's two. There's three. Four. Five. Six. There's six gigantic belts that are spinning around that creates that round cylinder bale. And you know, they get up to five feet tall, four feet wide. That's a big bale of hay. And whenever it finishes, there's an alarm that goes off in the cab. And then it's time for the net wrap. You have to wrap the bale of hay in the net wrap. Oh. Do you want to see that? Oh, check this out. All right. Here we go. Oh, yeah. It's ready. Oh, yeah. Come on. Come check this out. So right here, underneath this latch. Oh, look. It's the net wrap. And this is what we use to wrap the bale of hay once it's finished inside the chamber. Can you see it? It kind of looks like a net right there. Oh, we got one for extra just in case we need it. We do have a lot of hay. We've got a bale today. Oh. And so once it's finished wrapping with the net wrap and it's all done, there's an alarm that goes off in the cab to let you know you need to eject it. So you have to open it up and the finished bale rolls right out. And you close it back and you keep on going. Wow. Isn't this awesome? I totally cannot wait to see this in action. Come on. Let's go. This is awesome. It's got so many different things in here. All kinds of cool technology, like our screen here. This is telling us how much hay is actually in the chamber. Yep. So as we go, it collects it. That's what it's doing now. It's collecting it. Oh, yep. And then whenever we're full, it's going to let us know. That way we can wrap it with the net wrap. And then we can eject it. Oh, wow. This is great. Oh, thank goodness. It's got air conditioner in here. Because it is a little warm outside today. Oh, what if it's got a radio? Oh, look, it does. Oh, yeah. Look at this. Oh, yeah. Look at this. Let's keep on going. Kind of straddle this hay. Look, it's working great. Oh, this is awesome. Oh, yes. Here we go. Wow. This is a big field. This is going to take a long day. Well, thank goodness we've got a hay baler to help us out. Oh, yeah. Oh, did you hear it? There's the alarm. It says it's almost full. Oh, and look. It's telling us to eject it. Okay. So, here we go. Slow down and let's open it up. Oh, wow. There it goes. Did you see it? Nope. We're going to close it back. And continue on. Wow. That was amazing. That was our first bale of hay. Wow. This is so awesome. This is so much fun. Oh, wow. Look at this, my friends. This is a hay field. Doesn't this look awesome? Oh, and look. Look at it right here and it looks kind of like grass. Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, the Williamson Hay Farm has been in business for over 25 years. And they have over 100 acres full of hay. Now, this field right here, this field, it's got about four to five more weeks and it'll be fully mature. And then they can harvest it. You know, hay is really important because we use it to feed all kinds of animals, like horses and cows and even goats. When here at this farm, they produce a thousand round bales of hay and 2,500 square bales of hay. That's a lot of hay. Oh, maybe we should check out the bales. Come on, let's go. Whoa. Oh, wow. Look, these are the bales. We've got a square bale. See, it's in the shape of a square. Oh, and we've got one of these. It's a gigantic round bale. Check that out. Oh, you know, 16 of these, 16 of these squares can fit into this one gigantic bale. Yep. So these weigh 50 pounds.

So now, we've just got to get it in the shed. We've got to put it in the shed to protect it. Got to keep it from rain and moisture. Yep. You know, this being the last one, we're getting to use a really awesome piece of machinery to move these bales. Check it out. Look what this is! It's a gravel tractor. And it's got this gigantic gravel on the front. Oh, so come on. Let's get to it and move this last bale of hay. All right, here we go. Right on in. Seat belt first. There we go. Woo! God, I love the air conditioner. Okay, so let's get this in gear. Here we go. Let's go. So what we're going to do is we've got to position the gravel right over the top of the veil, right into the center of it, like right there. Perfect. All right. Now we get to use our joystick. We're going to lower it down right on the top of it. Just like that. Oh, a little bit higher there. Let's see. Oh, and right there. Okay. And now we get to close the grapple. Just like that. Perfect. All right, so we're going to lift it up. Just like that. And then we're going to tilt the grapple out. Because this is how we're going to stack it. Just like that. All right, here we go.

Oh, and we got to use some really awesome equipment to get the job done today. Like the hay baler. The best part is seeing the bales ejected out of the back of the baler. It's my favorite part. Oh, and then we got to use this piece of machinery. The gravel tractor. It's awesome. It's really good for helping us move the bales from place to place. Even helping us stack them in the shed.
