 Music Today I'm back out on the Richardson farm and we're harvesting some wheat and I thought that would be a great opportunity to talk about two of the most interesting things I've learned during my time here, which are crop rotation and zero till. Music Music Music Crop rotation means that this wheat won't be wheat next year. It will likely be canola. Crop rotations follow a typical four year rotation between oil seed to cereal to pulse back to cereal. And the rotation takes place because different plants leave a different amount of residue. Residue being organic matter or plant leftovers. This is residue. And a field with less residue will dry quicker and that allows for seeding to take place earlier in the spring. Residue can also be beneficial. For example, the residue from a crop of lentils is full of nitrogen, which is absorbed into the soil benefiting future crops. Music Music Music Zero till is pretty self explanatory I hope. Done are the days of old McDonald with a plow and a horse going across fields. Tilling breaks the surface of the soil, exposing the moisture locked beneath to the hot sun. That dries out the soil, which is, you know, not good for growing plants that need moisture. So, a zero till, like these leftover lentils. With the lid on, moisture is safely trapped inside. But take the lid off and introduce a warm prairie wind and you can quickly lose moisture along with a bit of your soil. Music Music Personally, I find crop rotation and zero till incredibly interesting because they're both simple practices that significantly increase sustainability and production. Music Oh yeah, and because I love numbers, in 2015 Saskatchewan contributed 85% of Canada's total germ production. This year, just like I said with the canola last time, we're going to have to wait and see.
