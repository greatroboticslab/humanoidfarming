 Shopping for tractors can get confusing, which is why we've done a ton of research to bring you this top five list of subcompact tractors available to buy in 2024. Now there are a ton of tractors to choose from beyond what's on this list. So when you don't see your tractor in this video, it's because your tractor sucks. Just kidding. Just kidding. I did throw in a bonus tractor, so stick around for that and stick around for some graphs. I'll compare all these tractors side by side along with the prices so you can decide which one fits your needs best. So make sure to check out that graph at the end.

The SA325 is no exception and is a class leader among subcompact tractors. From head to toe, this hydrostatic tractor is designed with comfort and ease of use in mind. All the major components are easy to access and the controls are seemingly perfectly placed to minimize fatigue during use. It lifts just over 1200 pounds in the front and back, which is pretty impressive for a 24 horsepower tractor. New to this year is the rear hydraulics that come standard, allowing you to run hydraulically powered attachments. Or a hydraulic top and side link. A rear hydraulic side glass allows you to simply check how much fluid you have. You also get interlink technology, which means the engine, transmission, front axle and final drive are all engineered by Yanmar. So that the tractor has maximum fuel efficiency and power transfer. Finally, all the Yanmar tractors come standard with an industry leading 10 year powertrain warranty. Now don't forget, you'll get to see all the prices of these tractors at the end of this video. The John Deere 2025R is one of the most popular subcompact tractors in the United States. Not only because of the plethora of Deere dealers across the country, but also because of the reliability the tractors provide. The engine is a super reliable Yanmar 24 horsepower diesel and all the controls are thoughtfully placed. You do get a small toolbox, which is nice. You also get cruise control and a tilt steering wheel. The lifting power could be better on this tractor with a three point lift capacity of 915 pounds and a loader lift capacity of just 800 pounds. Making it one of the least capable in terms of lifting and power out there in this horsepower range. The front attachment style is the John Deere proprietary quick attach. And like most other subcompact tractors in 2024, you get a quick disconnect loader. I like that the engine is pretty easy to access with simple to remove side panels. And like many other tractors in this category, you get a six year powertrain warranty. Zetter is most popular for their larger utility tractors. However, this little 24 horsepower subcompact packs in some serious performance capabilities. Plus you get this tractor with a loader and backhoe for less than the comparable John Deere with just a loader. Which makes this tractor a great option for users who are already considering a backhoe. You do get a reliable 25 horsepower Yanmar diesel engine. The lift capacity is also really great at 1325 pounds in the front and back. I also like that it comes standard with a skid steer quick attach bucket. So you'll have a wide array of front attachments to choose from. The implement hydraulic flow is 4.7 GPM, which is pretty high for a tractor of this size. And new to 2024, you get a standard third function in the front, allowing you to run a grapple or other hydraulic powered attachments right out of the box. You do get a solid six year powertrain warranty as well. The M25 HT should be a top contender if you want the best value out there. Especially if you are already considering getting a backhoe on your tractor. Summit is one of the newest brands on this list. The company was founded only four years ago back in 2020. And since their launch, they have caused quite a stir in the tractor industry. Because they pack in a ton of standard features for a cost that's pretty competitive. The TX-25 features a 24.7 horsepower Mitsubishi diesel engine. Like most other tractors this size, it does have two ranges. While the lift capacity is not the highest at 1100 pounds in the front and back, this tractor makes up for it by coming with some really great standard features. You get a premium seat, front and rear hydraulics, rear work lights, foldable mirrors, and a toolbox. Access to the engine is really good as well. All in all, this tractor looks really great on paper. But it is important to note that all the features that come standard on this tractor are optional upgrades on basically every other tractor out there. The Kubota B2601 is a pretty solid 24 horsepower tractor. While it does not come with a ton of standard features like other tractors, many tractor buyers have gone with the Kubota because of the wide array of available options. And the amount of dealers there are as well. The tractor features their own Kubota 24 horsepower diesel engine. The lifting capacity in the back is pretty solid at 1400 pounds. While the front lift capacity could be better at just 948 pounds. However, you do get a handy skid steer quick attach bucket and quick disconnect loader. It also comes with a tilt steering wheel and cruise control. And yes, this is a hydrostatic transmission. The two things I don't like about the Kubota B2601 is the loader joystick, which kind of gets in the way of your leg, making it easy to accidentally knock. And the other thing I don't like is a personal preference, which is the rocker style forward and reverse pedal, which some people don't mind. I'm just more accustomed to the common side by side hydrostatic pedals. The bonus for this video is the bad boy 2025, which is one of the smaller tractors that bad boy makes. I put this tractor on the list because it comes with some really great features while still being super affordable as far as tractors go. At only $16,988 dollars, the tractor lifts about a thousand pounds in the front and just 500 pounds in the back. However, you do get awesome standard features like a skid steer quick attach bucket, LED ROPS mounted light bar, quick disconnect loader, and more. The loader joystick is in a more economical position. However, for folks who already have a bad boy mower, their tractors would be a great addition to your fleet. Bad boy offers several different tractors ranging in horsepower. Plus they make some really great tractor attachments as well. Finally, as promised, here's a graph showing how all the tractors on this list break down side by side. Feel free to pause the video to take a closer look at how they stack up. I've broken it down into four categories, powertrain, lifting, dimensions, and features. You'll notice many of the tractors share similar specifications and features, while the prices vary quite drastically. In terms of reliability, I'd say Yanmar is the best. And in terms of value, Zetter is probably the way to go, since the price listed on the chart includes the tractor, loader, and backhoe for the M25HT only.
