 We're in Jiangmen at Guangdong's first Guangdong-Hong Kong Joint Laboratory for dual carbon research. This massive testing ground grows dragon fruit, corn, roses and green tangerines. But what makes these plants so special? This is fresh xinhui tangerine, which becomes dried tangerine peel after processing. As we know, carbon dioxide is a raw material for photosynthesis in plants. Through a pipeline system, we apply high concentrations of carbon dioxide from the bottom to the top, enhancing photosynthesis. This helps the plants accumulate more nutrients and increase their yield. The carbon dioxide used here comes from alcohol factory fermentation. After purification into food grade quality, it's delivered through precision pipes to soil and leaves. Take the dragon fruit we just saw in the test field. Its yield increased by 27%, and its sugar content rose by more than 30%. In the lab, we have access to an agricultural platform that includes experimental data from across China. Using this platform, we can perform real-time, dynamic remote control. The carbon dioxide concentration in the air is typically around 420 parts per million. In the greenhouse, we can increase the concentration to over 1,000 parts per million through real-time adjustments. Injecting dense carbon dioxide enhances photosynthesis in crops, leading to increased yields and higher income.
