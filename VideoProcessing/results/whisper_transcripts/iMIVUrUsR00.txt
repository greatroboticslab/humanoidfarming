 Hey YouTube what's going on welcome back to the channel in this video I wanted to quickly show how I tell if my cannabis is safe for long-term storage or ready to be stored in a jar for an extended period of time and it's really quite simple you really just want to make sure that the buds are snapping off from the main stem so basically let me try to show you basically these tiny stems right here here here here basically you want those stems to snap convincingly so you want to hear a pop or you don't want them to be difficult to pull off so when you pull them from the main stem you want it to be very easy and you want to actually hear them snap so let me see if I could do it right here you hear that perfect we try it again I want to snap this tiny stem off of the longer stem so let me see what that sounds like you hear that perfect let's try it again so with these bigger buds that are wrapped around the stem you want to be careful that you're pulling them off correctly but let me just try to get a good handle on this one and let's see if it snaps perfect so you actually want to hear that snap on most of them and for this I don't actually snap it off so let me try it again with one more stem just to show you what I'd like to look for so starting off with this stem you zoom in a little bit I want this stem to snap off this tiny one to snap off so when we talk about stem snapping I'm not talking about this big one snapping because as you can see there's still some moisture in there so that it bends but when we're looking to determine how dry a bud actually is we want this tiny one to snap so let's see ooh perfect I love to hear that so let's try it again nice convincingly all right um and I'm just gonna leave this as a cola but that's what you look for and uh I hope that this video helped you guys out and thanks for tuning in I'll catch you guys in the next one peace
