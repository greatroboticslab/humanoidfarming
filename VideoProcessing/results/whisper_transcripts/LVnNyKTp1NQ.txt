 Hello there everybody in YouTube land and welcome to the Mr. Sin channel. Today we're going to be talking about subsistence agriculture in the developing world. This video will be going over pastoral nomads, shifting cultivation, slash and burn agriculture, which is the same as shifting cultivation, intensive subsistence agriculture, wet rice and not wet rice, and also plantation farming. So stick around as we explore these five different types of agriculture. Now while watching this video make sure to use your guided notes. You can find the guided notes in the description below. I've created the notes to go along with the video and to help you study. If you don't want to use my notes, that's completely fine, but I definitely recommend at least taking your own. That way you will be prepared for whatever quiz or test you have. Also in order to save a little bit of time and to make this video shorter for you, I'm not going to read through all the different areas in the world that each type of agriculture is practiced. Instead, I'll have that listed on the top of the screen when describing each of the five types of agriculture. So just make sure that you're writing that down and paying attention to the things on the screen, along with what I'm saying in the video. All right, let's start with our first type of agriculture, which is going to be pastoral nomads. Now pastoral nomadism is based on the concept of herding domesticated animals. Now these people aren't just randomly roaming around with their animals. In fact, they actually have kind of a set territory and it's pretty rare that they would leave it. Normally they will only move the herd out of their territory if there is a natural disaster or like a drought or war. So only in extreme situations. Now pastoral nomads, they get actually most of their food from grain, which is kind of interesting. Since they're nomadic, they're always moving around. They get grains through trade. One of the other things that they do is they'll actually, if they find a location where you could plant some grains, they'll leave women and children behind to plant and take care of grains. As then they move with the herd, the rest of the tribe, and will continue to look for sources of water and food for the animals. Then eventually they'll swing around and pick everyone back up and then they'll have their grains. So it's important to understand that their diet is not just based off of animals. Actually, the majority of their diet is grains. And they're going to be located in drier climates. The agriculture that is happening here, which is pastoral nomadism, is occurring because of that. They actually just can't have sustainable, sedentary agriculture. It just wouldn't work, for the long term at least. So that's why they're nomadic. Also, a lot of people still practice this because that's what they've been used to. That's their culture, their tradition, and their society is built around it. Today, we still have over 15 million people who practice this type of agriculture. People used to believe that pastoral nomads were actually kind of a step in the evolutionary process of agriculture. However, that's kind of changed. We now understand that the reason why people are pastoral nomads is because of the environment. So it's kind of just an offshoot of sedentary agriculture. It's just a little bit different and it's based off the environment. Now, pastoral nomads are on the decline. One of the things that's causing this is as countries start to kind of grow, they want to control the different lands that are part of their country. And so a lot of governments are trying to persuade pastoral nomads to join society or they're pushing them off their land. We're also seeing increasing communication and new transportation methods, which are no longer making this agricultural practice that viable. So only time will tell to see what will happen with pastoral nomads. Our next type of agriculture is shifting cultivation. Better known as slash and burn. Now, what happens here is we'll have a main village. The village is going to decide of where they want to plant their crops. These are located in tropical areas. One of the things that they'll do then is when they identify a plot of land, they're going to clear the land. They'll cut down all the trees. They'll let it all fall. And then they're going to burn. They'll burn everything in the area that they plan on planting things. This will then put nutrients back into the soil. Once everything is burned and cleared, then they will plant their crops. They'll plant crops for as long as they can. Normally, it's around three years, sometimes even less. After they've used all the nutrients out of the soil, they will leave the land for it to follow. Now, what's going to happen here is they'll just let everything regrow. They won't touch it. They'll move on to a new plant of land and they'll kind of restart the whole thing. Now, the land normally gets left barren and lets it just regrow for around six, sometimes even 20 years. So what's going to happen is this village will keep identifying new plots that they're going to clear, burn, plant, and then abandon. And then they'll keep rotating. The idea is eventually you'll just move back to the original spot you started. And then this cycle will just continue. One of the interesting things about this type of agriculture is the conversation on the environment. Now, some people point out that this only supports a very small population. If the population grows too fast, well, they're not going to be able to be sustainable because you're going to have to keep cutting down more and more trees. You're going to have to burn more of them. They'll put more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. And then with the population growing, you have to repeat this process quicker and quicker. And eventually the land won't be able to grow back. So you're going to run out of nutrients and you're going to have an issue then with your population and starvation. On the other hand, though, what we've started to see is when societies around this type of agriculture are growing, they start to move in. They push out the villagers and what they turn the land into is a logging industry or a cattle ranching area or cash crops, which does a lot more harm to the environment, putting a lot more carbon monoxide into the atmosphere or just cutting down the rainforest in general and deforestation happens. So the debate is still going on of if this is better or worse for the environment. The other interesting thing about this is actually the crops that are grown. You can see here on the screen all the different crops that are grown in this type of agriculture. Even though less than 5% of the world practices it, it's kind of interesting seeing all the different crops. And it depends on the culture that is there and also geographically of where these things are being grown. So something to think about for kind of shifting cultivation. Is it better for the environment or would it be better if it didn't exist? Who knows? It's up to you to kind of decide. Our next type of subsistence agriculture actually gets broken into two parts. We're looking here at intensive subsistence agriculture. The reason why it's intensive is because people here need to produce a lot of food in a very small amount of land. You have very limited resources and a lot of times what we see here is people who are producing here, they'll be given a small amount. These lands get passed down through generations. So people will have multiple plots of land kind of scattered all over. Now in order to make sure that you're utilizing your land to the best of your ability, paths are kept very small here. Roads are almost non-existent on arable land. The goal is to make sure that anything that can produce food is being used to produce food. Animals are kept off the land unless using it to till. And that's about it. The goal here again is to get as much production as possible. You want to maximize your yield. Now this category gets broken up into wet rice and non-wet rice. And it all depends about where you're located. So let's actually first start talking about wet rice. So we're going to look at intensive subsistence agriculture with a focus on wet rice. For intensive subsistence agriculture with wet rice, there's a whole process that happens here. One thing to note is for both of these types of agriculture, there's not a lot of technology used. Pretty much everything is done by hand. And for wet rice, it's no exception. What happens originally is we have the field preparation. What they're going to do is normally take a water buffalo or just an oxen, and you're going to till the land. The next thing that's going to happen is after your land is completely flat, you're going to flood it. Now this is a kind of a careful process because too much water could damage the crop and too little water could damage it. Once the fields are flooded, you're going to have a dry nursery where your rice has been growing. You will then transplant the rice, the seeds, from your dry nursery into the field. After that, you're going to harvest. And once you're done harvesting, then you would either be producing the food for your family, for yourselves, or for your community or maybe even a small market. So depending on what happens there, you might do different things with the seeds to try and make sure that you can either sell it to someone or you just consume it directly. Now if farmers are located in an area that has a warm winter, they're probably going to do doubling crop. What this is, is exactly what it sounds like. You're going to plant twice a year. The goal is to get two harvests out of your land. This way you're maximizing your food production and you get a higher yield. The other type of intensive agriculture here is non-wet rice. And this is located in areas that environment just doesn't support the production of rice. This is normally because winters are too harsh. Here instead of growing rice, you can see the different products that are grown. The reason why these are grown is because again, the winters here get too cold. And so we wouldn't be able to have a successful yield with rice. One of the important things for this type of agriculture is rotating your crops. This is to prevent soil depletion. If a soil gets depleted, well, there's not enough nutrients and then the farmer will get worse and worse yield. This remember is not acceptable for intensive subsistence agriculture. They have a small amount of land. They need to take care of it. And actually this kind of connects back to a concept that we'll talk about later, which is the tragedy of the commons. When people have a privatized land, they're going to protect it. For more information on that though, you can check out my video on the tragedy of the commons. Now, important thing to remember here is just the difference between wet rice and non-wet rice. Really, it comes down to the geography and the winters. When we're located in regions that can promote rice production, we're going to see farmers focus on that. Again, too, all of the land is used as much as possible for agriculture. So that is also important to remember. Our last type of subsistence agriculture that's found in the developing world is plantation farming. Now, plantation farming has a pretty complex history. It was used with slaves in the United States and also other countries for a lot of history. However, today it's a little bit different. Today, plantation farming is located in the developing world, but it's owned and operated by developed countries. Now, one of the things that happens here is normally these plantations focus on producing one or two crops. You can see all the crops listed right over here that they produce. And the reason why they're producing them in a developing country is because they can make them in bulk for so cheap. One of the things is these are located in areas that are kind of remote. They don't have a lot of population living around them. So what happens is we actually have to import workers here. They go out and they try to motivate people to migrate to the area to work on the plantation. You get living, you get some money, and that way also you get some cheap products. Most of these products, pretty much all of them, are going to be processed, taken care of. Everything is going to be done at the plantation. Then it's going to be sent to the developed world. So these directly benefit the developed countries. However, they're operated in the developing world. This was a really quick overview of subsistence agriculture in the developing world. But I hope it gave you at least a good understanding of what each of these types of agriculture is, how it works, what life is like for people in these areas, what products they produce, and where they're located.
