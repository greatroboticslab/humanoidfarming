 The eighth principle of permaculture is integrate, don't segregate. We can integrate multiple farm systems so they work together symbiotically. I keep chickens for the eggs. The chicken manure embedding goes to my compost. The compost goes to my garden where we grow the food we eat. And we bring our food scraps right back to the chickens and worms, reducing waste. Sometimes I let my chickens free range out here in the orchards. The bugs, weeds, and fallen fruit feed my chickens while they fertilize my orchard and manage the pest population. We can also integrate within a single system. Co-planting is a single system integration. The Three Sisters is a co-planting technique where corn, beans, and squash are planted together for mutual benefit. The beans are a nitrogen fixer. The squash helps deter pests and weeds. And the corn provides a trellis for the beans while taking advantage of the nitrogen. Layering up these symbiotic relationships while integrating farm systems saves us time and money while reducing waste. Permaculture is all about sustainable regenerative techniques. But one resource we'll never get any more of is time.ios
