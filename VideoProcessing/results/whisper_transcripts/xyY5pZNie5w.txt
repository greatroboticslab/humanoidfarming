 To get more eggplants, pay close attention to these tips. For a high yield, watering is key. Master these three crucial periods, and your eggplants will bear more fruit. Before flowering and fruiting, water less to encourage deeper root growth. Overwatering at this stage will make the plant grow more leaves but fewer fruits. During fruiting, increase watering. Eggplant fruits need moisture to swell. Keep the soil consistently moist, but never waterlog it. After heavy fruiting, reduce watering. Each time a new batch of eggplants forms, add fertilizer when watering. This strengthens the fruits and extends the harvest period. Follow me for more smart growing tips.
