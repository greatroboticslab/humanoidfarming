Howto & Style
 Did you know you can grow your own tobacco in your backyard vegetable garden? You plant your seeds in the seed trays. You don't cover them up for eight weeks and then you transplant them in the garden. It's about 60-65 days from then to flower. We have three different varieties of seed to sell to suit you.
