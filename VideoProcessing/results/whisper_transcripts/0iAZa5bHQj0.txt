Mango farming is a popular agricultural practice around the world due to the high demand for the fruit. Here is a stepwise guide on mango farming. Side Selection Mango trees thrive in warm, tropical climates with well-draining soil. Choose a location that receives plenty of sunlight and is protected from strong winds. The soy should be rich in nutrients and have good drainage. Varieties Select the mango variety you want to grow based on its characteristics such as yield, fruit quality, and disease resistance. Some popular varieties include Alfonso, Kent, Tommy Atkins, and Hadain. Propagation Mango trees can be propagated from seeds or grafted seedlings. Seed propagation can take several years to produce fruit, while grafted seedlings can produce fruit into 2-3 years. Planting Plant the mango trees during the rainy season. Dig a hole that is twice as wide and deep as the root ball. Add compost or organic matter to the hole and mix it with the soil. Place the tree in the hole and backfill with soil, making sure to tamp it down to remove air pockets. Irrigation Mango trees require regular watering, especially during the first 2 years after planting. Irrigate the trees deeply once a week or as needed during dry spells. Fertilization Fertilization Mango trees require regular fertilization to produce healthy fruit. Apply a balanced fertilizer every 3 months, starting 3 months after planting. Pruning Prune the mango trees during the dry season to remove dead or diseased branches and to shape the tree. Mango trees should be pruned to a height of 4-5 meters to allow for easy harvesting. Pest and disease control Mango trees are susceptible to pests and diseases such as mango fruit flies, anthracnose, and pottery mildew. Use pesticides and fungicides as needed to control pests and diseases. Harvesting Mangoes are ready for harvest when they are mature and fully ripe. Mangoes can be harvested by hand or by using a long-handled picking pole. Mangoes should be picked when they are still firm and allowed to ripen off the tree. Marketing Mangoes can be sold in local markets or exported to other countries. Proper packaging and storage are essential for maintaining the quality of the fruit. By following these steps, you can successfully grow and harvest mangoes on your farm. We hope you enjoyed this video. If you did, please give it a thumbs up and share it with your friends.
