 Welcome back to the FSB Smart Banking series. Today we're talking about an important tool for planning for your future, individual retirement accounts or IRAs. I'm here with Jen, our senior universal banker in Minerva Point, to walk us through the basics. So Jen, what is an IRA? An IRA or individual retirement account is a personal savings plan that offers tax advantages to help you save for retirement. At Farmer Savings Bank we offer both traditional and Roth IRAs depending on your needs. What's the difference between a traditional and a Roth IRA? A traditional IRA allows you to defer taxes on your earnings until retirement. Your contributions may also be tax deductible depending on your situation. With a Roth IRA, you contribute after-tax dollars but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. What else should someone know before opening an IRA? IRA accounts earn interest. You can contribute up to the annual limits set by the IRS. If you have another retirement account and another financial institution, you may be eligible to roll over the funds into an IRA with us. Required minimum distributions or RMDs for traditional IRAs begin at age 73 but can vary depending on your birthday. As always, it's best to consult a tax advisor to see what is right for your financial situation. Thanks Jen. Whether you're just starting to save or looking to roll over a retirement account, we're here to help. Visit any Farmer Savings Bank location to learn more and start planning for your future today.
