 There's a lot of different things that we do here on our farm to make sure that we are good neighbors. We're doing whatever we can and to keep the air clean around us. We have manure management rules to make sure that we're maintaining healthy water around us, so we're keeping an eye on that. Other things that we do to be sustainable is we put in a solar operation. Farms are a perfect place for renewable energy. We have plenty of beautiful sunlight and we might as well harvest it and use it instead of burning other fossil fuels. On our farm we're running fans in the summer and in the winter we're running heaters on the waters and then we're continually using electricity for our feed mill. So solar fit really good because we produce about the same amount electricity out of our solar field is what we use on our farm. Our whole point is that we live here too, so I would love for my family and my kids as kids to have the same piece of land and have it be in the same shape that it is now as when they get it. So good for us, good for the environment, good for the cattle. New pięć, India.
