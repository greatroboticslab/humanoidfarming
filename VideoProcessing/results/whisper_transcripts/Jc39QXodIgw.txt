 Food demand would increase by 70% by 2050 in pace with the increasing population rise. According to a UN report, 9.9% of the world's population still suffers from hunger, making the idea of providing food for roughly 10 billion people a difficult task. We must rely on improvements in agricultural technology since environmental changes are so unpredictable. Welcome to my YouTube channel. In today's video, I'll be sharing the 10 tech trends in agriculture innovation to watch in 2023. But first, please like and subscribe to this channel. Without further ado, let's get started. Number 10. Farm Management Software. Many farmers struggle to manage a demanding job with little assistance, burning the candle at both ends. The more extensive the farm, the more challenging it is to oversee every process. Yet, there is an app for practically everything now thanks to the SAAS revolution, including farm management. Farm management software. A digital checklist-like integrated platform, provides real-time data and analytics to help farmers keep track of their daily duties. The use of this monitoring and reporting software can aid farmers in making better decisions regarding all aspects of their operations. FarmRP. An enterprise resource planning tool, makes it possible for farms to collaborate easily and streamline their procedures. From a single hub, users may manage the supply chain, financing, processing, and procurement. Agriculture technology innovation will keep expanding as internet-connected devices become more prevalent. Wardour Research predicted that over the 10 years leading up to 2026, the market for farm management software will expand at a CAGR of 11.2%. Number 9. Real-time Kinematic Technology. Robert Salmon, an arable farmer in the UK, discovered that limiting agricultural equipment to a fixed lane dramatically decreased soil damage. The drainage and freeability of the ground can be compromised if machines are allowed to travel through it without any restrictions. Robert intended to convert his 4,800 acres to a 12-meter controlled traffic system in 2016, where all farm machinery will use a single dedicated lane. Accurate methods are needed to implement a controlled traffic system, which is virtually unattainable with conventional GPS systems. RTK technology can deliver centimeter-level accuracy, enabling farmers to precisely map their fields and restrict automobiles to the same lane indefinitely. Tractors can stay on course while traveling since it sends the correct positioning data to them through a radio signal. By improving soil health and productivity, this invention increases output while requiring less input. Number 8. Laser Scarecrows. Crops growing in an open field may be threatened by obtrusive birds or rodents. Farmers used traditional scarecrows in the past to fend off ravenous pests. But, to prevent birds from stealing food, farm owners and managers are now using high-tech gadgets with motion sensors. A University of Rhode Island researcher assisted in the creation of a laser scarecrow that emits green laser light after learning that birds are sensitive to the color green. Although the light cannot be seen by humans in sunlight, it can shoot 600 feet across a field to alarm birds before harming crops. Early research on laser scarecrows revealed that by reducing bird populations near farms by up to 70% to 90%, the devices can reduce crop damage. Number 7. Indoor vertical farming. Three to six tons of rice are typically produced per hectare. Yet, when adopting indoor vertical farming, producers are not constrained by this issue. To boost crop productivity in confined locations, the technology uses growing shelves that are positioned vertically. Typically, the shelves don't need soil because they are either hydroponic or aeroponic. Hydroponics is a gardening technique that involves growing plants in a nutrient- and water-rich solution. Aeroponics suspends the plant roots in the air, while emitters sporadically spray the roots with water and nutrients. Growers can manage factors like light, temperature, water, and occasionally carbon dioxide levels in indoor vertical farms, which helps them produce healthier and larger crops. Additional advantages of the technique include a 70% reduction in water use, which saves energy, and lower labor costs, because robots are used for planting and harvesting rather than humans. Six, bee vectoring technologies. Honeybees are worth $20 billion in terms of crop production in the United States. Due to the importance of these insects to human life, agricultural equipment is becoming more innovative to preserve bees and enhance their pollination skills. In place of chemical pesticides, BVT uses commercially raised bees to deliver targeted crop controls through pollination. This crop protection method is safe for the environment. The technique does not require the use of tractors or water spraying. Instead, the scientifically created bumblebee hive enables the bees to carry a little amount of pest control powders on their legs as they move over the field. This advancement in agricultural technology encourages increased crop output, sustainable farming, and soil quality. Blueberries, sunflowers, apples, and tomatoes are just a few of the crops that BVT's solution is suited for, and farms of all sizes can use it. 5. Water management technology. To make drylands arable, irrigation is a crucial means of supplying water to them as they typically receive insufficient rainfall. Although this is an essential component of farming today, many farmers still irrigate their fields inefficiently with water, much as the Mesopotamians did more than 4,000 years ago. Moreover, it might dump extra fertilizer into lakes and streams, tainting freshwater sources. Farmers now have more environmentally friendly options due to agricultural innovation and technology for providing plants with enough water. For instance, the N-Drip micro-drip irrigation system creates the ideal conditions for crops to flourish by allowing water to trickle slowly to plant roots. The method enhances crop quality and can save water use by up to 50%. 4. Mini-chromosome technology. Agritech future estimates that to maintain our current standard of life, farmers would need to raise crop productivity by at least 23% due to the expanding population and increased demand for food. Consequently, as the world's population increases, losing entire yields to pests is a serious issue. Studies have raised concerns about genetically modified food in recent years, with claims that they may trigger allergic reactions or contain toxic substances that put people at risk for illness. Another problem is that the manufacture of GMO food has the potential to damage natural biodiversity or release poisons into the soil. However, there is a potential for improvement. The traits of a plant can be improved by agricultural geneticists, using mini-chromosome technology without changing the genes in any manner. Little quantities of genetic material are contained in mini-chromosomes, making it possible to employ this technique to modify plants to be more pest or drought-resistant without affecting the host's normal growth. In summary, using mini-chromosome technology, genetic engineers can develop crops that require fewer fertilizers, insecticides, and fungicides, hence reducing their dependency on dangerous chemicals. Also, it enables them to boost the nutritional value of a plant and accomplish biofortification. 3. Farm Automation Farm automation combines electrical devices, chemical sensors, computer systems, electronics, and data management to enhance equipment performance and decision-making, ultimately lowering human involvement and inaccuracy. The widespread adoption of the technology is being driven by decreased work time, increased yields, and resource efficiency. The way that farmers cultivate their crops has changed thanks to the introduction of automated harvesters, drones, autonomous tractors, sowing, and weeding. They can concentrate on more important activities because the technology handles tedious and repetitive duties. 2. Livestock farming technology Farmers can streamline farm management, enhance animal care, and increase output with the help of emerging livestock technology, which gives them data-driven insights. Here are a few of the many inventions that are revolutionizing the livestock industry. 3. Automated dairy installations milk cows without human input, and the milk sensors also aid farmers in assessing the milk's quality. 4. Automated cleaning systems remove waste, enabling cleaner disease-free environments. 4. Fermenta's non-antibiotic treatment employs acoustic pulse technology to treat bovine mastitis, a cow disease that costs the U.S. and Europe about $6 billion annually in losses. 4. Automated feeder systems provide animals with the appropriate amount of feed combinations formulated to meet their individual needs. Fermenta's employs robotics, AI, and big data to enhance farm productivity and animal welfare. 1. Precision agriculture Precision agriculture is an approach to managing agricultural resources that gathers, analyzes, and assesses data and provides insights to assist farmers in enhancing and raising soil quality and productivity. Precision agriculture data points are used to inform management decisions to enhance farmland and agricultural products in several crucial areas, including quality, profitability, sustainability, resource use efficiency, productivity. This advancement in agricultural technology makes use of big data to assist management choices, allowing farmers to optimize output by controlling crop yield characteristics including moisture content, soil quality, and microclimates. It uses automation, robotics, and remote sensing technologies to enhance crop health and maximize agricultural resources, increasing productivity. According to Grandview Research, the global precision farming market will reach $16.35 billion by 2028, expanding at a CAGR of 13.1%. According to the company, market growth would be fueled by rising government backing and rising demand for effective crop monitoring systems. And that's all for today. I hope you enjoyed the video.
