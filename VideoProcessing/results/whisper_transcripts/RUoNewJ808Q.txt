 What was that mistake called? Oh! Oh! Okay, this is making me nervous. Okay, we're gonna do take two with these cows over here. See if we can get them up and get the bull. Gonna put some feed in this trough. It looks like the majority of them are over there under those trees. Oh! They see us. That's right, girls. Come get the candy. Candy corn. Okay, girls, you gotta go around. Go through the gate. Where's the bull? Oh, I see him. He's over there. Hey, Mr. Bull. Hey, Mr. Bull. Look, he looks so sweet. Here they come. It's really nice that they were so close. I just, I think these calves look amazing. They are chunky monkeys. Oh, my gosh. It's really nice that they were so close. I just, I think these calves look amazing. They are chunky monkeys. Oh my gosh. Get in there. Oh, she's gonna be silly. It's always gonna be one or two, isn't it? It's way hard to catch. Got him. Good deal. Okay, well, I guess we're working these cows today. He says he's gotta go to town and get some more dewormer. This barn, bless this barn's heart. It's gotta have some major repair. But, I love this barn. I think it's pretty. Alright, we're back. I'm gonna get these up. Of course, all the rest were under the barn. Just been a little weed whacking with cattle prods. Alright, got them in here. They are gonna be so happy to get some dewormer on them. That is going to get rid of these flies. I hope that they are on them. Just think they're not showing up. Hang tight. All right, next. Next. No, it's not. Five more ish. One, two, three. Hold on, bull. Hold on, bull. Got the bull. Almost got the bull. Good. He's like a big puppy dog. Yeah, that's good. Long arms. You need to hold your tail straight up there. Yeah, that's why I need to stand up. So we're banding the calves. We started doing that the past few years. He used to cut them off, but we're not doing that, especially with the flies as bad as they are. So they'll get banded. And in a month or so, when the testicles fall off, then we'll wean them and we'll sew them. Oh, this one was a stinker. It was sucking up there. It took them forever to get it banded. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Wow. So much hurt. I wish I had some balls. I wish you'd can that tail so you don't kick me in my face. Oh boy. I know. Your babies are coming. So that one we lost was a bull. So we're going to have to sell it as a bull and not a steer. And Wesley just asked what to how much, what was that mistake cost? It'll be at least two or $300. Because there's like a 20, 25 cent difference right now for bulls versus steers. So that's why we're, that's why we're selling steers. Because steers are always more than bulls. But anyway. It's not the first one that got away and it won't be the last. All right. All right. Oh my gosh. Is it the big one? The big one that's bad back there? Is that a heifer bull? Catch it. Catch it. Catch it. Catch it. This one's small but scrappy. Okay, girl. We're just tagging the heifers since the bulls are going to be leaving. The other one right before her was a heifer and she was humongous. This one must have been later. Later, Kevin. But number three and the third rib. Oh, man. All right. Here we are with our friend, Cheryl. Oh, look at y'all. Oh. Oh. Oh. Well, man. He might run me back in the truck. They ran me back in the truck. I'm not out here playing with these little bulls. I'm not here to play, y'all. I'm just here to help get you another buddy. Oh, boy. Oh. Oh, boy. Oh. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Cheryl said, all you got to do is run them off. They won't bother you. Oh, no. Those suckers were coming after me. He died kind of early in life. The other one that he'd buy, one of those Jorgensen bulls is really good, but they are a little sort of. He has got great testicles. A small bull is a better bull.
