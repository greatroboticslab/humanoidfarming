 Hey guys, how's it going? Today I want to talk about growing zones and explain what it's all about. So this is going to be a pretty quick video, but I get asked the question quite a lot, so I felt like it deserves some attention. So in order to understand what your growing zone is, let me first explain the difference between an annual and a perennial. So an annual is a plant that you have to replant every single year, and a perennial is a plant that after you plant it the first year, it will come back every single year for you. Now that you know the difference between an annual and a perennial, let me introduce you to the USDA hardiness zone map. So this map breaks up all the areas of the U.S. into different zones based on the average low temperature each area will be expected to receive during the winter. And you may hear them referred to as growing zones or hardiness zones, but this map will basically tell you what plants will be perennial in your area based on the zone that you're assigned. And the zones can range wildly. So in the United States, and I'm talking the lower 48 states, it can start at zone two, which is northern North Dakota, northern Minnesota, northern Montana. Plants have to be able to withstand temperatures in the zone two down to negative 40 to negative 50 degrees Fahrenheit, which is so cold. And then it can range all the way up to zone 11, which I'm talking southern Florida, southern California, southern Arizona, where temperatures don't drop below 40 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. So all you need to do is look at the map to help you figure out what zone you're in. But don't use this map as an end all because this is just a broad overview of a lot of different areas. It's not taking into account any nuances, any geographical differences that are minor within each area. Like the map, most maps will tell me that I am a zone six when I am in fact a zone five. But you can travel 30 to 60 miles away from my current location and it is a zone six. But they're not taking into account that my little town sits down in this little valley and it stays a lot colder than it does in every single area surrounding me. So the best thing to do is look at the map and kind of hone in on your zone and then go down to your local garden center and talk to them. They will know exactly what zone you are in in your area. And they have to otherwise they would be selling plants that would die every single winter and they don't want to be doing that. So they are a really good source of information to help you out with that. So once you know what zone you live in, it's super easy to figure out whether or not a plant will be a perennial for you. So let me use myself as an example. I live in a zone five. I'm going to be planting a whole bunch of North Pole arborvitaes this year. So let's look at the plant tag. It says it's a zone three through seven. So it's actually rated two zones lower than I need it to be for them to survive in my area. I also know that if I happen to live in a zone six or seven, it would also survive in my area. However, if you live in a zone higher than a seven, it actually will not do well in your area because it does need a cold dormancy period in order to do well. And let's look at another example. Look at this hydrangea. We all love hydrangeas. This is a city line Rio. It's got beautiful color. It's also a zone five through nine. So I know I can plant it in my area and it will survive. Now again, if you live in a zone higher than a nine, it's not going to do well for you as well as if you live in a zone lower than a five, it's not going to survive for you because you have colder winters than that hydrangea can handle. And one last example, let's look at the Supertunia Vista bubble gum. Now this is a beautiful plant growing zones 10 through 11. So obviously it's not going to survive my zone five winters, but we plant them anyway because they're gorgeous. We just treat them as annuals and we enjoy them. Now the same zones that apply to annuals and perennials also apply to shrubs and trees. And this USDA zone map is assuming that you're planting these things in the ground. So you can throw out pretty much all zone information if you're putting these plants in containers. You always want to make sure if you're wanting to overwinter a shrub or a perennial or an evergreen in a container that you choose one that's two zones colder than your current growing zone so that you have a buffer there to help your plants survive. Now we did put together a video on overwintering these kinds of plants in containers. We will link it down below in case you're interested in learning more about it. So there are a couple other factors I want to go over that can make a difference as to how your plants do through the winter. The first is moisture level. So let's say you live in a zone five and you're planting zone five plants like a boxwood and a butterfly bush. Moisture level plays a huge part in how well those plants do. So a boxwood does not like to go into winter being dry but on the other hand a butterfly bush doesn't like to go into winter being wet. So knowing those things about your plants can really help. The second thing is how well your soil drains. So plants don't like to be sitting in boggy soil even if they like a little bit more moist soil. Boggy soil is not a good thing. The third thing is mulch. Mulch is such a great insulator for plants. So if you can mulch up your plants in fall and give them a nice protective layer of either shredded leaves or like a bark mulch that can really protect the plants from any really severe cold temperatures. The fourth thing is snow cover insulation. So just like mulch is a good insulator so is snow. So in our area we got down to negative 17 degrees fahrenheit this last winter which thank goodness we're planting zone five plants because those plants can withstand temperatures down to negative 20. But we also had a few feet of snow which insulated all of our plants and had that snow not been there some of our plants may not have survived that severe cold. And the last thing is mother nature. You never know what is going to happen as far as the weather goes during the winter. A couple years ago we had a cold snap so early in the season that none of our plants had a chance to acclimate and go dormant and it actually took a bunch of really hardy trees mature trees mature shrubs that were appropriate for our area. But that cold snap just it was too early and too much for the plants and they just couldn't handle it. That kind of stuff happens. So just know that even if you're planting appropriate plants for your area weather can just it can happen and your plants may not survive it's not your fault or the garden center's fault it just happens that is gardening. So anyway you guys I hope that this video helps you understand more about growing zones and maybe will help you have more success in picking out plants for your garden in the future. Thank you guys so much for watching and we will see you in the next video. Bye!
