 Hi, my name is Zillian. I'm the co-owner of The Crow's Crop. We are a pasture-raised pig farm and lard sop-raise. We are a no corn, no soy, non-gmo fed farm. We also do not feed any food scraps. We do not use antibiotics or hormones in our meat because we believe that less is more. We also do lard-based body products including soap and lotions and lip balms and now we've also included our new bath balms as well. So if you're looking for a great quality product you can find us at the Bend Farmers Market every Wednesday, the Larkins Valley Ranch Ranch Market in Redmond, Shilling's Garden Market and the Sun River Saturday Market every last Saturday of the month.
