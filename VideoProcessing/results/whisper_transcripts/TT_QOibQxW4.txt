 I really want to see if this will work. Basically, I started cauliflower and cabbage indoors really early in the season. They grew fast and big indoors so I needed to move them into the greenhouse. They stayed here for about a week to harden a little bit. Afterwards, it was time for them to go into their final spot. We had a few days in spring when it was really warm but since they were big enough, I knew that they could withstand really cold days and nights. After transplanting, they wilted just a little bit but they did bounce back right away. Fast forward to May and this is what we have. At this point, bug activity is really low and a few of the plants started to form cauliflower heads. It looks like we'll get an early harvest which means I can grow more with our short growing season.
