 In the vast farmlands of North America, the quality of hay and straw directly impacts the health and productivity of livestock. High nitrate levels in hay, often stemming from drought conditions or improper fertilization, harmful agents from the humid environment cause cattle deaths. Darrell Peel, Oklahoma State University Extension Agribusiness Livestock Specialist, said that poor-quality hay is robbing cow herds of nutrients and producers of profits. According to the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service, hay stocks nationally dropped to their lowest numbers in 2022. In 2022, hay inventories declined down 6.9% from the previous year and 15.1% below the 2012-2021 average. States saw a 49.2% decline in inventories compared to the previous year. Studies show that 5-10% of livestock deaths each year are attributed to poor-quality or contaminated feed. Hay with 14-15% moisture is subject to mold. In 2021, the total number of cattle and calves in the U.S. was about 93.8 million. By 2022, this number dropped to 89.3 million. Furthermore, moldy hay is also a common issue, particularly impacting the respiratory health of animals and reducing feed intake, which negatively affects livestock performance. Good storage practices, like keeping hay dry, testing for nitrate levels, and preventing mold growth, are critical to maintaining the health and productivity of livestock. Our hay storage units are designed with a modular system that allows them to be easily linked together, forming an extended chain of interconnected barns. This feature makes it possible to create a large and continuous storage area, ideal for farms needing to store vast amounts of hay, while maintaining easy access and organization. Steel Mobility Creations presents the portable hay storage, a robust and mobile solution designed to keep hay dry, clean, and safe for livestock. Hay stored in a dry, ventilated environment can retain its nutritional value for up to 12 months longer compared to hay stored outdoors. Hay stored under optimal conditions retains more energy and protein, which can enhance weight gain or milk production by up to 15%, improving farm profitability. Our portable hay storage facility is meticulously designed with a height of 15 feet and both a width and depth of 10 feet, catering to the needs of large-scale farms, with the capacity to hold up to 32 bales of hay, each measuring for X5FT, and weighing approximately 800 kilograms. This facility offers maximum storage. Building a traditional fixed hay storage facility typically requires an investment ranging from $8,000 to $10,000, depending on the size and materials used. However, our innovative portable metal hay storage facility offers far a more cost-effective solution. Due to weather exposure, poorly stored hay can lose up to 30% of its dry matter. Proper storage techniques, such as covering hay with tarps or storing it in weatherproof sheds, can reduce these losses to around 5-10%. Investing in proper hay storage is investing in the health and future of your farm. Protect your feet, and you'll protect your livestock. You
