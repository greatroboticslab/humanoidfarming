Howto & Style
 Hi, I'm Tony Stefani with Hillside Christmas Tree Farm. It's planting time and we should be getting our trees next week but I kind of wanted to go over how we prepped our fields. So last year we band sprayed down and you can see the lines with Roundup. In 2020 we actually would have tilled this and made it bare earth, bare ground and what we found was that that led to a lot of broadleafs kind of taking over and taking root. So this year we wanted to try just leaving the grass dead on top. Hopefully it'll keep some of the broadleafs from germinating and we'll go through with a pre-emergent once the trees are in and hopefully we can get those weeds under control. Also last year we didn't have any way to know across the rows so we'd like to put them in a pattern where we can mow both ways. Last year I tried to try doing it by sight and that didn't work out so trying something new this year. What we did in the past what we were hand planting is we actually would scribe crossways. So a little hard to see but you see the clumps but there's a line going across the field now that when I see that line I'll put the tree in and hopefully that'll give us our nice checkerboard pattern. The main varieties that we're gonna do are Canaan, Balsam, and Concolor. Those are our main core rotations. We're gonna do a couple hundred blue spruce and a couple hundred black hill spruce and I'll be doing some more exotics this year. I think I have a Korean Balsam and some sorry Korean Grand and Nordman. So we'll be doing that and should be doing that next week so hopefully stay tuned for that. Thanks.
