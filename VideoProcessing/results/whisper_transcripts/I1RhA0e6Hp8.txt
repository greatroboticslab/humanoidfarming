 If you see this plant growing in your garden, whatever you do, don't throw it away. Many people mistake it for a common weed and pull it out without a second thought. Big mistake. What most people don't know is that it holds an incredible nutritional secret. Its name? Purslane. You've probably stepped on it without even realizing. It's often fed to animals because it grows everywhere and is packed with nutrients. But in reality, it's a superfood for humans too. It contains up to 7 times more vitamin E than lettuce and more omega-3s than salmon. And the taste? Slightly tangy, a bit salty, surprising but delicious.
