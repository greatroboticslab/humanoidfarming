Howto & Style
 We're visiting the Ted Everett auction this morning. We visited some of these tractors earlier in the week. You saw that in our last video. As we go along, we'll see what these tractors actually sell for. I think it's going to be interesting because this is the challenge of an auction. You see it before the auction, you have no idea what it's going to bring. Once we're here, yeah, we're going to find out. And oftentimes it's a lot different. Let's get started. Just about six or seven minutes left, and there's really not very many people here. It's time for me to get a bargain, Christy. I could probably get that $2.84 for cheap. You need a high bidder, you get to take it home with you. We've tried to check everything out. We've missed something. If we know it's bad, we're going to tell you it's bad when we sell it. If we sell it to be good, you get it home and it's called some kind of a major issue, a motor, a transmission, rear end, anything major. You give us a call and we're going to fix it or take it back. So you just bid with confidence. If we sell it as is, guys, it's as is. We'll tell you what they told us, that maybe it had a bad motor. If you get it home and find out maybe it had a bad transmission instead of a motor, it's still your. So anything we sell as is is not returnable. We're just going to start out with an as is piece, guys. Little $2.84. Little $2.84, guys, you're going to buy it just like you said. It's an old International $2.84. I remember when these came out new. Hey, I'm trying to figure out whether that was going to fall off or not. I wonder if it'll start. Okay. I wonder what I have to do to make it. Try to start. I don't think we have anything here. I guess we have to look at the sale bill. This may be one of those that they sell as is. One, two, all right. Here we go. Here we go. Come on, baby. Come on, baby. It's going to run here, man. B7100, folks. This tractor was way ahead of its time. This one's four-wheel drive. It says 1,246 hours. The hour meter looks fairly new, though. It may have a lot more than that. Now, you might notice one thing missing here. No loader. That should be kind of a red flag. I mean, if you're thinking you need a loader, which most of these small tractors do, it's going to be hard to find one for this old machine. We think we've got a road guard coming for it, boys. $2,600. Now $700. $2,600. $700. $500. Now $700. Now $700. Now $2,700. He sold it. $2,700. All right. Not that low right now. Looks like a late model, old dude. $1,300. All she's got on her, boy. Four-wheel drive with a loader and a deck. All right. Here we go. 10 down, no head. Down 10 down, no head. 10 down, 6-7. 6-9, no head. 7 down, no head. Got a man. $700. $700. Now $700. Now $700. Now $700. Now $700. Now $700. Now $700. Now $700. Now $700. Now $700. Now $700. Now $700. Now $700. Now $700. Now $700. We're going to have our set. Now $700. Get in 50 and Morgan. Here we go. Mr. the great state of Oklahoma. Got a brand new bucket. Give us a few days to get them, boys, but it does have a new bucket. It's coming along with it. All right. 670 6900 2370 all right it's not a current model 7500 7500 7500 without a loader what you got here boys got a little cabin closure there's a nice tractor guys hey it's a 2660 all right here you go 12 12 9000 all right here comes another 2350 with a deck 4 wheel drive there's a nice one 25 3 5900 sold a 5900 sell the little DX31 you bad 4 wheel drive no loader boys it's got the it's got the joist here it's got the brackets it's got the external hydraulics but no loader but there's a little DX31 all right here you go but there 15 ton 670 hours boys 15,000 dollar move it 15,000 all right now 15,000 dollar 10,000 dollar 10,000 dollar 10,000 dollar sold a 10,000 dollar 10,000 dollar 10,000 dollar 10,000 dollar 10,000 dollar 10,000 dollar 10,000 dollar 10,000 dollar somewhere between 2014 and it's got the heavy drive over deck it's got 651 hours 2017 nice tractor 2018 651 hours on this tractor and it looks just like it did basically when it left the factory I would suspect that this tractor is used for mowing more than anything else for mowing more than anything else. I don't see a lot of evidence of loader wear. It has the 49 inch buckets. Front tire is going flat. That's a common problem with these tractors. That's a massive. Boy, that's rock solid right there. You set way up the way up high. I forgot on these older Masseys for sure you set way up high and they have a weird shaped steering wheel to bring the steering wheel up to you. You don't need an arm rest on this tractor because you use your leg. So this is a slightly older generation Massey Ferguson subcompact 1710 GC 1710. It's got a backhoe. It's only got 179 hours on it. It's got a lot of vibration in this handle. See that? But that's just here. I'll drive up a little bit so you can see it. Look at that. But that's no big deal. Still runs high. The front end loader does not have a quick attach. So I can't quickly go to a set of pallet forks or a grapple. This one's got a pin on bucket. On the surface, I don't see anything wrong with a tractor. But an item like that is expensive to change. And I haven't been to a lot of these auctions here at this place. But what I have been to, something like this will sell for more than what I consider it to be worth compared to a new one. That will cost you 30 grand of town wood. 15,500. You can't get one. 15,500. 16. Sold it. 16,250 bucks. All right. Here comes the new hauling, boys. Four wheel with a loader. All right. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Here you go. Well, this valve works a little better than the last new hauling. But look at this. Wow. That's a long way to go. At least it has a float position. So I'm pretty sure that the valve on the first WorkMaster 25S that we had was bad. It also doesn't have a quick attach bucket, which to me is important. So that's not a statement against the WorkMaster. It's a statement against this model year. We all happen to know from from the last one that we got that New Holland switched to skid steer quick attach. And I believe it was 2019 or 2020. It's got a flat front tire as well. That's not going to be unusual. You know, if you can get it for a bargain, this might be a fine little tractor for somebody. But what's a bargain? A little bit of the car is coming out now. All right. A little bit of the car is coming out. All right. . . . 12.8. . . 12.9. No way down . . . No way down . . . . No way down . . . No way down . . . 9. Sousat . . 12.8. Here comes Tommy on the locomotive with a Mormon on the back of her guys. This is now the tractor. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. . . . The money here is 511, something over there, 711, what's that? 90? I believe it's got 4 now, but... The about 17. Don't have power steering, that tag only goes with 3 digits. So it's probably about a 1,093 hour. 13, now 14, now 15, now 14, now 14, now 14, now 14, now 14, now 15, now 18, now 15, now 15. So the 1,800 down here. What are you talking about a tractor that's like new now? 478 hours. It's got a roll wire that goes with it. Here is a CK2510. It's a relatively new model, but they've changed it a good bit. This one's still got a treadle pedal, so this one must be older. Boy, that transmission is smooth. Now, I really expect this tractor to sell a little cheaper. What I've seen is some of these older coyotes don't resell as nicely as, say, a Kubota or a Deer or maybe even a Massey Ferguson. Probably just some concern people have about what they're getting. This particular one might turn out to be a bargain. It's got a backhoe. It's got a loader. It'll be about 25 horsepower. 7 Bonnie throw with the hing defenders that are Alright, here comes another Kubota. Yeah, I don't think I've ever seen a Deutz this small and I really don't know whether it's built by Deutz, whether it's uh uh oh now i believe i don't have enough battery what do you give for a tractor like this this one does not have a loader i don't know how you would find a loader for it hour meter shows 238 hours this guy has done somebody a lot of work look at that 2291 hours still fires right up well almost right up one thing i see here is the independent brakes being above the treadle pedal is not a new design currently they had that for 20 years or more i don't know how in the world you'd ever use them you know their transmissions have always been jerky i guess i can't keep that happening still the engine runs so smooth nice this is a nice machine b2650 this should sound really good i'm gonna sell it for his wife this is a b2650 167.6 hours hey it's got the same jerk in the transmission that my lx yep there it was the lx 3310 has this is the predecessor to the lx series a lot of these sold i just never been in one with a cab it's got a full third function in fact i believe it's the same third function i have on my lx 3310 yeah it is it's the kaboda third function there you go guys you're getting the loader trackers the cab the deck the quick hits you're getting the the whole family all right here you go there 30 grand if you can't get a new one six seven i get 2657 down with an asset we're gonna turn it 2657 sold the tracker 26,500 look at that little h there boys you bet here you go there you go there you go there you go there's a nice one sold it $1,700 tenn said this old tracker come right down here two miles and this is a buddy he is so this one was selling for the estate tenn said he bought it right up here brand new boys guys there is a rare tractor it is rare the narrow front's at the gate it goes with it there you go boys original super 88 lp bearing 657 ohiof i got 657 ohiof 659 ohiof sold it $6,500 bucks guys he said this tractor had a new engine in it four years ago look at the rubber on her look at the vendors wide front thousand twelve and a half fifteen fifteen hundred one bit not close to the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the 20 23 only put down on three four put down on three four sold it 23 hundred that looks better all right here comes the case i each with a loader on our boys we're talking a big tractor maybe 35 or 45 nine thousand ten thousand dollars nine hundred over to ten eleven down five hundred over to nineteen thousand over to five hundred dollar nineteen thousand over to sold it nineteen thousand dollars guys he said the reason this tractor's got new tires the guy traded for a new tractor and he had the auto four tires on this one he wanted the auto four tires on this new one so they swapped it over and put the new tires on this one tires and wheels little 7 70 40s one get 930 hours got a cab four wheel drive there is a nice little tractor boy it just needs fluff all right here's a beautiful old tractor you should sell well except for the cab It's a beautiful tractor.

There's one like new, boys. 20 grand. Boys, you can't get them. $18,000. $18,000. Boys, they are set up orders two weeks ago on a farm sale. They filled her on the truck.

The guy traded for a new Claris Ranger under Robertsville. It's got 179 hours. It's hydrostat. The quick edge. That thing is just like absolutely brand new. Put around with the money, boys. There is a tractor like new. All the books are in the office for it, guys. Alright. Here we go. 25 grand. The only thing you can do, boys, is take about 35 to Big Orange and wait six or eight months. 26.7. 26.7. You want to get five? 25.5. Sold the tractor. 26,000. I've been there all day. Boys, there's a little Mahindra. Four-wheel drive with a cab. Got it all. Boys, a little shuttle. This tractor's got 921 hours on it. Huge cab. Very large feeling cab. It's been used hard. Pretty dirty. I would say it's very loud in here for a cab tractor. I'm really surprised at how loud it is. So it's got a shuttle shift of some sort. Okay. It does indeed have a shuttle shift, but it's not an easy shuttle. I don't know if I can... Boy, that's not a smooth one at all. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to shift it without the clutch or not. The throttle moves backwards to me. It's on the dash, but you pull it down to go faster. And I think this is a fairly recent tractor, because it's got that MCRD sticker on the side, which I think means it's the non-DPF. So it still has emissions, but it doesn't have DPF. We talked about that a few episodes ago. No loader again. Maybe you need to buy that brand new loader over on the other trailer. I wouldn't be surprised. It seemed like about the right size for this. It might fit. It doesn't turn real short. $19,500. $19,500. $19,500. $19,500. $19,000. Here we go. Buy the tractor, boy. She's a Supersteer. Alright, here we go.

Buy the tractor, get on the bottom, boys. Here we go. $12,500. $12,000. Alright, tell the Yanmar the net goes with it. I don't know if this old Yanmar will start or not. It says, as is on this side. Uh-oh. I doubt it. No, it don't have anything. Project tractor. It blew the oil cap off, so it's got something back with it. As is. There you go, boys. You're getting the mower deck and all. Not the trailer now. Yeah. Just the tractor and mower deck. $2,000. $500. $7,500. Is that four-wheel drive? Now $1,000. Now $12,500. Now $15,000. Now $15,000. Now $17,000. Now $17,000.

Salt, 13. 13, that's a little orchard, no. 15, head out 15 pounder, you want to get 15 pounder, head out 15 pounder, 5,000, you want to get 7 pounds, and then you have to get 7,000, from our 16, 9, here 7. So, here we at 16, 900, 75, this part tractor. Here's a little, come on, right here, 20, head out 20, now you want to get 20, 20, 20, now you want to get 9,000, 10,000, now 7, 50, 14, 10, 50, you're having all ears of the land, so, little money, 14,000, here's a little, 3, 30, 8, E, 30, 30, 8, E, 20, 20, 20 rigs and all right there, quick hitch and all right there, a lot of value here, just in the weights. So, right there, 11,000, you want to get the best tractor ever built right, right there, about $1.50, but I can't get how they're buying. 2650 hours, it's a deer 970, it's got four wheel drive, manual transmission, I think there's a two speed shift selection here, and then this has got four gears in each range. This thing will probably sell high, probably not going to sell, you know, below $10,000. It's older and it's got worn tires, no quick attach bucket. This is a quick detached loader, there's a couple of levers right here that if I take the pressure off, I put them down and then just these pedestals will remain. It's got the integrated parking stand, it's interesting that they had that that long ago. You know, this machine would get the job done for you, there's no question. It's got some dirt or something in the carburetor, but she runs fine, don't you? Right there, it's got some dirt or something in the carburetor. But she runs fine. Right there, $75, $335. Do the land baby, come out of a night, $75, $475. Let's do it. So it's a good thing. I'm going to go through too. And then you're going to move my down here. Now, the truck's going to pull up the truck. New hydraulic pumps, they spent a bunch of money on that tractor. She's ready to go, isn't she? Rub her and all, boy, she's good. I'll put the lower on her. 65, 7, now 5. You can go, $735. Now, you can go, $735. Now, you can go, $735. Now, you can go, $735. Now, you can go. Now, you can go. You're out, $7,500. Sold $7,250. Give it up or out the door. 12, 13, hang it in. Now, 1, 13, 1. Sold $13,000. One time, one time. Got a little $46,000. There, four little driver. About there, $7,500. Ten, $4,000. $5,000. $7,700. $7,700. Good. Sold $7,600. Did you have? Okay, there you have it. 45 tractors sold in, well, wasn't too long, was it? What did you think of those prices? Let us know in the comments section. Now, remember, you couldn't buy them at those prices. If you'd have bid, it would have been at a higher price than what you saw sell, right? Let us know if you'd be interested in seeing the attachments selling in the same way. And I hope you enjoyed this. Thanks for watching, everybody. We'll see you next time on Tractor Time with Tim. Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own. You were bought at a price. Therefore, honor God with your bodies. Don't be sure you should not have made those days. I just wish for the opposite flavor to you. God has간 you, whom you have made those days. Listen to me too.�� Think of you, who you are? Even thisardi1-112иту. Forgive me. Peace. Thank you.
