 The cultivation of crops involves the following steps. 1. Preparation of soil. 2. Sowing of seeds. 3. Adding, manures, and fertilizers. 4. Irrigation. 5. Weeding. 6. Harvesting. 7. Threshing. 8. Storage. Agriculture is the chief occupation of people in India. Farmers follow a set of practices in growing of crops. The first step in this regard is the preparation of soil. This method usually involves loosening and tilling of the soil. This allows the roots to penetrate deep into the soil and helps in the growth of microbes and earthworms that enrich the soil with essential nutrients. It also brings the nutrient-rich soil to the top. The second step is the sowing of seeds in the field. The next step is the addition of manure and fertilizers to the soil. Then comes irrigation of the field. The crops are watered, at regular intervals, throughout their growing period. Then comes weeding. The weeds are removed, either manually, or by using machines. After the crops are fully grown, comes the process of harvesting. The cutting, and gathering, of a mature crop, is called harvesting, or reaping. Then comes threshing, that is, separating the seeds from the chaff. The grains are finally filled in sacks, and stored, in go-downs, and warehouses.
