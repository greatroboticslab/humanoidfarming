 so some days back i saw a video trending i think some weeks back rather about um the dedication of the chicken when she's sleeping on her eggs and i tell you until you experience that period of time first hand you won't really get a clear picture or a clear idea of what it takes for these hands to stay dedicated committed to that particular process now for me one thing i picked is avoiding distractions knowing when to make certain moves now every morning afternoon i come out i feed them and from different direction once they hear me coming out they run towards me and come to where i usually feed them one of the things i've observed constantly anytime i'm feeding them is that she would never leave her eggs simply because she see or she hears that i'm feeding them she will remain on her eggs and in her own time that's when she would come out to look forward to eat in her own time that's when she will come out to maybe drink water eat and then go back to her eggs and it's like she has a schedule she has the specific time of the day that she usually comes out so when she comes out she stretches herself she just like cleans herself up sometimes she'll go to where there's sand and roll in the sand and do her thing before going back to her eggs committed stay dedicated and avoid unnecessary distractions so if there's something i've learned from this video is that in life distractions will come but you have to stay the course stay the course as long as there's something ahead of you there's something you're aiming for stay the course
