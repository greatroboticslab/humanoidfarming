 I would make the case that the 4-in-1 bucket is the most underrated attachment. It's standard issue in Australia on these tractors, but you don't see them a whole lot here in the States. It is a grapple, and it's an HD bucket, and it doesn't cost that much. So here, you see me moving a good-sized log with it, which saves me from switching attachments all the time. But it's also really versatile for back dragging and moving dirt. And if you take your machine with you on jobs, it means you only have to take one attachment in some cases. Let me know your thoughts on the 4-in-1.
