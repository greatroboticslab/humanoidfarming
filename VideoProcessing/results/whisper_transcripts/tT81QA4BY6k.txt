 Welcome to the Animal's House everyone. Today I'm going to do a quick demonstration of some of the best practices I've found with using a compact tractor bucket on a front end of a tractor. I've got a 3039R John Deere tractor with a 320 loader and we're going to move some dirt. Here we go. So here's the things I'm going to do today. I'm going to talk about the concept of having that bucket be in the right position and to help you glide across the surface versus cutting into a surface. And then we're also going to talk about some of the tools the tractor loader actually has for you to help you with knowing the tilt of your bucket. I'm also going to talk about kind of the hydraulic controls and then we're going to talk about back dragging. We're going to also get into a pile and talk about loading and we're going to hopefully help you learn a little bit if you're a beginner about how to use a front end loader on a compact tractor. All right. So here's the first thing you got to understand. This is the leading edge of the bucket. Okay, I've got the heavy duty bucket for this loader, but basically every bucket is going to have a leading edge or a front cutting edge. That is going to do a decent amount of the work, but your tractor doesn't have the power to just rip virgin soil up the way like a bulldozer does or a big excavator does. So you got to kind of keep that in mind. You need to use this as a tool and understand its limits. So if you look at this bucket, it is engineered with like a 12 inch section from here to here that's completely flat and straight and that's on purpose. So if you tilt that down too far, you're going to want to cut into the pile and you'll cut for maybe six inches. But then all of a sudden your machine is going to stop because it takes too much power. So what you want to do is you want to kind of evenly trim the surface with whatever you're picking up. In some cases you're excavating and you're cutting. Other cases you're just picking up gravel, dirt, sand, mulch, whatever it is that you're working on. But you got to be careful not to cut. So this this platform right here is an important thing to understand as part of your machine. Another thing is you want to realize that pushing forward and having this leading edge push material is going to then fill your bucket. You got to understand you can't see it when you're sitting on the cab. And so basically you got to kind of understand that all you got to do is push up a little pile in front and then it's going to fill the back of the bucket. OK, another thing I want to show you if you come over here is your your bucket has to try to stay level. Otherwise you're going to cut. All right, if your best case scenario is to have your your whole bucket be as level as can be. What makes it level? It's the four tires of the tractor. So if you're trying to prepare a surface or even just pick stuff up on a surface, but your tires are on an uneven ground, it's going to adjust the tilt of your bucket as far as like this way. And it's going to like you're going to dig little holes. OK, and then once you dig a little hole, then then after four feet, your front tire goes into the hole, drops it more, makes it worse. So that's why if you're a beginner, it can become pretty clumsy when you're sitting up on the operator seat when if you don't really know what the heck you're doing here. So let's just show a tool real quick that you can use to make sure your bucket is tilted properly. So this right here, OK, this is attached and it's adjusted. Usually when you buy a tractor new, but you can adjust it if you want. Just got a little set screw here. This essentially just tells you what level your bucket is tilted at. So right here, the way I have this set when it's right in this crest right here, that's pretty much exactly level. And essentially it's just a baseline for me. So if I go like this, I know I'm not sitting in that crest. I know that my 12 inch section here and my leading edge is tilted down. And then if I come up like this, I'm a little bit past. OK, so now I know I will definitely not be cutting. I will be riding on the palm, kind of like some of those shoes that have wheels in the heels. OK, so kind of like that, where you're putting your toe up and you're just pushing around. So, you know, this is my guide because, again, when I'm sitting in the seat, I cannot see what's going on with the bucket. But once you get enough experience, you can get a feel for how everything's behaving and you can you can become a pro at it. So I'm going to get on the tractor real real quick here. And what I'm going to do is I'm just going to push up a pile. So first of all, always in four wheel drive, always in low range for me anyway. So what I want to do here is I'm just going to go straight towards the camera and I'm going to try to push up a little pile. I am dealing with really loose soil. I was working this up with a spring tooth and I've got really loose soil. Essentially, what I want to do in this situation is pick up some dirt from the high areas and fill in the low areas. So all I'm going to do is I'm going to get myself perfectly level. I'm going to get down. OK, I already know my four tires are on a pretty level surface. And when I set down, I'm watching this. OK, as soon as I set down, there's a reaction right here that tells me that the weight is transferring. So if the weight is transferring back here, I know the bucket touched the floor or touched the ground up there. OK, so usually what I'll do is I'll just watch for that. So I'm I'm I'm airborne here. I'm paying attention here. Right there, I just saw it react. So now if I push forward a little bit, I'm believing that I'm taking a little dirt here. OK, so I'm looking in front of my tires to see if I'm taking anything. And it looks like I am. All right. So now if I'm comfortable with that amount, it's good. I felt a little force. I think I'm just going to raise up just a little bit because now my front tires just went down a little bit. And I believe I should be filling that bucket. OK, so I can kind of listen for the tractor. Now I'm digging a little much, so I'm going to tilt and I'm going to listen for the tractor. I can tell it's under a little more work right now. And now I can see the material from here. And so I'm just going to tip up and now I'm good to go. OK, so now we look at that. And we look at the surface that we left. The surface that we left is straight. So now if I go in and I take my tech, my next bucket load, it's going to be just as easy because I'm not doing this. Right. So it's important to understand you've got to have a good base for your tractor. Otherwise, you're going to dig. OK, now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to demonstrate how this can kind of get screwed up. So I'm just going to leave an uneven base here. And I'm going to level my bucket and I'm going to get on here. Now I'm going to go down. And shoot. OK, now look what I did. All right. I just I just dug a hole. OK, so you can see I dug a hole on the left side. That's because my bucket wasn't straight. I can't have that. All right. If you're trying to dig holes, that's fine. But, you know, when I go and I'm trying to push my next bucket here and my left front tire goes in that hole, it's going to dig a new hole. All right. So it is absolutely critical that you understand that your platform affects your bucket. OK, so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to try to level that off. So I'm going to try to find myself a good base. I'm going to get down. I'm going to start. I'm going to get just a little bit here. I'm going to go and I'm going to make a little pile. I can tell I'm pushing because I can hear the machine. OK, and now I'm going forward. I'm going to lift up. I'm going to drop that. OK, and then I'm just going to back drag back. I'm going to try to give myself a good level surface to work on. And now when I go through, I might have to do that a couple times. But now when I go through again and get after it, I'm going to tip it back. I'm going down. OK, I just felt it. I'm not tipped very much. I shouldn't be cutting. I feel level. Now I should be starting to pick up a little bit. OK, now I should be filling and boom. OK, there I go. OK, so now I've got myself a good bucket load. I'm on a flat surface. OK, I can drop that off. And wherever I'm going. And now when I get into my next one, I'm on a nice flat surface. And I just keep working forward. And you really got to just kind of get in tune with what your machine is telling you. As far as, you know, what's your machine saying? Is this, these arms here, are they moving? If they're not moving, you're probably airborne with your bucket. If these things change, now you know your bucket is being supported by the ground and not by the machine. And then you can kind of listen for the transmission. I don't really like to go full power when I'm, you know, when I'm moving dirt. I like to kind of feel when the tractor is under load, when the transmission is under load. Because that tells me what forces are going on with the bucket up there. All right, so what I'm going to do right now is I'm just going to take a little time to back drag. So sometimes you got to fill some holes. Or otherwise, you know, try to help yourself get to a level surface. So I mentioned earlier, one of the things you can do is go pick up some dirt or push it in front of you. It would be even better. But then let's say I've got some holes here I'm trying to fill. I want to build a little pile. Get on the, and then get like this. But the key is, is I'm kind of flat right now because I just made a semi-flat surface for myself. So now I can get in there. The bucket works better to back drag when you're like this. As far as pulling a big pile. If you're just trying to smooth, I'll show you that after this. But I got a big pile to move. So if I want to let a little material go. Well, right now I got, I'm plenty high. But, okay, that's looking real good. If I want to let a little more material go. Then I'm just going to take a quick little hit to raise this. And wait. And, you know, then I'm going to have more material that's going to fall down. And if I'm trying to dig more, then obviously I'm going to push down more. And I had it pretty right there. So now let's just say I want to smooth. I'm going to put my bucket level. And I'm just going to go down like this. And I can actually put a little bit of weight down. I mean, you can lift the front end of your tractor up if you want to. I mean, you really don't need to. But essentially, maybe I'll just go straight here. I'll drop it. And I'll just go with a nice smooth back drag. And that might be a good option for you too. If you're just trying to like smooth a couple. Let's say you got a couple rows up. Baby rows. And you just want to smooth them out. That's about all you need to do. So, all right. Let's move on to the next thing. All right, so now we're looking to dump our load on the pile here. So, first of all, with your controls, you can go up and down exclusively and then tilt. Okay, but the controls will obviously work at the same time. But they'll usually slow down because you have the same amount of hydraulic flow that's split two ways. So, if I go up and down exclusively, it goes about that fast. But if I'm going up and turning, it kind of slows down. But when I'm approaching the pile as I'm moving, I'm usually doing multiple things at one time. So, I'm approaching the pile. I'm lifting. I'm starting to turn. And then as soon as I get myself up a little bit, then now I got that drop down. Okay, so now if you're going into a pile, all right, let's say you got mulch. You got gravel. You got sand. You got top saw. You're trying to clean that pile up. So, usually what I'll do is make sure I get on a level surface. I'll take my bucket and I'll be perfectly level. And then I'll just go one click up because I don't want to dig if I'm picking up mulch on grass or something. And so, like, I found my baseline and then one quick tap. Okay, then I'm going to get down until I watch this. Okay, I saw that. But, again, I don't want to dig. So, I'm just going to do one little quick click. So, right there it moved. And then I'm just going to go up one time. And now I'm going to get into the pile. As soon as I get into the pile, now I'm about halfway in. I can hear the transmission working a little bit. So, I know I'm in a little bit. There's no sense in wrecking your machine working it too hard. I'm just going to tilt up a little bit and I'm going to keep forcing in. And then I'm going to lift up. And then I got a full bucket right there. If you want to shimmy it a little bit, shake it, you can do that. If you want to dump a little off so that when you're traveling you don't lose it, you're good. And then generally you want to carry your load low. And generally you want to have some kind of ballast behind you. I just have my three-point spring tooth on here so I don't have a ballast behind me. Plus topsoil is a little lighter. But if you're carrying stones, if you're carrying gravel, sand, you should have something behind here. So that if you have to stop suddenly you don't tip. But basically that's it. If you want to go into the pile a little higher up, that's another idea. And with that you're basically just going to go in here. Get in a little tip. And now you're good. If you want to only get a half a bucket, then you're just going to go into the side of the pile like this. And you're going to get a half a bucket. Tip it. Now I only got a half a bucket on the left side. You can do it on the right or whatever you want. A lot of this stuff, when it comes to operation, it's all about practice. If you get a couple concepts down, it is all just about practice. And once you get the concepts and you know what you're supposed to be looking for, as far as your goal is to be flat, your goal is to move that bucket as you're entering the pile. Once you get some of those concepts, before you know it, you're doing all that stuff at one time and you look like an experienced operator. I by no means am a professional, but I know how to work what I've got. Okay. And you start slow, learn a couple basic concepts. You can do it without any problem.
