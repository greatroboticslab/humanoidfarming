 Todd, would you like some mixed vegetables? Hell no. What did you say? I said I don't want any damn vegetables. Alright, that's it, young man. No Bible stories for you tonight. You're going down, peas. It's crunch time. Get six. Boom! Boom! Boom! Veggies. Veggies. Veggies. Eat your veggies. Eat your starches. Who wanted all vegetables? I did. They're good and you're going to have some. You've been told that vegetables are the best things to eat. What if this isn't true? What if plants don't like to be eaten? I was wrong about eating vegetables. Dozens of people have ended up in the hospital with possible cases of E. coli. The CDC announced another E. coli outbreak is impacting romaine lettuce. People reported getting sick, being hospitalized for liver dysfunction, and even having their gallbladders removed in some cases. 98 people from 22 different states making this the biggest multi-state E. coli outbreak in at least 12 years. The affected region is Yuma, Arizona. Cut fruit, cut cantaloupe, strawberries, caramel apples, tomatoes, onions. All these products are likely contaminated. I ate a salad and now I have long-term health effects from it. You know, we're in a global food system where we're importing and exporting food all over the place. So problems that occur here can certainly be exported elsewhere. Bacteria don't care about import and export restrictions. Consumers don't cook lettuce, so there's no way to control that risk in our kitchen. We eat it fresh. So there's no kill step. You know, you can clean it, but you're still not truly killing it. I would never touch an inorganic fruit and vegetables because fruits absorb pesticides and herbicides and insecticides through their skin. There was a recent study published about inorganic strawberries where they actually took inorganic strawberries from the supermarket, brought them home, put them in a commercial press, pressed the juice out of them, and there was so much pesticide in the juice, they were able to take that juice and respray the crop. Whoa. And still have the same level of pesticide protection from the juice that was squeezed from inorganic. And organic only means that it uses less chemicals, pesticides. Organic simply doesn't mean pathogen free. I've been virtually plant free in my diet for the last three and a half years. That means no vegetables, no fruits, virtually no nuts, no seeds. I've been eating just fatty red meat and eggs, occasional chicken and pork and seafood. That has been the entirety of my diet. And I have not developed any vitamin or nutrient deficiencies. I actually feel better now at 53 years of age than I felt in my early 30s. We've been told that vegetables, the leaves, the stems, the roots, the seeds of plants are good for us because they're full of nutrients. Meat and organs contain far more nutrients than vegetables. This is why the diseases are going up and up and up and up. It's simple. Growing up, we've always been told to eat your vegetables. They told you that if you eat your greens, you'll grow up to be big and strong. B-R-O-C-C-O-L-I I am the broccoli and don't know why. C-A-R-R-O-N-A-T Carrots are healthy for you and me. You'll get muscles like Popeye. You might even become superhuman. How'd you do that? Uh, you know, eat your green vegetables. And if you didn't? Well, we all know what happens to naughty kids that don't eat their vegetables. Angelica, if you don't eat some broccoli, then you're not going to get seconds on dessert. But that's not fair! But what if we told you that the whole eat your vegetables thing was a flat-out lie? What if vegetables are not actually all that healthy? What if plants have complex defense mechanisms to deter animals from eating them? And that's why vegetables are actually somewhat toxic for us to consume? If these plants are so toxic, how can animals eat them? Well, animals are adapted to eating these plants. These are herbivorous animals. Possums and Jess doses of up to 10 grams of 1-8-signol per day. Doses which would be quite poisonous for human beings. And what if all the micronutrients vegetables do have are completely useless because our bodies can't absorb nearly any of it? What if eating too much celery has been linked to miscarriages and infertility? What if eating too much kale has been linked to thyroid disease and kidney stones? And yet today, all these vegetables have this magical aura around them. Today, when we think of a healthy diet, our brains automatically conjure up images of luscious, bland, leafy greens. When in reality, that is the exact opposite of what we should be eating. Oh! Oh! There's a reason why you don't feel full eating vegetables. There's a reason why vegetables usually taste bitter. Because vegetables are not meant to be eaten. It's so hard to get kids to eat their vegetables. For millennia, people intuitively knew this. Vegetables didn't make up the majority of their diets. They ate meat that they hunted and fruit that they scavenged. Vegetables were used sparingly. And yet somehow, we've all been duped into thinking that salads, green smoothies, green juices, green powders are healthy. There is some validity to considering the wild notion that vegetables, the leaves, stems, roots, and seeds of plants contain defense chemicals. And they may not be helping us with our issues.

People were spending all day working on the farm, and to spend an entire day on your feet, you would need a lot of calories. A mandarin chicken salad from Wendy's just wouldn't have cut it. And sure, these farmers would slip a vegetable or two into their soup for some extra flavor, or use herbs and leaves in a medicinal way to cure diseases. But no one was horking down piles of broccoli or painful swallowing forkfuls of kale. Because why would they? They needed high-calorie foods to have enough energy to plow their land. Their lives depended on it. And the most dense food out there, in terms of both calories and nutrients, was, and always will be, meat. So that's what farmers ate. And these farmers stuck to a high-calorie, meat-based diet for a while. But then, the Industrial Age happened. All of a sudden, people started leaving the farm life behind for a shot at the American dream in the big city. Big cities where there's movie theaters, restaurants, and grocery stores. People turned away from plowing the fields to work cushy office jobs. And their wives had all the time in the world to cook all sorts of different meals at home. People didn't want to eat the same food as low-class farmers now, did they? That was behind them. Plus, meat is expensive. So now, the American population started experimenting with new cuisines, new recipes, new ingredients. New ingredients like vegetables. In every other culture around the world, raw vegetables were either consumed very sparingly for medicinal purposes, or for a bit of flavor. But come on! This is the golden age of America. Let's import every vegetable we can. And let's eat vegetables in every way possible. We have the time. We have the money. So why not? So Americans started to get creative with raw vegetables. There was the Aspic salad of the 60s, the spinach souffle of the 70s, the broccoli cheddar salad of the 80s. And slowly but surely, vegetables started taking over the American palate. And because vegetables are pretty much calorie-free, it made the perfect target for the weight loss industry. Kale. It's crunchy. It's crisp. It kind of tastes like grass clippings. But according to the biggest health experts in America, kale is the superfood. MVP of greens. It is King Kale. Because it's one of the most nutritious vegetables. I knew kale before it was kale. It's the holy grail of nutrition. But here's what you may not realize. Only 10 years ago, kale was just a sad, wilted mess underneath the Pizza Hut salad bar. So how did this lowly vegetable undergo this incredible transformation? Well, it was all thanks to one woman, Miss Oberyn Sinclair. Oberyn is the owner of the New York City PR firm, My Young Auntie. And Miss Oberyn had one simple dream, to get America to eat more kale. Why? Because I've been trying to convert people for years to eat in a healthy way. I've always loved kale. It is an amazing vegetable. And so, she used her skills to make kale the hottest thing since avocado toast. She got Beyonce to wear a kale sweatshirt. She convinced New York restaurants to put kale on their menus. She even created a fake Facebook page for the American Kale Association. Which isn't even a real association. She literally made it up out of the air. And yet, somehow, it worked. Kale! Kale! Kale! Kale! Kale! Kale! Kale! Today, you can find kale everywhere. It's being massaged into salads. It's being blended into smoothies. McDonald's even put out a kale breakfast bowl. And that would be fine if kale was actually healthy for you. But the truth is, kale is shockingly bad for you. See, back in the day, farmers tried to feed kale to their sheep. And the results were nothing short of horrifying. Because of the sheep's high kale diet, they ended up giving birth to babies with massive goiters. A goiter is when a sheep has a giant bulge on its throat, like this. But on top of that, a lot of the baby lambs developed major brain abnormalities. Some were even stillborn. And cows that were fed kale in Tasmania? They produced milk that ended up causing thyroid disease in the children who drank it. If you don't know, your thyroid gland is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located below your Adam's apple. Your thyroid gland is responsible for making two main hormones that affect every cell in the body. And they play a key role in how fast your body uses fats and carbohydrates. In other words, your thyroid plays a key role in your metabolism. So you definitely don't want to hurt your thyroid or get a thyroid disease. Thyroid disease can mean your thyroid doesn't produce enough of the thyroid hormones your body needs. Or it can produce too much. Or you can also develop a goiter like those sheep. That is what's happening when you eat kale. And yet, health-conscious Americans will just keep gobbling it down like there's no tomorrow. And sure, you're not going to get thyroid disease after one or two kale smoothies. But it is definitely a net negative for your body. And here's the thing. The exact same thing happened with celery. Before, celery was consumed here and there. But it wouldn't be until five years ago that America would get really hooked on it. And it was all thanks to this guy, Anthony William, a famous psychic. Many people shortly after drinking 16 ounces of celery juice on an empty stomach every single day experience less digestive problems. They get rid of acid reflux. They feel more energy. They feel more clear. Their brain fog dissipates. They feel like they're moving forward, moving forward, finally out of their illness, finally out of their condition. But why celery juice? Well, because a voice in his head told him so. For anybody who doesn't know about me or where I get my information from, comes from a source above. A source that's free from the agenda that men here have on the planet. The idea that celery juice is healthy did not come from empirical data, but a random voice in his head. And yet, once again, the public ate it up. So many celebrities have joined this craze. Sylvester Stallone, I heard, is now a big fan of the celery juice. Yeah, he's juicing celery juice. Absolutely. He's juicing celery. Yeah. That works for him. I mean, come on. It's going to work for everyone. Jenna Dewan, I've been seeing. She's been posting about you as well as the celery juice. Kim Kardashian. Yeah, she's doing it too. She's doing the celery juice every single morning, 16 ounces on an empty stomach. Wow. Yeah. Never mind that celery was traditionally considered a medicinal food that's only supposed to be eaten in small amounts. But just like kale, celery is actually not good for you at all. Drinking high amounts of celery like this has been linked to asthma, extreme sun sensitivity, male infertility, miscarriages, and fetal abnormalities. But it's not just kale or celery that's bad for you. It's most vegetables. But why? Why are vegetables so dangerous for us? It seems very counterintuitive since we've been conditioned our whole lives to believe that green equals healthy. But the simple reality is plants do not want you to eat them. The intention of plants is very clear here. They don't want us to eat the leaves, the stems, the roots, or the seeds. From a survival perspective, plants don't have much going for them. They're just kind of there, waving in the wind, just waiting to be eaten. So in order to survive, plants have evolved complex defense mechanisms to deter would-be vegetarians. For example, when a caterpillar chews on certain types of leaves, the leaves will actually secrete a toxin, driving the caterpillar away. When we chew a spinach or kale leaf, those same toxins get released. And these toxins are called natural pesticides. You've heard of pesticides. They're the dangerous chemical cocktails that are sprayed on big agriculture to prevent insects from eating the crops. But what you may not know is that plants actually produce natural pesticides. And pretty much every green vegetable contains them. These natural pesticides can cause digestive disorders, headaches, asthma, and a whole list of autoimmune diseases. All in an effort to convince you never to eat this plant again. And yet, thanks to all this conditioning to eat your vegetables... Eat your vegetables. Eat your vegetables. Eat your vegetables. Eat your green vegetables. Eat your vegetables. Eat your vegetables. Thir thousands of animals. Who are the Poor shot? goes right through us and is actually pretty bad for our digestion. Others of us have to avoid them because they immediately start to cause inflammation in the gut, which can manifest as constipation, diarrhea, bloating, gas. But it's not just these natural pesticides that are ruining our bodies. Green vegetables like kale, broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage all contain something called goitrogens. Goitrogens are compounds that interfere with your thyroid gland. They block your thyroid from absorbing iodine, which it needs to build hormones, which means your metabolism is gonna be wrecked. Goitrogens act the same way in the body as cyanide. It's pure poison. Remember those lambs? It was the goitrogens in the kale that made their thyroids so big. So many people today are chucking kale smoothies every single morning, assuming it's giving them energy, when really it's blocking their hormone production, making them more tired and weak. Typically people will struggle with cold intolerance, or they say that I'm just having trouble losing weight, and I'm doing all the same things, and that I used to be doing, and I'm gaining weight, or I feel really sluggish. So they might have brain fog, they might have fatigue, they might have muscle wasting and hair loss. And the symptoms seem to be all over the place, right? And you're like, well, do I go to the hair doctor? Do I go to this kind of doctor? And a lot of these symptoms can be traced back to the thyroid gland. And as if pesticides and goitrogens aren't enough, green vegetables are known to be sponges for dangerous bacteria. And the CDC with a warning this afternoon about an E. coli outbreak linked to baby spinet. You can get really sick, and if you're vulnerable, very young, very old, autoimmune problems, you can die from that. Washing does not remove this bacteria because what it can do is get inside the cells, so washing doesn't do anything at all. Number one is just don't eat it. Just when in doubt, throw it out. Which explains a lot. Like, have you ever wondered why it's always the leafy greens that are contaminated with E. coli? It's because E. coli and other types of dangerous bacteria, like listeria, are found in soil. And what grows in soil? Green vegetables. And unlike fruits, which are usually grown on trees, or potatoes and onions that are grown in the ground and are usually peeled, green vegetables are just eaten as is. So if there's E. coli-infested manure in that soil, and the food processor doesn't clean their vegetables well, those same vegetables could make their way to your plate. Romaine lettuce contaminated with E. coli's caused four new deaths, one of them in upstate New York, according to a new alert from the Centers for Disease Control. The bacteria, which is normally treatable, causes severe fever and diarrhea. The breakout started last month after E. coli was found on lettuce from Yuma, Arizona. So far, almost 200 people from 35 states have reported feeling ill. Look on any container of greens powder, and you'll see a huge list of vitamins and minerals. Calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, vitamin B6, biotin. You stir up a glass of this green stuff, thinking that all of these nutrients are gonna be absorbing into you, turning you into the fitness influencer of your dreams. But that is simply an illusion. Barely any of those nutrients are gonna get absorbed. According to one study, only one to 10% of the iron in spinach gets absorbed by humans. So when vegans argue that one cup of spinach is the equivalent of a piece of steak, it's just not. You're only getting a tiny fraction of the nutrients listed on the label. One of our regulars at Antler was talking to me about his experience. He used to have a organic vegetable farm, and he's a six foot seven, big, huge, tall, Dutch white guy. And he goes to me, he says, you know, I was vegan for a long time. I had this organic vegetable farm, and I thought that I was doing my body a service. He said, I thought I was doing something great for my body. And he got really sick, and he went to the doctor, and the doctor said, listen, man, you have to take supplements, the things you're not getting from eating meat, or you have to go back to eating meat. But why? Why can't you absorb all that goodness that is in spinach? It's because of one thing, something called anti-nutrients. Anti-nutrients are compounds that are found in vegetables like spinach, kale, broccoli, collards, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and more. And there's also anti-nutrients in grains like rice, and legumes like beans, lentils, chickpeas, soybeans, and peanuts. The reason why they're called anti-nutrients is because they bind to the nutrients that you actually want to absorb and basically make them unusable by the human body. A few of the well-studied anti-nutrients include lectins, phytic acid, and tannins. Now, there are ways to reduce the amount of anti-nutrients in these foods, like boiling them, fermenting them, or soaking them. But it's not perfect, and it usually doesn't remove all of it. For example, if you boil your vegetables, you also have to make sure you dump out the water to get rid of the anti-nutrients, or else it will just be in the water. So if you ever wondered why vegans tend to look and feel malnourished, this is probably one of the reasons. Almost none of these nutrients are getting absorbed. So if vegetables are completely off the table, what do we put on our plate instead? Well, first off, if you're using a little bit of basil or mint here and there for the flavor and aroma, it's probably not the end of the world. But to base your entire diet off of mainly vegetables is a bad idea, no matter what the vegans want you to think. The documentary on veganism coming soon, so make sure you subscribe. Overall, the most nutritious foods you can eat from the plant kingdom are root vegetables and fruit. Plants don't want you to eat it, but they do actually want you to eat their fruit. Why? Because when animals eat a plant's fruit, that animal is helping that plant spread its seed and propagate. There's a reason why fruit is sweet and delicious while you have to douse celery and ranch in order to be able to scarf it down. When a plant is making a fruit, it may put defense chemicals in the fruit when it's green, when it's unripe. But as the fruit ripens, they get lower and lower and lower and lower. And a lot of these defense chemicals are at much higher levels, five to 10 X in the stems and the leaves. So fruit is clearly the least defended part of a planet. And roots like potatoes, carrots, and beets are so dense in nutrients, you could literally grow leaves out of them. Now you may be thinking, but what about fiber? I need all that fiber from my daily kale smoothie. Well, fiber from vegetables is actually not that important. Soluble fiber, which is the watery gel-like fiber in vegetables and roots, is the only type of fiber we need to feed good bacteria. Insoluble fiber, which is the stuff in vegetables, is like eating pure grass. It just goes in one hole and right out the other. We're not adapt to this, guys. As humans, we have been seeking out animal foods preferentially and the least toxic plant foods for our entire evolution, which is why making those the center of your diet sends a signal to your body that you are the apex predator, that you are a good hunter. If you want to send a signal to your body that you're a crappy hunter and you want to eat crappy survival foods like seeds, nuts, grains, legumes, plant leaves, and stems, you can do that, but you're not going to thrive in the most way, in the highest way, I believe, for most people. What we've got to keep in mind is that not all meat is equal. In fact, most of the meat you find at your local grocery store is pretty sketchy. You know how you see those American-raised beef or produced-in-the-USA stickers in the grocery store? Well, apparently, those stickers are a complete lie. There used to be a very strict law in place that required meat packers to label exactly where their beef was raised, but that law was squashed in 2015 by the USDA because it hampered competition with livestock from other countries, which means you could be buying beef that's labeled produced-in-the-USA when in reality, the meat is from Mexico or Brazil that could have much lower standards.
