Science & Technology
 If more fertilizer is spread on a field than the plants can absorb, the result is an excess of nitrogen, which pollutes our environment. A new smart farming method is meant to help reduce this problem. Camera 1 is the normal camera of the drone. Camera 2 is the multispectral camera, which we have extra mounted. Using the multispectral images captured with the drone, we can observe and quantify the variability in the field and relate this information to the nitrogen nutrient status of the crop. So we can use this information to adjust the fertilizer application rates to the plant's needs in the different zones on the field during the season. As nitrogen is also naturally supplied from the soil system, we need the information to better adjust the plant's needs to what is already provided by the soil. Soil samples are collected at the beginning of the season to assess the levels of plant-available nitrogen in the soil. In-season measurements of nitrate are also important to better synchronize plant demand and nitrogen supply. The result is a fertilizer application map which shows exactly how much fertilizer is needed by the plants in different zones of the field. This method is promising, which is why Agroscope and Swiss Future Farm are busy optimizing it for the practice. the process. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
