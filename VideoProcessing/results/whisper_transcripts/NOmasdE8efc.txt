 Hi, I'm Amy and I'm a nutrient management planner. Welcome to the application of nutrient management section of the soil fertility class here at Dalhousie Agricultural Campus. And as well this section is going to be used for the training component of the certified nutrient management planner program in Atlantic Canada. I'm standing here in front of the Ruminant Animal Center which is part of the farm unit here at the Dalhousie Agricultural Campus. And we're going to be using this farm as an example to run through two of the modules in this program, the field crop module and the forages module. In this module for the field crop and for the forages module, we're going to be using the Dalhousie Agricultural Campus Farm Unit as our example while we work through and do a nutrient management plan, a three year plan for three farms that are being farmed here at the Dalhousie Agricultural Campus. Now I just met with Jean Lyons who's the farm unit manager here at the Dalhousie Agricultural Campus Farm and she provided me with a number of records and some information that I need to continue on with the plan. So I've collected from Jean her soil test reports that were taken in the fall. I've got manure sample analysis from Jean as well that were taken during the summer. And I have all her cropping plans for the upcoming year including the crop rotation and where she hopes to put some of that manure and some of her fertility goals and we also talked about crop yields as well. All of this information needs to be compiled and processed and by the end of these modules what you'll have is a completed nutrient management plan that you'll be able to present back to Jean for further discussion and just making sure that it of course is in line with her farm and production goals.
