 Hey, it's Brock here with Rock Hill Farms, and this is my John Deere 325G. This is my first tracked machine I've ever owned, and it's the first skid loader I've ever owned. And I just crossed 100 hours, and I'm not ready to do a review on this machine right now, but I would like to talk about a few things that I wish I had known before buying my first skid steer. So that will include maintenance and ease of operation, cost of operation, and just anything I think might be helpful to you guys. Some of it is going to be specific to the 325, but having test drove a lot of these machines from a lot of manufacturers, I think they're more similar than they are different. So if you're in the market to buy a machine, you should be able to take some value to this and apply it to another manufacturer you may be shopping with. So first thing I want to talk about is daily maintenance. Let's go open up the back of the machine and take a look. You guys know these are not cheap machines, and my first concern was how easy is it going to be to do the maintenance on this? I don't know anything about how these are built or how to service one, and I thought that was going to be a big deal, and what I'm learning quickly is that it's really not. These manufacturers are doing an amazing job at making it easy to service. So first we'll just open this up. Then you grab the side panels and it lifts right out. Actually, for daily maintenance, I don't even have to lift these out, but I'm going to do it today because we're going to take a little more in-depth look. I've only pulled these panels a couple times. So right here, I can check the oil. The oil fill is right next to it. Hydraulic fill is right here. Every time I walk up to the machine, it might be 10 times in a day, every time I walk by, I look because it's so easily visible, even from a distance, where I stand on hydraulic fluid. Then we've got coolant here. That level is always the same. Maybe it's a new machine, but check that. Then here's your diesel fill, and here is your air filter. You've got the two air filters, an external and an internal. This pops off really easy. You can pull the air filter out and clean it without taking the side panels off. So all I do on a daily basis is check everything I just showed you. Only takes a minute. Then I do a visual inspection, see how my tracks are, make sure nothing is off there, and grease the boom. Whole thing just takes five minutes to start the day. So outside of that daily maintenance, the only service I've had to do so far was at 50 hours, I had one real service item, which is the hydrostatic gear case, where the sprocket for the tracks is. You've got this hub with three screws. That is a drain, check, and fill. It's like a five-minute service, drain the oil out, put in one quart of 80-90 oil, and that's like a break-in oil change. There's no break-in oil change on the engine oil or the hydraulic fluid. You actually don't do another service on this machine until 500 hours. So you can't beat that for low maintenance. One other thing I forgot to mention that's part of basic maintenance is just cleaning all the dust out of the machine because it accumulates really fast in these dusty conditions I'm working in. So for that, I'm going to lift the boom up, lock it in place, lift the cab off, which I've never done before, but looks easy. So let's get this thing opened up. So after you lift the boom all the way up, there's a mechanical lockout right behind the seat. You just rotate a handle, and it physically locks the boom up in the air. So right here is a very large pin that comes out and locks and will not let this boom come down on you. Okay, so we've got an 18 millimeter here. Again, I've never done this, but my understanding is one nut on each side right here, and the cab just lifts up in the air. And I'm not required to do this as part of the maintenance schedule, but I've seen other guys just have the whole undercarriage of their machine just packed with dirt, which isn't a good thing. So we're going to do it just in cleanup. Okay, I wasn't even aware of that, but when you lift the cab, it automatically drops a locking bar in place, so that can't come back down on you. And it's really easy and intuitive to release. Here's the hat that I bought that caused them to give me the skid loader. Forgot it was in there. It's a nice looking hat if it wasn't all dirty. So it looks like there's just six bolts that hold this bottom tray in. Now, it feels like a lot of the other things I had to say were more interesting than this maintenance, but the reason I started with it is because it's the thing I'm the most surprised about. I cannot believe... It feels to me like someone who's never had any mechanical background and never owned a skid loader could walk up to this and figure out how to do everything. It's just so user-friendly. And I let that be something I worried about, and that was silly. Okay, so the pan should just lift out. And it does. So let's take a look and see how filthy this is. I was originally thinking I didn't want to power wash this, even though I've seen people do it. Saying there's electronics in here, but there's no way to get all this dirt out without water. I tried blowing it out with the air hose, and it's just not going to happen. Okay. Another item on the daily maintenance or routine maintenance is the cabin air filter. So every time I blow off my main air filter, I also get the cabin air filter, but it's just two thumb screws right above the seat. Comes out real easy. And blow it out. Okay, this was probably the first thing that I was surprised because it took longer than expected. I thought I was going to blow the dust out of this, and it was an inch thick, and you can't blow it out. There's too many places, and so I did what I've seen other people do, and I just washed it out with a water hose. I didn't want to use a pressure washer, so I just used a garden hose. And I found this manual to be incredibly thorough about all the maintenance. Not just telling you how to do everything, but telling you how to do everything in the perfect order based on the number of hours and the frequency of maintenance. But I didn't find anything about how to keep this clean under here. It probably took me at least 30 minutes to get all the dirt washed out of here, which I guess 30 minutes every 100 hours isn't too bad. Maybe if I took it once a week and blew the dust out of here, it would never get built up like that. Let me know what you guys do as far as cleaning out under your cab. Show you what it looks like now, and then I got two more minor things to mention on maintenance. One thing I forgot to mention on the maintenance is I like to blow out all of the coolers right here. You've got your radiator and your hydraulic cooler and everything right there. So I try to do that every time I open up the back. And it also has an auto-reverser fan. So periodically it will blow backward and try to clean those off itself. But the next thing I was concerned about was the tracks. Because I've never owned anything with tracks. I didn't know what I was going to have to do to maintain them. And it's not that bad. I was worrying too much. So if you didn't see it, I had my tracks roll off about a week ago through operator error. I was turning and I was up against something and I rolled them off. And without knowing anything about it, having never messed with anything like that, I was able to get them put back on in, I don't know, an hour and a half maybe. And that included a time of researching it on the internet first, getting all my tools gathered up. It was night. I was doing it at, like it happened at nine o'clock at night and I finished about 10.30. And that required me to get lights out and get everything set up. And it still probably was only an hour and a half, maybe two hours. And I think next time it might be 30 minutes if it happened again. And there's no magic to it. You just push down with the boom. It'll lift your tracks off the ground and you just measure the distance between here and here. And if it's too loose, you pump a little grease in it. And while you got it up, you wiggle these casters, the rollers on the bottom. And that's it. Now the thing I wish I had understood a little better is that these tracks are not indestructible. They're very expensive. You're going to spend probably at least a couple thousand dollars on tracks. And you've got to be careful how you run them because it's better to get 1,500 hours out of a set of tracks than 500. And at 100 hours, I have a lot of cuts in my tracks. And I believe the way it's happening for me is up on the hill, we have a lot of rocks, big rocks protruding out of the ground. And if you go up and you turn on those rocks, it's rubber. It's going to cut it. So you really want to be careful. The obvious thing that the dealer told me was just be careful. You don't want to spend too much time on concrete. Hard surfaces will wear out your tracks. But another big one is protruding rocks or rough areas. I'll show you some of these cuts on my tracks. After I finished this video, I went ahead and power washed the tracks and the outside of the machine. It's kind of hard to see here, but all the way around the tracks, I've already got a lot of pretty deep gouges with only 100 hours. Compared to my tractor, there is a lot more maintenance to do on this machine. But everything is set up where it's easy and user-friendly and anybody can learn it if they want to invest the time. So let's move on from that category and talk about operation. So I've rented skid loaders before this machine. I've rented many excavators. I've used them on different occasions. And I felt like, as someone who runs a tractor all the time, I enjoy operating my tractor. I enjoy running the backhoe on the tractor. I enjoy running a mini excavator. All of those are just like playtime. I mean, you take it seriously. You want to be safe. But I enjoy being on those machines. And I had rented a skid loader a few times. And I would have told you before buying this that I don't like running a skid loader. And a big part of that is the machines I rented were old machines. The first two were Bobcat wheel machines. And they had pedals on the floor. But those pedals controlled the lift on the boom, if I remember right. And I did not like it at all because it was a new machine to me. And if I got going too fast, I would instinctively hit those. And that slams your boom into the ground. I didn't like the way it turned. It was just, the whole thing was awkward to me. And bought this machine. After running it for two days, I felt completely comfortable in it. And as a further example of that, I got my son, who doesn't have any machine experience, obviously. He's 16. I got him out here and explained the controls one time. This is how you do everything. And he spent the rest of the day running it, moving brush. Never once asked me a question. Never had a scary situation. Just jumped in it and did it. And anybody can learn to run one of these machines. Now, if you're an operator, what you already understand, whether it's any type of machine you're operating, it could be a weed eater or a lawnmower, on any machine, you can learn how to control it quickly. I can show you very quickly how to run this. But I could put a thousand hours on it over the next year and still be a rookie. Because there's a big difference between being able to control the machine and make it do what you want and being fast, efficient, and smooth. And the real expertise comes from knowing how to attack the job. Things where you're only moving a pile of dirt once, not set it in your way, then circle all the way around it for the rest of the day or move it twice. It's about being fluid and efficient. So, I'm still a rookie operator with a lot to learn. But don't be intimidated by owning a machine like this. If I can do it, anybody can do it. As I edit this video, I've thought of a couple more things that I forgot to mention when I was out recording. Running this channel, I get the opportunity to test a lot of different equipment. For both the tractor and the skid loader. And maybe the biggest advantage that a skid loader has is how easy it is to swap attachments. It's not just that I can actually change the attachment with a push of a button without getting out of the cab. But also, I can hook the hydraulics up with it running. There are no situations like with the backhoe or the stump grinder that take more setup time. The counterpoint is that it's much more expensive to get attachments on the skid loader than it is a tractor. Another thing that surprised me that is a negative is my hydraulic output. Because my tractor is only 5 gallons per minute and this machine is 21 gallons per minute or 32 gallons per minute high flow, I thought I would never have an issue with doing two functions at a time. But that's just not the case. And I don't have the experience to say if that's something with my machine or if it's common to all skid loaders. But if I'm operating the boom and trying to turn at the same time, I have very slow response. A couple of other items that are absolute must-haves for me is the severe duty door. Because I think you can't put a price on that extra protection it gives you. and the vertical boom. Because a radial lift just wouldn't work for me loading a trailer. When I load my dump trailer, my tracks are almost touching the trailer tires to be able to reach over the side. So, there are some things I would compromise on but those two, I would not. I mentioned cost of operation at the beginning and it's hard to put a number on that. I can say that it uses a lot more fuel whereas the tractor uses about a gallon per hour. The skid loader is between two and three gallons per hour. Now, in terms of depreciation and maintenance cost, it's a lot harder to come up with those numbers. And most people want about twice as much per hour to run one of those machines. So, you would think that your depreciation rate is going to be about twice as high. And if you figure 3,000 hours before needing major repairs on a $75,000 machine, you're talking about $25 an hour depreciation. The next thing I didn't know about owning a skid loader is they are dramatically better at working on a hill than I was expecting. So, I spent a bunch of time clearing for a wood yard over on the hill behind the Kwanza hut just running back and forth all over, removed a bunch of rocks, pulled out a stump, spread some mulch, and just a breeze. I go and get the tractor and go to work on that same hill. I make two trips across it carrying stuff. I said, I'm not working on this hill anymore. I don't think I would have flipped, but it's the kind of thing where I've talked about the danger of rollover, and if you have one wheel dropping a hole just a little bit while you're carrying a load up in the air, you can flip it over. And obviously, you can flip one of these, but they are so much more stable on a hill than a tractor is. Now, as far as stability, another thing I didn't realize is it's a kind of like using a floor dolly, and if you get a little rock under a floor dolly, you would have thought you ran into a brick wall because it locks it up. And this, nothing locks this up, but when you run over something small, it doesn't give. Like, the axles on my tractor totally, the front axle pivots like this. And so, you can run over a big rock, and it doesn't throw you the way this does. When you run over something small with this, it feels like you tipped it way up in the air and slammed it back down. So, these run a lot slower than a tractor. Max speed is less than half of what my little tractor will move, and it's probably a good thing because I like to run at full throttle in rabbit mode, and it really will sling you around pretty good when you run over a small rock. And the way that's relevant is like brush cutting. If you're on uneven ground trying to run a brush cutter and it's sticking out in front of you, you go over one small rock, that brush cutter comes up in the air six feet. And so, it's hard to cut on uneven ground. Just something to think about. Now, these are an absolute workhorse for moving dirt. just on another level. If you've got to dig a hole or move a pile of dirt, it's 4x the speed of doing the same work with the tractor. But, if you have a long distance to travel or you're mowing with it, it's slow. Now, the next thing that's kind of related and probably unique to me and not to everyone is driving this can make me physically sick because as I run it at full speed, high throttle most of the time and I think any experienced operator is probably doing the same thing unless they're doing something that requires precision, you know, fine grading, finish grading, something like that. But, for moving a pile of dirt from one place to another, you're moving pretty quick and your spin, you know, you drive into it and it's bumpy and then you spin a lot right back over here 10 feet away, spin again and when I was a kid, I used to get motion sickness all the time. Hasn't ever really happened to me since except like if I ride a spinning ride at an amusement park, I'll get sick. This will make me physically get sick if I'm doing a lot of turning so I'm going to get some Dramamine I think. I don't know, I think that's the most common thing for car sickness, motion sickness and there's been a couple days when I wanted to work all day and I only did an hour and a half because I was nauseous. Next thing, it's noisy. It's got a radio. I can hook that radio up Bluetooth to my phone and play music but with the machine noise, if you want your radio to be louder than the machine noise, you're probably at a decibel level that's going to cause hearing damage. So I would 100% say use some hearing protection with a built-in audio device. Same advice you'd have on a tractor, really. Sometimes I use the isotunes and sometimes I just use my AirPods. The next thing is visibility. Deer may be on the lower end of visibility for skid loaders but even the best visibility machine, which would be the JCB, you cannot see, you have gigantic blind spots. So you just have to be ultra careful even with the camera. You cannot see everything happening around you. So you've got to be ultra careful about who's in the area with you. So I bought some cheap walkie-talkies and if there's someone outside at all, they've got a walkie-talkie so I can say, hey, I can't see where you're at. My grandson, you'll see him outside with me all the time and every time I go to move, if he's within 100 yards of me saying, hey, where are you at? He'll walk behind a dirt pile and I have to just sit there until he answers. So visibility is not that good. Next thing isn't really specific to skid loaders, but I thought I was an open station guy with the tractor when I bought it. I'm 100% air-conditioned cab. That's the way because it doesn't matter what the weather is like, I can be in there and be comfortable working. So I would 100% on any machine I buy from now on is going to have an air-conditioned cab. So I mentioned earlier that I originally would have told you that out of any type of machine I've operated, my least favorite was a skid loader. That's because I didn't have a modern skid loader. Now I would tell you there's nothing I would rather run than this machine right here. I really enjoy it. So versatile. You can do so many different things with it. But I will say it is a rough ride. It beats you up a little bit. Unless you're just on perfectly flat ground, even then, it's a jerky ride. So that just is what it is. Last thing is the door. I had a lot of people tell me the reason not to buy a John Deere is the front swinging door. And I found it interesting that the top three in sales volume are cat, deer, and bobcat on skid loaders. All three have a swing open front door. These skid loaders are sold to homeowners and farmers, but more than anything, construction and big excavating operations are buying these machines and they're putting tons of hours, professional hours, on them. Why are they buying machines that have that style door if they're so bad? So, I went with the dealer I trust and bought the deer machine. I've been very happy with this machine. I think it's awesome. But the door is a factor because there are times when I want to set my load down two-thirds of the way, but not all the way. Say I want to, here's an example, I want to do maintenance on the brush cutter or even just look under it to see if there's anything under it. I'd like to be able to lift it up halfway and get out of the machine and I can't. There's also the scenario where you get stuck and you need out of the machine and you can't get out of the machine. Now, all of these have safety options to let you still get out of the machine no matter what happens, but it would be really convenient having that slide up door or the side open door of the JCB. My initial thoughts on being in one of those was I didn't like it. It felt kind of awkward getting in and out of the door with the lift up, but I think if I could just swap out the door, if I could say same machine with the roll up door, I would take it. So, that's just my thoughts on that. A lot of people have been asking me to do a comparison between a skid loader and a tractor. I've had that comment a few times anyway and I'm not ready to make that video and that'll be kind of a hard video to make because you want to compare apples to apples, not apples to oranges. My skid loader cost two and a half to three times as much as my tractor. It is more than twice the horsepower of my tractor, so it almost seems like if I want to compare this to a tractor, it should be a 75 horsepower, 60, 70, 80,000 dollar tractor and I don't have one of those to compare it to. Size wise, it's closer to the tractor but I can't compare, well, skid loaders are a lot more powerful. They're a lot more powerful, they are in general, but they're really a lot more powerful if you have a really small tractor. So, I'll end up making some videos doing that kind of comparison but it's not really fair with the equipment I have right now. So, I've given you all the uneducated opinions I've got on a skid loader. If you want to drive one, shoot me a message, I'll give you the address, you can come on over, we'll have a good time with it. Otherwise, I appreciate you taking time to watch this video. I'll put links on the screen to a couple more of our videos and I'll see you next time.
