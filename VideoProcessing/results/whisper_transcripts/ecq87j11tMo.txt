 Welcome to the Table Explainer video series. What is agroecology and what are the key debates associated with its use? Agroecology is often understood as a science, a practice and a movement. As a science, agroecology uses principles from the field of ecology to study relationships between organisms in different agricultural systems. It sometimes focuses purely on environmental impacts in the farm scale, however many people describe agroecology as the study of the entire food system. As a practice, agroecology aims to build productive, sustainable and resilient farming systems with minimal external inputs. This is achieved by optimising the processes and interactions that happen in agroecosystems, for example through crop rotations, cover crops, polycultures, agroforestry, crop livestock integration and minimal tillage. In many cases, agroecology also incorporates various off-farm practices, aiming to generate rural livelihoods and empower smallholder farmers and marginalised communities. Practitioners seek to advance these goals through the development of local markets and democratic social organisations, and the promotion and defence of Indigenous cultures and values. For many people, agroecology is part of a broader movement that aims to transform the social, political and economic structures affecting farmers and food production, in order to advance food sovereignty and social justice. Agroecology became particularly popular among small-scale farmers in the Global South in the 1970s and 80s, in response to the expansion of industrial agriculture during the Green Revolution. Agroecological practices were similar to many of the techniques long used by smallholder farmers, and were seen as a way to minimise input costs by building on traditional farming systems. Agroecology gradually expanded through farmer-to-farmer teaching and collaboration between rural social movements on a global scale. In recent years, interest in agroecology has increased. Agroecology is not only promoted by small-scale farmers, social movements and NGOs, but also by many larger organisations, such as the United Nations and various agri-food corporations. As agroecology has become more prominent in discussions about the future of food and agriculture, different aspects of it are heavily debated. Some people are sceptical that agroecology can feed a growing global population, as yields per unit of land can be lower than in industrial farming systems. Others claim that focusing only on yields is misleading. They suggest that if accompanied by wider changes, for example to diets and levels of food waste, agroecology could produce enough nutritious food, in a much more sustainable and equitable manner than the current food system. Many people promote agroecology as a tool for generating a more equitable food system. They suggest that it empowers small-scale farmers and marginalised producers, helps address rural poverty and provides healthy, nutritious food for personal consumption and local markets. Others suggest that agroecologists tend to ignore the intensive labour needed for agroecology. They claim that moving away from agrarian livelihoods, or improving access to markets and new technologies, would improve the lives of smallholder farmers more effectively. Agroecology offers various environmental benefits compared to industrial farming. For example, less pollution, less dependence on fossil fuels, less damage to soils and other natural resources, and more agricultural biodiversity, which improves the resilience of the farming system. Some people, however, are concerned that indirectly, agroecology could have a negative impact on biodiversity, because more land is needed to produce a given amount of food, which potentially reduces the amount of land available for dedicated conservation efforts. Agroecology has received lots of attention in recent years, and it will likely play a role in shaping food systems in the future. However, as an increasingly diverse array of actors become interested in agroecology, and use it in different ways. Many people are wondering which approaches to agroecology, and which visions of sustainable food systems will prevail.
