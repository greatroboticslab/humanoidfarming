 Hello guys and how you're doing? So I'm welcoming you to this amazing video and in this video today I am going to be taking you through the first management practice or the first routine practice you are supposed to carry out on your commercial planting field after setup. In this video we are going to be showing you things you must do. It's a must you to carry out this very practice in order to get the right plant population. The right plant population ensures that you get the right yield at the end of the day and the purpose of setting up a field is to get the right yield so that you can make the right amount from a specific plant area. So in this very video I am going to be taking you through all the maintenance practices that you must carry out after your setup and this should happen within the first two months after setup. So we are carrying out this operation after about six week after setup. The reason why you have to carry out this is you want to ensure that the plant the difference in terms of the growth rate from one plant to another is not so wide apart. Now you have to bear in mind that when you set up when you plant you are not going to have 100% germinability. No you are not going to have that. You could have about 95% you could have 90% which is totally fine. So when this happens so are you then going to leave those empty species you have in between where your suckers the comb of your your the comb the planting comes or the suckers you planted at those points didn't get to germinate. Are you going to leave them out? You obviously ain't going to be leaving them out and the reason why I said you don't have to wait for so long before you carry out this operation. It should be within the first two months after you set up. It's so that if there's any place you need to replace and if there's any also stand you need to thin out a certain sucker you need to be sucker certain holes where you are probably having more than one sucker which is very possible because in the course of planting your planters or your guys could have made mistake and put two suckers in a hole or you might have a sucker sprouting at two different points all these are possibilities that would happen during the course of your setup. So after you have set up you give it about you know six weeks by then your field will have sprouted and then they would have been evident or you can go further to give it about two months which is about eight weeks for your field to properly sprout at that point in time you would have given the comb the plantain comb enough time to germinate so the ones that would germinate would have germinated and the ones that probably decayed in the course of it wanting to germinate would have also decayed. So at this point in time you will then carry out the operation I am going to be showing you and this operation is what we refer to as the thinning okay and supply okay so you supply in areas where the suckers are missing you thin out or you de-socker from holes that have more than one plantain plant growing from that point. Looking at what we have here now will you realize that we have some missing points here this guy didn't sprout and then also at that point so what we are going to do now is to ensure that we supply at this point so what we are going to do real quick is to begin to dig out those holes and then begin to supply them with suckers and that is what this guy is doing at this point in time so this is literally what we have you know done all through the field we have been going around to see that all places where suckers are missing are being supply so the reason and the essence of doing this is so that we have the right plant population on this field okay our target is to have 4 000 suckers on this field and we are definitely going to be ensuring that we get the 4 000 suckers. Question is what if I do not have enough suckers to you know supply what if I didn't make provision for suckers that would I would then use to supply okay so and that is why you need an expert for your field setup. During setup we always make provision for these supplies we have an understanding that you are not going to have 100 germinability or germination of your sucker so in that situation in that instance we usually keep aside certain number of suckers depending on the number of areas we are setting up we keep those suckers aside and then we set up the field so the reason why we keep these suckers aside is so that we can use the suckers to replace this is it when you keep these scum aside now what happens is as this other field as the field you've cultivated is germinating and growing those ones you kept aside are also germinating and growing at the same time so what that means is when you then eventually introduce during your supplying during the maintenance practice after you're setting up you're now making the supplies to this field okay it's not going to be so far apart because they are all growing at the same rate so eventually they are you know going to be of the same age group that is usually what happens so and then also going to show you reason plantains do not mature all at the same time so this is the simple you know explanation to why plantains do not mature all at the same time the simple explanation to this is that your plantain suckers do not all begin to sprout at the same time okay so this is a typical example these guys were planted on the same day and then if you pay attention to this guy and this guy you see that there's disparity in the size okay now reason why there's disparity in the size is because they all sprouted at different times okay probably this one sprouted few days after it was planted and this one had to wait a couple of weeks before it started sprouting okay and for that reason this guy is going to be ahead of this guy a couple of persons have called in and they are like should have i cultivated at the same time why am i not harvesting at the same time i don't have a sun at the same time because your plantains didn't all start germinating or growing all at the same time okay they started growing at different times though you planted them on the same day so the next question is how can i avoid this you can avoid it the only way you can avoid or the only thing you can do is to ensure that you probably use an already sprouted you know sucker you use sprouted suckers instead of sucker combs okay you use the seedlings instead of the comb to cultivate even if you use the comb they are still not gonna you know all mature at the same time reason being you also have areas on the field that has more nutrients than certain areas so that is what we refer to as the nutrient variability across the field so you don't have every point of the field having equal amount of nutrients so because of the nutrient variability across the field so you don't have every point of the field so because of these factors you are then going to have various growth rates for the planting suckers but then know that the ones that started early would always match up first and then you begin to harvest those ones first and that is the reason why you are not going to be having 100% you know harvest during your first harvest but you are going to be having about 30 to 40% within your first harvest and that is the simple reason why it happens that way so the next operation we are also going to be doing is thinning let me show you if you go through this field you realize that there are certain you know suckers or there are certain holes that the suckers sprouted that you are having more than one sucker sprouting okay i'm going to show you okay i am going to show you for instance if you pay attention to what you are having here this is having three sprouts okay but we are going to allow these three to grow all together we are going to take out two and then use the remaining two to supply in places where we are having missing suckers now the reason this could happen is as a result of you know the comb now the planting comes sprouting comes sprouting at different points so if it sprouting at different points it means it's going to have different plant growing foot and of course it's a good thing because you can always you know approach from those points sometimes you know the what you're trying to keep smiling and we are using that un artistic knowledge so please if you pay attention orkeeper you're also going to embrace how to grow in mind but with!". these areرة up right to stand in the process of swimming that says that you have喜Freezi Walis Well you see this in the process and the sores will be magicalest well you're seeing somethingzähl now the question is which one are we going to leave which one are we going to dig out so in this case this is the most vigorous one and that is the one you are going to be leaving now so we are going to be taking out these two okay these two that are not as vigorous as this this is the first to spot and that is why it is the most fun if you pay attention we still have other ones okay but this is the one we are going to leave to maintain this stand and then we will be putting these two and they will be taken to other points okay after we are done with this operation the next operation we are going to be carrying out will be the application of manual so what is the operation we are firstly going to be carrying out so the first thing you want to do before you apply your manual is you want to ensure you de-socker or you thin out the holes that have more than one sucker you ensure that you have one sucker per stand okay across the field so after you've been able to achieve that the next thing you want to do is you then supply in areas where you did not have soccer sprouts in our front you supply from those points that are having more than one sucker you also supply from the reserve you must have kept out during the setup to use for the replacement so that is the first operation so after now the next operation we are going to be carrying out is the application of manual and this has to be a routine management when something we say something is a routine management practice it has to be something you do on a regular basis on a monthly basis on a maybe on a bi-weekly basis every two weeks you carry out this operation or every month you carry out this operation to ensure that your field is growing vigorously and it's coming out great we do not want excuses at the end of the day and that is why we are ensuring that everything is done right so i'm going to be taking you to seeing how the manual application will be carried out and we cannot wait to get started so we are going to be applying the manual and you are going to be seeing how to go about with manual so for this field we are going to be doing a combination of organic and then inorganic manual we are going to be doing about 80 organic manual and about 20 inorganic manual to ensure that this field comes out great at the end of the day so guys let's dive in and let me show you quickly what we are going to be doing so first thing first is to ensure that your field is well with it even before you start with all of this operation ensure that your field is well with it second thing is you want to ensure you are getting a quality inorganic fertilizer so this is an example of an inorganic fertilizer and the one we are using here is mpk 15 15 15 so how do you avoid getting fake fertilizer ensure you are getting fertilizers from well-known brands okay brands with integrity the next thing you want to ensure you do is you get your organic manual and your organic manual has to be an organic manual that has undergone the composition so how do you know your organic manual has undergone the composition it does not have presence of margot in it and it does not smell so the next thing is your mixture ratio your mixture ratio is dependent on what you want here we are using about 70 organic manual and 20 inorganic fertilizer so depending on what you want and then what you want for your field so we are more concerned about you know using more of organic manual on this field okay and that is what we're doing about 80 70 80 organic and about 20 30 percent in organic so after you mix thoroughly then you would begin to apply now you need to pay attention to your application you must ensure that this application this manual now that this combination you have is not coming in contact with this thing it is not the stem that utilizes the manual so you have to ensure that the root is where the manual or this combination is applied to you have to ensure you give a distance of about 10 centimeter from the stem to where you are going to be applying your manual okay and that is what we are currently doing here and you ensure you are applying it in the region where the roots of your plantains are present so you have to ensure you apply it in areas where the roots of your plantains are present because it is the root that then absorb the nutrients present in this manual it is the root that then absorb the nutrient present in this so don't be too focused on trying to allow the manual come in contact with the stem because in cases where you have more of the inorganic fertilizer it will end up pulling the stem off your still very tender plant as you can see you give it about 10 about 8 to 10 centimeters away from the stem of your plantain and then you apply your manual okay as you can see after application you cover it up to avoid you know leaching or washing the way so guys we just demonstrated how you get to mix the fertilizer what we use is a 70 to 30 percent ratio 70 percent of organic manual to 30 or 20 in some cases inorganic manual okay literally what we do it is the inorganic manures are released to the plant and then they are readily available so what that means is within a couple of days the inorganic is already released and it's no longer available and that is at that point that the organic manure then pick up okay take up from the inorganic and then slowly releases its nutrient to the plant so everything is not all available boom at once to the plant and the plant is able to absorb them gradually so that's the reason why we use this combination and you can as well implement it on your field so basically you need to manage your field goal that is the only way you get quality result at the end of the day you need to manage your field goal you need to ensure that you are doing the right things okay you have to do the right things in order to get the right result there are no magic to farming okay it's just proper planning and then proper maintenance management practices and ensure you are always going around and around this operation is a continuous operation until you harvest even after you harvest it it's a routine maintenance practice simply means you do it on a regular basis okay depending on the interval you want to be carrying out this operation so guys that was what we did so after this next week we are then going to be applying a treatment to the suckers because these a couple of the suckers have been infested by grasshoppers really really a couple of insects are really eating up the succulent leaves and we don't want that to continue so we are going to be applying some you know treatments to ensure that these this barbaric act by the insect come to our dead so we are going to be applying this treatment to ensure that this you know insets are you know taking care of and are killed and you know driven out of the field whatever the case may be so we don't want them eating up our leaves and so that the plants can properly carry out photosynthesis and help them grow really really vigorously so that was it guys we need to draw the curtain at this point so for for a lot of you who want to purchase suckers all you need to do real quick is send us a whatsapp message send a message and tell us what you want the quantity your location anywhere you are in nigeria even across the country we are going to have the suckers brought to you to your farm okay so all you need to do is book ahead and we would handle the rest and if you still want to set up your commercial field and you want chidavagriculture hub to come get that done for you professionally the best possible way all you need to also do is send a dm tell us what you want and then the
