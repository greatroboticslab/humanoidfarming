Howto & Style
 Did you know that it's a myth that you have to start your seeds in seed starting soil? Just look at these ones that were started in seed starting mix, versus these ones started at the same time in potting soil. We start all of our seeds in potting soil, which saves us from having to fertilize and pot up later. After all, in nature, seeds don't start in seed starting soil. Plus, most seed starting mixes tend to contain peat, and the harvest of peat is not great for the environment. If anything, the downside of using potting soil over seed starting mix is the bigger chunks it contains. So just grab a sifter and sift it out. So forget the hype and experiment with a few different things until you find what's right for you.
