 So today I want to talk about the hidden truth behind subsistence farming and homesteading that not one channel on YouTube tells you. So going back in history, from the time of the pioneers to present day, there's a hidden fact about homesteading and farming. And that is normally the first generation to establish a homestead does not achieve a viable result where the homestead or farm is self-supporting. So from personal experience, I've grown food in three locations within about a 50 mile radius of where I'm at now. And in normal circumstances, without a lot of money or outside support, it takes one generation to really build the underlying infrastructure and to clear the land to achieve a reasonable amount of food production. And the reason for this is the capacity of production you need needs to be high enough so that you can produce enough food to support yourself in a bad year. So if you have a really bad winter, you have a really bad planting season and a really bad harvest season all at the same time, you need to be able to have enough food produced and firewood produced that you can make it through to the next year. And if you think about this, let's say you have three bad years of food production in a row. Can you survive based on that poor food production? Most of these YouTube channels that I see, they base their output on what they do in a good year. And they hide the fact that they actually support themselves from outside sources, including the revenue from their channel. So you as a homesteader establishing a new homestead, you're going to need an outside source of money and income to support yourself for the first generation on that land. So it may be your children, if they choose to stay on the homestead, that actually become viable and or profitable. I've seen many farms where the second generation is the generation that actually makes a living on the farm and produces enough food where they can support themselves and make a living at the same time. So this is what you need to think about. In one example I saw was there was a wealthy family that established a farm probably 30 miles from where I live. The reason I found out about this is they had disagreements and ended up in court. That family spent $10 million establishing buildings, clearing land, buying equipment, and getting plants in. Did you know that some fruit trees could cost you $50,000 an acre to plant? So these are the kind of things you need to think about when you're establishing food production. For instance, at my age, why would I want to plant a one-year-old apple tree when I may not be around to see the benefits of that? I would be much better off paying the extra money in planting a six- or seven-year-old fruit tree. That way I would see the benefits of my work. These are the kind of considerations you need to keep in mind, especially if you need to produce food fast. So please share your thoughts, comments. We'll see you on the next video.
