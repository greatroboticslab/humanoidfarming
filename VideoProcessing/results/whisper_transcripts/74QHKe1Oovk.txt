 Hello and welcome to Miller Farm Place Assisted Living located at 8130 Miller Farm Lane about one mile west of downtown Centerville off of 725. When you come to Miller Farm Place you'll first be greeted here at this door. Our community is secured which is wonderful to keep our residents safe so we will let you in and have you sign in and then when you come right here to the right is our lovely dining room. This is restaurant style dining so what that means for your loved one is that they can sit down and be served and relax. The menu is always changing and meals are cooked fresh daily. There's also an a la carte option, several options actually available so if your loved one wants something different other than what's a featured on the menu they can also do that which is great. Another thing we love about the dining room is the fact that there's a lot of socialization that goes on in here and you'll see them kind of becoming friends and talking which is the part that we love the most. From here you can see our living room it is super cozy and warm the fireplace is wonderful. We've done holiday parties here there's exercise class in the morning we'll have musical guests come in families can come in and gather together and use this space it really does feel like home and that's a space that we all really love. When we come through past the living room you will come into the sun room. This space is awesome because in the winter time especially when it's freezing outside our residents can still enjoy some natural light and warmth without being cold and then it's also really nice in the summer when it gets really hot because they can come sit in here again and enjoy the sunshine but you know not be overheating. And this directly backs up to our beautiful courtyard here which is awesome it's all secured we do all kinds of activities out here gardening concerts we've had carnivals out here it's a really great space for people to come and get fresh air in a secured environment and we'll also come out and just sit and relax. Next I'm going to show you a one bedroom so we'll go ahead and walk in here all of our residents have their keys to their room so they can lock it when they head out if they choose. The first thing you'll notice here on the wall is a pull cord which is great for emergencies or if they need something they can pull it. Our residents will also pull a pendant and that will help if they need help they can pull it and we'll get out to them quickly. Something that's great about the size of this community is that we're able to get to our residents really quickly because it is all one level and it's a smaller community which we love. This is the kitchenette right off of the living room so your loved one can keep their favorite snacks and drinks there heat things up if they like to you've got a little sink and some cabinet space. And then this living room area you would have your television so you can sit and relax if you want to have a love seat and a little lazy boy. When you head in this direction this is the bedroom also a pole cord and a nice big closet. So you can see this view from back into the living room. Another great feature is the large handicap accessible bathroom with the walk-in shower. And the last thing that people really love in these rooms are the heating and air unit so your loved one can choose the temperature and be comfortable at whatever setting they prefer. Let's go. Thank you. Thank you.
