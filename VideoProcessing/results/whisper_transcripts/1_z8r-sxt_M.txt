 Welcome to the Mike Les Farmhand Mike YouTube channel. A farming and outdoor channel that I started in 2012 that now has over 1600 videos and thanks to you has over 180,000 subscribers with a hundred plus million total views and over 12 million hours of total watch time. I am filming and uploading new content all the time so come along for the ride. I am bringing you a corn planting video from the 2025 season. If you've seen my last video it was a John Deere 9RX 640 tractor pulling a deer field cultivator with a J&M soil conditioner behind that. Well this very same farm was planting corn just a mile and a half down the road with this rig. In this video is the farm's John Deere 8RX 410 tractor pulling their John Deere 24 row model 1775 NT planter. And if you did not catch the video of them working ground I'll put the link to it at the end of this one. Now that I filmed a couple of these 8RX tractors out in the field one thing I would like to point out notice over the rear tracks on this tractor you'll see some tanks. So John Deere does have an option for these tanks allowing the tractor to carry a thousand gallons of liquid fertilizer on it that can be plumbed into the planter or if you're side dressing whatever. But anyways allows the guy to go longer between stops without filling up with fertilizer. So he's able to carry liquid fertilizer on the tractor. If you notice the tank in the middle of the planter up towards the front that's also a fertilizer tank and then the two hoppers behind that are for seed. initially once libertarians siècle when he нужно sidebreed and右imoo seems JULIA It's great as well. The more poor likelihood of lifting the car was too thick. After that it all emerged from its truck I can use kreed and brandimp but this kost tasks for tons of retrieve and traces eager to catch the tires.urity so so The 30 I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. I'm out.
