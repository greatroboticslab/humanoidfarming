 Hi, I'm Marissa Shuh, an Extension Educator with the University of Minnesota Extension, and today we're harvesting garlic scapes. Scapes are what the immature flowers are of the garlic plant. When they get curly like this, we can clip them off so we have something good to eat in the kitchen, but we also will get bigger bulbs of garlic. So to harvest your garlic scapes, wait until they have a super curly appearance. You can either then snap them off or use clippers to clip them off right at the base. Now they're ready to eat in pesto or pasta or whatever your garlic loving heart desires.
