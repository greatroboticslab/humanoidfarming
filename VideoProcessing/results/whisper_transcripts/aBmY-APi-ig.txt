 Not all eggs are created equal and there's a reason pasture-raised eggs are more expensive. Organic cage-free eggs come from hens that are kept indoors with only about one square foot of room to move. Pasture-raised eggs come from hens that freely roam the outdoors on open pastures. This allows them to eat a more natural diet including worms and bugs. Pasture-raised eggs are higher in vitamins A, E, and omega-3 fatty acids. You'll notice the yolk looks darker and more vibrant in the pasture-raised egg. When looking for the best quality eggs, choose pasture-raised, organic pasture-raised, or buy from your local farmer.
