 This is Zetter's brand new tractors in the Tier 4 category, Proxima Tier 4. Good tractor, we've had very few problems with that new Tier 4 setup, but it is still a Tier 4. It's got DEF and everything on it. This Proxima Series tractor has been the workhorse for Zetter for quite a while, and this series has now switched out. It used to be a 60, 70, 80, 90 horsepower series tractor. It's now a 100 or 120 horsepower series tractor. The old engines would not meet Tier 4 emissions, and the new engines that do are a higher horsepower than what the older one used to be. So this tractor being 100 horsepower, it is just a little bit bigger than what some guys are needing, but for most of the hay and stuff, it's kind of an ideal size for it to fit in there. It will run pretty much every piece that we've got here except for that front mounted mower. This is the same loader that that or same style loader that was on that big tractor that just left what it would look like on the tractor when we get here. This tractor is a mechanical shuttle, 12 speed forward, 12 speed reverse mechanical shuttle, three sets of auxiliaries, 540 and 540 EPTO. Like I said, it is Tier 4. It's been a good system, but it is still a Tier 4. When you move back to the mower on this one, this one is a nine-foot disc mower, seven rotor. Same blades that are on the other one, they're a quick change blade. As far as this one here, you do have to have a wrench to take the blades off of it, bolt and wrench to take the blades off. Pretty quick process on here, not as quick as the next one, but still a fairly quick process. Same thing, this mower is going to be a category two mower, belt driven on the rear, nine foot discharge on it with no conditioner on there. And like I said, once again, McHale next year, we will be seeing the same very similar style mower to that, but it will be with finger conditioners in it if a guy wanted to go that direction with it. C Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
