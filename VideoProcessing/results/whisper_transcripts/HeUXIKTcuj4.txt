Howto & Style
 I went vegan seven years ago and this is my favorite meal prep lunch. Welcome back to Plant Based Basics. The number one reason I love this pasta salad recipe is because it actually tastes better after it marinates in the fridge overnight, making it perfect for meal prep. It's also loaded with whole grains, veggies, protein, and a killer dressing I could chug. So let's whip up a big batch and enjoy all week long.
