Howto & Style
 Let's give this tomato superpowers. This is a grafted tomato. Above the graft, it's your normal everyday delicious tomato. But underneath the soil, it gets more interesting. The roots on this guy give this guy more leaves, more fruit, and disease resistance. So let's create a super franken tomato. You can cut the top and bottom at the same angle and join two different tomatoes with a clip and a steak for support. Then humidity is really important, 90% or above. Remember, you just cut off its roots. So mist it for a few days, slowly transition it to more light and after about a week, you can pop it in the ground.
