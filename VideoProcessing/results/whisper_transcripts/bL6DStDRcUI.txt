Homegrown oatmeal!

 Here's how we make oatmeal when we're living off the land. Our oats turned a beautiful golden color this week, which meant they were ready to harvest. So we collected all the seed heads and then put them out on the sunniest spot in our yard to dry out. Once they were nice and dry, we loaded them up in this bag and smashed them on the side of the house until all of the seeds separated from the chaff. When you first pour this out, it just looks like a big pile of junk, but after winnowing, you start to notice all the little seeds in there. It wasn't very windy today, so we used our solar power to generate some wind power to blow the chaff off the seeds. Sylvan really enjoyed being the camera person for this part. This process takes a while, but after a few passes, you're left with a clean seed. Some of y'all might not recognize this as an oat because what we get at the store is typically a rolled oat, which is steamed and crushed, so this probably looks a little bit more familiar. Overall, this was an insanely labor-intensive process, and it reminded me why most of the grain that we grow is corn, but we're still excited to make some homegrown granola bars, so stick around for that.
