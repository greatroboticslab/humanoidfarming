 My name is Michael Oll. I'm the General Secretary of the German Association. Within Europe we have 16 members and we are one member of the European Association, the Great Association, NIMA. Our name is Landbaum Technique. We take care of all the dealers and the crafts business and do services for example. Everything around the educational system. We take care of the vendors and that they will sustain in a comfortable position. What is the deal with the company? In Germany we have approximately 5,000 companies who are in the business doing dealing and service. Within the European Association we have 60 country organizations and we are collecting more than 180,000 workshops and dealers. What is the size of the market? At the moment, the size of the market is totally different. In Europe the markets are quite different. We don't have one unique market. Because you have different climate, different market situations and economies. For example, in the south of Germany we have smaller farmers and workshops and dealers than in the eastern countries. In Eastern Europe we have big farmers, big rural areas bigger than in our area. So it is quite different depending on the different countries. The challenges we have is that we are delivering services to farmers, to agriculture, services and products. Together with the manufacturers we need to be innovative on the other hand. We need to take care of the environmental aspects that are integrated. That the frame, the factors which the economy and the society brings that agriculture needs to be environmentally friendly. It is taken care of. Our businesses of course, challenging with new techniques, digitalization and entrepreneurship. To bring these new and innovative techniques to the market. What do you make to the market? What is the market? With the market-specific, it is a brand dealer. Of course you have a bigger region like in other countries. All there is more responsibility to take care of the brand, for the service. You can of course integrate smaller dealers and smaller service workshops to run in a defined region the system. in combination with marketing aspects including doing service which is guaranteed to the customer as a priority and therefore you are licensed by the manufacturer. The manufacturers do it differently. There is no system that guarantees that everybody is doing the same. So I would say that an A-Dealer for John Deere is doing for example an A-Dealer in the C&H Group. That's depending on their conference. But in general we are partners from the industry and of the industry. In between you need to work on everything together. In the end we want one. We want the customer satisfaction. We want together to grow, to gain market share depending on the brand or not. In total to satisfy our customers and that they buy new investments on new techniques. On the other hand, new service on existing equipment who has high quality. It is in high quality because sustainable growth is depending on innovation but as well on good quality. And innovation. So it all comes together. If you can see here on this booth, I mean two thousand companies who represent the world's business and their land technology and agricultural technology. It's a big business isn't it? And the most important thing is that we do marketing for the brand in the other branches. In total. Sometimes in comparison to the car business, to the industrial car business, they do a wonderful marketing game. Some people think we are a small business. No, we are not a small business. We are a little bit calmer. But it's a very attractive business. In rural areas, we want the people to give them the possibility to do sustainable work. But we need to help everybody. That's how we are positioned together with the manufacturers. To make it attractive for young people and for people who are in the business. To stay there and to make business as well. Not today, but tomorrow. What is the business that should be attractive for the next generation? It should be attractive for the next generation. And to bond the people who are in the business. And of course we are competition. There are a lot of interesting businesses. Our business is very attractive because it's a technical one. On the other hand, you need to have social competence. And as well business administration. So it has attraction. We do have an increase of young people who come into this business. Despite of the fact that in total, the markets are shrinking with regard to the demographic development. In Europe, in some countries. In some countries, in some countries. That's why we run a campaign. Together with our partners, as you can see maybe later on, we run a show. Not only here, but mainly here to show to the next generation, to make an impressive show. That our business is interesting. That makes fun. And to work with the staff on the other end. To do business with farmers, with other groups who are interested. And we are of course attractive because we emphasize these factors. That you can become a technician, but as well a business administrator at the end. So we are working on these processes in different educational systems. It's an academic system, but as well the vocational system. The system which is run by the employer side and by the state. It's a dual principle. It makes it very interesting. The state says, okay, we do the theory. Employer, you do the practice. And together we have only German 9,000, approximately 9,000 apprenticeships. They become a master technician, business administrator with different possibilities. We need to show that once you are in the system you can grow. And grow together with the company and with our educational schools for example. Or as well universities. Working together. That's the biggest challenge. Our business is not as big as a CV or a car, a CV or a passenger car business. It's quite bigger. But we are a big fabric. So we have several items to work together. Our campaign is sponsored by manufacturers. Our campaign is done not only by crafts and dealers. It's as well run by our manufacturers. It's wonderful, isn't it? On the other hand, of course, everybody needs to take care that he is responsible for a bid. That we need to take care of our bid. So everybody has his bid and his homework to do. So what do we do to get to know where are the pupils and the students we want to have? As in the market, you need to go to the customer. The customer is as well staff. We do personal marketing. We go to the schools. We go to the booths in the regions. Together with our county organizations. So we are one national organization. But we have county partners, smaller members and regional partners. These so-called inner trade associations on the regional level. They are a member in our organization. Guilds, right? They are working. They know. They say they care that our campaign is illustrated in the region. It's implemented on their booths in the region. So it's not only one time effect here on this booths. It's going on all the year. Taking care of the fact that the young generation is as well as social media generation. Secondly, that we can be at the front, but as well in the media. And nowadays, the young people are not reading books. They are reading this type of book. And that's why you need to be present there. So we run social campaigns, media campaigns. To be attractive. You are to the customer. The pupil is the customer as well. You are to the customer. The pupil is the customer as well.
