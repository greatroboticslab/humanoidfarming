 The perfect time to harvest your broccoli. Technically there's no wrong time, but there is an ideal time. For example, you could harvest this, but it's a little bit small, so you're leaving a lot of broccoli on the table. Ideally, you want it to be at least the size of your fist. And you want the head to be nice and tight, so this one's already starting to loosen up, and it's definitely ready to harvest. Here's an example of one that's loose and slightly past its prime. Another sign is that the florets are starting to separate, and the flowers are starting to open. So let's harvest this, but don't remove the plant quite yet. That's because each leaf node will produce its own little floret. And given enough time, that one plant will now turn into so many florets, you won't even know what to do with all your broccoli. And that's how you get the most out of your broccoli in the garden.
