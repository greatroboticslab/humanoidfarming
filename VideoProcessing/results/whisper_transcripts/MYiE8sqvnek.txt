Education
 Okay, so good afternoon and welcome to the Southeast Hay Short Course. My name is Marcelo Vallau. I'm the Forge Extension Specialist for the University of Florida and I'll be your host today. Thanks everybody for being here. This event is a collaboration between the Cooperative Extension, especially the University of Georgia, Auburn University, and the University of Florida, supported by the Southeastern Hay Contest and Massive Ferguson. We also count with the sponsorship of multiple of our industry partners, starting with our collaboration partners, Mayo Ag Services, Hobo Tractor, and Florida Gateway Fairgrounds. Associate sponsors Purina, Farmers Cooperative, Informed Credit of Florida, and trade show sponsors, Corteva Agri-Science, Card Insurance, and Agri-King, Key to Profit. Before we start, I'd like to acknowledge the committee that has put this program together and also the next few events. Paulette Tomlinson from University of Florida, Mark Mulding from University of Florida, Ashley Kuhn also from University of Florida, Lisa Baxter from UGA, Leon Dillard from Auburn University, and Ash Holt from Massive Ferguson. A little bit of background here. The Southeastern Hay Contest is a multi-state project involving 13 land-granted universities which have been recognizing the top hay producers and promoting hay quality in the Southeastern United States for over 16 years. And I'm proud to be the chair of this contest. It's a great educational event. And as part of our educational committee, we're now starting the Southeastern H-Word course. So this is the inaugural event and I'm very excited about it. A few housekeeping information before we get started here. We have two presentations. We have Dr. Khalidja Dumberstein and Dr. Nicholas DeLorenzo. I'm going to present them just prior to their talk. Dr. Nicholas DeLorenzo. And I will ask for everybody to keep your microphones muted. That would be appreciated. You should have entered the Zoom meeting with your microphones muted. So if you didn't unmute, just leave it that way. This event is being recorded. So be aware of that. We want to share this with other colleagues and other producers that were not able to attend today in person. Dr. Nicholas DeLorenzo. Question and answer sections will be held after each of the talks. Dr. Nicholas DeLorenzo. And there are two ways you can ask questions. You can type it on chat and Ashley and myself are going to be monitoring. We're going to read it over to the presenters. Or you can raise your hand. There is a feature you can raise your hand on Teams. And you can also put your name on the chat and say you have a question and I'm going to call you by name and in order. So you can unmute your microphone at that point and ask your question. Today's online section is being presented by Purina and Farmers Cooperative. And we have Derek Betty here with us that is going to have a quick word with you before we proceed with the technical talks, starting with Dr. Dubestein and then Dr. DeLorenzo later on. Derek, the floor is yours. Let me stop sharing my screen here. Thank you very much. Just a second. Derek, you should be able to share your screen now. And if you would like to, we have your... Yep, right there. Derek, awesome. All right. My name is Derek Beatty. I want to thank you for this opportunity to be a part of this inaugural event. I work for Purina Animal Nutrition through the Farmers Cooperative in Live Oak in Madison, Florida, um, supplying needs to farmers, ranchers, uh, to anyone who needs anything. Um, and my title is a Livestock Production Specialist. And today we're just going to go over some, uh, forage supplementations that we, uh, at Purina use to, uh, express, uh, uh, maximum genetic potential of cattle, um, and why quality forage is important. Uh, adds values. You improve the health of your calves and the proper nutrition allows vaccinations and genetics to perform. Um, you can minimize costs. Um, are you spending money on feed or are you making money? Uh, and then minerals, vitamins, they're essential to, again, maximizing that genetic potential in those animals. Uh, corner post of your nutrition program should be, uh, your mineral. Uh, it's extremely important. The bioavailability, uh, the quality source cow system can absorb, um, or, um, or wind and rain mineral, mineral, uh, is very bioavailable. Uh, it's extremely palatable and it comes as a weatherized mineral. So you don't have to have a very expensive, uh, mineral trough to keep it in. Uh, you can kind of keep it in something, uh, for instance, in my cow herd at my house, I use an old tub with holes in the bottom. So the water leaches through. So that's what, what I use, um, skipping on mineral will drive down your herd profitability. Uh, you'll see smaller, weaker calves, decreased in weighing weight, poor immunity, increased in sickness, the decreased milk production and reduced bladder conception. Um, and all this is, you know, uh, if your mineral isn't there, it's a thief, uh, and it can steal from you. These are a list of the macro and micro minerals required. Um, if you have any questions, we can go over, uh, this at a later time, they can get pretty in depth. Uh, we also carry it in fly controls, IGR to, um, recently read that the horn flies cost quite a bit of money for the cow industry. Just going from cow to cow, the irritation, the stress that it causes, uh, we carry mineral in that. And then the question that some of us ask, should cattlemen feed all season long? Um, and we would say yes, along with our forage. Forage has to be the basis of, that's the cheapest commodity to the producer. Um, and forage is very, very important. And with our Accuration blocks and our Accuration liquid, um, we are harnessing snack eating technology. So they'll eat a little bit here. They'll go away and they'll consume more of your cheapest commodity, which is the forage. Here are things that, some studies that have been done showing, uh, cow cycling and the percent of cows that are actually pregnant 40 days after calving, um, um, based on their body condition, fours, fives, and sixes. As you can see the lower body condition score, the less of your cattle will be cycling, the less of your cows are going to conceive. Um, the higher you get four, five, six, six is optimum. Uh, once you go more than six, you see it going down. Okay. Why use the high fat liquid, uh, cattle need balanced nutritional program when forage quality or hay is not enough. Um, so again, as the lower the forage quality, the more of it they will snack on. The higher the forage quality, um, the less of it they'll eat. We improve cow utilization and management of your forage through intake control snack eating. Uh, if you have any questions, that's my name and phone number. Um, you can call me, oops, excuse me. You can call me anytime I'm available. Um, and I appreciate the opportunity to be with y'all. Thank you. Thank you, Derek. And just to remind our participants, uh, you'll be, uh, you'll receive some material with all the sponsors and contact information. You also have a chance to, for those participating on the, um, hands-on field day on September 2nd, you have the chance to visit with, uh, all the sponsors. Awesome. Derek, if you could stop sharing screen, we're going to, we're going to go for our first presenter. And it's very proud to introduce Dr. Callie Jo Dummstein. She's an associate professor and equine extension specialist at the University of, uh, Georgia in Athens. Uh, her background is in, uh, equine nutrition and she spent several years actually riding and competing in horses. So she has a lot of hands-on experience here. Um, her role as extension specialist, um, she, uh, fusing many questions of forage quality for hay producers, horse owners, and veterinarians around the state. Dr. Dummstein, I'm going to give the floor to you. Oh, thank you so much. Um, let me just share my screen. Dr. Dummstein, I'm going to give you a slide show. Okay. So I appreciate, uh, being invited to talk here. I'm actually from Florida. Um, I went to the University of Florida, so it's great to be back, even if it's virtually. Um, so I am an equine nutritionist by training. Um, I'm certainly didn't start this job up here as any kind of forage expert, but I've been in Georgia about 15 years. And in that time, I have fielded so many calls and questions on forages. So I get a lot of questions from horse owners, from vets, and from hay producers around our state. Um, you know, asking about forage quality and what's a good forage, what's a good quality forage for horses. So we're going to talk about that today. Um, honestly, I could give you, I know a lot of you are interested in how to look at a hay report and how that applies to horses. And I could give you numbers in about two minutes, but that would not make a good talk. So we're going to go and talk a little bit about the whys, about understanding why, um, why some of these numbers apply to horses. So I'll talk just a little bit about, uh, how the horse's GI tract is unique from some of our ruminant animals and how that affects forage digestion. And then I'll talk about what makes a forage appropriate for horses, especially with regards to, uh, that, that forage quality and how you can use a hay test to, uh, maybe get some numbers to apply and balance the diet. And then we'll talk just a little bit about, um, some health problems and how, uh, you can test for some of that in a forage report as well. Uh, so it's a short talk, but if you want more information, I just this week, I have to give a little plug for my videos. Um, I just this week got some videos up on our equine science page. There are 10 videos up on forage education for horse owners. So a lot of what I talk about, I'm going to go into more detail in the videos and they're up. So please view them anytime, share them, make me a movie star. Um, okay. So just to talk a little bit about the horse's GI tract. When we look at the horse, we talk about the horses having a foregut, which is the stomach and small intestine and a hindgut, which includes the cecum and the colon. And when we talk about, um, fiber digestion and fibers high in our forages, we really think about that being digested in the cecum of the horse. Some other things that are worth talking about when we think about selecting the right hay for our horses or forage for our horses is that we begin digestion in the mouth and the horse chews. And it's really important to understand that the horse produces saliva when it chews. And this might seem like a really minor thing, but they only produce saliva when they're chewing. And that saliva is really important to both lubricate that hay or grass or whatever's in the GI tract and push it through. And also it serves as a buffer to neutralize stomach acid. So the horse, a horse is prone to a few different problems that we think of when we think of forage. And one of those would be impaction colic, and that would be a blockage somewhere in the GI tract of the horse. And this can be related to different things, but a lot of times it's related to not enough intake of water and also not enough chewing, because if they don't chew enough, they don't produce enough saliva to move that food through. The other thing that they're prone to is gastric ulcers or stomach ulcers, especially our horses that are confined in stalls, maybe not out on pasture. And some of the reason for this is that we don't feed them as naturally as they would ideally be fed. So a horse left on its own is going to eat more than half the day, so 12, 18 hours, where it spends chewing, and when it chews, it swallows that saliva. And saliva is a buffer and it neutralizes that stomach acid. If we're only feeding them a little bit in the morning and a little bit in the evening, and they're only eating for a few hours a day, they get a lot of buildup of acid in their stomach, and that can make them more sensitive to ulcers. So ideally, what we want to do is feed them more continuously throughout the day. And so if we look at a few numbers, we say that the horse eats about 2% of its body weight in dry matter a day. So if we're looking at hay, this is about 22 pounds of hay a day for our average horse. We don't want to go below 1% of their body weight. So sometimes we've got to restrict our horses. We get horses that are too fat, like maybe years ago when horses were working a little harder, this wasn't our big problem. But today, a big problem is that horses get too fat. So a lot of times we're restricting them, but we still don't want to go below 1% at a very minimum. And that's for an average horse about 12 pounds a day of hay. So why is that important? Why am I even bringing that up when I'm talking about forage quality? And the reason is that there's not one right answer for what forage is best for a horse. What forage we select for the horse really should reflect what that horse actually needs. So some of our horses are too thin or they're hardworking or they are lactating brood mares or they're growing horses and they need more calories. And those horses need a higher quality forage. Some of our horses are fat. I have several at my house that are too fat. Those horses need to lose some weight. They need fewer calories. So we feed them maybe not the highest quality forage. And I didn't say a poor quality forage because we still want to make sure that our horses get what we call a reasonable quality forage. And so that kind of has to do a lot with the GI tract of a horse. Horses in general are less efficient at fiber digestion than some of our ruminant animals. And I'm not going to even pretend to be a ruminant nutritionist. We can hear that talk in a few minutes. But in general, the GI tract of the horse looks different. So the horse has what we call a cecum. And so in both of these animals, we have our kind of fermentation chamber. And that's where that fiber of our feed or our hay or our grass goes to be digested. And in the horse, that fermentation chamber is the cecum, which is in the hind gut. And a ruminant animal, it's in the fore gut. And so what that means is that the fiber in the horse's diet, they are adapted to eating fiber. They're much better at it than you and I are. But they're not as well adapted as a ruminant because their fermentation chamber is at the end of the digestive tract rather than at the beginning. And food tends to spend less time there. So what that means is that in general, they don't handle poor quality forage as well as some of our ruminant animals can. And that's not to say that we want to feed poor quality forage to ruminants, but horses don't tolerate it very well. So when we talk about what makes a forage poorer quality versus higher quality, we're trying to consider some of the different components. So it's important to remember that forage isn't just fiber. It has sugars and starches. It has proteins, vitamins, minerals, water, all of the other components that we would find in a grain or something like that are in forage. But forage tends to have more fiber and that's what makes it unique. And a lot of times when we're talking about forage quality, it has to do with the digestibility of that fiber because not all fiber is created equal. Not all of it is as digestible. So when we look at the horse's gut just a little bit closer, just to set the stage for a few things we're going to talk about later, all of these components get digested somewhere in the horse's GI tract. The carbohydrate fraction, we break down into what we call our non-structural carbohydrates, which would be sugars and starches, and our structural carbohydrates, which would be fiber. This has to do with whether they give structure to the plant or not. We'll talk about that a little bit more in a minute. But our sugars and starches are proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals. Those all get digested and absorbed in the small intestine. The fiber moves to the cecum and the horse can't break it down until it gets to the cecum. And at that point, the gut microbes, the bugs that live in the horse's gut, they break it down and produce an energy source for the horse. So I wanted to briefly touch upon this just because with horses we talk a lot about the difference between structural and non-structural carbohydrates. So the difference between sugars and starches and our fiber components. So our non-structural carbohydrates, our sugars and starches, and our fibers actually look a little bit similar. So if we're looking at these, our top structure up here would be starch and our bottom structure down here would be cellulose, which is in our fiber group. What you'll see is that they both have the same basic molecule and that's a sugar. So when I talk about sugars and starches, the main difference is just how many of them are linked together. So sugars are just a single molecule or a couple molecules of something like glucose that are linked together. When we talk about starch, it's many molecules. It's a long chain of glucose. And our fiber is the same way. But the difference is that our starch are linked with a bond that looks like this. And our cellulose is linked with a bond that looks like this. And the horse's enzymes can break down starch just fine in the small intestine, but it can't break down, sorry, it can't break down the cellulose. And so just keep that in mind because we're going to talk about how that affects quality in just a minute. So if we shift gears a little bit and we start to think about how to select the right forage for our horse. There are a lot of options that work for horses. But what we need to remember is that it's an individual thing. So we have horses like this one on the left that are growing. The mother that's lactating, they have high energy needs. So we want to select a forage that provides them more calories, more protein, more nutrients. We have horses like this one on the right, which is one of the most common forage that we see. So we have a lot of people in mind that are too fat, that don't, standing around not doing a lot. And we still want to provide them with forage, but we don't necessarily want to provide them with a lot of calories. So we can take a forage that has a little bit lower digestible energy and use it on that type of horse. Some common forages that we'd see, we have legumes and grasses. And some of our common legumes would be alfalfa and perennial peanut are our most common. Clover we see more in pasture than in hay, but sometimes you'll see it as hay. And we're starting to see more lespedeza, which is another legume that works well for horses. Common grass forages, there's more than what I put up here, but the most common hays that we see are Timothy, Bermuda grass, tall fescue, orchard grass, and annual rye grass. And what I'd like to point out to you on this slide is that when we start to talk about what makes a good quality hay for horses, we're really focusing on the digestible energy. So I know in ruminants, we work more in TDN, total digestible nutrients. In horses, we work in digestible energy. And there's a conversion factor, you can convert them back and forth. But the lingo in horses is digestible energy. And it's measured in mega cows per kilogram. And so a mega cow is actually a pretty big unit. It's 1000 of our kilocalories. And that's what we use on our food labels for human food. A horse eats about 20 mega cows a day. And so what you'll see is per kilogram, which a kilogram is a little over two pounds, you can see the range of how many mega cows per kilogram the hays are providing. And you'll see that if we look at, you know, something like our our lower end and our upper end, we're seeing a difference of about 0.4 mega cows, which doesn't really seem like a lot. But actually, that's 400 of our kilocalories, which is the equivalent of two Pop-Tarts. I used to eat a lot of Pop-Tarts. So I know that each Pop-Tart is 200 calories. And or one cheeseburger. So for every couple pounds of hay that they're eating, the difference in calorie content between the low end and the high end is about that of a cheeseburger. So that's fairly significant. But what is also important to notice is that the upper end of all of these, if I take these pictures away, the upper end of all of these forages is fairly similar. So a good quality hay can be produced from a lot of different types of forages. There's not one magical forage that works best for horses. And we'll skip on a little bit. The main thing that I try to stress to hay producers, horse owners, is that price isn't always reflective of quality. A lot of times horse owners feel like if they're paying more for a hay, they're getting a better hay. And so they'll think I'm paying $15 for orchard grass or I'm paying $15 a bale for alfalfa. So it is definitely better for my horse than a $5 bale of rye grass or $5 bale of Bermuda grass. And that's really not true. What they're paying for is the cost of shipping it. So certain things grow around your area. Certain things don't grow around your area. If they don't grow around your area, they cost more because you have to freight them across the country to get them. That doesn't necessarily mean they're better quality. So what really influences quality and what's really critical for producing good quality hay for horses is the stage of harvest, the stage of maturity when it's harvested. And so I'm sure that you guys know what grass looks like. But if you really think about it, if you're looking at that young, very early growth of our plants, it's very tender. If you taste it, it's very sweet. It's very pliable. And as that plant grows and matures, it gets a lot more tough, not nearly as sweet. We start to get seed heads. It gets a lot more of this woody substance that we call lignin that we'll talk about. What that looks like from a quality standpoint is that lignin and some of our fibers as the plant matures, they reduce the quality. So on that last slide, I talked about fiber being cellulose and some other things. As that plant matures, it starts to get more cellulose. But again, remember that the cellulose is able to be broken down by the microbes and the cecum. So it's not as high in energy, it's not as high in calories as like sugars and starches and some of those things that you might see in the younger plant. But it still produces energy for the horse because of the microbes and the cecum. But as it continues to grow, as that plant gets to the point of producing seed heads and reproducing, it produces a lot more of a substance called lignin. And this is what the structure of lignin, this is a structure of lignin that I pulled off the internet somewhere. And what you see is it's a complicated structure. And the horse can't break this down with its enzymes. The microbes and the cecum don't break this down. So basically, the lignin is not digested. It just passes through the gut of the horse out into the manure, completely undigested. So as that plant continues to mature and produce more lignin and get to the point where it has seed heads, it becomes very indigestible to the horse. And as it becomes indigestible, we consider that to be a lower quality forage. And again, this just shows that if we look at our bottom graph, as we go across and our lignin content starts to get higher, then our quality really starts to go down. So our young plants over on the far left here are going to have very high quality, very low lignin. Our mature plants have very high lignin and very low quality. So what that means is that if we go back to when we're cutting it, we want to cut that plant before it develops a lot of fiber and especially a lot of lignin. And so we want to cut it, like basically the earlier we cut it, the more digestible it is to the horse. That being said, there's a trade-off, right? Because if we cut it really early, if we're cutting it at like two weeks or three weeks or something like that, that's not practical. We don't get any kind of yield with that. And it's kind of pointless. But what happens a lot of times is that hay producers will wait too long to cut their hay. And they'll try to do just a couple cuttings and they'll wait until that plant is extremely mature because they get higher yields. But the yields, even though they're high, the plant is extremely mature. And it's a poor quality hay. It would be far better to cut it at an earlier stage of maturity. You'd sacrifice a little bit of yield at each cutting, but you would get more cuttings over the course of your growing season. And you would produce a higher quality hay. And so that's really what we try to encourage people to do is to start to think about the quality of the hay and cutting it at a stage before it starts to become very tough and lignified and having those kind of mature seed heads on it. What that looks like on a forage report is something like this. So if you're sending in hay to get a forage analysis done, if you can, try to specify that you're having it run for horses. Or you can have it run for more than one species. But if you put it that you're doing it for horses, it will put on it, it will put digestible energy instead of TDN. Or you can get it to put both. But digestible energy is really what we work with on horses. So when people send me forage reports, I can compare it to tables that I have using digestible energy. I keep going backwards. I'm sorry. RFQ is another parameter that we use. And there's a couple of good publications where it breaks down RFQ for horses and basically starting with kind of our idle horses being at about 100 to 110. Our working horse is going up from 110 to 125. Some of our really high producing horses, like our lactating mares and things like that, going up from like 120 to 140. So the idea is that we would use this RFQ to pick a hay or forage that was more suitable for the type of horse that we have. That being said, in horses, we tend to focus, a lot of our publications tend to focus more on acid detergent fiber and neutral detergent fiber, ADF and NDF. These are what my brain is programmed to look at when I look at forage reports. In general, the lower these numbers are, the higher quality the hay is, the more digestible the fiber is. So they're a measure of fiber digestibility. And the lower they are, the more digestible the fiber is. What's important to note is on these parameters, I work on a dry matter basis so that I can compare apples to apples. Because sometimes you'll look at fresh forage, fresh forage, and fresh forage is a lot of water so it really throws your numbers off. So I compare apples to apples and I use the dry matter column. So on this one I would look at the NDF would be 36%, the ADF would be 23% is a very high quality, this is a very high quality forage. In general, the parameters that we have are that the lower they are, the more calories they're going to provide, the higher quality that they're going to be, that forage is going to be. But we have some upper limits. So we don't want to, we don't necessarily need the highest quality forage for some of our idle horses. But we still have an upper limit for what we say is acceptable quality for horses. And that upper limit for ADF is 45, and for NDF is 65. So if we get numbers above that, then we say, hey, that hay is got a lot of lignin and it really shouldn't be fed to horses. I say this with a little bit of a caveat. I see a lot of Bermudagrass samples that the ADF will be fine and the NDF is going to be pushing that 65 or over that 65. It's still, that's still right now the number we use is 65. Some people will say that because the NDF in Bermudagrass is so high, it's associated with impaction, colic, and horses. Some people will say that that NDF in a warm season grass is more digestible than a cool season grass. So we can push the NDF a little higher. I don't know the right answer. I'm doing some research on that right now. So I'd like to maybe learn more soon. But right now we still use 45 and 65 as our cutoffs as the upper level for horse quality hay. The other thing that I want to touch upon really quickly is this idea of a low carb diet for horses. And when we say low carb, we're referring specifically to the sugars and starches, not the fiber component. And so I've started to get hay producers who are sending me forage reports where they've run a carb analysis. And they're asking me, hey, will this hay work for for horse owners who are looking for a low starch, low carb, low NFC, they kind of all mean the same thing right now, that type of forage. So I wanted to give you just a little background on why that's becoming popular. And in general, when we look at the carbohydrate fraction, the sugars and the starches should be digested in the small intestine, the fiber gets digested in the cecum. If we have a sugar overload, we can cause laminitis in horses. And the mechanism there is that whatever sugar doesn't get digested in the small intestine moves into the cecum and it gets fermented, it produces something called lactic acid, which drops the pH in the cecum, kills microbes, those microbes release toxins. So this historically has been associated with horses that are eating high grain diets, horses that get in the grain bin and overeat and eat a huge amount of feed at one time, it overloads the small intestine and we get too much sugar dumping in the cecum. The problem is in the last few decades, what we're starting to see a lot more of is horses that are getting laminitis and founder that are not getting the grain men that really aren't eating large amounts of grain that really shouldn't be foundering. And so what's being recognized is that horses are prone to insulin resistance, especially our two fat horses like that one you see on the right. So as horses become obese, just like people who develop type 2 diabetes, horses seem to develop insulin resistance as well. And so when they develop insulin resistance, we can get these recurring episodes of laminitis that really are not driven by way high sugar content. The mechanism, I made some pretty slides to to show it, but the mechanism is interesting. Basically what happens is when they break down any kind of sugar and starch. So remember, grasses still have sugars, even though we think about them having high fiber, they still have sugars. When those sugars are absorbed, they go into the bloodstream. And when there's sugar in the bloodstream, the body releases insulin. The insulin binds to all the cells in the horse's body. And what it should do is trigger a reaction that opens a channel basically for glucose to move into the cell. And then we get lower blood sugar levels because the glucose has moved into the body. What happens in these horses with insulin resistance is that there's an increase in sugar in the bloodstream. They produce insulin, but this reaction is kind of messed up. It's disturbed in the cell. And so that transporter doesn't open and we get a lot of glucose that starts to build up in the bloodstream. And then the body's triggered to produce more insulin. So we start to get a lot of insulin in the bloodstream. The clinical term is hyperinsulinemia. So they get a lot of insulin in their bloodstream. And the problem with that is insulin is a signaling molecule. So it does more than just put glucose into the cell. It also controls vasoconstriction and vasodilation. So that would be how much the blood vessels constrict or open. What happens when there's a lot of insulin is we get a lot of vasoconstriction. And so that kind of reduces blood flow. And where it reduces blood flow is to the hoof. And in the hoof, we have more than just a block on the end of their feet. There is what we call the lamina and it is fed by blood supply. So that bone in the bottom of the horse's hoof, the coffin bone, has blood supply around it. And so when we get vasoconstriction, when blood is reduced to the foot, what happens is kind of like Velcro. It separates a little bit. The hoof wall, the outer part of the hoof, separates a little bit from the inner part of the hoof. And if it's severe enough, we can actually get rotation of the coffin bone and cause some severe problems. A lot of times that doesn't happen with these bouts of pasture lamina. You just get these recurring bouts of reduced blood flow and inflammation in the hoof. What that means from a hay producer standpoint is that there's a lot of people out there who are looking for hays that have low levels of sugars and starches. And so if we look at different varieties, different forage varieties, what you see is what we're interested in is what we call the NSC, the non-structural carbohydrates. These are the sugars and starches in the plant. And so some of our forages, we shoot for 10% for these horses that are affected. That doesn't mean every horse out there needs a 10% NSC feed or hay. It just means these ones that are prone to laminitis like this need to stick around 10%. And these are the ones that kind of fall into that range. The problem with alfalfa is it tends to be high in calories. So even though it's low in NSC, it's not the best forage for horses that have these issues. Things like oat hay and rye grass are especially not good because they're high in sugars. So that leaves things like Bermuda grass and timothy as options. I've started to have producers that run carbohydrate panels on their hay to see where it falls. I'll just be honest, I'll go through this quickly. There are a bunch of ways you can look at carbohydrates in hay. The problem is we only have good numbers for NSC. So you can run all these things, but at the end of the day, what you're most interested in is the NSC value. And what we're trying to do is stay below 10% for these horses that have carb sensitivities, that have insulin resistance. Okay, I think I'm about out of time. So I'm going to wrap this up really quick and just remind you again that horses are adapted to eating forage. We want to provide a high quality forage or at least an appropriate quality forage. Not all of our horses need high quality forage. Again, that's dependent on what they're doing. We want to make sure that we match the horse to what it needs because again, horses need to eat a minimum amount of forage. So our horses that are too fat don't need the highest quality forage. Our horses that are that have high demands do need a high quality forage. There's lots of types of forage that are suitable for horses. So there's not one magic bullet. But when we're talking about producing high quality forage, we're mainly talking about that stage at which it was harvested with younger being higher quality. And we can best assess this with forage tests using some of those numbers that I just gave you. So I'm going to stop with that. So I stay on time. Do you want to answer questions now? Is that what we decide? Yes, correct. Well, thanks a lot. It was a great presentation. I'm going to open the floor. We didn't have any questions on the chat here, but I'm hoping to get some questions from from the audience. While people get the... Hello, Marcelo. I have one question. Go ahead, Philip. So in the south, we are seeing the growth of the perennial peanut. You say hey, I wanted to ask you if how do you consider it for horses? It's a good option in your your experience or not? Is perennial peanut a good option for horses? Is that what you asked? Yes. Where I live now, we can't get a lot of it. When I was in Florida, we fed a lot of it. It's comparable to alfalfa. I think it may be just slightly lower in digestible energy, but it's very comparable and it can be a very good quality. Again, not peanut, but perennial peanut is a very good quality forage for horses. And I would again kind of classify it like I would alfalfa as a good quality legume. Carissa. Carissa. Carissa. There was a couple questions I was going to ask and you covered it. So thank you, regarding NDF and and some of the concern with Coastal. But coming coming back to that, I mean, we hear that from a lot of our horse owners, even some of the veterinarians that that we get to work with and know, they're really scared of feeding horses coastal. And can you maybe just comment, you know, rather than just focusing on the fiber, are there other things in terms of just general management and feeding of forage that we think might be playing a role in some of those colics that we see and how to avoid that? Yeah, I can talk about that. So there's two things with Bermudagrass. One is that it's a finer stem and so they may not chew it as well. And when they don't chew it as well, they don't produce as much saliva to help push it through. So it might make them more prone to being impacted. And I say might because there's not very much research to support or refute it. And the other factor is that it tends to have a high NDF, which makes, in theory, it makes it less digestible. And that's where we're doing some research now to see if that's, if that, if it really is less digestible, if there's some different numbers we should be looking at with Bermudagrass. But the analogy is that it's like hair in a drain, that it tends to ball up because they don't chew it as well. And then it's not very digestible, so it forms a ball. That being said, it's by far the most common forage in the southeast. So a lot of horses eat Bermudagrass and do fine on it. Where it becomes an issue, I think, is when it's not managed right, like you're saying, Carissa. And so the classic scenario for impact and collet would be that we transition a horse very abruptly from grass to hay. So grass has, you know, 70% water. Hay has 10% water. So all of a sudden we're shifting them from a very moist, you know, it has a lot of lubrication already to move through the gut to something that's very dry. And if we do that, especially we tend to do that at the time of year when it gets cold. So all of a sudden, hey, we don't have as much grass. Let's put out a bunch of hay and we don't transition them slowly. And maybe they don't drink as well because it's cold. It sets the stage for an impaction colic. And so better ways to manage it would be to slowly transition to hay rather than, so I'm not opposed to round bales, but you don't want to wait till your pasture's dead and then put out a round bale on a cold night for them to gorge. So slowly transition them, add salt if you can to their feed on cold nights to encourage them to drink, some things like that. Perfect. Thank you, Kylie. Sure. I see somebody, it says iPad 2 that has a hand up. Yes. My name is Greg Mock. Probably sounds like a silly question. We do orchard grass, hay, and orchard fescue. And you were talking about insulin resistance and non-structural carbohydrates. And just theoretically, if I have excellent orchard grass, hay cut at the right time versus orchard grass, hay that didn't get cut at the right time and is now a little more stemmy, a little older, or potentially was even down and got bleached. Can I point a customer at that hay and say, if you're really hunting for low carbohydrate hay, this hay here will have lower carbs for your horse? Yeah. So that's the balance, right? And I see this with Bermuda grass a lot. I could send a lot of samples. You want it to still be digestible. And this is where it's hard sometimes. It's a trade-off. Because you're right. As it gets more mature, the sugar is going to go down, the fiber content is going to go up. And so, and this is where it's important for someone to buy something that's appropriate for their horse. So for a hardworking horse, high producing broodmare, something like that, we're not so worried about sugar and that high fiber that's not very digestible is not going to be good for that horse. For an idle horse, a horse that's too fat, yes, that more mature hay might work just fine for them. We still want to stay below what we consider those top parameters of not going above the ADF of 45, the NDF of 65. But if it's below that, but kind of on the higher end, not as good of quality as maybe if you had cut it earlier. Yeah, it could work fine for a lot of horses. It could be, you know, some of our fat horses, some of our more idle horses, it could be a very good option. So, and like I said, there's, I think hay producers in general always want to produce high quality hay. But there is still a place for some of the hay that might not be quite as top notch as ideally we would have. Very interesting perspective on a niche market there. Yeah, and that's hard. It's just that it's a growing market right now. There are so many fat horses and so many people trying to restrict carbs. And so for a lot of our forages, when we're looking for, and again, I don't want to advocate producing poor quality hay. But at the same time, there's a lot of fat horses that don't need high quality too. So, and there's starting to be more of those than not now. Yeah. So go for a quick last question. I mean, this could be a topic of the whole presentation, but we'll try to make it quick before we move on. One of our agents, Joe Walter here is asking if you could talk a little bit about the tropical grasses in legume mixes. And our favorite here, which Dr. Rickens has been working a lot with is actually Bahia grass and perennial peanut mix. So those mixes are fantastic forage for livestock and fantastic forage source for horses. That's interesting. I don't know. We don't get a lot of Bahia grass up here. So I haven't seen a lot of forage reports on how Bahia grass looks. In general, I didn't think that we used a lot of Bahia grass forage in horse diets, but, you know, Bermuda grass would be a lot more common. I've always heard that Bahia grass is a little bit on the lower end of digestibility. Perennial peanut is obviously very good. I haven't seen a lot of Bahia grass for horses, but maybe you might comment on that. Yeah. The fresh pasture, like giving Bahia or providing access to Bahia pastures is mostly what we do. Yeah. I mean, we've had a couple of research trials where we've fed like round roll Bahia on purpose because we were looking at low protein diets and it was very low, at least in terms of protein and digestible energy as harvested forage. But yeah, fresh grazing of Bahia, especially those perennial peanuts, it's good. Yeah. Actually, I may have not phrased this properly, the question, but it was especially the mixture of the peanut in the Bahia, the peanut adding a lot of value in that diet and balancing out. Okay. So I think Dr. Debrestein has her contact information there and also some links, some links, some cool links. If anybody has a hundred questions, you can submit in the chat here. We'll try to address, but for sake of time, we'll move on to Dr. DeLorenzo's talk. Yeah. Let me make it stop sharing. Hold on. Yeah. There we go. Okay. Awesome. Let me just share a quick slide here for introducing Dr. DeLorenzo. Dr. DeLorenzo is a professor and beef nutrition specialist here at the University of Florida. He's located in Mariana at the North Florida Research and Education Center. Dr. DeLorenzo has primary research and extension interest in beef nutrition and how to improve the efficiency of use of forages without minimizing an environmental impact. So his research focuses on rumenal metabolism, fermentation emissions and greenhouse gases and nutrient excretion in cattle systems. And today he'll be talking about importance of hay quality in cattle nutrition. Dr. DeLorenzo, the floor is yours. Thank you, Marcelo. Let me begin sharing. Can you see my screen? Yes. Good. All right. Well, thank you. And thanks to all the organizing committees for this opportunity. I really look forward to the in-person part of the short course. I think it's a very interesting topic that we never get tired of talking about hay here in Florida. And I'm going to skip all the all the introductory slide that I usually use of why we need hay in Florida. I'm going to assume that at this point there's no need to explain why we have this imbalance of the amount of forage produced in the summer versus what some of our nutrition needs are in the winter or even in the transition from winter to fall. So winter to spring. One of the things that I also wanted to, well, just take advantage of just to start addressing or at least just to try and find that I'm going to talk mostly about cattle. And Dr. Duberstein did a great job covering even some of the basic stuff for the forage, which is going to help me a lot on my talk. So I'll try to keep some of those those basic concepts and try to get more into how we can apply that into that knowledge into beef cattle diet. So I'll just start with something that I read on or I found on the internet that I thought it was interesting. It is definitely a transformed world. And in case you might have a small screen, I'm going to read that out to you. It's saying whoever said one person can't change the world never ate an undercooked bat. So I actually thought that was a an interesting way to summarize what all we're going through right now. And it has been it definitely has transformed a world and we certainly hope we could get back to to at least some more in-person meetings in the near future. But so I'll just start with a little bit of I guess, you know, you can you may already philosophize about what what is here? How is it the most expensive feed in the operation? That's the question I always get. I used to say and I still say it depends on what time of year and when. And I put some numbers to illustrate that. I updated this slide many times. And basically, when one considers the hay and then talking about the cattle operation, when one considers the the waste, I have updated this this slide. Let me share my. Yeah, here's the pointer. So what I have here, I calculated something. I'm not going to go through the detail that I always encourage producers to do. And that is to calculate the each one of the the feed ingredient and the per pound of TDN or crude protein, basically per pound of nutrient. And I will echo the comments of Dr. Duberstein about the we do tend to work more on TDN on the cattle work, but we also are all constantly converting back to mega-cals. But that's a unit of energy that that I will refer to for most of my presentation. So total digestible nutrient. So recognizing that if I do this on the basis of protein, hay will be a very expensive way to supply protein to cattle. So I try to give the hay a break and use TDN. And if we put and then you can you can use your own numbers of this, but at a 13% waste, and I will cover that out. I will share why it is 13%. Because in some some work done in the north, that's that's what trailer feeding of hay appears to be in terms of waste feeding weight. So that puts that $100 a ton roll to $115 a ton at a 55 TDN, that hay is costing about 10 cents per pound of TDN. If I do the same with a 50-50 corn gluten soy hole, just just looking at a common supplemental feed during the winter here, we're looking at 16 cents per pound of TDN with today price. I think I might have done this at $250 a ton using 78% TDN for this mixture. So the answer, the short answer to that is still hay is a pretty cost effective way to feed cattle through the winter. But hopefully, as I will try to convince you to my presentation, it needs something else. But definitely on the bulky side of things, hay is actually still a pretty decent buy. Of course, if I apply 25% waste instead of instead of 13, quickly, we get into the 14 cents per pound in hay. And then it started approaching what something like a commodity gluten and soy hole may may look like. So we got to be very careful. Waste is a big factor to consider, particularly in cattle feeding operations. And one thing that I had to address not too long ago on another extension talk was this issue of shorting protein in hay-based diet. It's never a good idea. Hopefully, I'll try to convince you why. But hay in general, at least the hay that we mostly end up working with in the southeast, it is relatively poor in protein. There's always some exceptions. In fact, we have had some exceptional exceptions that I had to work with on very well fertilized tipton 85, for instance, Bermuda grass. But when most of the hay that usually we use, and particularly beef cow operations for wintering cow, it may be more than the 8 to perhaps 10% range of crude protein. And that is not enough to get the rumen to produce enough of that protein, which ends up in the cheapest source of protein that we have, the rumen micro. So sometimes we resource to some sort of supplemental approach on top of either stockpile or hay and stockpile forage or conserve forage in any way. There are many options. There are high protein concentrates, and there are several of our allied industry in the audience that are well familiar with this and can help you with some of this. liquid supplements, which I've done a lot of work with, and I'm a big proponent of those. And there's a lot of options that can help create a synergistic effect of feeding the rumen so that that rumen can take care of the ruminant, in a sense, and get that response to the supplement. And here's something that we did locally, actually, here at NFREC, taking advantage of some of the newer technologies that are there for precision feeding. What you see here on the right hand of the screen is called SuperSmart Feed. It's basically a unit that allows supplementation of individual cows based on radio frequency ID. So in this case, we have a little over 100 head of heifers in one pasture, and they were all fit different amounts. So what you see in this graph, basically, is the impact. This were on hay for a portion of that, and then, actually, they were on corn silage, which it is. Corn silage is not much better than average quality hay in terms of protein. In terms of energy, definitely not, but in terms of protein, it's deficient. So we had a little bit of hay in this pasture, and then corn silage ad lividum, and these heifers were growing. They were newly weaned, and they were lacking protein. So we basically did this short study for a few days, and then we weigh them. And what you see here is, and the label in the in the middle of each bar, the N is how many of how many heifers were in each category, which it was just was by actually, we were hoping all of them will consume four to five pounds. So that each bar represented like zero to one, one to two, two to three, three to four, or four to five pounds per day of a 20% crude protein, that it was basically a commercial crude protein supplement. So what we saw is this heifer growing as they were, if they did not access that feeder at all, so they consumed less than a pound or zero, they basically lost weight. They were very close to losing some of them a pound a day, which it was quite surprising. I think under different conditions, they might have been at least gaining close to zero or basically maintaining. But this growing animal do need the protein. That's the main point. And the main point I want to illustrate with this slide is why sometimes we need to resource to some of those things that were discussed before in terms of supplementing, basically helping the hay, the way I like to call it, to meet the requirements of that growing ruminant. Then you can see almost linear effects. So as we increase the amount to the point that we have 23 heifers eating the four to five pounds that was the target amount. So the heifer were gaining a little, well, quite a bit over a pound and a half, 1.65. So you can see a clear gradient here. And the biggest point of this is even with average or even good quality hay, we may still be in need of some protein to, in order to maximize that. And a question that I've been chasing for many years and you, you might have seen some, some slides of this presentation and in a different version is that whether cows are eating enough to achieve maintenance. Can we design, I always like to make this point, if it is possible to design a cost effective supplementation strategy, if we don't know what, how much hay or forage those animals are consuming. So that led me to this study, I apologize if some of you have seen this slide before. I have presented it quite a bit, but today it's probably the best experiment that we have done here at NF-REC in terms of assessing hay intake. Basically we have 120 cows divided into, this picture is actually taken during this study. So all the cows on the right had a calf on the side, so cow-calf pairs, five per pen. So there's 12 pens all the way here to the end. And on the left 12 pens of five cows, weaned cows that we had just weaned their, their calves a little before, about a month before the study. So they, they had a time to, actually three, about two to three weeks before the study. We used Bahia, Bermuda grass hay, 10.85. We fed that for 56 days. 10.5 protein, 67 TDN. You can see it's probably one of the best hay that we can have here at our station. And all we did was just, among other things, we were looking at using this devices here that you may be familiar with. These are called Grow Safe Unit. Basically they're feeders that have load cells on the side. So when the animals approach the bunk, one at a time, we get individual feed intake. So we were able to collect feed intake over the 12, over the 56 days of the study. We have 12 pens in each of the treatment, 60 in each side. So this is the result from that study that I, that I've shown many times already. But basically on the leg, we have the suckled beef cows. The total amount of hay may not tell you much if I didn't tell you how big these cows were. So then I, I just put it on a percentage of body weight, which is the most common way to see hay intake. This was a big surprise to me, to be honest, because I always used to formulate diets or balanced cow diets in the winter, assuming a 2% intake on hay. And we just realized at least this study, and it could have been some reason why, why this, but even with lactating cows, where this were like about five month old calves on the side, those five month old calves were consuming five pounds of hay. So it's not a, not a small amount. So when, when those calves were sucking with the calf on inside the pen, they consumed 1.7% of the body weight. Same cow or same type of cows, but when they were weaned on the other side of the, of the, of the barn, they were consuming 1.4% of the body weight. And that led to a reduction in intake. And this is a concept that all producers are familiar with. We tend to wean so that we can reduce the, that, that burdening in that cow. When we reduce, when we wean those animals, we're reducing the intake by the pair. Now I'm talking cow and calf by about 32%, 32% in the pair. So basically a third. Whereas if we just look at the cow intake, that cow, so that is that 1.4 to 1.7, that, that was a reduction of 15% in, in dry matter intake. So that's, that's how much we can generate in terms of savings of hay when we wean. And this is the, the size of those cows that you can see on the left set of bars, the suckled cows, basically over 56 days, they lost weight. Whereas the cows that were weaned before going into the barn and fed for 56 days hay, they maintained their body weight. The loss of body weight and the ones that were suckling was 84 pounds. Whereas there was no change in the ones that were weaned. So what's the, the moral of this? And I can, one last slide on this is the body condition score. It goes in the same direction you would expect. Basically, suckling cows lost body condition score. Whereas the weaned cows on the same diet, the same hay, and nothing. I actually had a mineral supplement that was the only other thing that they had. But other than that, it was just straight hay. Those cows that were weaned gain body condition. So the overall point of this, besides learning about what intakes we're getting of hay with, with Bermuda grass, one of the main points of the study was that first the intake of hay seems to be maybe a little less than what, what I used to think there are several factors going in there. One could be waste. Another one could be the fact that this was done towards the end of the summer. So maybe the intakes in the middle of the winter would have been different. So those are the questions that are still hunting us a little bit, but it was interesting to see that when those cows, that at the full potential, when they were lactating, and we know they were in the pooling of high demand for nutrients during lactation, they still were able to consume only 1.7 pounds per day. So that was, that gave us a starting number to develop something. And I know some of you in the audience have used this. Some of you have asked me to make modifications. I recognize several of you that I know I am in depth because I need to get back and make some modifications to this tool. But this is one of the tools that I developed mostly for me, and I did not expect to have the reception that it generated from producers and their clientele. All it is, is basically a fancy Excel spreadsheet that I call it the UFA balancer. And there's a few links here where you can download it and some instructions on how to use it. And it started, it evolved from an Excel spreadsheet that I used to have for me just to balance our dice here at the station. I give you this, this is actually, like I say, it's an Excel with some macros that allows you to choose from our common feed ingredients in the area. You can create your own, you can add more feeds. And by using some of this macros that you'll see, you can basically change the nutrient settings of that protein and TDN. All this does is balance for protein and TDN. And at this point only, and I will, Paulette, I know you're one of the people that have been asking me about this and I haven't forgotten about what I need to do. There has been a lot of demand to expand this tool to improve applications, such as probably developing heifers or even to make it so that it can use a fixed amount of hay intake. Right now it's designed to balance a diet that is provided, a hay diet that is a free choice, basically, and uses the intake that I have generated, that 1.7 or 1.4 percent of the body weight. The intake that I have generated, data I've generated, I use it to calculate the shortage of protein on TDN. So basically, this is showing the summary screen of that, but everything that is orange, you can change. And this will allow you to determine the cost per cow per day total, including hay and all the supplement only, and whether that diet needs to be balanced for TDN or protein. That's all it does. It's a really very simple tool and I'll be more than glad to walk you through if you have any questions. But it's something that I've been using a lot and I've been trying to promote and eventually I like to expand it a little bit. So the more usage I get out of this, the more feedback I'm getting and it's been just a simple enough tool to balance for again, protein and TDN in cattle. This is, if you go, sorry, I'm going to back out one more time, this one website here, which is our NFRC Beef and Forage webpage. If you go to the bottom of that, our webpages are not fancy, I have to recognize, so that's why I'm showing this. You go to the UFA balancer and it will download the latest version of that. And there's a few, actually the link above, it shows you how to use it, but it really requires minimal expertise for that. So that is one tool that is out there. Dr. Bluberstein already touched a little bit on RFQ, made my job easier because I don't even have to tell you, or maybe I shouldn't have to tell you the difference between RFV and RFQ. We are moving away quickly from RFV for years now. Relative feed quality is a better predictor of hay quality because of several reasons, but the main one being that it has an estimated in vitro digestibility that it's used to estimate at TDN. The formula for RFQ is here, and basically it's a way to compare different hay values. But one thing I wanted to, hay quality, sorry. One thing I wanted to point out is this is started with the dry matter intake as a percentage of body weight. And that's where, that's where I started questioning the values that we have for relative equality. I think sometimes it's hard to determine that number and it's hard to, definitely hard to measure it, but there are equations that, that can assist you in that, always based on chemical analysis, which is going to be my next big point I want to make. The importance of testing. The, like I said, the formula is relatively simple and it is just a way to compare apples to apples when it comes to hay quality. And for all of this, as well as with that formulator or hay balancer that I show you, the key in the beginning of everything is this, testing. It is key. We have done at the Panhandle group, Extension group, we have emphasized for years this, and I know many other groups have done the same. We have articles in our Panhandle Ag newsletter that, that show you the step-by-step processes for hay sampling in analysis. That was discussed previously and the only point I want to make here is how important it is to have that starting point of what that nutrient balance is, even if it's just crude protein and TDN. That is the cheapest. If you can get more information, even, even greater. But we even have a option within IFAS that can get you a value of crude protein and TDN in a relatively inexpensive way. So I'm going to begin to wrap up or just to get into the end of my presentation by, by, by showing some data, some of our own data for one of my former PhD students, soon to be joining University of Georgia actually, Francine Macias, Henry now. And, and she did a couple experiments. I won't get into all the details of what we did at that point when we were after improving fiber digestion in hay with different treatments. But basically all I, all I want to point out of these two experiments, it was, one was bahiagrass hay without supplementation. And in the next one we learned and we knew how bad, we confirmed how bad that was. And then we provided some supplementation. So this is another point to make of why we need to supplement. So these were growing heifers. I'm going to back up, sorry, one more time to show you the weights to highlight that these were our newly weaned heifers and steers. Uh, five, between five and six weight cattle. So very green, assigned to different pastures, blocks, et cetera. When we fed them for 56 days, bahiagrass, and don't worry about the treatment, we were, like I say, trying different ways to improve the hay. None of them, as you can tell, were very successful. But, but you will see the, the big difference that protein makes in my next slide. So this first experiment was 8.3% fruit protein, 46% TDA, IVOMD, which could be a proxy for TDN. So very, I would say average, I wouldn't even call it a poor. We have, I've seen worse hay than that, on bahiagrass. So those, those animals on average, you see, they lost, we could call it almost even, they, they, they maintain a bet. Actually, they lost close to a tenth of a pound per day. So that hay, even just that average hay for growing cattle does not work very well. And that's something that, and maybe it should not surprise anybody. Then we turned around and we added for different reasons. We wanted, we still were after our calcium oxide treatment, which like I say, won't, I don't want you to, to focus on that at this point. But what we did, all we did is the same hay, turned around and did another 56 days, same animals. Well, now we just, we weigh them again. So we got a starting weight. And now we fed 0.3% of the body weight per day of cotton seed meal. Cotton seed meal, it was close to, I believe 38, 39% fruit protein. So that, that's all we did. And you can see the drastic change. Same hay out of the same field, probably even the same cut. Now we got heifers gaining, or it was a mixture of heifer and steer that we're gaining between 1.2, close to 1.2 pounds per day. Again, our treatment did not work, but that was, that was not the main, the main point that I want to use here, is how big of a difference, 0.3%. So if you're talking about 600 pound animal, we're talking about about 2 pounds a day or less of cotton seed meal, which in terms of cost, it's really not a very costly, yeah, that one part a day of cotton seed meal did the trick and took us from a zero to a 1.2 average daily gain. So that, the main point I want to make with this is how important it is to balance diets, because the hay has to be the base of the diet. There's no question about that. I show you my first light, it's still in one of our cheapest, if not our cheapest, uh, feed in terms of cost of dry matter. But if we don't help that hay a little bit, it's, it doesn't do any good as you can, as you saw a little before. At that point, when we did the study, we were talking about 25 cents per head per day, the daily cost of supplementing this shy of two pounds of cotton seed meal, 25 cents per head per day, took us from a zero to 1.2 hour daily gain, uh, value. So, um, some work, uh, and the next question that, that all we always get is, well, the fact that hay, feeding hay in both ways, there are ways to get around that. Of course, a worse one will be feeding in the ground, but, but there are people that do that and, and you just factor maybe, uh, depending, I've, I've seen research anywhere from 14 to 25 percent waste when it's, um, just feeding on the pasture on the ground. If you can adopt any of these technologies, uh, that, that obviously come at a cost, some of them are not as costly as, as, uh, one may think, but, but they add up to the, to the burden of the, of the operation. But you can look at, and the bottom here, cone feeders, there have been, uh, this is all work done in the Midwest, uh, Michigan, but, uh, the waste, basically I want to concentrate on, not so much on the, I'm going to skip the pound per cow and I'm going to go straight to this percentage. These are the numbers that, that I want to send a message about in this slide. Uh, the cone is not very common, but the hay rings are very common, particularly in our area. So we have seen repeatedly, and there's several studies that came to the same conclusion, a six percent, five to six percent reduction, uh, six percent waste when we feed ring, like, hay in the ring structure, hay ring, uh, a little bit more with a trailer, 13 percent, and some of the, the cradle types, uh, seem to offer for reasons that, that I'm not sure I understand. They, they get a little higher, um, waste, so 17 percent. So the point, biggest point in here is, if nothing else, a hay ring, just thinking about cost effectiveness of some of this structure, the hay ring, uh, it does a job. I mean, it's not perfect. There's no zero waste, but it's certainly, uh, it's one of the, the technologies, quote unquote technologies, I guess, that, that we could adopt in order to, to begin shrinking that, that winter feeding cost. Uh, there's no way to avoid losses. That's some, that's something has to be very clear, but the hay ring could allow us to, uh, reduce that waste as much as, uh, six percent. So as to have that waste as low as six percent. So, um, and just, just, uh, wrapping up to, to allow for some, some time for questioning, uh, I wanted to, uh, just very briefly talk about losses. So this is something, it's a picture that we see, uh, sometimes. So these are net wrap, uh, hay bales. So they should be okay. They're really, we've done our job. Uh, those, uh, are, are already net wrapped. So that saves us from, but they're in the middle of the water. So the job doesn't, uh, we can pick the, the man, the message here, you probably, you, you probably know you are getting the message, but, uh, we got to do a little more than just, uh, the wrapping of the veils. The next step will be how we store them, where we place them, and how we avoid them to get in touch with, with, uh, moisture. And there's things we can do, and sometimes there's things that are impossible to control for. So this is not very uncommon, as you probably know, but there's things that sometimes can help us to prevent that. So to, to wrap up and allow for, for, uh, enough time for questions, what are some of the, the summary and conclusions out of this? Hopefully I convinced you how important is testing. It's a starting point of quality and balancing. We cannot do balancing of hay dyes if we don't know how much they're consuming. We're doing research to address that. And what are the nutrients of that hay? And that is entirely up to producers. And we certainly do, we try to do what we can on the extension side, and we're here to help. I always say, if you have any questions, many of you do a really good use of our, uh, county faculty. If you are not one of those producers, I, I encourage you to reach out to Nick, because we do have many tools available. They can help you with the, uh, some of the testing material. They certainly can direct you towards the labs, uh, assist you in what type of analysis, uh, you need to do. Uh, you can always reach out to, to us, state, especially as also, we have a, a very vast network, not only in Florida, but some of our neighboring states that are partnering in this short course. They, they also have a very good network of resources that can help you with that. Hay losses cannot be avoided. That is something that, uh, it's a given. Can turn hay into the most expensive feed. I don't think we are there. The reason why we're not there partially is also because feeds are very expensive right now. I gave a similar talk. I was going over my slide for a talk that I gave five years ago, and I had, it was probably one of the, the cheapest, uh, time that I've seen for commodities. We had hay costs almost as high per pound of TDN as high as corn gluten at that. And again, it's all about the waste. So if you can manage waste, uh, hay can still continue to be one of the, the, the cheapest, uh, feeds that we can have in the operation, but it's certainly cheap. It doesn't mean that we shouldn't invest in waste to preserve it better. So if nothing else, my only point out of this conclusion, if nothing else, at least consider buying a hay ring. That will shrink your waste to 6%. Shorting energy of protein, uh, in growing cattle can be costly, particularly protein. And I show you that, that set of slides, I show you the linear effect of protein supplementation. We can have something as good in terms of energy, as good as corn silage, and growing cattle still might be short on protein. When we put protein, and we do have another set of studies going on right now with sorghum and corn silage with different levels of protein, they have, we're, we're getting some really, uh, interesting data out of that. They show the impact that that protein has in growing cattle. We're not really, uh, maybe, uh, discovering anything that hasn't been said before. What it's the biggest impact that I see on that is the number that we get, the impact on how much more we get out of a good energy forage when we balance that diet for it for protein also. Um, take advantage of the session tool like the one I presented, the UFA balancer. Uh, UGA has, uh, excellent resources too, uh, for balancing diets and particularly for calculating the cost per pound of TDN and per pound of fronting. So take advantage of those tools when you can. And we're, like I said, we're here to help in extension. So, um, I think this is one, uh, uh, bullet point that, uh, soon I might face out. I think RFQ is definitely, uh, the preferred way to assess quality of hay. For many reasons, main one means that include fiber digestion. So that allows you to compare, uh, different forages and decide which one may go for horses, for instance, versus, uh, what may be better for a, a dry cow over the winter, uh, something that may require less nutrients. And there are many more technologies that are emerging, which is the point of this short, this short course. Uh, we're gonna get to see some of those in action. I am, it's my understanding, Marcelo, in the field. So that would be great. There, the field of hay, uh, or forage conservation, um, it's, it's evolving, uh, quite a bit. And there's been newer material for wrapping, uh, for harvesting. And, and I would always encourage you to take advantage of opportunities like this to see what else is out there. There's a lot more than, and not to even mention inoculants and things like that, that have perhaps little value in hay, but when we start getting to talk about bailage or even silage, then, uh, those, those tools are very cost effective. So with that, uh, I just want to acknowledge my lab current and past lab members, including, uh, interns that generated a lot of this research. I do have a, uh, uh, the Lorenzo Nutrition Lab. It's our, uh, web page for labs. So we get, we always posting news, uh, research news, et cetera. So, and if you have any questions, you can reach out to me through that web page or, um, through our extension faculty. Thank you, Marcelo. That's all I have. I don't know if, Alex, I'll turn it back to you if we have time for questions. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. DeLorenzo for the, for the quest, for the presentation. I'd like to open the floor for any questions that we may have from the audience. One of the, one of the things I, I, I like you mentioned there is I think it's very important about hay testing. Of course, we're, we're working on, on hay testing here, but it's how, how the cheap hay can be very expensive later on, um, between reduction of intake and reduction of performance and increase of waste that can be very, very expensive and nothing like testing. So you can, um, no other way than testing to, for you to be able to balance that, uh, hay quality or that diet quality, I should say. I have one question, Marcelo. Go ahead, Felipe. Yeah. So Nicolas, just a question. What, would you recommend the producers to seek as cheap, uh, protein sources in Florida? And if possible, if they have a small area where they could, plant winter grasses, could they use that as a protein concentrate for when they're feeding hay and maybe do some hours of grazing per day, would that work for them or not? Yeah, that's the guy asking, I was just gonna, I usually know all the answers. He's, uh, um, no, that's a really good, good question. That's a question that, as you know, we get all the time. I would, you say cheap, cheap sources. There are no cheap, uh, protein sources right now. That's really the, the, the, the easier way to answer that is right now, nothing is cheap in terms of protein or, or even supplements. Cheap pair supplements, uh, in Florida, I still on a, I always encourage people to do the math and do it on a per pound of crude protein. Uh, that is, that's the best way to compare it to do that. There are tools, uh, one of the best ones, actually, it's, uh, one that my colleagues at UGA have done, a calculator for that, to calculate basically cost per pound of TDN or pound of protein. And right now, when you do that, I'm, I'm, uh, as you may imagine, I'm always doing that, uh, because we get questions every week. And it's still, I would consider probably the best protein sources as far as being the cheaper one in the area continue to be cotton seed meal. Uh, at times, uh, gluten, maybe gluten is not as high as cotton seed meal or distillers. Uh, the still and cotton seed meal probably still and whole cotton seed, not, not, not mention whole cotton seed whenever we have access to that. Those are, uh, some of the, as far as the commodities, perhaps those are the cheapest one. And the one that we can never forget is non-protein nitrogen. That's probably on a per unit of nutrient continues to be the cheapest one. It has some limitations in terms of growing cattle. Sometimes it may, uh, it may limit what we can get out of NPN urea more, more commonly. And that's one big difference that we, we, uh, with, with hand gut fermenter like horses, we, in cattle, we have the advantage of using urea. We, I mean, when I say we, the Southeast in general have made really good use of urea or non-protein nitrogen for, for, uh, wintering animals and the companies and nutrition companies know that. And they, many of the products include that, whether it's molasses fortified or, uh, urea in, in a, in a pelleted cube. But, uh, those are still probably the three top ones that count, or four, if I include distillers, gluten, consume meal, and always, uh, urea or any other NPNs, or they could be biorette, it could be nitrates. Thank you. Do you have any other questions? Well, for the sake of time, I think we're going to move on to the conclusion of this, uh, and, um, my, my zoom is telling me that it cracked. Can you still hear me? Okay. Sounds good. It's kind of like everything froze here for a second. Uh, just want to mention, uh, thank you, Dr. Dubrestein. Thank you, Dr. De Lorenzo for the participation today and for Purina and Farmer Scope for presenting this talk. Next week, uh, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 5 p.m. Central time, we're going to talk about tools on hay production, weather forecasting tools with Dr. David Zierden from Florida State University, and also inoculants with Dr. Juan Romero from the University of Maine. Uh, one last thing I'd like to share with you for one last time is just to acknowledge our sponsors, because that's how we can get things done. Uh, South, this project is presented by the Southeast State Contest in Massey Ferguson, and, uh, in collaboration with Mayo Fertilizer, Florida Gateway, Fairgrounds, Hobo Tractor. Associate sponsors are Purina, uh, and Farm Credit, and trade show sponsors that you'll be able to visit on September 2nd are Corteva, AgriKing, and Cardin. Those that we, that will not be able to, that can join us on September 2nd, I'll be glad to see you in person there, but I hope to see everyone next week on Thursday, August 26th. Thanks everyone. I hope you have a great evening.
