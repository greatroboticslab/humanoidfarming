 I'm a little more hopeful. Oh yeah. I'm holding my breath now. Hurts me to say that. For bad news, I was afraid to ask. Lookie, lookie, lookie, y'all! Lunch. Lunch duty. Alright. We're gonna use work and busting rock. Cinder block. Oh, this is what he's been doing. Look! Okay. He's already got all this done in the last few hours. So resourceful. Alright, he has eaten. Gonna get back at it. Doesn't have any air in there, so... Lucy's in the shade over here a little bit. Well, we had a good supper. It's actually Father's Day. I know this will air not on Father's Day. Anyway, happy Father's Day to all the amazing dads out there. Happy belated Father's Day. So Lawrence's work today, but he got himself a good steak and I made him a red velvet cake. And we had that and now we're gonna... We got some rain puddled up. Just had showers come through, some storms. And now we're gonna take down a few more limbs. None of these sites are gonna have trees over them though. These are all gonna be in the open. And that seems to be the preference. I thought that the sites that had like some tree cover were gonna be the most popular. They're not. The one that we have that's in the open is the one that everybody wants. So, maybe this will make everybody extra happy. But he's got a few... He hasn't been able to really work under a few of these limbs very well with a traco. So, they're gonna take care of that. And they're pretty low. So, Wesley should not have to get as high as he did last time. I hope that sun's bright. He's very sure he's gonna have to take this tree down. And I'm very hopeful that he doesn't. But even if he doesn't, it's probably gonna... It's gonna be right... I don't know. I don't know. I don't think... I think it's gonna be... Yeah. I think it's in the bad spot. Shucks. I don't know. I just stepped it off. I just stepped it off. I mean, obviously this is very not precise. Which is right up my alley. But I did like seven strides across that pad. And I got on the other side of the septic. And I did like seven. And then I did like five for in between. And then I did seven more. And I came up on this side of the crepe myrtle. So... I'm a little more hopeful. But it'll just be right here in the corner. Oh, I hope it can stay. Back to our OSHA approved programming. Oh, yeah. But one thing I do notice about over here is that because of these trees, a couple hours before sunset, these are gonna start... These are gonna start getting a little shade. Whereas those are directly... They're direct... They're in the view of the sunset until it is gone. So, there's that. Wow. Got the big saw now. Oh, boy. That's a big one. Okay. I'll stop holding my breath now. Okay. I'll stop holding my breath now. Okay. I'll stop holding my breath now. Seven tenths. Seven tenths? Seven tenths? Yeah. That's a big one. Okay. I'll stop holding my breath now. What is it? Seven tenths? Seven tenths. whoa it rained a lot more than we realized last night well with the two tenths we had yesterday that makes nine tenths an inch we basically had an inch of rain so lawrence is not going to be able to grade today he was going to finish grading those sites he said he can't do that in the mud he can't just push around mud so and it's actually supposed to stay cloudy all day so anyway oh well it's the way it goes oh gosh the dogs dogs dogs dogs oh that's one way to do it time to soak time to soak these bad boys put them in a big tub and okay that's enough water well it appears we have more rain heading our way there's storms west of us heading this way Lawrence is giving his truck a wash it's been sitting a while very very thankful very very thankful that that truck has finally sold we've had it listed for how long now a couple months um he knew it would sell he just had to wait for the right person to come along so somebody's actually driving up here tomorrow from sumter south carolina it's like over four hour drive so hopefully that goes through and we're we're down one vehicle wouldn't that be amazing without just something being broke but i mean actually yeah sold okay y'all we are back in the kitchen and you will never guess you'll never guess what i'm cooking tonight wait for it just wait just wait i'm cheating i'm cheating on our beef i'm cheating with chicken that's funny i don't care who you are that's funny okay um yeah so we went to a little i can't remember if i mentioned this or not we went to we have like where are y'all you are okay we went to austin and i went to this little amish store that we have in the county it's super cute anyway and they have all you know all this fun stuff there and so we bought this garlic parsley noodles um because my girl she loves pasta right like all the carbs she gets that for my mother we like we like that um her daddy not so much but that's okay you know we can't we can't all have we can't all have all have what we like every single night but so anyway i was like what's she gonna make of this she's like some kind of chicken so how about chicken thigh okay yeah i was making sure i got the boneless skinless i was hoping i did so i got little chicken thighs because they do tend to taste better i think than like dry breast anyway um so i just found a little recipe i'm just gonna put some seasoning on it i'm gonna bake bake it i'm gonna bake it that's what i'm doing and then i'm gonna cook the pasta and she wants a garlic butter sauce so i'm gonna also look up a recipe for that and then we need something green i don't know i'll find something green in the cabinet probably little sewer peas so i don't think i have anything else and um that's what we're doing tonight and it is thundering and i do believe we're gonna have a little stormy storm so i mean the humidity you know you could just like ring it you could just ring the humidity out of the air because it's so humid um man if it rains if we get another strong storm i was gonna say shower and then shower and storm started to come together and it just wasn't working it's really gonna push back getting these sites worked on this week and so there's a lot going on this is really actually a very busy summer for us like off the farm busier than normal because i decided that this was the year that um i'm doing things i'm doing things i'm doing things i'm not letting the farm still another summer and we're doing less on the farm we're doing we're not doing the beans and the corn so that helps um being able to get away some so next week just give you a little rundown next week monday through friday austin and i will be away at youth camp wesley will be working um so i will be at camp with her all week and then we come back and we're home for a week and then hopefully we're going back to the river for a few days around the 4th and then we're home for a week and then it's somewhere else i don't know there's something else and then the first week of august the kids and i are heading out west we are doing a whole little roundabout from denver to arches national park in utah to gunnison back to denver to red rocks to see our friend ben fuller play at red rocks and um hopefully get cowboy hats up in um what you call it oh come on mayor where's your brain um greely greely hat works i've got that reminds me i need to make that appointment wow i gotta get that done so um and then uh in between all that austin has driver's ed for a week that's coming up and that's also in august and then wesley's birthday is in august and then all these things to figure out so it's a lot going on a lot going on oh and then i'm taking austin and alex to the outer banks in september so that's a lot it's a lot happening y'all um and then of course finishing the rv park and well at least finishing phase two deciding if we're going to phase three letting just figuring it all out so um that's where we're at okay four minutes sorry about that let's see what we can do with some chicken okay well i'm washing dishes and i really messed up because i did not i did not video or show you what i cooked and i spent a long time doing it i was just focused so i thought it was really good was it good at all it was good i mean it was it was good but the thing is this is what i know about chicken chicken has no flavor has no inherent flavor so i put all the seasoning on it i mean you could see the seasoning i know what i put in it and i doubled what it said like garlic powder garlic powder what was that onion powder salt pepper paprika oregano like all this stuff and it still was kind of bland like what i don't i think i'm just so spoiled with beef because beef is it's better y'all it's just better okay but anyway awesome's like do they make just some kind of chicken seasoning like i guess they do but i put all this stuff on it you think it would have given it a lot of flavor and it didn't so feel free to give me your suggestions but i just don't know what else i can do to make chicken taste tasty but anyway it was good the pasta was really good um it really tasted different like i think that pasta was like homemade or yeah i think it was anyway i also would love to do more of that and i started looking into it and y'all then pasta attachments for like the kitchen aid are ridiculously expensive got a lot of ridiculous so i might look on marketplace or something but she's made pasta before and that's really good but it's time consuming and like to cut it up and everything she said it'd be nice to have something that would should roll it through so we'll see about that okay we are going to have a movie night um yeah i don't even like admitting it actually it dawned on me last night that there was actually a john wayne movie that we haven't watched in entirety like it it really hurts me to say that because it was on tv last night and lawrence was watching i was like wait i don't remember this even though i know the name very well the sons of katie elder we haven't watched the full version we haven't watched the full movie so tonight we're going to sit down and watch it and yes that hurts my heart because i would have said that we'd watched pretty much every john wayne movie over the years but you know it's kind of exciting too it's like oh we got a new one all right um yeah in other news the yellow tractor has been moved lawrence and brock were working on it earlier and this was the coolest spot because there was shade right dixie um i can't tell you exactly what they were doing but he said it was it was running he said it fired right up so we'll see how many years y'all how many years has that been here three three years it hasn't been used yet but maybe it's time is coming maybe it's bush hog cutting time is coming i think that was what they were working on the bush hog park anyway we're going over here to see what he's doing he is doing more grating it's finally dried up a little bit um it looks like we could have more pop-up storms just we're just we're in that fun summer weather pattern you know super hot it's 88 supposed to only get hotter from here for the foreseeable future 90s all next week hot sunny um i'm afraid our youth i'm afraid our youth camp is even though it's in the mountains i'm afraid it's still going to be pretty warm so anyway it is it is what it is um i want her to get used to riding uh the truck did sail i know that's in this video the truck sold yesterday dawson actually from charleston and the air force i believe it's what laurence said um i did get to meet him for a second and he was just the nicest guy and he seemed so excited so we sold the truck that was working and now the chevy lawrence came in um a little while ago and he said more bad news i was afraid to ask i'm always afraid to ask he said the transfer case is going out in that truck and from what i gathered asking more questions that's not a good that's a bad that's not good that's not that's not good so brock from god is going to see if he can find a used one in a junk yard that's where we're at and um it's no surprise at this point is it anyway hopefully we can get that fixed without spending an arm and a leg my little uh my little grasses do you see them my little grasses i planted they look so good and green among the weeds and the dirt i want to put more stuff in there but i'm just i don't know what i don't know oh i'm so excited i like what i see looky looky looky looky y'all i see a tree i see a tree still standing and he's got all three of the pads scratched out so yay i didn't know if it was standing or not he didn't tell me got the little dozer doing its thing oh my gosh it's hot out here at least the um at least the dozer if it's not going to be a cab at least it's um open air but anyway a little dozer that could i do believe we might have something rolling in here so he's um taking that big pile of dirt that he had there and using it i was wondering if he was going to need it obviously he does what you doing girl she just told me she was here i know you're here baby i know it's hot out here and then she was in the shade i'm a smart girl i'll find me a little shady spot oh yeah there's no doubt it's coming i just looked at the radar i told him it's coming so i'm gonna head back i'm gonna head back i am going to work on supper and um there was just a car that came down but i didn't see it i don't know we definitely had some people coming to check it out which is good um got our little dumpster did i show you that little dumpster that's good yeah it's actually a pretty pretty big line so i'm gonna go ahead and see what that looks like and it doesn't look like there's any chance of it missing us so our next monthly comes in in a couple days and um here we go all right y'all i hope this finds you well we will see you back next time you you
