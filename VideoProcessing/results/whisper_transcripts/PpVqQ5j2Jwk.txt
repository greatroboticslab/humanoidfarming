 Small holdings in developing countries have long been associated with poor farm practices, intensive labour, low productivity and low income. This has made the sector particularly unattractive to a new generation of farmers. But this seems to be changing. IICD's projects for young farmers in Kenya show that ICT can play a role in attracting youth into agriculture. By enhancing access to market information, production techniques, new technologies and financing opportunities, their perspectives have changed. Farming is now moving from a backbreaking, poorly paid, labour intensive task to a solid source of income and a much more profitable and rewarding business. Let's have a look at an ICT enabled journey into profitable farming. Young farmers struggle to make ends meet because of unprofitable agricultural activities. As soon as they hear about the potential of using ICT as a tool to increase their income from farming, they want to be part of this. Once they start acquiring basic ICT skills, the youths begin to identify the potential of ICT to make their farming activities profitable. The young farmers are trained at ICT centres that are also open to other farmers and community members. The training includes sessions on how to use ICT equipment and software that best addresses farming challenges within the local context. Gradually, the young farmers start applying their ICT skills to obtain reliable market price information. This enhances their power to negotiate and their position in relation to local traders, businesses and other key value chain players. Their digital competencies in combination with the right tools help them keep records, identify crops that are in high demand, access information about pest control and new farming practices and technologies. We can search market prices using our bones. We can even Google to internet to see more information about agriculture. And also through videos. By seeing videos, by seeing how other people work. The early adopters of ICT for farm management now reap the first benefits of their activities. This return on investment motivates them to continue applying their skills on their farms. Some of them start renting or buying land, in addition to obtaining land from their parents, which in turn offers employment opportunities to other youths. We have a Facebook account. So we've been actually chatting with young farmers within our region. How did you go about this? Where do I get this information? So I think they are also benefiting a lot. Due to their increased technical knowledge and higher incomes, the role of youth stands out more strongly, both internally towards their families and externally to extension agents and other community stakeholders. This recognition of their role and added value enables them to link up more effectively with the private sector. This also motivates them to continue applying ICT to farming. After introduction of ICT, I have seen the youth change in attitude. They have found that farming is not only left for those people who are not educated. So the educated youth have come back to farming because of the introduction of ICT. Eventually, the ICT skilled youths emerge as role models, having increased their social status and generated higher yields and incomes. Other community members, young and old, are then inspired by their success and follow suit. To ensure the future viability of the agricultural sector, tackle rural poverty and generate employment, it is crucial to equip tomorrow's farmers with the right tools and skills that will allow them to start off their own journey into profitable farming.
