 Over the last seven years, I turned my 2,000 square foot backyard into a mini homestead where I grow hundreds of pounds of food each year. I started off with one garden bed and zero knowledge on how to grow a single thing. That one garden bed was overwhelming at times and I made plenty of mistakes, but each year I gardened, I fell more in love with growing food and kept expanding my space year after year. It honestly wasn't until year four I started to feel more confident in my skill set. Two years ago, I introduced chickens and started to learn more about taking care of animals. There's truly nothing like having your own fresh eggs right outside your door. Throughout this time, I learned how to can and preserve my food in all kinds of ways, something I never grew up doing. So let this be an example that you don't need acres of land to start your homesteading journey. Your backyard may give you all the lessons you need before you get that acreage.
