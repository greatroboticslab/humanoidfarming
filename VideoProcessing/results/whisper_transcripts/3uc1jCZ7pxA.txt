 What is the challenge of the land for life? Lands for life aims to use behavioral science in order to improve the adoption of sustainable practices. What is the challenge of the land for life? Farmers tend to resort to short-term solutions. They have the challenge of climate change. They have the challenge of increasing pests and diseases. And they basically resort to things that they see that other farmers are doing. So I think that the main challenge, the main barrier is the current social norm. Make their life easy. Make the practice very simple to adopt. So for example, take compost. It is a practice that is relatively easy to do. But when we explain them and when they see the benefits that compost brings them, it's more likely that they will adopt it consistently. I would say that make implementation or the adoption simple, and then gather evidence to show the results is part of this strategy. When you see your neighbor implementing something that is really providing results, and that person helps us in spreading the word, then the whole community will be willing to adopt those practices. What is the challenge of the land-used and agricultural sector? In Colombia, the land-used and agricultural sector accounts for almost 40% of greenhouse gas emissions. And agriculture is like 26% of that proportion. So bringing sustainable agriculture to smallholder farmers, which are like 87% of the farmers in Colombia, is important in terms of climate change. What is the challenge of the climate change? I think that there is something wrong about our food systems. I grew in my grandfather's farm, and I remember that potatoes, carrots, peas, blackberries, milk and cheese came from there. And I relate very much to food as home, as family. And there is something wrong about the current food systems. Food is making us sick. And in spite of abundance, there are many people who are still dying because of hunger, right? So I want to be part of the solution. I want to fix what's wrong with our food systems. And I think that smallholder farmers are a big piece of that puzzle. I think that with the right support and with the right information and incentives, smallholder farmers can really support our efforts towards climate change, while also improving their livelihoods. And this is why I do what I do.
