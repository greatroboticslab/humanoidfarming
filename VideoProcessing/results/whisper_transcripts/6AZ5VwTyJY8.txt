Howto & Style
 So one of the arguments that people have about this, you know, tight, high-density grazing is, well, the cows are on top of each other. You know, we've had people say, well, you can't put 100 cows in an acre. I mean, all they've got, you know, all they've got is manure. Well, here are 200 in three acres, and you can see their spacing. There's plenty of room here. They're not cramped up at all. And so, you know, that whole argument is just people that haven't done it, haven't seen it, don't know any better. They just make that argument. And it's a one day. So they're only going to be here for one day. You can see the front fence right there, and they'll move from there. They'll move into here tomorrow, where we're standing.
