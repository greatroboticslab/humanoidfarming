 Every morning when I wake up, I like to say my prayers, have a cup of tea, and then go downstairs to water my flowers. I have a very small garden that I cater to all by myself. In my garden, there's no water supply, so I usually will have to fetch water from the house and use it to water my beautiful flowers. The process of watering my flowers can be said to be a form of irrigation, and I'll tell you why. Irrigation can be defined as the artificial application of water to soil or land for farming purposes. This could be done in several ways, and there are three major types of irrigation systems, which are surface irrigation, subsurface irrigation, and over-earth irrigation. You should keep in mind that there are several factors that determine the irrigation system to be used. Some of these factors are availability of water, slope of the land, soil type, type of crop, and size of the farmland. Remember, I mentioned that I have no water supply in my garden, so I have to fetch and then apply directly. Also, my garden is small in size. Imagine if I had a much bigger garden. I would get tired attempting to water all the flowers. In this case, I might need a more effective method. Hope you have enjoyed this lesson. In our next one, we'll be looking at the importance of irrigation. See you then. Thank you. Thank you.
