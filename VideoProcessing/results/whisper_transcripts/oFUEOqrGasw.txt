 They painted a cow with black and white stripes. It might seem strange at first, but the effect was surprising. The cow started to look happier and began producing much more milk than before. In fact, there's a direct connection. These helpful stripes confuse mosquitoes and flies. Because of the stripes, the insects avoid coming near the cow and don't bite.
