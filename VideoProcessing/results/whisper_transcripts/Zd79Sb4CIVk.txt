Science & Technology
 Look, the Japanese people are very dangerous when it comes to farming. These people cultivate rice on the rooftops of their houses, and when the rice is ready, they harvest it by hand. And when they grow onions, they spray pesticides using a long bamboo pole with a thin pipe attached to it, which is held by two people. This allows them to spray pesticides over a larger area of the field in less time.
