 I'm Kevin Shelley with the University of Wisconsin Nutrient and Pest Management Program. Winter wheat grown on Wisconsin farms can provide economic and stewardship benefits to an annual grain crop rotation. We harvest winter wheat, such as in this field, in about mid to late July, after which we still have about 30 to 40 percent of the growing season remaining. So rather than just leaving the field fallow, some farms will plant a cover crop to keep something green and growing into the fall for soil health benefits. If we're on a farm that has livestock, particularly feeding cattle, or if we have a market for harvested forages, we might consider planting something that can be harvested as a forage. Wisconsin research shows that the spring cereal grains, such as oats, barley, or triticale, can provide reliable options for late summer planted, fall harvested forage. So for example, in this field, we got the wheat off in about the 20th of July. We baled up the straw. And now we're going to use a no-till drill to go into the wheat stubble and plant about 80 pounds per acre of oats. Unlike when oats or other spring cereals are planted in the spring, at this time of the year, they'll undergo a slower rate of growth with greater accumulation of sugars and more stable concentrations of fiber and energy. That provides a wider harvest window for optimum forage quality. So if we can get these spring cereals planted in late July or early August, we can usually expect between one and a half to three tons of dry matter per acre with relative forage quality, about 110 or a little better, by October. One concern is we can end up with relatively high harvest moisture concentration. So we may need to be prepared to deal with that. And that's especially if we're planting a later maturing variety or one of the forage type oat varieties.
