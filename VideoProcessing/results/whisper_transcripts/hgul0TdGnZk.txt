Science & Technology
 Hi, my name is Matthew Paul and this morning I'm going to be talking about the importance of sugars, particularly sugar signal known as trihalo-6-phosphate in improving crop yields, crop yield potential and drought stress tolerance. We're using this knowledge through genetic modification and chemical intervention in cereals to improve crop yields. What I'm going to be telling you about then is research that we've been performing on sugars in plants and crops and we've been adopting three different approaches to modifying a particularly important sugar called trihalo-6-phosphate that performs a signaling function in plants so it has a very powerful effect and we've been using genetic methods as well as chemistry methods to modify amounts of this sugar phosphate in crops. I want to say to you as young people in science, plant science is often a poor relation to other sciences but I think there's never been a greater need for plant scientists to engage with agriculture because food security is becoming an important global issue. The only way we can really solve food security is by bringing plant science ideas technology into agriculture and wouldn't it be absolutely fantastic if we could find a cure, we often think about a cure for cancer but wouldn't it be fantastic if we could find a cure for food insecurity which still occurs around the world and could again become a problem in the West. We've kind of taken it for granted that we get food in the shops, there's always going to be food there but it wouldn't take much for there to be food shortages. So we do need to think about new ideas and one of the new ideas that we had was to use chemistry to modify trihalo-6-phosphate, I'll be telling you about that as well as the genetic methods. So there is a big need to improve yields as I've just said. We do need to actually move beyond the yield increases that are currently being achieved through conventional breeding. It's not sufficient to avert potential food shortages so we need step changes and that's where technology can come in. And so the sugar pathway that I'll be telling you about actually is about altering the way sugars flow in the plant. So we need to ensure that as much sugar from photosynthesis ends up as yield. It doesn't sit in the rest of the plant but it ends up as yield. And that's easier said than done because the regulation of sugar metabolism and photosynthesis is very strong in plants. It's a bit like the blood sugar. Our blood sugar levels are controlled very strongly. It's very difficult to perturb blood sugar levels in healthy humans. Similarly in plants if you try and increase photosynthesis the plant often down regulates it or will find a way to kind of dampen manipulations that we may make. So we need to be quite clever and think about the endogenous regulation of plant processes. So as I mentioned these are the kind of the global worst case scenarios and we were just talking at breakfast actually about wouldn't it be nice to have a week or two where there isn't some kind of disaster story in the news. Well we do have political instability at the moment unfortunately we're leaving the EU. You know we have Donald Trump as president of the United States. There are these terrorist attacks happening. And the last thing we need at the moment is something like crop failures to compound these kind of insecurities. And of course crop failure and famine has been part of human history. Agriculture has been a great technological achievement but when it goes wrong it can cause serious problems. And in the 13th century there was a period of large scale famine which followed a period of prosperity. So this probably took people by surprise. They'd taken their period of prosperity maybe for granted. There was a series of crop failures and this had big effects. Number of deaths. And of course more recently in Ireland there was the potato famine in the 19th century. And just before the potato famine the population of Ireland was half that of England. So around about 9 million people. And present day population of Ireland still hasn't caught up with where it was in the 19th century. Whereas the population of England now is 55 million. So crop failure can have potentially big consequences, disastrous effects. And of course it's a constant and ongoing battle in certain parts of the world and particularly in Africa. And so in the second half of the 20th century after the second world war there was a period of food rationing ended in the 1950s. We had the Green Revolution which I'll mention again in a moment which saw crop yields increase. Which meant that global food supplies increased. And this graph shows you the state of the world's grain supplies. And so at the end of the 20th century there was a good supply of grain. So I think it says it's over 100 days isn't it? But this has started to come down. And we're now at the stage where we only have a 75 day supply of grain. And of course this is coincident with the financial crisis in 2008 as well. And there are some projections of course. You get these perhaps exaggerated headlines. But nevertheless we need to pay attention to these. And as I've said there's no greater now need for plant scientists to enter into solving some of these problems. And part of the reason why there was a drop in food reserves was a series of bad harvests 2008 and 2010. This caused in about 2008 you may not remember but there was a price of food increased in the shops. And this really kind of raised the attention of the government. And they started to think a bit more seriously about food security. And again in 2010 there were similar things happening. As soon as it starts to affect food prices then you know government starts to get concerned about it. And so why we need these increases in yields is that population continues to grow. So it's projected to continue growing through the 21st century. And there isn't any more land that we can cultivate. So there's always a demand on land for other. And we don't want to be cutting down rainforests and so on or native vegetation. And as the world develops in China particularly there's an increasing demand for meat consumption. And of course that's an inefficient way of using crops. And then there's this ongoing climate change. So what we need to do then is we need to be raising the yield ceiling on crops. And combining that with protecting that yield ceiling against particularly droughts but also other stresses. Particularly drought. Drought is the most widespread abiotic stress that can limit crops worldwide. And so there is a need to actually double yields by 2050. And it's estimated that this requires a 2.4% yield increase per year. And this is above what we're currently achieving. So I've put here the four major food security crops. Cereals particularly are food security crops. And these percentages are the current rate of yield increase that we're achieving for these crops. Wheat is particularly poor at the moment. And this just presents that information in a slightly different way. So the solid lines are the rate at which we're currently increasing these crop yields. And the dotted line is the rate at which we need to be increasing crop yields to avoid food insecurity. So how are we going to do this? Because current breeding is incremental. Obviously it's achieved an awful lot. But it's quite slow. How can we speed it up? Genetic modification has achieved an awful lot for things like herbicide resistance and insect pest resistance. So farmers love grain gym crops in the countries where they're allowed to grow them. It's increased farmer profitability. It's reduced inputs of chemicals for insect pest resistant crops. And the profitability and yields have increased as a consequence of those traits. But there are very few yield traits that have been improved by genetic modification. It's interesting to speculate why that is. Although I will be presenting an example where genetic modification of just one gene has improved yield. But it could be that because yield is such a complex trait, you're not going to be able to do it just by modifying one gene. You need to be able to modify one gene that then regulates lots of genes in order to modify yield. And often we don't know which genes to actually target for yield. So we need this fundamental science understanding to understand much more about how plants work and what actually limits yield in the agricultural environment. And then new technologies coming on with regard to genome editing. This could be a new opportunity for us. It's a non-GM approach. And as I've said, we don't know what the yield genes are. And then we need to be thinking about other possible methods of yield improvement apart from genetics. And so do we need to really completely synthetically, you know, synthetic biology reorganisation of a crop? Or do we actually just need to be kind of tweaking a few genes for regulatory processes that are important? Is it a fine tuning of what's already going on? Or do we need to really completely rethink? I actually think it's a fine tuning of what's going on already. We just need better understanding of what actually limits yield in the agricultural environment. So I want to talk to you about previous improvements in crop yields. The Green Revolution of the 1960s and 70s. Norman Borlaug was behind this. He was someone actually who failed one of his first entrance exams. But he kept going. And we were talking about success and failure yesterday evening. And Winston Churchill once said that success is going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm. And certainly in science, if you want to be successful, you've got to keep going. You've got to be resilient and keep going. Be persistent. And, you know, you shouldn't dismiss failure because you can learn an awful lot from it. And it's about turning failure into success that really makes a big difference. And this Norman Borlaug was somebody who just kept going, worked very hard, was committed to the cause. And saved, it's estimated, a billion lives as a consequence. And this graph is taken from Rothamstead Institute where I work. We have the longest running field experiments in the world going back to 1843 where wheat has been grown continuously year on year since 1843. Given different treatments. And you can see at the bottom this is wheat grown without any fertiliser. And you get about one tonne per hectare. Which is actually what the yields that are currently achieved in many parts of the developing world at the moment. Fertiliser obviously gives a yield improvement. But this increase here was a consequence of the green revolution. Norman Borlaug introducing short-stemmed wheat. And also disease-resistant wheat. So this has been tremendously important. So in addition to things like rotations and use of different chemicals. And we're now up to about 10 tonnes per hectare in a good year. So that's tenfold higher than without any human intervention down here. The thing to note though about this graph is that we've got this levelling off. As I mentioned wheat yields are not increasing now at the rate that they need to be to avoid food shortages. And so what Norman Borlaug was able to do was to select wheat varieties that had shorter straw. So in the natural environment plants will want to grow tall to outgrow their neighbours. So it's a strategy for survival. But it's at some cost to seed yield. So the plants with taller stems will be compromised in their seed yield. But at least they will have outcompeted their neighbour and survived. Whereas these ones down here will be partitioning much more biomass into the grain. And this shows you it's not just that people were shorter in the Middle Ages. The wheat actually was a lot taller than it is now. And this is a picture taken at Rothamsted in the 19th century showing again how tall the wheat used to be. So it's quite a simple trait actually. Simply reducing stem height. And Borlaug didn't know the mechanism behind this. But we now know that it's interfering with gibberellin signalling. So this controls stem elongation. And another trait that Borlaug was able to modify was resistance to rusts. So rust can have a big impact on crop yields. And he was able to introduce some of these genes to prevent yield losses that way as well. So in terms of increasing stress resilience as well as your potential. We need to be thinking about drought. Which as I've said is the most widespread stress even in the UK. And this I've put this slide in to show you that actually the most productive years are the fat ones. The fat rings here represent the wet summers. So and this season hasn't been particularly kind of dry. But we did have a very dry April. And we may not think of that as a drought. But there may have been an impact on wheat yields. We'll have to wait and see. But even kind of a subtle drought. We're not thinking of devastating droughts like we had back in 1976. But even small amounts of drought like that can actually have an impact on crop yields. That we had back in April. So we went for the whole month practically without any rainfall. And other parts of the world suffer drought more than we do. So the United States had a particularly bad drought in 2012. Which affected their maize crop. So what we need to be doing then is combining. Raising the yield. Raising the ceiling on yield potential. And combining this with stress resistance. So is it possible to do this? Another problem is that as I've said conventional breeding is incremental. We need to be speeding it up if we can. GM does not have wide acceptance. And as I'll give you an example where targeting one pathway with one gene. Is giving an increase in yield. And then we need to be thinking about alternative strategies. And we need continuing research into fundamental science. So that we know actually how plants work. And what limits yield in the agricultural environment. So we need to be combining high yield potential. And protecting this potential from these stresses. Well if you think about it. Plants that grow in dry environments. Are quite different to those that grow in productive environments. And so it's difficult to take all of the traits from this environment. And put them into wheat. To combine resilience to drought with productivity. We want wheat to be productive. We want it to be resilient. But we also want it to be productive. It's no good if we have wheat plants that survive drought. But don't yield very much. If they just sit there and survive. There may be some mechanisms that we can think of. That we can take from desert plants. Perhaps some of their heat stress mechanisms. That protect cells from extreme heat above 35 degrees. But by and large. We need to be thinking a bit more creatively. About rather than simply going. Taking genes from this environment into this environment. And what we've been thinking about. And focusing on. For nearly 20 years now. Is what is termed source and sink processes. And sugar metabolism. And how source is linked to sink. Through sugar metabolism. So sucrose is produced in photosynthesis. We need to ensure that as much of that sucrose as possible. Ends up in the yield part of the plant. And by doing this. By ensuring that as much sucrose ends up here. We can actually increase yield potential. And we can also protect that yield from drought. We found. So we can kill two birds with one stone. By targeting one process. And as I've mentioned. The regulation of photosynthesis. Is quite complicated. It's a whole plant process. You can't look at photosynthesis in isolation. From the rest of the plant. Because we know that. What goes on in the sink. Actually regulates the source. And we know. From the results that we're getting. That this process. This integration of source and sink. Is not yet optimised. For yield and resilience in crops. And it's actually a way. To improve photosynthetic efficiency as well. So we can actually increase photosynthetic rate. By improving sink strength. So photosynthesis is an extremely important process. Driving the planet. It's estimated that about 30 tonnes. Of starch and cell wall carbohydrates. Are produced. Per person per year. So that's an amazing amount. Of biomass. Mass. So if we go outside and look around. We can see structures like the trees. Cellulose is lots of glucoses linked together. In a slightly different configuration. To starch. So these alpha and beta configurations. Glucoses linked together. Can form these tremendous structures. That make up. The vegetative environment. And sucrose. And sucrose. Is particularly important. Because it's the end point of photosynthesis. But it's a starting point for growth. And yield determining processes. So it forms. Its breakdown. Then forms a starting point. For starch synthesis. And cell wall synthesis. And the carbon seletons. For protein. Oils. Of course. Provides ATP. And carbon seletons. For secondary metabolites. And so we really need to understand. What regulates. The use of sucrose. There has been attention in the past. On glucose. As a signaling molecule. But glucose is not produced. Directly in photosynthesis. It's a breakdown product. And it doesn't tell you. Sucrose is ideally. In place. Because it gives you information. About the rate of photosynthesis. And it also then. Is a starting point. For end product synthesis. And growth. And development. And all these important processes. And you can say. That all the variation. That we see. Is determined by. How plants use their sucrose. So it's really important. That we understand. The regulation of sucrose use. And so we're focusing on. The regulation of sucrose use. That we're finding. Regulates both. It's utilisation. And allocation. In the plant. And so far. Modification of this pathway. In three major crops. Three cereals. Is improving yield. Including yield potential. And drought resilience. And by three different strategies. And so. The sugar and sickling pathway. That regulates sucrose use. Is the trailers pathway. Which is very similar actually. To the sucrose pathway. Although you'll notice. That the distribution of genes. Along the pathway. Is quite different to sucrose. We have. Eleven TPS genes. Ten. TPP genes. And only one. Trahalase gene. Whereas we have all. These. Genes involved. Invertases. And sucrose synthases. Involved in the breakdown. Of sucrose. And that tells you something. That actually. The regulation of. Trahalase six phosphate. Control of its levels. Is particularly important. Now going back. Twenty years or so. It was thought that. Trahalose. Was only important. In some. Marginal resurrection species. In accumulating. To high levels. To enable them. To survive. Almost complete desiccation. And then enabling them. To almost completely resurrect. Or completely resurrect. When resupplied water. So it was thought. That it was marginal interest. Curiosity interest really. And. Here. I'm just showing. The major. Circulatory sugars. Obviously glucose. In mammals. Sucrose. In plants. Trahalose accumulates. In high levels. In a number of organisms. The only organisms. That can't make. Trahalose. Are vertebrates. Trahalose. And. Resurrection plants. Do accumulate. Trahalose. To high levels. But in the vast majority. Of plants. Trahalose. Accumulates. In much lower levels. So it's a low flux pathway. In compared. In comparison. To sucrose. And. Trahalose. Phosphate. Is the key. Regulatory metabolite. And. What T6P does. Is it. It tracks sucrose. So sucrose. Induces. Trahalose. Phosphate. And it's a. Much lower levels. At least a thousand fold lower. We don't know the exact. Molecular details. Of how it induces it. But it involves. TPS genes. And TPP genes. But we do find. That there is this very good. Interrelationship. Between sucrose levels. And T6P levels. In different plants. And crops. In aerobidopsis. And in wheat and maize. You get this. Very good interrelationship. So. And what T6P does. Is. It actually. Then regulates. The gene expression. For. Transporter sucrose. And. For the utilisation. Of sucrose. In end products. So it regulates. The gene expression. For all these. Different processes. And we found. We discovered this. At Rothamsted. That. It does it. By inhibiting. A protein kinase. Called. Which is called. SNRK1. Now. Protein kinase. Is involved. In phosphorylation. Cascades. Are particularly important. In communication. In plants. And animals. Are involved. In regulation. Of cancer. And SNRK1. Is a. Is a stress protein kinase. That actually. Protects. Cells. From. A carbon. And energy. Deficit. So it senses. Starvation conditions. It's activated. By AMP. And it's inhibited. By trihalo 6. Phosphate. That we found. So T6P. Switches off. This stress function. And activates. The biosynthetic. Pathway function. So it's telling the plant. There's lots of sucrose available. You need to grow now. And develop. And make end products. And what you find. Is when you look at gene expression. In response to T6P. You get. The green light. For. Biosynthetic processes. Growth and development. Things like starch. Synthesis. Whereas. Survival genes. Are then switched off. So genes involved. In stress. And surviving. Conserving ATP. Conserving carbon. Are switched off. By this. So when there. And so you have. Feast and famine conditions. When sucrose is available. You have high T6P. Inhibition of the protein kinase. When sucrose is in. Short supply. There's much less T6P. Protein kinase is active. And you find that. Genes for the mobilization. Reserves. Such as starch. Are activated. Sucrose transport. Is activated. As well. And so there are different processes. That we can. Modify. By targeting. Trahalo 6. Phosphate. So we found that. We can actually. Alter the movement. Of sucrose. To the grain. By targeting. T6P. Once the sucrose. Then gets the grain. Then we can improve. The conversion into starch. By targeting T6P. We found that recovery. From stress. Can be influenced. By targeting T6P. And another lab. Which I present briefly. Has shown that. T6P. Can actually enable. Anaerobic germination. For rice. For the rice crop. That's sown. Under flooded conditions. And this is quite important. So there were. The three examples. Of. In. Nature journals. That have been published. In the past two or three years. That are showing. Yield improvements. By targeting. T6P. In different ways. Through GM. Through a natural variant. And through a chemical approach. So I'll mention briefly. Work. That showed that. A trailer's phosphate. Phosphatase. Underpinned genetic variation. For germination. Of rice. Under flooded conditions. Now this is quite important. Because. Currently. Or before this discovery. Rice was transplanted. In flooded fields. So this. This is quite. This is drudgery. Of. Of having to do this. So there's a big labour saving. Of being able to sow rice directly. And also. The. Having to transplant. Rice plants. Hits the yield as well. So there's some yield check. As a consequence. Of transplanting rice. So the rice plants. Are high yielding. And. What this. Trailer's phosphate. Phosphatase was doing. Was. Decreasing trailer six phosphate levels. Which was sending out. A stronger starvation signal. During germination. Enabling much better mobilization. Of starch. Which then. Meant that the. The rice. The rice plants germinated better. Under flooded conditions. So now I'll present two. Examples from our lab. Where. We've modified T6P. Through GM. And through. A chemical method. And we've been able to. Increase both grain numbers. And grain size. With this approach. So I've talked. I've said how important drought is. So. But it's particularly important. During the flowering period. So. What can happen during this period. Is that if plants. Are short of water. During the flowering period. They will abort. Their grain. And. This is a survival strategy. To ensure that at least. Some grain survive. The plant has got no way of knowing. If the drought is going to be. Short or long term. So it adopts a safety strategy first. Which often means. That it aborts more seed. Than it needed to have done. So. A GM strategy. Targeting T6P. To prevent this from happening. During drought. Has been successful. And. I'm going to. Tell you about that. So this is a GM approach. Targeting again. The trailers. Phosphate phosphatase. With a particular promoter. That's active during. Reproductive development. In. This is a cross section. Of a maze cob. And the blue staining. Shows you where the gene is expressed. The transgene is expressed. So the transgene is expressed. In the vascular tissue. In the phloem we found. So it's pulling down. T6P. In the phloem. Sending out the starvation signal. And what this appears to do. Is to then. Draw more sucrose. Into the. Developing. Female reproductive tissue. Preventing this grain abortion. During drought at flowering. And so we did this work. In collaboration with Syngenta. Over a number of years. Going back more than 10 years. And. The. These crops have been. Field tested. So it's really important that. A promising trait like this. Is field tested. Because often there are. You can get very interesting. Or exciting results in the lab. That when you transfer them to the field. They don't work. And that's because. The field environment is so different. To the lab environment. There's so much variability. And things you can't factor in. In a glass house. Or in a growth chamber. So much variability. Variability from season to season. And. To really thoroughly test a trait. That is high yielding. You need to do field testing. And the best way to do that. Is with a company like Syngenta. Who got these. Facilities to do it. In different parts of the world. They did field testing. In North and South America. They can. You can replicate. Plots in different. Different ways. So you can do it. Completely randomised. Or you can. You can. Grow your control plants. Next to your transgenic. So that. Because the field can be. Can vary from one end to the other. In terms of the slope. And maybe water availability. And so on. It's often better. To grow your control plant. Next to your. Directly next to your transgenic. To factor for that. And so. They field test. These transgenics. Expressing this transgene. Driven by the mad six promoter. That was expressed during the flowering period. And they found a consistent improvement in yield. So this. This is a summary graph. Showing the percentage yield improvement. Of the transgenic. Against non-transgenic. So plants that have not been improved in this way. And what we've got. Plotted across the bottom. Is the yield. So up to ten tons per hectare. And at different levels of drought. So as the yield drops. The drought is getting worse and worse. And the percentage benefit. Gets much stronger. As the drought gets worse. So even without drought. Right up here. There is a ten percent. Yield benefit. And so these are. Field trials done in California. Colorado. Chile. Different parts of the United States. And there was a consistent yield benefit. At least ten percent. Without drought. And then a stronger percentage increase. With drought. So it's been impossible then. To improve both. Yield potential. And drought resilience. By transforming a TPP gene. With this particular promoter. Although I should say. That Syngenta have tested. Maybe a hundred different. Promoter gene constructs. And this was the only one. That produced. This yield benefit. So with such a powerful sugar signal like this. It's important to target it carefully. With the right promoter. In the right cells. It appears that getting it. In the vasculature. Pulling down T6P. Has produced. This positive effect. And so. What we've been looking at as well. Is to try and work out. Exactly how this has been achieved. We know that T6P. Has been pulled down in the vasculature. So we've been doing dissections. Of the reproductive tissue. To look at gene expression. And metabolite profiles. In the different tissues. That make up the reproductive tissue. And we've found that. The biggest changes in gene expression. I won't go into all. All the different changes that we've found. Were found in the pith tissue. And also in the florets. And this makes them. This makes them. Set more grain. And it's made them. Higher yielding under. With and without drought. So. Just presenting it in a different way. We're shifting. By expressing this transgene. In the vasculature. Pulling down T6P. We're shifting. Sugars. Sucrose. Amino acids. From the pith. Into the developing kernels. So this is one of few examples. Where GM of plant metabolism. Or of yield. Has actually improved yield. In field conditions. And after extensive field tests. Many examples that work in the lab. But often fail. When they're tried. Or simply they haven't been tested in the field. And that needs to happen. So. You can see actually. That this represents a lot of work. You have to do lots of field trialing. You have to develop these different. Promoter gene constructs. And you need to be collaborating. Really with a big company. To be able to do this properly. So I also had the thought. Some years ago. Well why don't we just. Try and spray T6P on. Why go to all this bother. And why not just do it chemically. Now I've talked to you. In the. In the. The rice that can germinate. Under flooded conditions. And in the. Transgenic maze. That I've talked to you about. It's about. Decreasing T6P. To enhance. Sucrose transport. As a survival mechanism. But there may be benefits too. Of increasing T6P. So. For example. To actually increase. By starch by synthesis. And having something. That you could just spray onto a crop. Would be. Possibly. A way to do that. So we. Were fortunate enough. To collaborate. With Ben Davis. A chemist at Oxford University. The problem with T6P. Is you can't just spray it on. In its. Natural form. Because it's not taken up. Doesn't cross. Plant membranes. So Ben Davis. Devised a strategy. A chemical strategy. To attach groups. To enable the uptake. Of this sugar. So you can then spray it on. And then. He also devised a strategy. Where. These groups. Are then UV cleavable. So they're cleaved away. In UV light. So you can actually. Spray the compound on. It's taken up. And then the T6P. Is released in UV light. And we've tried out. Several compounds. But the ones we've. Focused on. That seem to be more. Successful are. These two. They have slightly. Different uptake rates. Slightly different. Release rates. But they both seem to be. Very effective. In improving. T6P contents. And what we find. Is then you can. Apply this. Either you do it. Outside in sunlight. Or you can. Do it under. A UV lamp. We did a lot. Of the initial testing. In Arabidopsis. Grown in culture. Systems like this. And you can get this. Really big increase. In T6P. Much bigger than you would get. With a genetic. Modification. So. And the plant can't do much about it. Whereas with a genetic modification. The plant's got all these. Endogenous regulatory mechanisms. That can often dampen. The genetic modification. But with a chemical effect. With a chemical treatment. You can just hit them with this. And. We're getting up to. Even more than a hundredfold change. Now this may seem. Perhaps unphysiological. Or a bit extreme. But. Maybe we've really got to shift. Physiological boundaries. Actually to get big changes. In crop yields. And we can do it. With T6P chemicals. And. This graph just shows. The tracking of the. Radio label T6P. So you get this big pulse of T6P. Within an hour or so. And then it comes back down. As the plant metabolizes it. With its. With its endogenous enzymes. So T6P. Is released. It's metabolized. Metabolized to halos. And then to glucose. And we've tried this out. In aerobidopsis. Culture systems. And we wanted to see. If this could be a way. Of increasing starch content. So we did it first. In aerobidopsis. And we found that. There was an increase. In starch content. We could explain it. Through one of the key enzymes. Of starch synthesis. So AGPAs. And both the rate. Of starch synthesis. And the accumulation. Was increased. Obviously then we need to. Then needed to transfer it. To crops. And Cara Griffiths. Did these experiments. She's in the audience. One of the tutors. And so we found. In wheat. That spraying. During the grain filling period. When starch synthesis. Is starting to occur. That you get this big increase. In T6P. And. Harvesting the grain. A month later. Gives you. Up to a 20% yield increase. In terms of grain yield per plant. And the grains have more starch. In their grains. So this was. A really. Pleasing result. And we also noticed. That if you just target. The chemical to the ear. That. A day or so later. That the rate of photosynthesis. In the flag leaf. Is higher than in the control plant. And this carries on actually. For quite a while as well. So again. The sink is affecting the source. And we also wanted to ask. The question. For the yield effect. That we saw. This 20% yield increase. What kind of. So we're just. Getting this effect. By spraying ears. Increasing their starch content. What kind of. Rate of. Increase in photosynthesis. Would be required. To give that kind of yield increase. Simply by increasing. The amount of light. And we found that by. So they're grown at 500. Micromoles per meter squared per second. By increasing to 750. Gave. Well. Maybe a bit less. Than we were achieving. Just by spraying on the cursor. So. The T6P precursors. So it's equivalent. To giving them a 50% increase. In light availability. That yield effect that we saw. So I've talked about that yield effect. I now want to talk about. Just coming to the end of the talk. In the last five minutes or so. This growth recovery effect. That we'd previously seen. In growing seedlings. In cold conditions. So. If you grow seedlings. In the cold. Or any plant in the cold. Then if you transfer it back to the warm. There's usually a growth spurt. So. And. We hypothesize maybe. That T6P. Was. Could be involved in. This growth spurt. After transfer from. From. Cold to warm conditions. And so this is the kind of. Growth stimulation. That you get. When you transfer. From cold to warm. In genetically modified. Arabidopsis. With much. Less T6P. Then you. You don't see this. This growth stimulation. When you. Transfer from. Cold to warm. And this is work. That was done by Katia. Nunes. Who actually. Who's from Portugal. But she spent two years. Of her PhD. At Rothamsted. And one of the joys. Of doing science. Is the. Big international connections. That you make. Science really is. An international language. Some of the things. That I've found. Particularly. I've particularly liked. About science. And so. The hypothesis. Was that. T6P. Primes. Gene expression. For rapid growth. From stress. In this case. It was cold stress. Now. Would the same thing. Happen in the recovery. From drought stress. So. Cara did the experiment. So. These are wheat plants. That were droughted. For nine days. They were then applied. With this chemical. And then re-watered. And she found. That there was a. There was indeed. A growth stimulation. In response. To spraying. With the chemical. So. T6P. Appears to be. Priming gene expression. In anticipation. Of. Growing again. So whether. From. Low temperature. Or from drought. And so. The combination. Of the yield effect. And the. Resilience effect. We were able to get this paper. Into nature. It's effectively. Ten years work. And. We had a. A year's worth of revisions. From one of the reviewers. And. Yeah. We had 19 pages. Of reviewers. Comments from one of the reviewers. I won't tell you. Some of the things he said. About the work. But anyway. We got it published. This is one of the challenges. You just have to keep going. In science. And the rewards. Are very great. When you do. Cara won. This award. For her work. And we received all this. This coverage. In the press. So I'm not sure. That we maybe have. Solved food insecurity. But. We think it's. We're now at the stage. Where we want to. Collaborate with. A big company. To actually use this. As a treatment. But we also think. It's a way of actually. Understanding more about. Fundamental science. Maybe discovering. Genes for yield as well. So we can use these chemicals. Which provide us. With a way of actually. Tracking changes in T6P. Following. The treatment with it. So the advantages. Of this method. Are that. There are. There is one method. For different crops. So it gives you. That flexibility. You don't need to be. Developing different. Gene promoter constructs. Flexibility of application. We've got. Potential for. Dramatic effects on yield. Through giving. A big pulse of T6P. Shifting physiological. Boundaries. Maybe it's a faster. Roots of market. It's non-GMO. Publicly acceptable. And then it can be. Stacked with other. With other. Chemical applications. Fungicides. And so. In the last couple of minutes. So that. Just to summarize. Where we are with this research. So. 20 years ago. This was the understanding. Of the trailer's pathway. Functioning. In resurrection plants. And the first transgenics. Were made actually. To try and engineer. Plants of stress tolerance. To try and take. Trhalos. And it was found that the. And use it as a stress protectant. But it was found that. Transgenics. That. Were produced. Didn't accumulate. Trhalos. But. It was subsequently found. That they did have. Differential levels of T6P. And it appeared that. From looking at the plants. That these were quite robust. Healthy plants. A number of transgenic plants. Have been modified. From metabolism. Were particularly sick looking. Or didn't have any phenotype at all. But these were quite different. These. It was as if. The trailer's pathway. Was engaging in some way. With. A regulatory system. And so. You know. It's taken us 20 years. To work out some of the details. Of this. So these transgenic plants. Were produced in the late 90s. Telling us that something interesting. Was going on with this pathway. And then a few years later. Well in 2011. Around the publication. Of the genome sequence. It was then established. That there were all these genes. For the pathway in plants. That hadn't really. Been understood before. An embryo lethal mutant. Was then published. That showed that. The TPS1 gene. Was absolutely essential. For implants. For the first time. It was shown that. T6P was indispensable. For carbohydrate use. Then it was confirmed. That T6P was. Acting as a sucrose signal. We showed at Rothamsted. That protein kinase. Can explain. We think. A lot of the effects. Of T6P in plants. By regulating. Metabolic pathways. As a feast. Feast famine signal. Performing. Metabolic reprogramming. In effect. In response to feast or famine. And then it was shown. So it's not just. Something that's occurring. In Arabidopsis. Which it was shown. That T6P is important. In wheat. Mentioned that. T6P. Priming role. In response to low temperature. The rice work. Was published. Recently. And then there have been. These examples. That I've told you about. In crops. So potentially. This system then. Not just these. These traits of. Grain number. Grain size. And product synthesis. But also. Appears to be an effect. On flowering. So sucrose. Through T6P. Tells a plant. Or T6P. Tells a plant. There's sucrose available. That it's okay to flower. That you've got enough carbon. To do that. So it's one of those. It's part of the. The regulation of flowering. It's also we think. Involved in biotic interactions. Interestingly. Other organisms. Produce trihalos. Fungi particularly. Produce large amounts. Of trihalos. And there could be. This kind of. Warfare between. The fungus and the plant. In. The fungus tries to take over. The host's. Signaling. Machinery. To actually. Hydract sugars. To improve crop yields. So. I've told you then. How the. Sourcing system. Is particularly. Important in crops. That. To improve crop yields. And resilience. We need to be modifying it. We need to be understanding. Fundamental processes. Of. Cycrose utilization. and signalling. Through modifying this we've been able to improve yields in three major crops. Three approaches so far we've been able to do this and I think a strategy to combine with this low T6P in the phloem would be to combine this with high T6P in the endosperm. So and this is something that we like to do. We like to, so by decreasing T6P in the phloem and increasing it in the, we might get an increased grain number and increased grain size in the same plant. That would be an interesting experiment to try. And then just recently natural variation in a TPP gene has been found to associate with grain weight in wheat by this Chinese group. And so I'd like to acknowledge people that have been involved in the work. Cara's in the audience, she did the wheat experiments. We've had an excellent collaboration with Ben Davis and we wouldn't have been able to do the chemical work without that. We wouldn't have been able to do those, that GM work in maize without Syngenta. And then we've had BBSRC funding. We're currently collaborating with CIMIT in Mexico. That's been a really great collaboration. I haven't mentioned that at all today. And yeah, I do feel mentally fortunate to have been involved in this work. And please do keep in touch and visit if you want. We've got great facilities for doing research on crops. I mentioned about the long-term experiments that go back to 1843, but we've also got very modern facilities as well. So we can do loads of techniques, modern biology, biochemistry, molecular biology, as well as growing really healthy maize plants in our growth facilities. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
