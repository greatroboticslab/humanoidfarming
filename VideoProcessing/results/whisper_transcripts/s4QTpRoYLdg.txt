 There's peanut dust and corn husk drifting through the air tonight The marching bands warming up under the football ice There's tractor trailers backed up down by the elevators Train, track, grain, car, roll in later Get filled up and head on out in the world It's harvest time in this little town Time to bring it all in, pay the loans down Fill our diesel tank up and make another round There's a big red moon coming up in the sky Combines cutting in a staggered line The only time of year we miss the church bells chime It's harvest time There's a thermos and a water jug rolling around in the cab A set of socket wrenches wrapped up in a breezy red rack Bobby's mother pulls in the field bringing us supper We grab a bite and make sure to hug her Saddle back up and let the big wheels roll It's harvest time in this little town Time to bring it all in, pay the loans down Fill the diesel tank up and make another round There's a big red moon coming up in the sky Combines cutting in a staggered line The only time of year we miss the church bells chime It's harvest time At a quarter till two I kick off my boots in the laundry room We'll start it all over tomorrow at noon Until it's all done Until we're all done It's harvest time in this little town Time to bring it on in, pay the loans down Fill the diesel tank up and make another round There's a big red moon coming up in the sky Combines cutting in a staggered line The only time of year we miss the church bells chime It's harvest time It's harvest time It's harvest time It's harvest time
