 Trevor we've come to a farm here in County Doan it's not untypical of some of the systems in Northern Ireland compared to the south where it's an indoor system and it's on a three times a day milking could you describe maybe who the farm and who owns it yeah we're in Robert McCauley's farm in Ruther Island County Doan Robert runs a six or sorry a 580 cow herd high intensity herd they're kept in pretty much all year round producing averaging around 12,000 litres per annum this was why we've come here I suppose we wouldn't be used to a system here of a slurry separation system I've seen him in the UK and that but maybe for our viewers down south you know why is this system here and why why is Robert using that Robert's been running the system here for nearly four years it's a it's an eco better system it presses the cows slurry the fiber out of it to dry matter of between 38 and 40 percent he's currently running at 12 hours every day for this farm here how much is say quantity wise how much is he producing here and is it enough to supply his bedding needs he's producing somewhere in the region of nine cubic meters per day and that's that's enough to supply all the cubicles why why is bedding important for a system like this why not use sawdust or whatever lime or why use this method yeah Robert had been using previously sawdust he was having some issues with my status and he decided to switch over to the green bedding system and over this past four years he he's been totally delighted with the system you know is constantly as very low levels of status so on this farm here the cows are in full time are they they don't go outside Kaiser I used yeah pretty much all year round okay so the slurry then is all coming to one point on the shed here next door to this system here is it yeah so the the slurry the shed is made up of part slotted tanks and solid passages so it all feeds into the one tank there's an electric pump operates alongside the separator so once that starts the separator starts and goes through the motions runs for to say around 12 hours which is off and that's that's running every night okay so what are we seeing here on top of the container Trevor what what is the process yeah well the process is at the top section here it feeds in the the raw slurry it comes down into a screw or an auger which turns very slowly as you can see there that forces it across it's got resistance on the end you'll see the the weights hanging on it there so that keeps a constant load on it or back pressure and the around the inside of it is a stainless steel gauze and the liquid is squeezed through that runs runs out at the bottom here across and down and finishes up on his lagoon for storage okay does the story need to be agitated or you know how what does the story need to look like when it's presented to the system well on Robert's system here it's pretty much fresh slurry all the time so he hasn't he hasn't had to use any any mixing the the pump that he has on the air has a mixing system on it but they seldom uses it okay maintenance wise something like that is dealing with slurry it's dealing with particles or whatever what what what maintenance requirements typically would a system like that need well he has he's he needs to change the gauze in it approximately every two years there there is a cost in that of course somewhere in the region of four thousand pound to change that and that's the that's the only that's the main part on the system that does need replacing the electric motor is a 5.5 kilowatt I'm outside of that that's really the only maintenance that he has done other than every month or thereabouts fortnight to a month he would have to take the gauze I run a power washer through it and back in and not that that's quite simple to do that could be in a night within 20 minutes so we may walk down so we'll have a look at the material as as it's presented so Trevor we're looking at the the material here what kind of dry matters would have came in at and what is it presented here at then generally a chryslery would be coming in around seven percent seventy eight percent of course I think the parlor washington's come in here as well but once it's pressed it's around about 38 to 40 percent dry matter on this so Trevor people might ask it's dry done with in effect how how is there not a mastitis issue or what's the best management method to to ensure it's we're not creating mastitis issues well Robert's working on a system here of putting on a light dressing every day and that's that's probably key to his success you know we're hearing from him that he might have one case of mastitis every week it's only on for the day it's a light dusting therefore it's not building up any heat as such yeah it stays nice and dry yeah so from here how is he applying the material to the cubicle bits oh I see he's using a system on the front end loader which has got a an auger or a conveyor belt which shoots it shoots it out to the one side I think he does that within probably half an hour something like that every day investment wise roughly what's the capital investment for a system like this roughly well Robert's system here is designed around an old container but generally the you know the complete system with the better and a frame to hold it which can be risen up to whatever height just enough to get a loading silver so then underneath it and you take that all all and they're going somewhere in the region of 40,000 42,000 pounds okay yeah and ideally is where the material dropped is it is ideally covered like this to keep the rain off it or does yeah yeah it would be important to cover it wouldn't be yeah
