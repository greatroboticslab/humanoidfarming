 When I see young people getting into agriculture like Aravakum Singh, the adorable Aravakum Singh going into agriculture, I want to make a lot of noise about it. So when I hear, I told them you need to come to the Making AI Conference, which is here. And we've gone around a bit to see some of the exhibitions that are in the place. We saw farm history and Aravak got to be told about how you can farm in a small space. Most interesting, you can farm in an urban space. You don't have to go outside of a branch of a huge or vast land. You can farm in your house or behind your house, anywhere within the city. So if you think you can't farm in the city, you're wrong.
