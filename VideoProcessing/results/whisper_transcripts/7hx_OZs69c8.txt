 Here are my five backyard gardening essentials. Number one is a nice cart so you can get dirt back and forth through your gate. Number two is pots. I literally stop every time I see a pot laying on the side of the road and add it to my collection. Number three is cattle panels. Cattle panels are perfect for backyard gardening because you can grow a lot of vegetables vertically and save space. Number four, raised beds. Raised beds are perfect for backyard gardens because you don't have to till up all your grass and you can control your substrate by bringing in your own dirt. And last but not least, number five is quick connects. I use quick connects with all my hoses, attachments, sprinklers. That way it's just so much easier and faster to swap out different accessories.
