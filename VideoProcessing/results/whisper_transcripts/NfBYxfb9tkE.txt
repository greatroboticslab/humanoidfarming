The harvest season is here so we’re hard at work processing our homegrown and foraged abundance!

 Here's the current state of our kitchen. This is pretty standard for us this time of year because it's the beginning of the big harvest season and we're pulling stuff in faster than we can put it away. I love going out to the garden this time of year because it's just full of substantial staple crops. It feels like as soon as we finish one crop, the next one is ready to harvest. Gotta keep it real with y'all. Our chickpeas were a total failure this year. They got chewed down by rabbits, so we're gonna be severely lacking hummus this winter. Alternatively, the apples and pears just keep coming. I don't know why Sylvan and I are the only ones foraging these. They're in a public park. Come on, people. You gotta get out here. Anyway, I really feel like this is our best year yet. And I know I say that every year, but it's true because we get better at gardening and foraging every year. So every year is our best year yet. As soon as I finish posting this, I'm gonna work on cooking those apples into apple butter and maybe we'll share that process soon.
