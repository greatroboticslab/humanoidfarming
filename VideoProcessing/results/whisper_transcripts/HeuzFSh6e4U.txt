 If you see this amazing act of this person, you probably won't believe it. This isn't some act of enmity towards destroying another person's crops. Rather, it's a conscious and deliberate act of saving their wheat crops. When wheat seeds are ready to ripen or are fully developed, or the wheat grows to be 85 centimeters tall, then clever farmers try to save their crops from natural disaster by flattening them down onto the ground. So when a big storm rolls through, their wheat is not destroyed. Rather, when the storm clears up, it will slowly stand back up on its own.
