 you hey guys welcome back to my channel I had some video footage I got up this morning to edit and my video footage was corrupted on my GoPro camera and it's all gone I'll tell you what happened was I got into the Jeep after work it was fine on the way to work brake light came on I lost about half of my brake pedal and I was wondering if I was even going to stop the first time and it turned out to be driver's side rear wheel cylinder I'd already replaced the passenger side a little while back and did not replace the driver's side I've always heard if you replace one replace both I did not do that this one failed uh I believe it they say it's from the extra pressure that the other wheel cylinder can put out I don't know that but anyway I lost my video footage didn't get to show that to y'all and I had all the footage I recorded every last second of it but anyway that job is pretty in depth because you got to take the brake shoes off to get the wheel cylinder out if you got your disc brakes on the back you don't have to do that you got calipers but with this model with the uh the brake shoes the brake drums all that's got to come out and there's springs everywhere and if you're not kind of mechanically inclined I am and it's still a big job because I had to kind of figure it out every time because I don't do it every day uh but anyway that's the job you might want to take to your mechanic and let them do it because it's it's kind of in depth you'd hate to have this thing tore down at your house and then not be able to get it back together but anyway uh didn't get that but I did have something I wanted to ask y'all today and it is a beautiful sunny Saturday morning 54 degrees I got my old navy pullover back on and I'm loving this weather last year if you remember in one of my videos I mentioned that it was uh over 90 degrees the first three days of October I hope this weather from September through the rest of fall kind of holds true I don't expect it to I'm going to enjoy it while it's here but anyway back to my question I wanted to ask y'all all right guys so I have created a Facebook group called force built autos it's just for this YouTube channel for my subscribers and viewers to go post pics of their rides it does not have to be a jeep wrangler it can be anything you're proud of I just would like to see what you're passionate about and uh you've seen my passion on JJ I've been working on him and making him better and better I'd like to see some of your rides and some of your ideas and some of your plans possibly for the future just leave all that in the description of your picture and if you would just go join that group I'm going to leave a link in the description and uh if you don't want to uh that's fine this is no monetary benefit to me at all this is I just really am curious about my subscribers I thank y'all a lot for your participation in the comment section I thank y'all for coming week after week to watch my videos and uh anyway if you would just go join that group uh take your favorite pic of your vehicle post it on that group and uh leave a description about some mods you've done what kind of engine it has just all sorts of information that will be interesting to me and other viewers that will be coming and posting their pics so anyway that was what I was wanting to ask y'all to do if you would like to do that if you don't it's perfectly fine uh I don't expect a ton of uh people to join that group but uh anyway I just think it would help us have a uh little bit closer relationship so anyway to the rest of the video now just head down to the store and get me some coffee my brother has called and asked for some help they got some semi trailers they're going to take the axles and things out from under they're going to set them on the ground on some blocks and make some storage sheds out of them so let's go see what they got going on and see how I can help them out So yeah Cерь dire maybe in the middle of the mince We Type 1 At least two yearls 축es! Watch your nod, man! It's driving around, it's driving around, it's not big enough to dig it up. I said it's better to clean the right side. Let's leave it to real. Alright, we're... There you go. There you go. There you go. Yes. Whoa. There you go, you're the wrong way. That was impressive, man. Let me turn it off. Really? So if y'all wondering, we're removing these axles out front of this semi-trailer. We're going to make storage out of it. It's not mine, it's my brother's and my dad's. So we've got to do one more trailer over there. And we've got to take those front dollies out front of each one of them. Big excavator. Could've down some strength. Can't wait until the complained. Can't wait until halfway your dad is off. Can't wait until the ship's in here. Hey,lord *** ist e 你就华的士 surge. Their load coisas利用了. They're quiet until the past... The States will fly to the studs. The 요새,就是每乎公司100区33就ix碗 real slow. And then the safety net is graduating.alla Sometimes it's a bit schwierig jamais. We'reங两喝就是, all night gigsby fedsadłu. Come on. We down. That's a heck of a store shed. Perfect. Well guys, that's going to wrap up this video. That tractor ride was pretty exciting. It got intense at one point in time. I kind of got a little bit concerned actually, but he handled it well and got those axles put up under that trailer. Sorry about losing the footage on the Jeep this week. GoPro just got some corrupted video footage, video files. Anyway, the little red light was flashing on it showing me that it was recording and it actually wasn't recording anything. Anyway, it was kind of disheartening to realize that all my footage had been lost. But anyway, I've got some parts in the mail. So if they'll make it any time for the video coming this Thursday, I will try and just keep some footage going until I can find another project to work on. I haven't found one yet. I'm trying to be a little bit more choice about what I buy this next time than I was when I purchased JJ because I did not realize how much work he had to have done on him when I bought him. But anyway, y'all remember, don't forget if you will, go join the Facebook group that I created, Forest Built Autos. And join there and post me some pics of your rides on a sale. Even if you got some pics of them wheeling, I'd like to say that too. Don't have to be a Jeep. Be anything you drive that you enjoy. So anyway, I'll see y'all the next time.
