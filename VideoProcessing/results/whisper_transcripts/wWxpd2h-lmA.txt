 What's going on Big Bear Nation and hey welcome back to the channel. Well today we are super excited to bring this product review to you because we feel that whether you have livestock or not this product is going to change the way that you homestead from now and forever. But first if this is your first time here go ahead and smash that subscribe button and don't forget the bell we would really appreciate it. Okay so today we want to introduce you to the Gallagher Smart Fence System. Now we got this system about four months ago and when we opened up the box I'll admit I was a little skeptical but once I started flipping through the book and then we put it into use oh boy did we fall in love with this system and we fell in love hard and fast. Now the system has 10 poles, 362 feet of wire which is broken down into four reels on the main pole. You will need a grounding rod and a charger. Now here on the homestead we're using the S100 and that's because most of the time we have freckles in with the girls. Now the system is pretty much straight out of the box it's pretty much good to go. All you really have to do is connect the cranking handle. The system is extremely lightweight in fact Ladesa can carry it most of the time and she totes it with one hand. All right so let's talk about setting up your your paddock with your Gallagher Smart Fencing. It's very easy to do. It should take you about five minutes to get this whole system set up. First thing you do is unlock your reels, get your first pole out, step it in the ground and start walking. As you're walking Gallagher recommends about every 30 feet to place a pole. So depending on your height that's anywhere from 10 to 20 steps. Make your paddock, bring it back to your first pole, lock down the reels and then go secure your corners. Now Gallagher added a very nice nylon rope with a locking system on it that you can adjust the tension on your pole. So that way you can pull your corner poles nice and tight. That way it tightens up all four strands of wire and then whatever's left you can reel up at the end to keep your fence nice and tight. All right so once you got your paddock made and all your corners secure it's time to set up your charger. Now the Gallagher chargers are super easy to set up. On their clips they have a nice brass like half u that slides right onto the right onto the stud and then you just secure them down and then you just clip it onto the fence and then clip it on to the grounding rod. Now the one feature that I do like the most about the Smart Fence system is how they have this metal, I'm just going to call it a metal stud, where all four of your fencing wires connect to this metal stud. They wrap around the things and then it's uh they wrap around the screws and then it has a washer that goes down and connects both of them. But you just clip your hot your red onto and then your system is good to go and you turn on your charger and you're good to go. Now when it comes time for tear down or you want to move the fence tear down is just as easy as it is to set up. First thing you do is turn off your fence, pull off your charger, take your clip off your charger, and then you uh take your corners, unsecure your corners, secure basically you pull your thing out of the ground, stretch it back, secure it to the pole that you got it on and then you just reel it up. You come back to your base, you pick it up and you reel it up to each pole and then put the pole back where it belongs and keep on going. You're done and you walk away. All right, so this Gallagher smart fence system is definitely a force multiplier for your homestead. And that's the reason why we're going to make multiple videos about this system. We're going to do one on the setup and the takedown and all the different livestock that you can put behind it and also some of the different uses that we've been able to put this smart fence to use for here on the homestead. So while you're waiting for those other videos to come out, go ahead and check out this video on raising cattle for beginners. Thanks for coming by the Big Bear Homestead.
