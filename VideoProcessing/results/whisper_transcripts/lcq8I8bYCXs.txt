 So you have some seeds, but when are you going to plant them all? Here is how you figure that out. First, figure out your estimated last frost date. A quick web search will help you figure out when that is. Next, get yourself a planting calendar or get a friend that has one. There's a video linked below where I share my planting calendar with you. It's a pretty good calendar if I say so myself and I'm happy to share it. And there's this awesome tool on the Johnny's website that you can use to plug in your last estimated frost date and it'll generate all of the planting and sowing dates that you could possibly need. So what are you waiting for? Get growing!
