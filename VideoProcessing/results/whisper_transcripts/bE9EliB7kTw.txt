Howto & Style
 The next time I grow potatoes, this is what I'll change. This was my first time growing potatoes, and I don't know what I was thinking, but I did very little research and just assumed my Irish heritage would get me through, I guess. I got a pretty good harvest, but potatoes grow best in light, fluffy soil, and the soil I used in these grow bags was way too dense. Plus, I found some grubs eating the plants, so it was clearly contaminated. The moral of the story is when you're growing root crops, soil quality matters even more than it does for above ground plants, so don't waste time on inferior mixes.
