 A lot of times people ask themselves, do I need to use compost in my garden and is it beneficial? This video will answer your questions. Where do you get compost? Compost can be bought readily made in bags or in bulk if necessary. You could also make your own compost. We'll feature a video on how to make your own compost soon. Luckily most people however accept that compost is good to use in the garden. So let's get to the benefits. 1. Waste Reduction Compost uses mostly organic waste to make compost, grass clippings, leaves, kitchen scraps like vegetables and fruits can be used. Newspaper or egg boxes as well as manure can be used. This helps the municipalities to reduce waste in landfills but also makes their work easier as this reduces the workload when collecting waste. 2. Helps Reduce Erosion Compost is like sponge, which soaks up water. In rainstorms or floods, compost protects the top soil by soaking up the water. Compost will help to keep your top soil in place and reduce erosion damage that can be caused by the water runoff. The same counts for high winds. Compost will keep your top soil in place and prevent dust during storms. 3. Less Water Consumption As compost acts like a sponge, there will be better water retention in the soil. Not only will this mean you will need to water less and save on costs, but it will also mean that your plant and its roots will have more moisture for a longer time. You will still need to check the dryness of your garden to ensure it is watered enough. 4. Compost Builds Soil One big advantage of compost is that it builds the quality of your soil. Due to its organic matter, it feeds the microbes in the soil. Compost also has its own microbes that are added to the soil when using compost. These microbes and bacteria help to break down the soil to the advantage of your soil health and plant growth. The more organic matter, the better, so use compost frequently. 5. Attracts Earthworms Soil that is moist and rich in organic matter attracts earthworms. Earthworms are natural aerators of the soil. The moist soil helps them to navigate more easily, and while they move, they break up the soil components, making it nice and fluffy. Plants love the fluffy aerated soil that worms create. 6. Balances pH Level Most plants and veggies and fruits require an average pH of 5-6. This environment will be perfect for your seeds to germinate and your plants to thrive. There are other ways to lower or increase your pH level by adding compost to the soil will generally balance this out. 7. Reduces Commercial Fertilizers Commercial fertilizers are expensive. Once you've built up your soil with compost, there will hardly be any need to use commercial fertilizers. Should you have a nitrogen or phosphorus deficiency in your soil, this can be countered by using dried chicken droppings for nitrogen and cattle manure for phosphorus. 8. Build Sound Root Structure If the soil is healthy and sound, the roots will grow. This is super important for plant health. The soil structure created by compost allows roots to soak up nutrients and water more effectively, as well as grow with less constraint than in dense soils. 9. Compost Contains Humus Most compost, as it's breaking down, has some level of humus in it. Humus is the byproduct of compost when the decaying process is finished. Humus has some nutritional value but nitrogen. An important nutrient to plants is missing. The main benefit of humus is its ability to absorb water. A healthy garden needs this plus compost to provide nutritional diversity. Compost is usually a main ingredient in topsoil. These are just a few pointers on why to use compost.
