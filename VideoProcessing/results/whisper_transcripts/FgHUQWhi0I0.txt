 Welcome to the second lecture in the subject agronomy. This lecture is on the topic of agronomy management. This lecture is part of the agronomy subject, which is taught across two degrees, the Bachelor of Agriculture and Technology and the Bachelor of Equine Studies. Both of these degrees are offered at Melbourne Polytechnic. The Bachelor of Agriculture and Technology is a partnership degree with Melbourne Polytechnic and La Trobe University. Please visit our website at www.melbournepolytechnic.edu.au for further information on this subject and the other subjects that we offer. My name is Dr Nikki Cooley. In this lecture today on agricultural management, we are going to concentrate on understanding the measurements of agronomical plants. This is the first stage in being able to manage. We are going to look at the basics of plant growth. We are then going to study the basics of plant growth measurement. We will finish this lecture by looking at yield in some detail. Yield can be measured in various ways. There is economic yield and biological yield and we will learn about both of these. We will also begin to touch on the inputs of yield and how one might assess it. So let's start by learning about what plant growth is. Well quite simply, it is an irreversible change in size. The growth can be a measurement of either a change in mass or a change in volume. And it can include either the whole plant growing or just a small part of the plant. The important component is that when this growth occurs, it is accompanied by an increase in dry weight. There are many complex physiological processes that underpin plant growth. You will learn about some of these basics today and further on in the subject. You will also cover some of the basics of plant growth in the subject Living Systems 1 and Living Systems 2. Please refer to the plant physiology subject in later years for when you want to learn about more in-depth physiological processes pertaining to plant growth. Here we will just cover the simple components. So let's start from the beginning. In simple terms, plant grows by a seed germinating. This is sometimes called sprouting. Once the seed has sprouted, the first component of the plant to appear is the seedling. We call this the seedling stage. The plant will continue to grow into an adult version and it will take the shape of that adult version. Please note, seedling stages and adult versions of plants can look wildly different. In the subject Living Systems 1, you will cover the different types of cell division. In summary, there are three phases of cell growth. These are cell division, cell enlargement and then finally cell differentiation. The first two stages result in plant growth while the third stage results in cell maturity. It is important to note that cell division alone is not growth. This is because when a new cell divides, it is exactly half the size of the cell from which it was formed. Cell division is realised as the potential for growth. Animal and plant growth are not the same. Animals undergo what we call fixed and uniform growth, while plants undertake indefinite and diffuse growth. Plant growth can be determined by primary and secondary growth types. These are the most common forms of growth in a plant. This is where the meiotic division of meristemic cells occurs. These cells are present either in the shoot or the root apex. This enables an increase in the length of the plant, which can be detected by an increase in dry weight and is called the primary growth. The secondary meristem increases the diameter of the plant body and is called secondary growth. We can also define growth by being limited or unlimited. Unlimited growth is where, just as the phase suggests, there is a process where the root and the shoot system will grow continuously. Growth occurs from germination to the death or throughout the lifespan of the plant. It is called unlimited or it can also be referred to as indeterminate type of growth. While limited growth is where the leaves, the fruits and the flowers stop growing after they reach a predetermined size. This size is usually determined by the genetics of the plant. As well as being called limited, this may also be referred to as determinant type of growth. When plants grow without producing flowers, this is termed as the vegetative period of growth. In this stage of growth, plants will produce flowers, stems and roots. After the vegetative growth period, plants will produce flowers. This is referred to as the reproductive part of the plant. There are many ways to measure plant growth. I am going to introduce some of these methods. The type of measurement you record will depend on what you are trying to determine or understand about the plant growth. For example, if you are growing lettuce, the leaf area is important for growth measurement. As in the commercial enterprise for lettuce, leaf area is the one that determines price. The larger the lettuce on an area basis, the more money you will receive for that product. The weight of the lettuce is not important. The weight usually represents water in lettuce. If, however, you are growing pasture for animal or horse feed, then the amount of energy that the plant is going to return to your animal is more important than its area. This can be represented by some extent, the dry weight of grass. I am going to introduce you to the concept of change in size. I am going to start by using area as an example. I have drawn a figure that demonstrates the concept of plant growth. In this figure you will see two leaves, leaf A and leaf B. Leaf A is described as a somatic drawing. It is 5cm in area. After some time, the leaf has grown. The new leaf is shown as leaf A1. Leaf A1 is now 10cm squared. You can observe the change in area from 5 to 10cm squared. And you can say that the area has doubled. Therefore, it is reasonable to describe this doubling as a 50% increase in size. That is what we mean when we state that we have described the growth mathematically. Now let us look at leaf B. You will notice that it is bigger than A or A1. It is in fact 50cm squared. Over the same period of time, the leaf has grown to 55cm squared, as is shown in the figure. Therefore, leaf B1 has grown by 5cm squared. You will note that this is the same increase in area as A to A1, but it is not a doubling in size. If you had doubled leaf B in size, you would have a total area of 100cm squared. The percent increase of leaf B to B1 is in fact just 9%. You will however notice that the increase in area from B to B1 is 5cm. Again the same as A to A1. What we have been able to do is monitor or record the change in weight. This can be referred to as a relative change in weight. And in fact there is a whole area of plant measurement that is called the relative growth rate. Let's do another example, but rather than using area, we shall use weight to demonstrate the concepts. Here we have the same two leaves. In leaf A it weighs 1g, while in leaf A1 it weighs 2g. Again you can see it has doubled in weight. It is also increased by 1g. In the other example, the weight of leaf B is 50g and then increases to 55g. This time there is a difference in weight increase between leaves A and B, but nevertheless the principles are the same. There are two types of plant weight that you can measure. You can not only measure the fresh weight or the weight that occurs when you remove the leaf from the plant, but you can also measure dry weight. From a consumption perspective and in many industries, the water content is not as important as the measure of energy. The fresh weight is largely made up of water. The dry weight however is largely made up of simple and complex sugar proteins and amino acids and this is the bulk of the plant. If you remove the water by drying in an oven you obtain the dry weight. Therefore, we can equate the dry weight as an indicator of the amount of energy. There is of course different ways of measuring energy and we can talk about this in other subjects. So let us take the understanding of changes of rate or the relative growth rate into more details. And let's actually assign a formula so we can calculate this robustly. The actual plant dry matter increase for both leaf A and B were the same. However, the relative increases was largest in plant A as it has nearly doubled in size. We can calculate a relative increase accurately by applying the following mathematical formula. Relative growth rate is the relative growth rate. We can calculate a relative increase accurately by applying this formula. You can put in the weights that we have used in the previous example and you may calculate the relative growth rate. It is worth practicing calculating this. It was Rod Hunt in 1982 that first published the concepts of relative growth rate. In the next slide I will take you through step by step how to apply relative growth rate calculations. So first of all, using an example, you can identify what T1, T2, W1 and W2 mean. So T stands for time and W stands for weight. In our equation, T was in days. T may be in weeks or months or years. In our equation, weight was in grams. So therefore, T1 equals the time one, say on the 1st of January 2013. Whereas T2 was the time on the 10th of January 2013. Our weights are given in grams. So there is no conversion necessary. But you need to keep an eye out for conversions. Weight 1 is dry weight of the plant in grams 50 grams. And weight 2 is the dry weight in grams at the end of the experiment. So, for reference, I have added a step in check your units and convert if necessary. As I stated before, we did not have to do that for this example. But it is worth when setting up your methodology that you do. Now that you've checked your units, now that you've put your data against the correct component of the formula, you can place the formula together in order to calculate the relative growth rate. LN or LIN stands for log. So the formula is log 50 minus log 55 divided by day 10 minus day 1. So now you can start calculating. I have broken up the formula in very simple steps so that you may follow. Have a go at this yourself. Then ask yourself, did I get it right? If not, what did I do wrong? Remember when you have brackets in a formula, it means that you calculate this component of the formula first. After this lecture has finished, have a go at calculating the relative growth rate for plant A. Then tell me which has the highest relative growth rate, plant A or plant B, and is this what you would expect? Can you explain your findings? In the middle, which you'll remember is the learning management software that we use in this degree, I have designed an Excel sheet for you to calculate relative growth rate. You can place data in this, time and weight into columns, and it will automatically calculate your relative growth rate. You can then compare the relative growth rate that you have calculated with the relative growth rate in the Excel sheet. Are your answers the same? The number of references that you might find useful to try and help you understand relative growth rate better. The Hunter-Till reference from 2002 is very useful and if you are going to spend a lot of time in the careers of agronomical plant science, crop science, applied research, or if you see yourself working for such industries as the Department of Primary Industries, then it would be good to try and get hold of this book, although this is difficult. If this is your career pathway, then if you purchase the book you will be able to use it as a reference throughout your career. If you are struggling with growth rate calculations, you may wish to read the Blackmont reference. The Lambers 2008 reference is a good example of the applications of growth rate. If you require some advanced reading into this topic, and some history of the development of relative growth rate, you can refer to the William Hoffman and Hendrick Potter papers in 2002. This reference is optional. We have covered the basics of measuring plant growth. Let's turn our attention to another very important agricultural measurement, that is, of plant yield. Yield can be characterised by either the economic or the biological yield, and they mean slightly different things. Both are important to the commercial aspects of agronomy. Economic yield is the components of plants that can result in value, while the biological yield is an increase in the total above ground parts. The measurement can include economic yield. The biological yield can also be the total biomass. The fundamentals of yield. If we consider the plant yield initially as biological yield, the first component for us to consider is photosynthesis. You will learn about photosynthesis in Living Systems 1 subject, and in a lot more detail in the second year subject, Plant Physiology. We do touch on it in another lecture here, in this subject too. For the benefits of this subject, we will only consider the very basic aspects of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis can be thought as the powerhouse of the plant. It is the process by which the plant captures energy from the sun, and then converts it into chemical energy. A plant can then use chemical energy to power or drive the growth. Therefore, photosynthesis is the powering of yield. Photosynthesis has two reactions. There is what we call a light requiring action. This is where the power obtaining component of the process occurs. It can capture light energy from the sun. There is then a non-light requiring action. This is where the energy that's being captured by the plant from the sun is converted into chemical energy. To introduce to you two compounds that are very important for plant, and therefore for the fundamentals of yield. The first one is ATP or adenosine triphosphate. And the second one is NADPH or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase. For this level of understanding, you can think of these chemicals as the power in the process of photosynthesis. They are used in a set of complex reactions which enable the building blocks of sugars to be added. The results in the production of simple sugars such as glucose. Glucose is a sugar that is made. It is the first sugar made in photosynthesis. Glucose can be converted into sucrose, which is then used as either the transport sugar or directly in yield. The important take home message from all of this is that increased yield often relies on the efficient process of photosynthesis. The inputs of photosynthesis are light, usually from the sun, but can be from artificial sources. Carbon dioxide gas from the air atmosphere. This cast makes up the building blocks and water. Water is an important compound in photosynthesis. The other important component of yield production is nutrition. For a simple understanding, plant nutrition can be thought of as the food for the plant. We will be learning a lot more about nutrition and its components in a future subject. For now, remember it is the important component of achieving optimal biological yield. In agronomy, particularly, we are often interested in the potential yield. That is, if all the inputs were available to the plant, all the conditions were ideal, what would be the potential or most yield that you could get in any one given situation? The abstract of the Lebel et al. 2009 reference gives a good overview of yield and the impacts on yield. For the purpose of this lecture, only read the abstract. To reach the reference, please copy in your lecture notes the link. The yield of an adopted crop variety or hybrid when grown under favourable conditions without growth limitations from water, nutrients, pests or diseases is the definition of yield potential. There are many examples of how inputs to plants can impact yield. Here is just one example. We have learnt that water is required for photosynthesis and photosynthesis is important for yield. It is also required for other important physiological processes such as transpiration, plant cooling and cell torgidity. In the following example, the experimentation conducted by Manson et al. in 2008 shows us that water and how a crop gets water and this can have a different effect on different crops. Therefore, not all inputs are equally impacting. The research explored how the grain sorghum yield compared to corn yield under similar water volume and soil holding capacities was different. Different crop yield responded differently to inputs. This can be influenced by soil, water, nutrient status, climate and disease pest susceptibility. The example I show here of Mason et al. in 2008 is just one and the literature is full of many such examples. Soil yield is not reaching when an input is limiting. This is described by a concept called the limitation of growth factors. There have been a number of laws developed in order for us to begin to understand these. The Leiburg's law of the minimum is one. And Michelin's law of diminishing returns is a second. There is a reference and a link in your lecture notes, the history of soil science, which gives an overview of this component. The Leiburg's law of the minimum is one. And please remember at all times that we are relating this to yield and how it impacts on yields. So Leiburg stated that a deficiency or absence of one necessary constituent, all others being present, renders the soil barren for crops which need the nutrient. This principle can be applied to plant nutrition. Therefore, if you have all nutrients the plant requires but it is deficient in just one of these, the plant will not thrive. It will not reach its optimal yield. If you then increased all the nutrients but still had one nutrient limiting, the plant still would not thrive. Its yield would be impacted and it would not reach its optimum biological yield. Now let's look at the law of diminishing returns. The graph on the screen demonstrates the concept. The increase in any crop produced by a unit increment of a deficient factor is proportional to the decrement of that factor from the maximum. Now we have looked at nutrition and photosynthesis and how they can impact yield. Let us move on to other agronomical management components and see how they might impact on yield. The first I want to introduce is something called seedling density. This is the space between each of the seeds in a particular crop. If the seedling density is very dense then it has a high plants per meter squared. If the seedling density is less dense then it will have a lower number of plants per meter squared. The data that you can see on the screen is from the FAO and it shows how the seedling density can impact on yields. If the plant you are growing is too dense resources such as nutrients, light and water which we have discussed can become limiting. This will reduce your yield. If however your crops are planted at a low density you are not optimising your biological crop yield. You are not using all of the nutrients or all of the light or all of the water that is potentially available to your plant. Therefore you will be losing money. In this example on the slide there is given a range of sowing densities and how they relate to cropping density. In the example on this slide 200 kilograms per hectare is the optimal density which you can, sorry the optimal yield which you can obtain from the density of 350 plants per meter squared. The phylaeton is a useful measurement that can indicate a plant's appearance. It is often applied to cereals and can be used as a tool to establish the development stage of a cereal. The reason I am introducing this to you here is that often you need to manage plants appropriately according to their developmental stage. Therefore you need to be able to ascertain all the different stages in order to then apply the right agronomical management strategies for that stage. The phylocron is the interval between similar growth stages of successive leaves on the same stem. The phylocron can be used in this assessment of growth development. It can be impacted by temperature, water deficits and particularly nitrogen deficits. These are all important factors in order to optimise crop yield. In wheat plants for example, nitrogen availability to the plant is low. Then it can result in a reduced leaf emergent rate. The reduced leaf emergent rate refers to how quickly a plant can produce leaves. In this example it means they produce leaves slowly. You can imagine how this can then impact on yield. Genetics is also an influence of this aspect. It can be impacted by many factors. These impacts can be positive or negative and in some cases the relationships can be complicated. Some of these factors we have mentioned already. For example, the soil yield can be impacted by the soil pH, soil salinity and the texture of the soil. We will cover this in more detail in a later lecture. The climate such as the light quality and quantity. The amount of UV radiation excessive or limiting. The amount of carbon dioxide, water and humidity and wind can also impact on yield. The elevation of where a crop is grown can also influence the yield. Crops grown on mountains have different yields to crops grown at sea level. Nutrient availability can impact on yield as well as pollution and toxic compounds. Crop management not extensively but this does include mechanical handling damage and all physiological inputs required. Integrated crop management, irrigation, germination rates, sowing density, how you handle the soil, timing of your crop, phenological development relative to climate inputs are just a few that we have mentioned. So you are beginning to understand that there are many complexities that influence crop yield and therefore influence crop management. This is why it is important to refer to agronomy in a scientific component a way. So I would like now to introduce you to the concept of plasticity of yield. This is an example on your slide of plasticity of yield. The vertical axis in the figure on the slide represents a theoretical yield while the horizontal axis represents a range of environmental conditions. The lines on the graph are illustrating how a hybrid responds better than the wild type. Commercial enterprise, one of the most important aspects to try and obtain is yield stability. That is you keep the yield the same year in year out. How stable a crop's yield is can depend on the cultivar's availability to your environment. Therefore, an ideal adaptivity characteristic of a plant would be for it to have a good optimal and consistent yield performance over a wide geographic region under variable climate and environmental conditions. What I mean by this is you would be able to grow your crop anywhere, whether it be in the UK or in Australia or in America and you would have the same yield. Adaptability is a measure of crop reliability. Ideally, a cultivar would yield well under both good and adverse conditions. The stability is the availability of a cultivar to yield consistently over a wide range of environmental conditions. We say that the yield has plasticity. This means that the yield can be impacted by the seasonal, the climate and or the management inputs. This can make growing crops commercially a challenge. Comparing yield and quality, some examples of this balance include feed grain production, human food grain production, forages and many horticultural crops. You need to look at the quality versus the quantity. There is often a compromise in agronomy between the highest, largest or best yields that you can obtain and the best quality output that you can obtain. And it's not the same for all crops. Some examples are when you grow red wine grapes, you may select quality over yield. You produce low yields with high grape composition characteristics. Or when you grow and manage pastures, say for either horses or sheep. You may compromise your yield, dry matter production, to ensure that you have the correct grass protein and nutrient content that results in your horse or animal optimal health and development. When you grow wheat for animal feed, you may only be interested in higher yields and you not worry about the quality of the crop. As you can see from these examples, quality is different for different crops and enterprises. When growing plants on a commercial basis, it is important to understand what the quality aims are and how you might achieve these on your farm. Examples of quality aspects are gluten strength, digestibility and nitrogen content. But there are many, many more. Please note that N in this lecture series is used to abbreviate the macronutrient nitrogen. The following slide gives an example of an alfalfa yield and its quality. The yield is measured as a weight in migs per hectare and the height of a crop. Quality factors are crude protein, or CP, digestible dry matter, DDM, relative field value, RFV. Looking at the data, you will be able to observe that the relative field value, the crude protein and the digestible dry matter, all decrease as the crop matures. To put this into context, a crude protein value of 18 is good. One of 15 is fair, but one of 13 is considered poor. Therefore, when the crop harvest is at its largest, the crude protein value quality indicator is between fair and poor. This would result in less economic return for the grower. That is a reduced value. Please note, the above graph is based on theoretical data set that may be typical for alfalfa values. For more information and other measures of quality, there is a reference on your handouts by Lansfield, in the preceding National Al-Falfa Symposium. This was published in 2014 at a conference at the University of California. There is a link on your handouts to this data. This is a link on your handouts to this data. Okay, so that brings us to the end of this lecture. But before we go, let's summarise all the important components that we have learnt during this lecture. We started off understanding what plant growth basics were. So what is growth? And how do you define it? We have learnt that there are different types of growth depending on how you define it. And this is important depending on your enterprise. We have learnt that there are many different ways to measure plant growth. This area is called plant growth analysis. The way you measure your plant growth will depend on what you are ultimately trying to do and the crop you are trying to grow. We have looked at yield and learnt about what yield is. We have defined it. There are different types of yield between actual and potential. There is biological and economic. We have learnt how yield can be influenced by its environment. How the environment can impact on photosynthesis which can then lead to increases or reductions in your yield. We have learnt about the plasticity of yield. That is how it can change with season, climate and management. Inputs may limit yield and we have learnt about the associated theories behind these, particularly with respect to nutrients. We will be covering nutrient theory in more detail in future lectures. We have learnt here about the relationships between yield and quality. That brings us to the end of this lecture. That brings us to the end of this lecture.
