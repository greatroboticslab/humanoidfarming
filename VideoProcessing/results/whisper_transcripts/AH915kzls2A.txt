 As a long-term player in the tree industry, Carlton is well known for their quality stump grinders. In a constantly changing world, Carlton's innovation took to new heights, or shall I say, widths. I'm Abraham with Crownstone Equipment, and it's my pleasure to introduce Carlton's new SP5014 TNX Stump Grinder. So what's new on this 5014? Walking around this machine, you'll notice many of the tried and true features you've seen in previous TRX models. You still have the same engine, cutting wheel, remote, and other options to choose from. This machine sports a 14-inch cut depth, a 34-inch cut height, and 50-inch swing from the cutter head. The most exciting innovation being the undercarriage. A new straight track design has been implemented. Carlton did this for one reason, to allow for a broader range of widths. Bigger isn't always better, and Carlton took this to heart while designing the 5014 TNX. The new undercarriage makes this machine capable of expanding up to 45 inches wide, or shrinking down to just under 30 inches. This is essential for navigating through difficult places like crowded woods and narrow gates. This new undercarriage also improved weight distribution. Carlton kept many of the dependable design features of previous models, and added new innovation to this TNX, making this machine the perfect blend of old and new innovation. Don't be stumped by this machine's new looks. The TNX offers Carlton dependability with added refinement.
