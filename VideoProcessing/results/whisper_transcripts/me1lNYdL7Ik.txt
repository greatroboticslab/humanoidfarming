 Music Good morning everybody. We're headed up to Ben, an Amish guy that used to work for me to pick up my small disc carols that he's been using. He's been using for several years now. Ben used to work for me for several years. But anyways, he's been borrowing my disc carols so I go pick it up in spring sometimes and run down to disc my garden. It works fine for that. We actually did a video last spring with him in it, but after I did it and actually put it on YouTube, he came back and said, you know, I don't really feel comfortable with this, so we took it off. But he said it's okay to show around his farm, so I'm going to just get the disc carols on and I'd like to show you his sawmill that he has because that's what he got done when he stopped working for me. He went and got a sawmill of his own, which I suggested that he do, and that's what he's been doing ever since. So we'll see what we can do. I've got Justin with us this morning too to help load these disc carols up because it's not something that I can do alone or even with Brenda's help. So here we are at Ben's. Looks like he's got some good strawberries coming here. He's worked up his garden already. Looks good. This car's is still over there, flipped it on the end. Hello, Ben. I didn't really think Ben would be here to help us, but he was, so I had to be very careful and do a lot of editing to be able to not show Ben's face or any talking that he might have done because that's what he wanted to avoid. So that's what we tried to do. I have been fortunate to get permission from quite a few of these Amish to do little videos on what they're doing and the different ways they do things, but I have to be very careful to be respectful of their wishes and not to show more than they would like me to show. So here we are getting these discs up into the trailer and my trailer is a little bit narrow for these discs so we had to kind of roll it up these planks and kind of twist it around a little bit to get them to go into the trailer. But we get her done. I have learned an awful lot about the Amish from Ben because, like I said, he used to work for me. But he not only worked for me, he actually lived with us for about a year. When I agreed to hire him and put him in our upstairs little apartment, he was an unmarried man. But before he actually moved in, he got himself married, so it was not just him but him and his wife that moved in with us and they were allowed to actually stay with us and have run and water and electricity while they stayed. But it was just temporary and then eventually they had to get out and get a place on their own without any power, of course. But I did learn a lot from him. So here's Brenda's going to go into the sawmill and show you real quick what he has for a mill. He has this LT28 Wood Miser and he does quite a lot of sawing here. That's how he makes his living now. And he just has customers, just local customers like I always did. And he is very busy running this sawmill and I feel he's doing a pretty good job at it. So I'm glad he can do that. He really was hoping to get a job at home so that his son could help him. And that's what he's able to do now, which is great. We're back at the farm. Okay. I wonder if we should even use the plank. We shouldn't just slide this corner off and then roll the other corner off and just roll it down. If we lift that lid up, we won't drive. You don't need me to help? I think by the time we go out, it should be fine. I think by the time we go out, it should be fine. I think by the time we go out, it should be fine. You want to pull out of this garden? Look at that door. Hi everybody, we're gonna be working on getting the garden fitted for another year of vegetables. Jim's got Bill this morning and he's gonna hook him up to the harrow and give him a run through the garden. I think he chose Bill because Bill seems to have so much energy and so he wanted to, he figured he could use a little extra work. He's gonna be harrowing out in the big field, getting the corn ready to go and just kind of takes the edge off if Bill does a little extra work this morning. He's always raring to go. The end of the garden Jim's on right now is always quite wet. And we thought it might be ready the other day but it is just heavy soil so we gave it a couple more days. It is a lot for one horse to pull. I think he used Ken last year if I remember correctly. But it can be done with one and I think he's just gonna kind of give it a once over. We'll have to go over it again with a spring tooth to smooth everything out. We put a lot of organic matter in this garden. Since we last used it and Jim plowed it really deep. So it's gonna take a little bit to get it worked up. But really it doesn't take long for him to go over it just once. So much quicker than me using the rototiller I'll tell you that. Jim took a big stone out of right here and didn't quite hit it with the harrows but where the spot was. But we'll get it worked in. Now that we don't have a fence Jim can get up a little closer. And get it worked up a little better. Closer to the flower garden. What? Apparently he's gonna get even closer. There's a fence post there so I'm not sure what he's talking about. Can't get that close. Here's a rock. Maybe this is what he's talking about. I don't know it's not fair enough. About everything white is interesting. Hornets so as you can hear our garden has tons of little stones in it we've picked tons of little stones out of it so uh maybe we could set it right in there i mean that's where a lot of times i have it yeah this is great over here i got some garlic i moved it and it didn't like being moved these didn't get moved but we'll see how they do my sister becky gave me some garlic she grows tons of it so i'll have to smooth out the edges because it makes it rough to mow but that's no big deal soil is really nice so this will help it dry out tremendously so so so phil's doing an excellent job of not stepping in my flower garden i'm impressed and jim's doing an excellent job of driving them so they're a good team so so so so as you can see when i'm disking with these harrows and one reason why i don't like these harrows is if you have them wide open like they are right now you make terrible ridges and where the center of the harrows are disc are you have this big concave section and if you go around every time and half lap it you tend to smooth it out fairly well but it's hard to do that so i just go around regular and i end up with the ridges but now i'm going to adjust my discs adjust my discs and put the the disc at kind of like half halfway and they will kind of smooth things out a little bit and then of course i'll take the spring tooth over it again to smooth it out even better yeah so i have to stand corrected because he did he is going over it more than once right now i'll actually i'll actually turn the other way does this make it easier or harder for bill or just the same easy these are straight not proper one one one two two two two Okay, that's all done. After lunch, maybe we'll hitch onto the spring tooth and get it ready so you can get your garden planted. Yeah. Thanks. Bye. Bye.
