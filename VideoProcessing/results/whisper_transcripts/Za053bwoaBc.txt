 When you grow vegetables at home, are you still using pesticides? Then you're missing the point of growing your own vegetables. Today, I'm recommending a high-yield formula that I've been using myself. It's something most people won't tell you about because it's eco-friendly and leaves no pesticide residue. You can easily mix it at home. This little formula used every 7 to 14 days will boost your vegetable growth, increase flowering, and yield high production. Plus, it reduces the risk of leaf drop. Today, I'm sharing a formula that many seasoned farmers use, such as baking soda vinegar and salt. No need for pesticides, just use this combination to enjoy green, healthy, and safe vegetables. Whether you're growing vegetables, flowers, or fruit trees, you can use it. I suggest you bookmark this so you won't lose it when you need it. The recipe involves mixing 2 ounces of white vinegar, 1 ounce of table salt, and 2 ounces of baking soda and 30 pounds of water. Spray this mixture evenly on the leaves of your crops. It not only kills pests, but also promotes lush green foliage and abundant growth.
