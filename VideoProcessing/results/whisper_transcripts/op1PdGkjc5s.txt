Assistance for Beginning Farmers and Veterans

Science & Technology
 I grew up in the state of Pennsylvania. I was always interested in farming, ranching, and when I finished my assignment in the Pentagon, I was reassigned to Fort Sam Houston, Texas, and I realized this was a key pivotal moment because I could realize a dream I had, something that I feel that I was meant to do, and that was to own and operate a farm or ranch. So I think in Texas, people think of Texas, they conjure up an image of ranch life, cattle, cowboy, and I'm happy to say that I'm able to contribute to that image in a positive manner on a day-to-day basis. I'm not from a farming or ranching family, and I think it's unfortunate that most people in the United States don't have that experience to include beginning and new farmers and ranchers. To include myself, because of the learning curve, I didn't have education and that experience from that experience, so it was really critical for me to address that steep learning curve that I had. One of the important aspects of services provided by NRCS, specifically through the Battleground to Breaking Ground workshops, is that it provides veterans or soon-to-be veterans with the resources that they need to be available to them as they begin farming and ranching. And that is absolutely key and essential so that they can efficiently use their time, their effort, their money to begin farming and ranching and to produce a product either for themselves or for consumers. Lisa contacted the Bexar County NRCS office, and I got in touch with her to help her improve her agriculture operation out here and help her treat her resource concerns by helping writing a conservation plan. The conservation plan that was prepared by David Bush and NRCS will directly impact and improve my ranching operation by ensuring that I can support my cattle operation with high quality forage in terms of the grasses and also for pasture rotation by improving the fencing, cross-fencing. When reviewing Lisa's conservation plan with her, we also discussed different financial assistance programs that she might be interested in. Lisa signed up for what we call the EQIP program, Environmental Quality and Ascentive Program, to help implement the practices that she has scheduled in her conservation plan. These skills that I'm learning currently on active duty directly translate into farming and ranching in terms of developing a concept, what is needed in terms of a requirement, and how do I bridge those gaps, whether that's education, whether that's fencing, buying the right stock of animal. It's military skills are directly related to farming and ranching. Through U.S. Department of Agriculture, NRCS provides several free services to veterans who are thinking about farming and ranching. And these services are free. They're voluntary. And it's been my experience that the representatives in NRCS are very happy to meet with veterans, farmers, and ranchers to provide their services. NRCS is helping veterans and farmers protect the land that they themselves fought to protect. legislating carries the лет undoes of these programs they had, right? Translating 잠 behandels to people with far smoother passage. But this is a huge factor, and there seems to be a foreign- прlayer of fifty- Nashville.
