 At the end of the season, this is what your tulips look like, right? They're done flowering and they look like they need to be cut back down to the ground. But the thing is, is you don't want to cut them down to the ground yet because they're still photosynthesizing, gathering all the sun's energy to gather and store for next year's growth and next year's flowers. So the thing you need to do is come in and just cut these flower stems off right down to the next leaf there and then you can leave the green until it withers all the way down to the ground. And you can stop also watering your tulips so it actually induces the dormancy a little bit faster. Now this goes also for daffodils, hyacinth, and grape hyacinth. So hope that was helpful.
