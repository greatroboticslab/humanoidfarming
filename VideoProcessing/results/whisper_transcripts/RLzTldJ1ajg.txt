 What happens if you shear a Minecraft pig? Well, nothing. But if you craft a special pair of shears using two gold ingots, then we can shear a pig to get the pig skin item. Gross. But that's not the only mob we can shear. Because this also allows us to get feathers from a chicken, leather from a cow, and even hide from a polar bear. Which we can then use to craft into our own special polar bear armor. But most importantly, what happens if you shear a creeper? All right, we'll make a deal. You click on that subscribe button, I'll click on the creeper. Ready? Go.
