 When you grow your own herbs, you have a fresh supply of them on hand whenever you need them. This can be specially convenient when you're cooking, as you don't have to worry about running out of herbs or making a special trip to pay premium prices for store-bought varieties. You can buy starter plants or seeds at a relatively low cost and have a steady supply of herbs throughout the growing season.
