Sustainable Agriculture: The Benefits of Crop Rotation

Science & Technology
 There are more than 40 different crops that are grown and marketed in Saskatchewan. This allows for diverse crop rotation, ensuring long-term sustainability. A good example of a four-year rotation is oilseed, cereal, pulse, cereal. Advantages of crop rotation start below ground. Different rooting depths and root types allow varied access to water and nutrients. Diverse rotations will encourage diversity in soil microorganism populations, leading to increased yields. Soil-borne pathogens can survive in the soil until a host crop is available. Crop rotation allows time for pathogens to break down. Other pathogens survive on the crop residue. Crop rotation gives the residue time to break down. Managing diseases with crop rotation also helps with stewardship of other disease management tools, such as disease-resistant cultivars and fungicides. Crop rotation also helps with stewardship of weed management tools. On its own, a diverse crop rotation will reduce weed populations and their risk of developing herbicide resistance. Within crop types, herbicide groups to control weeds are limited, and herbicide-resistant weeds have been reported in Saskatchewan for herbicide groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 25, as well as in populations resistant to more than one group. Diverse crop rotations help keep Saskatchewan agriculture strong, sustainable and abundant.
