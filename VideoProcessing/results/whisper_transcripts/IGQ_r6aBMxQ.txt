Howto & Style
 So make sure your string is all the way to the ground, touching the ground. And what I like to do, I like to pull the string a little tighter and hold the plant like this. And then I start wrapping my string around the plant gently. I'm going to try to do it a little faster. And then there you go. Just like wrapping it, you know, a lot of times. And you could tie the bottom if you want, but you don't have to. I don't. And then after wrapping it that way, then I take the top of the plant, holding the string down. And I gently twist the plant around the string like that. And all the way to the top. You got to come every two days when doing this. When growing your cucumber vertically, you have to come every two days or else it will overgrown and then lean over.
