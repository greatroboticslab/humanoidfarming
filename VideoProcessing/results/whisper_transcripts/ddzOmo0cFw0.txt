 Hello and welcome to Garock Farms. In today's video we're going to be giving you guys a bit of an equipment tour. We're going to go over the tractor lineup here to start with. This should make a pretty good video. I know a lot of you have requested this in the comments so here it is. We'll give you some of the history and maybe cover a little bit of what they're used for. So hope you guys enjoy the video. So we'll start with the Farmal M and this tractor I bought from my brother which he bought off an auction and he usually was in a situation where he'd buy these and fix them up put loaders on them or sell them to the hobbyists. But a really good motor on this motor is kind of souped up a little bit I think. We were going to paint it and one of my kids started started the project but something else came up they didn't finish it but so we just kind of stopped but that's why the hood is this is our smallest one and we use it for raking but right now that we got we got eight tractors so this one gets used like down here in this other shed to move equipment around. Narrow front really handy that way and for some reason I don't know why M's are usually pretty warm-blooded tractors this one here is cold-blooded it's just it has to be warm out or just I don't know if it's something with the float in the carburetor what's going on but we added some weights there's no fluid in the tires I think it's I don't know what the year this one is I actually got books on some of this we can't even hardly read the numbers anymore but I'm going to guess somewhere in the 40s the M's are made for quite a long time. If you guys want to see this restored throw some comments down below so what my younger brother that started this project might might finish it. So on to the 1066. Now this one here I bought off an auction when I still was working at home with my dad in 1989 it had only like 3,000 hours on it and right now it's got 6,090 hours on it. So we brought it home we started using it for lighter work it was good and then it spun a I think one of the main bearings spun. I'm trying to remember back but we did some checking on the cost of everything and it was it was to overhaul this whole thing and we checked the history on it it sounds like it done the same thing before and I think the farmer that had it didn't want to invest into it so it kind of just patched it up. So what we did there was a company in Springfield Illinois that would rebuild these motors. You'd send the core in and they would grind the crank and the camshaft and then replace everything inside and you'd basically come up with a brand new motor with a warranty on it. This 1066 came with a 414 and this is a 436 in here so this is the motor they would put into the 1466s so it's got 140 horse instead of like 120 horse. Anyway it's been really good ever since there's hadn't been any problems. We use it for packing the pile mostly in the summer I put it on the feed mixer because it's kind of clumsy for other stuff. The cab I could live without it it was great for plowing the road before we had one of the other tractors to do that now so then I have doors for it and stuff but what we want to do maybe one of the other brothers can do this one where we're going to get this cab took off we're going to buy fenders and we might have to make steps in the battery holder and stuff because the salvage yards don't really they can't they're not able to come across any used parts anymore simply because everyone that's got these that wants to redo them is uh use them parts up and then maybe put a canopy on it and then the black stripe they claim the black stripe but I think this is a 1974. 74 or 75 it's the last ones before the the 86 series came out and um I think they they're like the 1086 until right here is identical front end everything the same motor the same it's the rear end is where they changed and they came with the first soundproof cab so anyway this kind of a rattle box is basically just blocks you from the wind and the wheels are full of water it's my heaviest one so and we got dual sport for packing all right so we're in our other shed and I think my father he'll talk a little bit about um storing your equipment and not putting all your eggs in one basket you know it gets below zero we got the heated shop so what happens is you think well we put everything in there so it starts better and everything but then you hear stories where you got all your main stuff all packed into one building and and uh if you had a fire or something sometimes you you want you've got other buildings maybe it's best not to have it all together I mean like we we for instance got two balers we'll never store both balers in the same building and you know we don't have to it's it's and things like that you know better off split your stuff up so now this here is a super mta and if you look here this isn't the original decal I repainted this tractor back in 1984 and we could not find these decals so this is what we did but we only could find m and super m and I don't know why now you can find them again this tractor was on the home farm where I grew up and when my dad took over the farm in 1960 he bought the farm from my grandma and grandpa lock stock and barrel and they had two tractors they had a formal m and a uh uh formal 200 that my grandpa had already with the farm as soon as my dad bought the farm he found this on an auction now this is a 1954 they only made this tractor one year this super mta which is basically high low range in there so anyway he brought this home and my grandpa got very angry with him that you know he's spending his money and you know he's housing and pay for the farm and all these things he's having to pay for the farm and he's having to pay for the farm and he's having to pay for the farm and he said that went on for a little while until grandpa drove it then he started bragging about it with uh with all his friends like it was the best thing in the world which it's kind of like going from uh you know a horse to a four-wheel drive I mean it's just you know you can only imagine this tractor haul all the manure and there's a heat houser a canvas cab we call it with a shield that went on here I still have it yet and I've used it here back before I had the other tractors and this is the most warm-blooded tractor on this whole farm so this thing's been sitting here now for a couple months it's been below zero just about every morning here for the longest time this one's never let me down just clearing her throat not too bad for as old as she is most people this age would never get out of bed that quick now right here there's like some I don't know if that's nickel or what they used there must have been a crack in the block and my dad bought it that way and he claims he paid 800 bucks for this tractor back in 1960 so you got a 54 model I don't know if it was worth that much more new maybe 1200 bucks new so that's kind of a lot of money back then and he was told that this tractor was in a shed that got tore apart by a tornado and I don't know if maybe uh some something you know a piece of wood or something hit that and or what that was from but it absolutely had nothing no effect on how this tractor operated this one is the old faithful by far we put I remember replacing part of the torque several times which there's some parts in there that go bad over time um brakes we I don't never remember touching the motor ever starter of course that's just and it's and these are the last one that came six volt and this is switched over to 12 volt so all that happens it makes the starter zing a little faster and maybe wears it out faster too but it does start quicker and better that way what's different from an M or a super M is this block in here and there's what you call a torque ampler in here and that's what the TA stands for and that that was kind of high low range so when you pull this you would you would slow it down like when you want to turn around on the end of a field or something but it would freewheel the motor would not hold the tractor back so on a hill someplace you had to have this lever ahead and that was always something to keep in mind now if there was an hour meter on this tractor I would have to guess that this tractor would probably have more hours than all eight of our tractors put together I mean the draw bar here has been reinforced and my brother was always a pretty big welder but I remember growing up this thing's been rebuilt maybe six or seven times from the manure spreader wearing it down and these side hill hitches you know very handy now that that straight M that we were talking about it's got one of these on too for moving machinery around this is a real saver as far as just getting in places narrow front and all that they see come with 14 nines 38 inch rubber and I don't know if they came at 13 sixes and 14 nine I'm not sure definitely the good old faith and this track gets used for I mean we vacated with it and we pulled loads home with stuff like that I mean it's not as heavy as the big ones but it never fails us now the Oliver you've guys probably seen on other videos I bought this tractor right after I came here so I came here in 91 I bought this tractor in early 93 on an auction I was bidding against a jockey and my father-in-law standing next to me and he knew I needed something more of a tractor I only had that 1066 in this MTA so for hating it was sure made sense to have at least three I bet it up to 2900 I let it go the auction stopped the guy came to me that bought it and he asked me if I still wanted it and I he said for a couple hundred more I think so 3100 I got this tractor home and he sold a loader to me that uh I ended up getting rid of afterwards when we got the bobcat and a better loader loader but so I came back the next day to get this tractor and an old fellow was there and it was the brother to the guy so it was an estate auction where the guy died and and he was his brother was telling me he said uh this tractor rolled over and killed that man and I never knew that when I bought it and I always wonder why the hood was bent up a little bit all the other steel was pretty straight and you see their cleaner's a little bit bent and they had to replace the steering column and the fenders are off of 55 see that they made the 1650 and then the 55s were maybe a couple years newer and they had this stripe on and that's why that was that they must have got bent up and the story goes it was really narrowed up and the guy was raking hay and he ended up pulling the rake up on top the tractor when he turned around and it rolled it over on top of him so but this one's been good the motor's been very sound everything else I went through so when I got all done after a couple years later we I used to bail all my hay cut all my hay with this I think I had like about $6,500 in the whole thing with new tires and everything and rebuilt the hydraulics and brakes definitely a great tractor for getting around raking we use this thing for everything good starting tractor all right on to the other shed so uh yeah that's my father's oliver don't mistake that for the tractor I made some videos about a long time ago that was a 1550 same age just one size smaller but the chassis is the same size all the framing is the same is a little smaller motor and I use that to plow snow but I ended up selling it I didn't need it anymore so the 686 probably about as nice as you're ever going to find them and I found this over by St. Cloud way on the other side of the cities for us it's quite a drive and I always wanted one because I knew this tractor would fit under my corn picker and being it was a diesel I seen it in the paper and uh I told the guy it better be nice because I'm not I I don't you know if I'm going to drive that far I want to see a nice tractor that I could very possibly buy so anyway everything was pretty decent on it we ended up buying it when I got it home I noticed that the rims they used to have fluid in them they were getting kind of rusty and if we're going to put a picker on this long story short we ended up replacing the rims tires and tubes it didn't have any weights on it but I had some extra weights for my 1066 so we were able to add those with it and three-point hitch it came with it um to get them this nice it's pretty rare I think somebody's asked before I think this is the I think it's what they call the 312 my dad had a 656 gas and it's you know otherwise cosmetically it's all about the same there's a little smaller platform in here and then of course the gas motor didn't stick out past the framing but the chassis is all the same and it had 15 fives these are 16 nines I think yeah 69 38 says at 15 five which were a little lower to the ground is all a little smaller wheel and the brakes were completely shot I could barely stop on a dead level and I thought we are not going anywhere without redoing all them brakes so that was one thing we did right away and then we filled the tires full of uh this product they call rim guard which is like a beet juice and it's very friendly to the environment and the tractor it has no acidity to it at all like that calcium chloride did so since we had everything already replaced and knew we weren't going to go back to putting that stuff in there if we didn't need to and that is the weight by far keeps you very well planted you want a good stable machine where's the tires fast a lot of weight but yeah so as my father was saying this is what he uses for the corn picker and for those of you wondering what he used before he used that 1650 before that you just seen so the 7405 my first four wheel drive bought it brand new in 99. i believe this is a 98. it had only like 120 hours on it which i think what they said it was is they borrowed it out to somebody for a tmr tractor while theirs was getting repaired i'm not a john deere guy original and we stumbled across this and i thought let's drive it and you know like a lot of things you just kind of think oh wow that's that's the real deal and and we stood on it for a while and eventually bought it now the the old fives they made three different ones i think there's a there's a 64 and then a 66 and then the 74. oh five they're all five and they call this the advantage series which was more economical they had a smaller hydraulic pump then so it's the same chassis as the 10 series except a small hydraulic pump same motor 105 horse power quad transmission the dash is more of a basic dash you don't have a big adjustable air seat or any of that stuff your steering wheel is pretty much your standard stuff but the biggest difference was the hydraulics which still beat anything i had up till then my 1066 this is probably double and it came at bias tires and the other thing was this rack and pinion this is the old style hub um they used which let's face it doesn't make any difference they never had any problem with those as far as i know and the axles actually came out to here i ended up cutting them off afterwards so we didn't hook and gates and stuff with them by far this is our favorite one our all-around tractor is unloading our chopper boxes all our feed moving all my summer manure hauling this is uh a real get around tractor i put this here rail on both sides just for a handle otherwise they only had this little plastic one here a courtesy light for the um no that that was one thing that was a real plus that courtesy light at night you wouldn't see if you if you weren't familiar with this tractor you wouldn't know what gear what you're doing now this horn i was uh i was over in a dealer in hickston looking for some parts from my kiwani elevator and i think some corn picker parts and uh this was slain there and uh this apparently is on an old school bus you know so i don't know i don't even know why i picked it up it was all rusty but it was just kind of the shape of it but i polished this all up and i rigged it's uh a little get your attention anyway that's really what it does most they didn't come with front fenders that was an option they didn't come with the right hand step that was an option that we put on and in the weights we bought this loader later on to fit this tractor which we do use for certain things it's awful big and clumsy but it certainly um will go way further than your skin steer when it comes to lifting and pushing so it's on a 75 10 and the interesting thing i've noticed with the 10 series especially in the last six eight years you do not see these for sale anywhere whether it's a 74 i think they came in the 74 to 75 to 76 77 and 78 10 and they're called the 7 000 series in the 74 72 to 74 and 75 at the same frame except the motor and injection pumps and the wheel sizes and stuff like that in the same cab this one only came with a cab now i bought this brand new back in i think this is an 02 and in may of 03 we bought this exactly 200 miles from where we live here it was on a dealer it had 500 hours on it was a release return so still had a year's worth of warranty power quad transmission and it's kind of got the cadillac cab where just about everything that they put in them at that time is in this one like you can see here on the on the rims there's three holes instead of most of them we had two and then a lot bigger axle and they were they were kind of put together more for the loader tractors really and i think uh they just built a few things heavier so it handled that weight to that load but we haul manure with this one all winter we cut hay with it all summer that's more where this one gets tied up on the hay we ended up adding some led lighting to it when one of the lights or something got went wrong we ended up just switching up to that right away but yeah we got the doors on both sides and i wouldn't trade it for nothing these tractors i mean they the value they're worth way more than they were when they were new and we're using them and i think there's like just a little over 4 000 hours on this one well far as uh any problems we had nothing major i the air seat that that i don't even know what they call it that balloon in the air seat started losing air and then every other day you're pumping it up from completely flat and that got really kind of more of a pet peeve than anything but other than that i don't remember having really any serious problems with this tractor we still got the original tires on it yet which again i talked about radio tires wearing very well compared to those bias on my 7405 that's the third set on that tractor already but that's a way cheaper tire too these are very expensive i'd hate to even price them today one thing i've noticed too is there was an american front end this is what they call german front end and my 7405's got that too and a way to easily tell that is the shape of the axle and as far as which one's better you know i i i couldn't i couldn't tell you they've been good to us but what you pretty much see on this one came with it now it's time to talk about the the big horse on the farm 78 10. i always wanted one they were about ten thousand dollars more than the 75 or 74. the interesting thing is the cab on the 78 is the exact same cab as on the 75 and 74. you might have a few extra little goodies added inside but it's pretty much you go around with a tape measure everything's the same i bought this tractor new in 2014 milk is very high cattle are very high i mean we thought we're gonna we're gonna update with something we're gonna get something i called the guy that dealt with these good used ones and he used to own the john deere implement over in grant wisconsin and then now he sells good used machinery so he knew all the ins and outs of these tractors he sold these tractors brand new back in the day so this is a 99 and it had 2 000 hours on it well first of all i i called him and he had one there but it was sold already but it was still there so we went there anyway to look at it because i never really seen one up close but anyway then he said he'll find one so then he calls me up maybe a week or so later and he said he found one it's down in ohio and he's got guys that know tractors and when they say they're good they're good i said bring it up here if it's as nice as you say we'll be seriously thinking of buying it i walked into a shop and i took one walk around it i knew i was bringing this tractor home he told me it was 90 000 for this tractor that was back in 2014 and then after we agreed we'd take it and sat down to view the paperwork he told me you know he said i sold these brand new and he said they were 69 000 brand new back in 99 and it had we got the duels with it and the weights and everything you see on it came with it and the front tires were replaced new but the backs are still original which are all pretty good yet i thought that was kind of crazy we're paying 90 000 for a tractor that's 15 years old and uh on machine repeat so out of the kicks of it i got on youtube you look it up on machinery p they're selling a 7810 down in uh in iowa somewhere in iowa and came out of wisconsin originally it just got just under a thousand hours on it that was just just last fall brought a hundred and seventy thousand dollars and it's probably in the exact same shape as this one this is just a few more hours on it but anyway it's just crazy when you think about it these tractors are gaining value and we're using them all the time so anyway this has got the american front end on it we got 18 442s on the back the other one's got 38 axle mount duals instead of clamp on the other ones i put clamp on rules on the neatest thing with these tractors yet is like this past fall i think the fan belt broke or something for us and we ended we were chopping hay we had to switch tractors now between the drawbar the pto our hydraulic setups all electrical in the cab everything's in exactly the same place my chopper my baler along with some other machines everything matches up the same so the way all our hitches are designed on our or set up on our implements i can use either either one of these three john deers and that's the neatest part but the biggest difference with this one is right here we got about this cab is jacked up five inches higher off the chassis got a little bit bigger framing i think this tractor's maybe four or five inches longer than the other one you got a little bit more room under the fender here there we got 2800 almost 2900 hours which still is nothing these tractors i've seen them with 10 000 hours on in there this tractor is about as nice as you're going to find them and it's not really cleaned up right now it's pretty dusty because it's been sitting in our back shed we just drove it up to get a better look at it today you know you're wondering okay went from international you know my dad was all international and back in the day everybody you know the alice chalmers guy say those chalmers international say those international john new guy you know they all were they all had their goods and bads and and we just you know like i said with the 7405 we kind of stumbled across getting that and and it's always easier if you kind of stay with the same because everything mixes and matches you get to know these tractors if i started with a different brand i'd have to learn all over again and we don't have nothing against one or the other i mean the one thing about the green ones is they hold their value and i don't want to talk anything under anybody else color down but i know the guy i bought this tractor from he told me there was a i think it was a versatile with only a thousand hours on it i think it was over 200 horse and it was for a lot less money but again i had a lot of tractor i'm not going to say it was good bad or whatever but it's just and i want to add to that too working off the farm as well i think a lot of it is um serviceability and dealers that are close to you and you know what your neighbor has and yeah what you're used to a lot of that is a big part of it being able to get parts when you need them you know versus if we say uh went like the agco route there's not a lot of agco dealers close to us so that'd be a bit harder for us you know where we have a lot of john to your dealerships around so it's a bit easier to get parts and if you needed service you could get it things like that and i found with updating different machines so we with like the chopper went from new holland to gale i had to learn it all over again and it wasn't that it was that much better or anything it's just i think once you get on something you learn it well and like you said you get to know the people that you got to deal with it's you know try to keep it simple stick with it but we're happy with them i mean the four-wheel drives on this farm with these hills it makes you kind of wonder how we got by without them but i i realized everything just moved a lot slower and um i think the bigger thing with farming today is the equipment's getting so big that less people can get more done but the bigger pile of everything we produce becomes worth less so if everybody still had to farm with those two-wheel drive smaller tractors i think we would see some different prices but we wouldn't be able to produce it this fast it still end up being about the same at the end of the day all right so we'll wrap up the video i hope you guys all enjoyed it yeah leave a comment down below you uh farm oil guys when it comes to restoring those uh two tractors we started off with uh maybe give him a little grief in the comments maybe he'll get into finishing that that m i also wanted to say that if you guys enjoyed it and you wanted to see uh the rest of our equipment also leave a comment about that if that's something you'd be interested in um but yeah like we said thanks for watching we appreciate it and we'll see in the next video
