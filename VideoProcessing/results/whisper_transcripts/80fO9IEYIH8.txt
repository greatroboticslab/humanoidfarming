Howto & Style
 Okay, so then how do you know that the chicken at the grocery store, that the eggs in the grocery store are truly pasture-raised? So a lot of people would say, they're going to hear your question and be like, well, I can tell from the yolk. Like the yolk's going to be orange and the true pasture-raised. No, people. Like that is not how you tell. The industry uses something called xanthophyll, which is a feed additive. What? That can make that yolk any color they want. So whether the birds have lived out on green grass or they've never stepped foot outside, I can produce a yolk that's orange or red or bright yellow or even like shades of green. Like I can make it any color through a synthetic feed additive. That's what those guys are doing. So then a lot of people are cracking this yolk open. They're like, oh, look at this beautiful orange yolk. And I'm like, that's not orange because the birds are outside. That's from a feed additive.
