 Welcome to the farm. Welcome to the farm. I'm Justin and a couple videos ago we were working on the case tractor we pulled the oil pump disassembled it cleaned it put it back together and reinstalled it and I left the video off with having all these parts here yet to clean and I mentioned something about getting something better to make that easier and I did. So we got ourselves a parts washer so in this video we're gonna get this thing assembled and see how it works now that we got all the parts out we can work on assembling it but before I do that I want to lay some cardboard down on the workbench so I don't scratch up the new parts washer as we put it together parts washer is pretty easy to assemble we're gonna go ahead start by just mounting the legs to the tub as I assemble this I'm gonna leave all the nuts and bolts loose until I get everything loosely assembled and then I'll come back and tighten them all at the end just like a lot of central machinery harbor freight tools this does have some quality issues right here it's got some metal buildup or paint buildup on where the leg bolts to the tub this isn't a big deal still went together just fine however some of the the nuts and the bolts didn't want to twist together very well either I had trouble starting some of them so it's got its issues hopefully it'll hold up in the long run with the legs loosely assembled we can go ahead and install the shelf I'm gonna do two bolts to start with kitty corn from each other to kind of hold the shelf up and then I'll go around and add all the rest of the bolts now that I got everything assembled and lineup I can go through and tighten everything down leaving them loose really makes it a lot easier because some of those holes didn't want to line up so being able to move the legs around to get the holes lined up was a huge benefit with the tub and legs all assembled and it placed and where I think it's gonna end up we can go ahead and start working on the pump first thing we need to do is install the actual hose next I need to loosen the two screws that hold the switch to the pump housing and and that is to facilitate holding the pump down to the tub now we can install the pump in the side of the tub there's a little square hole cut on the side that the switch slides through and sits down on and then to secure the pump in place we just tighten down those two screws that hold the switch in and then we could just snap the pump cover back on put in the shelf and a little parts basket okay well that's this thing fully assembled could definitely tell it's a Harbor Freight thing because there's there's definitely some quality issues I'd say with it I mean there's up on the ledge edge here you can see the paints not the best I don't know how well you can see that on camera but there's tons of little lines in the paint on one of the legs there was a bunch of like metal weld material built up not a huge deal it's covered by the leg but the biggest thing that I'm seeing that I don't like is in order to hold this in you tighten those two screws that hold the switch box on and I've got them as tight as I can and it's supposed to secure this thing it's not secure at all and I also don't like that this doesn't doesn't open further I don't know if that's common for a parts washer or if the rest of other ones open up further but I can see trying to get like oil pans and stuff and moving around that this this lid might get in the way we'll see but I guess the next step now is to fill this thing up and test it out so when I picked up the parts washer this is the detergent they had with it and it's some pretty aggressive stuff for normal cleaning this is supposed to dilute down to make 200 gallons of cleaning solution for parts greasy parts it says dilute one part degreaser to 26 parts water from what I've read in the reviews people are doing two of these with 18 gallons of water I'm gonna do one of these with 19 gallons of water and see how that works I can always pick up another jug and add it in if I need something more aggressive but it says on here not to use with soft ferrous metal so I don't want to make this too aggressive because I don't want to damage any potential parts that may be of soft metal so let's go grab the gator let's go up to the house let's get 19 gallons of water and see if we can't get this thing filled up so it says this is a 20 gallon parts cleaner I only ended up putting about 14 gallons of water in plus the one gallon cleaner so I have about 15 gallons in there the direction said fill up to the bevel line which is what I feel like I have done not 100% sure I wanted to have a little more room on top so I'm not splashing and spilling because I tend to be messy let's turn it on see if the pump works well I hear the pump doing stuff but I got no fluid pump does not sound good pump does not sound good hmm there it goes just took a little while well I think the parts cleaner was a success this is looking fairly clean still got a little bit of gunk inside I'll have to try to get out but that'll be a different video yeah it's looking looking really good I'm happy with it the only concern I have now is obviously my barn is not heated so I'm a little concerned about that freezing and breaking the pump you guys got any ideas on how I could stop that or if you think it even will let me know in the comments but yeah I think that'll do it for this one thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next one bye
