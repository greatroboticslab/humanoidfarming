Incorporating Fertilizer

 Well, it's late summer here. It's in early September and we got a nice overcast sky and I'm putting on fertilizer. It's a good day to do that because fertilizer can volatilize in the heat and you lose the nitrogen. So a nice cool day like this is really good and we're using the petal tractor to help incorporate it. The first step is spreading it by hand, so buckets and just sort of dropping it at an approximate rate. And we did a calculation for what the different crops need. So it ends up looking like this where you've got these pellets adjacent to the rows. And so what I'm doing is I'm setting up the sweeps and the beet hose to pick up soil and throw it into the row. And so that pushes the pellets closer to where it's needed in the root zone of the plants. And it also sort of buries the pellets. You want to give good soil contact to the pellets so that when the pellets decompose, it's not volatilizing into the atmosphere, but it's getting up taken by soil microbes. And once it gets taken up by soil microbes, it gets cycled through them. And then it's really the exudate of the microbes that fertilizes the crops. And it'll keep it going, it's almost half más in a picture. Thank you. Thank you.
