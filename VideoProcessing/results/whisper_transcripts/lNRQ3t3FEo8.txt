 Every time I close my eyes, I just see clusters and clusters of grapes. When I share my wines with friends, they know that there's no trick, there's no gimmick. It's just truth. In 41 years of making wine, I've never seen anything like this. My dad would always tell us failure was never an option. What happens in the vineyards is a cycle, and it's our future.
