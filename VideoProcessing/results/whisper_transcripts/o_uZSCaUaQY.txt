Community Supported Agriculture. Ann Cure is a farmer in Boulder, Colorado. She grows fruits and vegetables for people in her community. When asked why, she says, Our goal is not to grow food for the whole world. It's to grow really good food for 175 families. She did that by creating a CSA. While the system may vary, the principle remains the same. Community members purchase subscriptions, or shares, from their local farmer. This allows the farmer to buy everything needed at the start of the season, and provides guaranteed income throughout the year.
