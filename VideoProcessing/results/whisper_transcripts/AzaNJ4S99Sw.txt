 Three months living off homegrown, foraged, and hunted food. Since we're at the three-month mark of this year's challenge, we figured it was time for a little pantry update. The corn's holding up really well, and we've been eating that every day in cornbread and tortillas, but as you can see, the canned stuff is a little low. We still have some dried mushrooms from our logs and wild mushrooms like these porcinis that we foraged. Now, honey's something we have a huge surplus of, so we've been giving away tons of it to our friends and family, but we still have gallons of it to eat, and we're going to be doing another harvest in the spring before we know it. Dry beans are one of our favorite staples, and unfortunately, we're almost out. A few months ago, the pumpkins and winter squash were covering literally every surface in our house, and we still have tons of them, but we've eaten a lot. The potatoes are long gone, so there's not even an after picture. Wild nuts like black walnuts, hickories, and acorns have held up really well for us, and we're still eating those regularly. Now, we eat venison pretty much every day, but it's usually a smaller part of the meal, so we have plenty of that left, and we actually got another deer that we shared half of with our friends. And for frozen fruit like cherries and peaches, we still have plenty to satisfy our sweet tooths for the rest of the challenge.
