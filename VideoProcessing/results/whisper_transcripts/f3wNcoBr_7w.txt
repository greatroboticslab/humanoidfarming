 Hello everyone, it's Farmer Charlotte here from Cannonall Farm with a very exciting update on our goat experience. So now these guys are a little bit bigger, a little bit more confident, we've started putting them on their colours and leaves and coming for little walks with us down the yard to meet some of our extra animals. Anybody who wants to come join us feeding our goats and then giving them a little walk afterwards, you can go onto our website and look for our VIP goat experience.
