 After looking at the image, I believe that most of you would have a brief idea about what would be discussion revolving around. So I would just like to tell all of you that the rural economy in India is mostly agriculture based and it is very important for us to link the agriculture side with other Indian industries as well. At the same time, agriculture also acts as a base industry for several industries, predominantly as a source of raw material and it is important in today's context because of its vital supply and demand links with the other industries in this sector. So in simple words, if I try to make it clear, what do we understand by the term rural economy? So we are primarily referring to the farm and non-farm activities. Since most of us would be knowing the fact that more than 70% of India's population is residing in rural areas, the people who are residing in these remote regions must undergo or perform certain activities in order to earn their livelihoods. So the money that they are earning from this livelihood is contributing to the rural economy. Now it is very important for us to understand the importance of rural economy and how is it relevant in today's time. So talking about the importance, the rural economy holds significant opportunities for creating productive jobs and contributing to the sustainable development and economic growth. It accounts for a significant share of employment and output in many developing countries but is widely characterized by work deficits and poverty, hosting nearly 80% of world's poor. Improvement in the rural economy is the only key to eradicate poverty and ensuring that the basic needs of a growing global population are met and it is also one of the agendas of 2030's sustainable development which is planning to increase the attention or in other words the focus towards the rural development, agriculture and food security sector.
