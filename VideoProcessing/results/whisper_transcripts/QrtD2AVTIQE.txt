Education
 Whatever milking system a farm has, there are some basic steps that have to be followed to ensure good milk and healthy cows. The cow's teats are washed with a disinfectant and wiped dry. Then, the milking machine is attached. There are four suction tubes, one for each of the four teats on the cow's udder. It takes about five minutes to milk a cow. After the milking, the cow's teats are dipped with an iodine solution to prevent any bacteria from entering the udder. The milk runs through a hose from the milking machines, to a pipe, to a bulk storage tank, where it's kept really cold until the milk truck arrives to pick it up. The milking equipment is thoroughly cleaned before and after every milking. And this happens every day.
