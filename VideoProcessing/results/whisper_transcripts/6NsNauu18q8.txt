 That dude's a legend. Is this the big boy right here? 25 horsepower. A little bit of an oil leak it looks like. What's going on? Yeah, there's a bit of a leak on the crank seal on the front. Look at that, diesel. Yep, 25 horsepower. How many times have you wrecked it? We won't tell your mom. I ain't wrecked it. I ain't wrecked it one single time. Oh yeah? Although I have about got bounced off the seat because I'm hitting pop holes in the driveway. So I get bounced off the seat. Oh yeah? Let's see how this thing sounds. Crank this thing up. Got a little smoke action. That thing's awesome. That thing's a beast. I like when you turn it off and it just shows it's got a monster. Yeah, this rattles. So this is the first one I ever bought. This one right here? Yep. How much did you buy it for? $35. $35? That's a deal. With the mower deck. All it took was really a new carburetor and some lines and hoses and some other stuff and new tires. We had a ladder sitting over the tractor and we had a fuel hose coming out of a fuel tank and it's going down and we're trying to start it. Now when you put new tires on the tractor, do you do it yourself or do you have some help? Have some help. Yeah. Yep. Anything smaller than that, that's a gas that I got. So this is the 420. It needs a bath. But the paint is like, look at how good the paint is in shape. So the guy that had it took really good care of it besides it needs a new starter. So it's a gas, this is 20 horse gas owning motor in it. And it does, it don't sound the best. It sounds like a cross between a really rough running 454 gasser and a cow screaming. That's an odd mix right there. Probably. So when you get a little bit older and you've got your farm, what do you want to farm? Like your corn and beans or you want to have some cattle? Corn and beans, corn and beans probably. Maybe move down to Florida and be a citrus grower? Okay. I'm corn and beans up here. So this, this is the nice seat. They say that's the nice seat on that 430, but this is really the nice one because it pops up. Oh, I like that. Yes. Can I try it out? Yeah. It's pretty comfortable. Oh yeah. Yep. This thing's nice. Now the nice thing about this tractor is it has, see when you're running out of fuel, it has a reserve. So you turn it over there and it will reserve fuel to get you back to a fuel tank or a gas can. And then this and that one, these are the really nice tractors because they got a hydraulic front end on them. So it's sturdy. So it doesn't bump you around too much. Unlike this. So watch this. See how loose that is? Oh yeah. This one's got the... And then vac, so it'll vac your leaves up. The motor doesn't physically run right. I probably shouldn't be saying this, but it, because we're going to sell it, but I'm, I'm just going to keep my mouth shut on that. Okay. Yeah. We won't tell anybody. So this will, so this will blow out and all your grass will get discarded back here. Discarded. I can tell you when I was eight years old, I was not using the word discarded. This is telling you. Education level is through the roof. big. So we're going to say that... There we go. We got some what we want to polsk. Yeah. We want to get it all. We're going to show off. We're going back. So I'm going to get you. We're doing all the three-wearing cy soit- меся對.
