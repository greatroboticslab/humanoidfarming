 Alpine season, a special time for people and animals. It begins around mid-May and ends with the descent from the alpine pastures, like this one, around mid-September. For many, alpine season is the most beautiful time of the year. But it is also a tough time. This year, I am accompanying Lena, Lukas and their dog Coco from the Grindel Alpine Farm in Gschwantenmarkt to give you a glimpse into life on the alpine pastures. For once, the video is mixed in different languages because it would be a crime to dub Lena's original voice. Na eben, es fängt heute nur entspannt an, aber jeder Tag bringt auch mehr Arbeit. You will love her accent. Today is the first day of the alpine season. I am excited to see what awaits us. It is the early morning. It is a quarter past four. Yeah, very early. Because I have an appointment with Lena. Yeah, from the farm, from the Alp. Yeah, and they wake up at five and she said, if you want to come see us, come at five. Let's knock. Coco is the first. Yeah. In the morning mood. Coco. Hi. Coco. Yeah, good girl. Good girl. Lena. I think they start wilking now. It's like the untumaten, gell? Yeah, genau. Hey, ladies. Hi. You should know me already. Hi. Yeah, you know me from last year? No? Maybe. Hi. Good morning. Hi. Lena is now on the way to the cow. Is that schwierig? Is it difficult? Is it difficult? Je nach je, when man's gewohnt is, is it entspannt. But when you're doing it for the first time, it's good, if you've practiced it a few times in the forest. Okay, practicing is recommended. What are you doing now? What are you doing now? Okay. Just. Put it on. The first thing, I'm using it, you say, you chew from when you're like it very bad. Si, say that even more. Or the bad milk happens, you think? Oh, say that and say that and the. When you touch charm. Yeah. Yeah. I focus that well, and still check out. And of course, if there are accidentally antigames, bloodpודה, and From gel toТiero feeling like bascaloding in it. part of the milk is probably with dirt and then she cleans the Euter. Exactly! And then we hang on! Go on the outside! And the cows are used to it, right? Yes, every day, every morning and every evening. So this is an automatic thing, they just wash it? Yes, and now let's go. How long does it take? I think three or four minutes. Okay. By the way, this oil cheese won the best prize last year and the year before, I guess. The last two years, right? Yes. So if you are here in Chwantenau, you need to taste. It's kind of massage, right? Yes, exactly. So, she has a lot of milk. So, let's go. How much milk does it need to prepare a sort of big cheese? Yes, for a cheese that has about 10 kilos, you need 100 liters of milk. For 10 kilos of cheese, you need 100 liters of milk. Yes. How was the first sight of the cows? Very special, very nice. Yes, and I know a lot of them from the last year. Yes. Do they recognize you? Kennen they you now? Yes, I think a little bit. They are looking forward to going to the Alps. Yes, I think it's the freedom here. What's the say? They have freedom. They can move freely. They have fresh grass here, fresh trees. And I think it's very nice. Especially the beginning here is still very quiet for them. We have everything on one level. Of course, if we go to the second season, with the time, with the Alps and the high, it will be very much more difficult for the one or the other cows. And they will be tired. But we will do that with the time. So, Lena said that the cows, when they are here on this Alp, everything is flat, so they are quite relaxed. And when they go up, they need to walk more and go on steep meadows. So, it could be exhausting for the cows. But this is the same for us human. The shit is part of it. A big part. And I can see how long the cows have been taken. And I know that the cows are ready to go up. And where they have to go up. So, if the number goes down, then it's finished, right? Yes. Okay. That's the Fluss-Zahl, so to say. Ah. So, look, here is the next one. Here is a Jod-Füllung or Mischung. So, this is a kind of disinfection. They put it on the water. Because the water is open after it gets milked. And they put it on and it's kind of disinfection. So, nothing bad can happen. And now? The milk goes now through this slug, through this thing, to look. And that's what we check now. Look prepared everything here in the kitchen. And what you saw before, the milk from Macau, is already here. What do you do now? He put in cultures. So, for the Mutschli, which you hopefully buy later. So, this is Zimba. She's tired. And Zimba is an original brownfiel. This is a Swiss breed. Very robust. Yeah. So, the breed is make-make or milking cows. And she's waiting for her turn. So, when the barn is full with 31 cows, it will take one and a half hours to get all the cows. And all the cows milked. That's good. To help you to clean. Yes. Okay, let's go. How? Here, this is wonderful. And here. Yeah. Super. Okay. And then you can balance it in the front. Or you can also move the way back to the front. You can also move the way back to the front. So? Yeah. So? Yeah. So? Yeah. So? Yeah. So? Yeah. So. Yeah, so. So. Yeah, the one is a little bit. That's a lot of shit. Look, he's doing the magic. So. Now we have our end station here. This is the end station for the milk machines. And now we're gonna put the milk machines. Yes. Now we're gonna put the hands first. First, Lena is cleaned. Yeah. And then we'll put the milk on the rest of the milk. So that the farmers have milk for the coffee. Ah. So she's cleaning this machines during six minutes. First a little bit with warm water. Then hot water. And then six minutes going through and through and through. And then the machines are cleaned for the next milking procedure. Ah, super. So this is now the milk for the farmers for the coffee. Yeah. As fresh as it can be. And nearby the barn is the fridge. Try to open it with the cheese from last year. Yeah. And of course I will take one at home. And then it's time for the first day on the Alpine pasture. Up, up, up. Come here. Come, come. Come, come, come, come. Come. Come. Yeah. Yeah, I'm so happy. And even though everything looks peaceful and idyllic, on the first day it's time to establish who's the boss here on the Alp. You can tell that the cows are excited and very happy to be back grazing on such a beautiful Alpine meadow. Meanwhile, production continues indoors. The cheese isn't ready yet. How are you doing? How are you doing? That's very good. That's very good. That's why you can't be afraid. Look, it's pretty thick. So we wish it to be. Tip, top. This is now almost the premiere. Yes? Yes. It's the premiere. It's the first Mutschle cheese on this Alp produced. At the squanded mat. And you were live on this video to see how this cheese was produced. Huh? Haha. It's exclusive to. What do you love most at the Alpine time? Was machst du am liebsten? Was mache ich am liebsten? Eben die Käseproduktion ist natürlich eins unserer Herzenstücke, denn da sieht man die ganze harte Arbeit, die drin steckt von dem ganzen Tag, von morgens eben ganz früh am Morgen bis spät am Abend. Und ich liebe auch eben das Ursprüngliche, das Altertümliche, das ein Schritt vielleicht zurück zur heutigen Zeit zum Gehen, um aber auch in dem Moment wieder zu sehen, eben was man eigentlich nur zum Leben braucht. Und sie sagt, dass sie das am liebsten, das der Cheese produziert. Und die Gefühl, dass sie ein bisschen zurückkehren von der modernen Leben und die hand-crafted Dinge, du kennst. Ich gucke jetzt mal, das mal zum Warmwerden, dass da drin schon Schotti ist. Wieso machst du das? Das mache ich jetzt, dass es warm bleibt. Wo ist die Körnchen, dass die jetzt im gewohnten Milieu sind. Ah, okay. Sie sagt, dass die Milch ist, nicht die Milch, die Körnchen, die Korn, die bleiben warm. Ich bin ein bisschen verurteilt. Das ist die Röcklitz-Fahrt. Und das ist die Musli-Fahrt. Genau. Ja, du musst so viel wissen, das ist verrückt. Und jetzt geht es runter. Und dann, ich denke, sie braucht etwas Druck. Genau. Ah, mit diesem? Lass mich mal sagen. Ja. Das ist ein Röcklitz-Fahrt. Das ist ein Röcklitz-Cheese. Das ist das Ding, das man in der Restaurant oder in Hause essen. Das ist ein Röcklitz-Cheese. Und da ist es 5 Kilogramm. 5 Kilogramm oder nicht 5. 15 Kilogramm. 15 Kilogramm. Oh, wow, understatement. 15 Kilogramm. Das ist ein Röcklitz-Cheese. Und was machst du mit dem Rest hier? What are you doing with the rest here? That's for the pigs. But the pigs are not here yet? No, they will come. In, I think, two hours. The pigs are here. I love pigs. I'll do the Maulkner. Look here, these are the IDs. What do you say? Personal Ausweis. Ah, for the pigs? For the cheese. They get some numbers. That's the Alp-ID. Now I'll put the date on it. So you can know from when. So this is the ID for the Alp. And now the stamp, I believe the stamp, comes with the date. This is the kind of only thing, bureaucracy, right? Yes. Rückverfolgbarkeit. So then they know, ah, with this number, Lena is guilty. Lena and Luke. 6, done. So the same procedure as with the Roklitz cheese. They take away the Schotte. And then they put in again warm water. To get the temperature, right? Yes. Yes. Ah, it already looks like cheese. Like Roklitz cheese. I'm on your way, young. Sorry. Bye-bye. And the number is on it. How long does it take now until this Roklitz cheese can be on my table? Two months. Two months. Yeah, circa. Then it's from the taste, super. And then from the consistency. Two months. Then it's in the spa. Two months. Ah, exactly. Super. Ah, they fight. While the Mucchlis still need a few minutes, I watch the cows again. They need to clear who is the boss on the meadow. And now it's time. I've tried it. I've tested the Consistent. And now it's ready. That's a Mucchlis. Then I'm going to form it. And I'm going to fill it up until it's full. I'm going to put it here a bit. And I'm going to put it in. Then I'm going to put it again. The Chotte helps the consistency to connect it. So, she said that the Chotte helps to connect with the cheese so that the consistency will be better then. Then the next one. And this will be one Mucchlis. One Mucchlis. One big Mucchlis. Yeah, normally they will go down to a size like this. Maybe the double or... Maybe the double or... Yeah. The simple one. The Couch. Now it's time to go. Now it's time to go. There's always the same process. There's always the same process. There's always the same process. There's always the same process. And then I'll put it on the back. There's always the same procedure. And two or the two when. So, I'll use it again once. And now it's time to switch. So this happens for project? I'm putting it on the back in 3 weeks. Yes! So this Mucchlis is ready to eat in 3 weeks. Oh my great. Now I need you to have it. And my Uncletable is going to eat every week. Yeah we teach the same cycle. These are always the same procedure. Yep. And then for example until weingtonually tend to hang out as long as mid of the order. are ready to eat in three weeks. Okay, now. You can clearly see from the first how it goes down. Huh? Yeah, because of the weight. Afterwards, everything is cleaned thoroughly so that everything is ready for the next milking and cheese-making round. Outside, I hear cowbells in the distance. The herd is not yet complete. The last cows reach the Alp after about three hours. Much to the delight of the other cows. The first day is a little quieter, she says. Lena can take a breather. Does she have a break until the next milking round? The first day is a little quieter, she says. The first day is a little quieter, she says. You arrive, you chat with the farmers, you have to clean the car stable. But with each day, there is more work coming, more cheese and more dirty work. But today, it is all about setting in. It is not so difficult, the Alp said, as we all say. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. It starts to be relaxed today, but... Every day, it brings me more work. It brings me more cheese, it brings me more work. Exactly. After the first excitement, it becomes quiet in the pastures. Most of the cows need to rest first, and the gentle, tinkling sounds across the swamp and moth. The Alpine season has begun. In a few weeks, we will visit Lena, Luke and Coco again, to see how they are doing. You can watch the entire series of the Alpine season playlist. Thank you for your interest in Swiss culture.
