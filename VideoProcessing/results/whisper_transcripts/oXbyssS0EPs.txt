 We've only have so much earth that that's been given to us and so you want to keep it in the field where it's going to be the most good. Over the years this organic matter in the soil was starting to be depleted. Civilizations fail when you lose your topsoil. It's what sustains everything. You know we owe it to the future generations to do a better job with soil health and water quality. When we have really big rainfalls we need these protective coverings, cover crops, in the way so that we don't have overland flow, so that rain can get into the soil and so that we can use that soil water later to grow cash crops. I started planning cover crops a few years ago and I think the first intent was is soil erosion and since then I've learned and continue to learn there's so much more to cover crops. And as I began to work with it then I found other benefits and worked with it long enough that I've actually observed increases in organic matter. So I've started to rebuild some of the degradation that has occurred over the past hundred years. And I'd say that's where I'm probably looking at more now is soil health. I'm concerned about what's going on underneath underneath the plants and stuff. I figure if I can try to take care of that then I have a good environment for my plants to grow the plants will take care of themselves so to speak. If you want to start somewhere and on your farm with conservation start with cover crops because I think we get we get some real good benefits from cover crops. So with Practical Farmers of Iowa over the next five years we'll help farmers who want to add cover crops to their farm do that even more. We'll be offering a cost share program for ten dollars an acre along with expert advice from one of our staff agronomists. Farmers that are eligible for public funding through maybe federal NRCS cost share or through the state. We'll also help you do some of that paperwork to take advantage of that opportunity and also help you become a member of the organization and learn from other cover crop experts.
