 The best thing about this recipe is not the dressing. Although I have to admit the dressing is probably one of my favorites that I use so often. No, the best thing about this recipe is actually the presentation. I start with a large shallow bowl and place some chopped romaine lettuce all over it. Then I create long lines of the toppings. The more color, the better. I use olives, cucumbers, tomatoes, chickpeas, feta cheese, and red onions. Now sprinkle it with some fresh herbs and then it's time for that dressing. Shake it up well and drizzle it just before you serve. Everyone will be saying, so good.
