Howto & Style
 All right, today on How's It Growing, we're going to discuss rooting, cuttings, clones, and seeds. We have three products here, Dip and Grow, Vitagrow, and Clonex. Those are all auxin-based rooting hormone compounds, contain indolebutyric acid, naphthalene and acetic acid. The importance of auxins in rooting really can't be understated. They are the hormones that cause a plant to root, those auxins. Indoleacetic acid, indolebutyric acid is what's contained in these three bottles here. Those are the lesser volatile of the auxins. Indoleacetic acid, which is an extremely important auxin, is almost impossible to extract and even more impossible to bottle because of its volatility. It just breaks down as a compound outside of plant tissue too rapidly, which is where this azos comes in by extreme gardening. Azos is an endophytic bacteria. Azos is an endophytic, which means that rather than colonized just around the root zone, it actually penetrates into the cell wall of the plant, thus the endo, it is inside the plant. Once inside the plant, the bacteria itself actually, through a symbiosis with the plant or a mutually beneficial relationship with the plant, actually increases the production of indoleacetic acid, which greatly increases growth rates, increases the speed at which your plants root. I hope that helps. You guys have a good day.
