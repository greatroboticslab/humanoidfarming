 As urban populations continue to rise, innovators are looking beyond traditional farming as a way to feed everyone while having less impact on our land and water resources. Vertical farming is one such solution that's been implemented around the world. By vertical farming, food crops can be cultivated easily in urban areas by planting in vertically stacked layers in order to save space and use minimal energy and water for irrigation. In the physical layout, the plants are vertically stacked in a tower-like structure. This way, the area required to grow plants in minimized. Next, a combination of natural lights and artificial lights is used to maintain a perfect environment for an efficient growth of the plants. The third parameter is the growing medium for the plants. Aeroponic, hydroponic or aquaponic growing mediums are used as the growing medium. As the technique becomes scientific, efficiency of the process increases and as a result, vertical farming becomes sustainable requiring 95% less water as compared to other farming methods. plants. It is a method of growing food in water using mineral nutrient solutions without soil. The plant roots are submerged in the nutrient solution, which is frequently monitored and circulated to ensure that the correct chemical composition is maintained. The basic advantages of this method is that it reduces soil-related cultivation problems like soil-borne insects, pests and diseases. The National Aeronautical and Space Administration is responsible for developing this innovative indoor growing technique. In the 1990s, it was interested in finding efficient ways to grow plants in space and coined the term aeroponics, defined as growing plants in an air or mist environment with no soil and very little water. Aeroponic systems are still an anomaly in the vertical farming world, but they are attracting significant interest. An aeroponic system is by far the most efficient plant-growing system for vertical farms, using up to 90% less water than even the most efficient hydroponic systems. Plants grown in these aeroponic systems have also been shown to uptake more minerals and vitamins, making the plants healthier and potentially more nutritious. An aquaponic system takes the hydroponic system one step further, combining plants and fish in the same ecosystem. Fish are grown in indoor ponds, producing nutrient-rich waste that is used as a feed source for the plants in the vertical farm. The plants, in turn, filter and purify the wastewater, which is recycled to the fish ponds. Although aquaponics is used in smaller-scale vertical farming systems, most commercial vertical farm systems focus on producing only a few fast-growing vegetable crops and don't include an aquaponics component. This simplifies the economics and production issues and maximizes efficiency. However, new standardized aquaponics systems may help make this closed-cycle system more popular. other Football
