 I just learned that there's a way to grow onions without starting them from seed. If you know anything about growing onions, then you know that the base of the onion or the bulb is the part that we eat. And as it grows, leaves come up from the center and the flower produces seeds, which you can then collect and replant, or you can let nature take its course and let it reseed itself. So understanding that, I got really confused looking at an onion in my pantry that had started to sprout. Like, the onion's already there. So is it going to make more onions or is it going to, like, try to go to seed again? So I looked it up and I just thought this was so cool. After a while, onions will actually grow more starts from the center. So you want to take your onion, carefully slice down the side, cutting back just one layer at a time until you get to the buds at the center. After separating them, you'll want to put them in some water to give them some time to root before you plant them. For me, this took about two weeks and I refreshed the water every day or every other day once it started looking kind of cloudy. And then I planted them in the garden and we'll see what happens. So this experiment totally failed, but I really want to try again. I think it ultimately failed due to where I planted them and not actually because they were store-bought onions. We just have a lot of mice in that area of the garden. And so unfortunately, all of the sprouts got eaten before they actually got a chance to get established.
