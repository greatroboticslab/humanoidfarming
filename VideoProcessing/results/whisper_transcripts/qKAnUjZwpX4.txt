 Hi, I'm Tim Norris, CEO of Bank Info Tech. We decided to create a video that kind of accomplished three basic things. One, to promote agriculture in general and talk about all the great things that our farmers are doing with technology to produce more food with less. The second thing that we really wanted to try to accomplish with this video series was to kind of talk about family farms and share the facts that there's 2.2 million farms out there in the U.S. and 97% of those farms are still family owned. I think a lot of people think agriculture is kind of controlled by these corporate farms and the reality is that 97% of those farms are family farms. So we really wanted to kind of drive that point home as well. And then we also wanted to talk about that these farmers are true stewards of the land. They want to be the land in a better place. And so one of the things that, or all of those things kind of combined and we created this video series and we call it Family Farms Global Concerns. And we kind of talk about some of the global issues in the videos and some of those issues being having to feed the world's population as it continues to grow. And while we're having less resources because of development of houses and just any development that takes farmland away. So we have less resources, we have more people to feed and how are we going to do that. And we're just extremely proud of our customers and how they've adapted to the technology in agriculture to help us do that. Our company provides technology and we get to work with these growers every day and we get to see how the growers have adapted it and put this in their own farming operations. And we just really wanted to basically share that with the general public. And it seems like years ago, everyone had some type of connection to the farm, whether it was a grandparent, an aunt, an uncle, a cousin, maybe a friend's grandparent, aunt, uncle, or cousin, but they had some type of connection to the farm and we really don't have that anymore. And so this video is to help get those people that don't have that connection to the farm to see the real people that are doing the work, that are conservationists, that are trying to do more with less and that are adapting the technology to help them meet those goals. So that's the reason we created the video series.
