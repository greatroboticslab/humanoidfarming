Education
 Before you plant your tulip bulbs, you want to make sure that you site them correctly. And that means you want to plant them in a full sun location, but they will tolerate some shade. When you go to plant your bulbs, you need to plant them 5 inches deep and 6 inches apart so they have plenty of room to grow and develop those root systems.
