 Hello again boys and girls welcome back. Today in Agricultural Science we are going to be learning about the tools used on a farm. Farmers need special tools to make their work easier. Let's take a look at some of these tools. This is a cutlass. A cutlass is a tool that looks like a sword. It is used for cutting down grass, crops and trees. It can also be used to dig holes when planting seeds of some crops. A fork is a digging tool. It has a long handle and long pointy tines. These tines help the fork to easily loosen and turn the soil over. A rake is like a broom for outside. It has a tall handle and a row of short teeth at the bottom that are used for sweeping up leaves, grass and other debris. Spades and shovels have a scoop at end and are used for digging, lifting and moving materials such as soil and grass. A hose is useful because it helps to get water to where it's needed on the farm, to the animals and plants. Boys and girls we've come to the end of this lesson. Thank you for joining me today. Until next time. Bye bye.
