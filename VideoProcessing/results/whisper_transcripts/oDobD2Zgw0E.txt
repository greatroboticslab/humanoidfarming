 Music Yes, very much. There's a lot of agronomic improvements and there's a lot of effort going into figuring out what that is. You know, especially for disease traits like white mold and things like that, just how you run your cropping system and your rotations is really key to maximizing your yield in soybean. Music Well, it all comes down to the health of your farm and, you know, doing five-year corn rotations and things as such, which we're hearing a lot of, really has an impact. In years like last year where we saw a severe drought come in, we certainly saw growers who were going corn on corn really had lower yield than people who were coming off of a soybean rotation. So it really goes to the health of the land and having the best management practices for your farm. We really encourage, you know, rotating through soybeans regularly. Music Nice
