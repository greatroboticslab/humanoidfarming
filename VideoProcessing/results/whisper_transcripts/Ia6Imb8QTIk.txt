 In response to the risks posed by climate change to the agriculture sector, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Food Security, and Rural Development organized a training program on financial literacy and microinsurance as part of the Building Effective Human Resilience Project. This collaborative initiative with the International Labor Organization provided comprehensive knowledge on financial planning, budgeting, risk assessment, and microinsurance benefits, enabling farmers to make informed decisions and safeguard their livelihoods. External consultant for the ILO, Geneal Huggins, expressed satisfaction with the program's outcome, highlighting the importance of farmers being knowledgeable on financial management and insurance practices. We saw that the Ministry of Agriculture is really poised to help bring development within the agriculture sector in this country. And, I mean, piggybacking off of the disasters that have happened over the years and recently with tropical storm breath, we saw the need to really come in to help build the capacity of the farmers and we saw that it was important that the trainings be tailored towards their needs, you know, to boost the agricultural sector within this country and within the region. Director of Agricultural Services, Dr. Aria King-Snack, emphasized the significance of the initiative, acknowledging the repeated and devastating consequences farmers have faced as a result of climate change. She says that by equipping them with financial literacy skills and promoting microinsurance, the ministry aims to enhance their capacity to withstand adversity and foster a resilient agriculture sector. When we speak to food security, we're not only focusing on production. We need to focus on the holistic component of it. We need to look at how we can develop our farmers, not only in producing, but develop them so that they could sustain themselves. And this opportunity will give them the tools that they need to be able to save, to be able to manage their finances, so when they do get themselves in a situation that they will be able to sustain themselves a little longer. So this thing came at a wonderful time, especially now that we're just coming out of the impact of BRETT. It will help them plan for the future, so in the event of any disasters, they will be able to manage. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, Food Security and Rural Development remains steadfast in its goal of building a more climate-resilient and sustainable agricultural sector through the implementation of mitigation strategies and the facilitation of access to resources and technologies.
