Science & Technology
 Think onions are just boring kitchen veggies? Think again. Give onions more water and they plump up, juicier, bigger, and happier. Add the right amount of nitrogen and boom, sweeter bulbs, brighter colors, and a boost in healthy stuff like antioxidants. But overdo it, and onions can turn bitter or mushy. It's like Goldilocks for plants. Not too much, not too little. Just right makes the magic happen. So next time you slice an onion, remember, science made it tasty.
