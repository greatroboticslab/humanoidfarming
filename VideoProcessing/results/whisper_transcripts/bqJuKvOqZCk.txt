 okay well good morning everyone today's lecture is on invisible farmers and what we're going to do today is take a historical overview to look at women and women's role in US agriculture and the title for the lecture today on invisible woman actually comes from a 1983 book so ancient in in your mind but a book that's over 30 years old by Carolyn Sachs and Sachs book was really groundbreaking in that she was one of the the first to examine the contributions of women to US agriculture and it was really this book that helped launch work by sociologists and other social scientists and rural historians and so forth to look at the contribution of women that had largely been invisible up to this time so this is a nod to that groundbreaking book so one of the big questions we've been asking in this class and posing since the first day that we met is why should we study women in agriculture why not just study agriculture why should we take a gender lens and think about the different roles that men and women play i mean why that's what we've been asking that's one of the big questions right and so what we've been arguing what i've been arguing and what other scholars argue is that why we want to study women in agriculture specifically why we want to take a gender lens and not just talk about agriculture in general is that women have always played a really critical role in feeding us and clothing us and sustaining rural communities where there are farm families increasingly helping fuel our society and this is everywhere not just in the us but when we just talked about agriculture women's critical contribution was largely invisible or when we did see it and we'll talk about this in the lecture when we did acknowledge it when we did see it it often wasn't valued the same as men's contribution okay and in some cases it simply wasn't counted at all okay in addition the other component that we've been arguing of why should we study women in agriculture why should we take a gender lens is because there's an important gender gap in agriculture where women don't have the same access to resources that men do they don't have the same access to productive resources like land and capital they don't have the same access to opportunities and leadership education and so forth and if we want to address that gender gap first we have to understand what is the issue what's the problem if you don't know about it you don't know how to solve it okay and for us to solve it we specifically have to think about men and women and gender relations so that's what we've been arguing in this class so what we want to do today is we are posing two questions and these are questions we're going to be answering throughout the lecture uh throughout the semester uh throughout the semester so two questions why have women and their contributions been visible and why and how is there a gender gap within agriculture so these are the two big questions and today we're going to look at three examples to examine these questions we're going to look at farmer identity we're going to look at farm ownership and we're going to look at farm labor and specifically today um we're going to take a historical perspective on this so moving forward with the semester we're going to unpack these issues um as they are today but for us to understand how we got to where we are today we want to look at what is what do these examples look like historically so that's our goal today and what i'm going to be arguing today based on the social science and the historical literature that that has looked at women women's invisibility the gender gap what i'm going to be arguing is that there are many different reasons for this the agrarian ideology but one important reason is this idea of the agrarian ideology and by ideology what we mean is a set of beliefs that underpin our politics and an economy so this ideology is a set of beliefs and the agrarian ideology which i'm going to unpack uh in a few minutes but fundamentally what's critically important for you to remember is that this ideology in terms of thinking about the family farm assumes that the family farm is split into two different spheres the farm and the household and within these two different spheres women and men play very different roles okay so two spheres with men and women playing two different roles so it's an ideology because ideologies are not necessarily grounded in truth and so one of the things we're going to be looking at is how powerful this ideology is and yet when we look at the reality on the ground it doesn't really reflect what we see in terms of the family farm in terms of the family farm in the u.s so to put some boundaries on what we're talking about today our focus is on the family farm and we're really going to be looking we're going to be picking up on the history of of the family farm since the 1860s really from the time of the homestead act so that are our boundaries so if we're thinking about the family farm it has some important geographical dimensions so the family farm is most represented in the midwest where we are here in iowa and the great plains and it largely affected white men and women so on thursday we're going to turn our attention to the the experience of african american women which also had an important geographical dimension in the south in terms of slavery and tenant and sharecropping agriculture okay so what we're talking about today is not a universal experience among all women everywhere but has some important historical and geographical and structural dimensions to it okay so what do we mean when we talk about the agrarian ideology and the family farm so agrarianism is a very old ideology thousands of years old um and this ideology is rooted in the belief that farmers have economic and political primacy over other industries okay that farming is the most valuable the most moral of all industry and all economic endeavors so in the us when we think about agrarianism it's thomas jefferson our third president who most clearly embodies the idea of agrarian ideology so thomas jefferson spoke about agrarianism he wrote about it and was perhaps the most influential in shaping um this idea of agrarianism so when jefferson talked about agrarianism he framed it specifically in relation to family farms so jefferson as we all know was actually a slave owner so perhaps there's some irony there but in terms of developing the republic in the us jefferson argued uh in favor of um um you know taking the land that was taken from native americans that it should be disposed of among people who wanted to work it so if you wanted to work the land you should have the right to own your own property okay so thomas jefferson is in favor of widespread ownership of what are we going to do about this okay so thomas jefferson was in favor of widespread ownership of the land so what's important when we think about how influential this ideology was is that if we think today when most people think about farming they think about family farming right um and in fact there have been many different structural forms of agriculture in the us we're going to talk about again slavery sharecropping on thursday as an example so part of part of part of the way we can appreciate how influential agrarian ideology was is that because it influenced our idea our perception that farming is predominantly family farming where the people who own the land should work the land the land so agrarianism was what scholars call a gendered ideology okay so in thinking about the family farm jefferson put forth the view that the family farm was two different spheres okay so even though we call it family farm we're thinking of this unit but he had this view of it being two different spheres the farm and the household and within those spheres women and men would play very different roles so here his view which again we're arguing is incredibly influential his view the view was that men would be the property owners men would be the agricultural producers and if you own property that gave you the right to engage in civic affairs for the early part of our history also to vote um and that women their sphere would be the household they wouldn't own property um they would be responsible for caring for the house okay they wouldn't be engaged in agricultural production um and that their role was really to support the endeavors of um the male farmer okay so this was um jefferson's argument um so um jefferson's um his um view of um dispersion of the land um and control of that land by family farmers really you know when we think about our history here in the us um really it's the homestead act that we think of as being the fruition of this agrarian view of land settlement so i know we all learn about the homestead act which was enacted in 1862 this gave anyone who wanted to work the land including women um um the ability to own 160 acres uh they were given that land for free and so long as they worked it they stayed on it for five years and so forth they were entitled to it okay so this was a a really important act um mostly um in the midwest and the great pains and if we look at farm numbers what we see is that um this act together with other things development on the railroads and markets and and uh development of institutions like land grant universities and so forth but what we saw after that was the explosion in the number of farms so in 1860 we had less than two million farms in the us by 1935 when it peaked we had almost seven million 6.8 million that was the peak of the number of farms okay so this was an incredibly important act um together with a whole number of other endeavors that led to the family farm um but again the family farm um was viewed as having these distinct spheres with these distinct roles for men and women so what scholars argue is that when we think of the agrarian ideology and again we're going to illustrate this through our examples today is that this ideology has been extremely influential if we look at our social institutions if we look at policies laws education extension and so forth we see it reflected in those if we look at attitudes and values and beliefs whether individual or familial or community uh or societal we see this ideology um um permeating through our attitudes and beliefs and again this idea okay that within the family farm the family farm has primacy we value it enormously but within that we have clearly different roles for men and women who operate within different spheres okay so we're going to look at three different examples to illustrate the agrarian ideology and our goal today is to bring it back to those questions we pose so what we want to try and think about is what effect has this agrarian ideology had on one women's invisibility within agriculture and two the gender gap okay so if we think about why does it matter if the farm is separated from the household how does that influence women's visibility how does it influence the gender gap okay okay that's what we're going to be thinking about so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to look at um agrarian identities and we're going to look at a short clip of a commercial of so god made a farmer how many of you have seen have seen maybe i should ask how many of you have not seen this commercial okay oh okay um small handful have not seen this commercial so this was a commercial that ran during the 2013 super bowl okay and it was advertising does anyone even remember what it was advertising okay what kind of trucks dodge dodge dodge ram dodge ran trucks okay so it advertised at the end of the commercial you'll see a truck i think you see other trucks as well so it ran during the super bowl um and it was an incredibly um emotional and impactful commercial people loved it since that time there's been over 23 million views of this commercial articles have been written about it in the media there you can go and read so many comments people absolutely loved this commercial so we're going to watch it and what i want you to do is i want you to think about the images in the commercial but i also want you to think about the language that's being used so what you're hearing is actually a speech by paul harvey who was a conservative radio broadcaster and the speech is from 1978 so we can um see that it's a few decades old and it's being used and as we watch it and as we listen what i want you to think and you can you know jot down some notes because you're going to come back and share it with the rest of the class is one of the reasons i like to show this video is i think it's a really nice example of the agrarian ideology and so think about how is the farmer represented how is the identity of the farmer represented what kinds of traits are associated with the farmer how are men and women represented in this commercial okay and on the eighth day god looked down on his planned paradise and said i need a caretaker so god made a farmer god said i need somebody willing to get up before dawn milk cows work all day in the fields milk cows again eat supper then go to town and stay past midnight at a meeting of the school board so god made a farmer god said i need somebody willing to sit up all night with a newborn colt and watch it die and dry his eyes and say maybe next year i need somebody who can shave an axe handbook from a persimmon sprout shoe a horse with a hunk of car tire who can make harness out of hay wire feed sacks and shoe scraps who planting time and harvest season will finish his 40-hour week by tuesday noon and then pain in from tractor back put in another 72 hours so god made a farmer god said i need somebody strong enough to clear trees and heave bales yet gentle enough to yeen lambs and wean pigs and tend the pink combed pullets who will stop his mower for an hour to split the broken leg of a meadow lark so god made a farmer it had to be somebody who'd plow deep and straighten not cut corners somebody to seed weed feed breed and break and disc and plow and plant and tie the fleece and strain the milk somebody who'd bail a family together with a soft strong bonds of sharing who would laugh and then sigh and then reply with smiling eyes when his son says that he wants to spend his life doing what dad does okay so god made a farmer whoops i cut it off sorry dodge um so take a minute and can chat with your neighbor or not chat with your neighbor but think about how the agrarian ideology is captured in this film and think about how farmers are represented how the role of farm the identity of the farmer is represented so okay so don't worry about writing down too much it's more just you know jot some notes to think about so so so so who wants to volunteer and and uh tell us what you saw or what you heard in terms of how the farmer and farming is represented what were what are some immediate things yeah masala i mean the audio is directed extremely towards men since all it does is just reference the farmer as a male but then the images come back and it shows females doing odds and ends work so it's extremely bipolar to what is actually being presented okay okay so the text and the images focus on men very nice good what else yeah i felt like at the beginning it started with like non-gendered language like it needed to be someone who and i think towards the end we did get into that more man ideal but i think it did still shine a light on women especially since like um like this was from back in 19 1978 not nearly as much as it could have but i i don't think they were ignored either okay so women weren't entirely excluded from and in fact the language at the beginning was sort of all-inclusive um and thinking about it historically yeah i think in the end the language is very like not gender biased until it says and when the young boy looked at us that dad said i want to do what dad does and that's when it kind of like you get the fact that it's a male but it's just that image in our mind and like the masculine voice like parlin harry's voice but obviously very deep that kind of gives you the idea that the farmer is a male because the images they show a variety of different people from older men and women who are hard-working and you can tell they spend their days in the field to like the next generation of farmer with the young girl standing in front of the fields so i think it's kind of the voice that's something that's a really nice point okay so all the ways we pick things up so how different might we have interpreted this image if it'd been a a woman's voice over and of course it's paul harvey it's a man but then perhaps that automatically makes us think that what we're talking about is men yeah yeah nice i don't think i think a stockbroker's dad probably wants his kid to be like oh i want my kid to think i'm pretty cool so i mean i don't catch a lot of gender bias but it's hard to take something that was made in 1978 where it was very male dominated traditionally and turn it into something where we are now okay but i think it was paul harvey that they wanted to use just because of the tradition of what he was he was so well known for his egg marketing and whatnot okay so incredibly influential so again you know part of it is because we're looking at this historic so they're taking a historical speech and putting it on to contemporary images did anyone have a different view or another take on how so thinking about these different spheres so we're talking about family farming so lastly what we saw was the farm right what sort of images of the household did we see in terms of this family farm where the house is integral right integral to family farming yeah my son i mean and also the video showed some of like women men the house together like they cook the food they bring it out to the guys in the field and then they go back and work on the house they kind of bring the family together through the house yeah but it's the the male at the head of the household and the language then is bringing them together yeah maddie i think like kind of what she said part of that language too is it says as part of the farmer's job is to mend the family together or build family together yeah and so it's almost talking about the same person so if you already like think that there is gender bias between that then you kind of see them as the head of the household person the woman holding everything together yeah okay all right cool okay so um one of the things you know when we think about family farming we think of the household as really integral and we'll talk about that um as we move through the lecture the household is less visible um in this image the focus is more on the productive aspect the farm aspect and if you look at women so we're talking about family farming right family farming women i think there are three images of women um out of the 18 or someone counted them up once okay so there are some women um but there's not many of them um so men um uh predominate in the images and again um as one of you commented the image we see is that um the boy will take over the farm and of course most of us as as was mentioned you know often want our children to um uh take over what we've done um but we can also interrogate that which is what we're going to do so if we think about the agrarian ideology in this clip um um the intent of it was to really help illustrate how both historically because you guys pointed out that the speech is historical 1978 both historically but even today the power um of the agrarian ideology where we see these spheres differently and we see the roles of men and women on family farms is quite distinct and we can think about that in terms of the identity of the farmer so when we um talk about farmers when we talk about family farming um the farmer is typically identified as male okay so we have these strong images of men um often working independently um you know working outside working with crops and livestock and machinery so these are the primary images that we get of the family farm that the farmer is a male and when we think about the traits that are associated with the farmer they are masculine traits okay so things we associate with men often being very strong um being independent being tough being persistent you know you could see the men in the images they were you know creative with the different challenges they had they were resilient and overcoming um the challenges that nature and others presented to them and so forth and and part of this helps us again come back to that idea of agrarianism uh it helps us recognize um why the status of farmers is so high in the u.s so if you do a survey of the american public farmers have a really high status okay and family farms have a really high status and part of it is because of this idea that you know farmers embody so many of the traits that we think are really important and that we value in the u.s again independence hard working resilient these kinds of language that we use when we talk about farmers and this is good this is important the critique is that when we look at this the contributions from women and even children but that's not our focus today the contributions of women are largely invisible okay so again we're talking about a family farm a family farm not a man's farm family farm okay where are the women okay so we didn't see them a lot in that video clip when we talk about women um when we talk about women on family farms we don't call them farmers we don't call them you know farm women um historically and predominantly today we call them farm wives okay so women on family farms um how we identify them as not in relation to the work that they do but their marital relationship okay so it's different for men and for women and we can see the historical roots of this again jefferson um and others at that time argued strongly that white women should not be engaged in farm production right this was not the view they had of black women which we'll talk about on thursday but in terms of white women on family farms the argument was that they should not be working unless they were in desperate dire straits their husbands had died or they were in poverty okay women's place was in the home as wives and as mothers supporting their husband um taking care of the the household and the children and so forth and to justify this um women's role um you know we associate what they do with strong traits of femininity so one of the things we can ask ourselves is so what right so what men are farmers and women are farm wives okay men are responsible on the farm women in the household who cares really what scholars argue is that um this belief that women didn't really contribute to farming and farm production that their role on the productive side was largely invisible had very real material consequences and we could say very real consequences for men but we could also argue for families very real consequences so the example i want to give because it's related to us being here at iowa state university is this idea that men and women operated in these very different spheres had implications for the kind of education that men and women received okay so in 1914 the smith lever act was passed and the smith lever act established the agriculture and home economics extension service and the idea with the passing of this act was that land-grant institutions such as ours iowa state university would provide education um for farm families and this education would be based on science and the idea was that it was to help them be successful farm enterprises but because of this agrarian ideology when men and women operate in these different spheres women were just taking care of the house and it was men who were the farmers um the education that was established um had different programs for men than for women okay so men learn you know the science in terms of what was needed in terms of farm production how to grow crops you know how to look after livestock deal with machinery women learned the science um for the domestic sphere how to cook how to preserve and the photo that you see here um from state agricultural college in colorado women are learning how to make butter which was seen as women's preserve does it matter so the problem is that it didn't reflect men and women's actual lives on the farm okay so that's what we're arguing here is that we have this ideology technology that separates men and women that makes women's contributions invisible that then has material consequences and wasn't a real reflection of the lives on family farms so this is a quote the photo was not the person speaking but i thought it'd be nice to have a photo up there but this is a woman she wrote in a letter i weigh 120 pounds i milk seven or eight cows night and morning run a separator get breakfast dinner and supper do most of the cooking for five people do all of the washing and cleaning do most of the garden work and rake some and hang and mend read and such but i don't have time to rest as we have a 200 acre farm and this letter comes from a series of letters from women who were writing saying i can't get the kind of education i need i mean i'm that's good to learn things about making butter and and skills i need in the kitchen but i do so much more than that and i i need to be learning these other things so the education is not reflective of my real needs one of the other arguments was that um because women's role in juggling both the productive and the reproductive side of things was that their concern which at this time was primarily calls for more labor saving technology was not being heard so women were saying we don't just work in the household we're doing all these different roles and we need you guys to be investing you know we need the government and we need land grant institutions to be investing and equipment that can save us time not just the men on farms so this notion of these different spheres we can look at and i've just pulled out a couple of examples to illustrate how strong this ideology is that we can look at policy education we can look at art we can look at media and we can see it's influence so you guys know this painting right so where's grant wood from yeah iowa okay okay so this is one of the most probably one of the most famous paintings in the u.s okay had lots of um people have poked lots of fun and done lots of things to this image but this is a really well-known piece of american artwork from the 1930s so how is the idea so how is the representation of the farmer and the farm wife conveyed here how do we know one's a farmer and one's a farm wife yeah the man has a pitchfork right that doesn't help you cook very well so yeah man has a pitchfork what else yeah the wife seems to have like an apron on yeah yeah yeah she does have an apron on you can see she has a nice apron and he has his overalls okay so this is actually a farmer and his daughter although most people you know don't know that you'd have to probably go and read about it so most most people look at that and they think it's a farmer and his wife okay but again here's the image of the farmer he's you know doing farm work and on this family farm um she's the wife the daughter um doing non-farm work she's got an apron on here's an example from um an advertisement a post-world war ii advertisement for a farm old tractor again this idea of these separate spheres between men and women so the guy's going off on his lovely new tractor um he's going off to farm and the wife has got her apron on and her nice dress and she's going to stay home and take care of the domestic sphere she's the wife she's the mum and she'll also be looking after the daughter again okay so perpetuating this notion among society at large about this view of the family farm that didn't exist okay and i put this this is a recent example from 2017 i thought this was interesting again just thinking about the language that we use to describe men and women on family farms so this was a um from a local newspaper um and it was an article about an award these two um the long neckers had received the 2017 cattleman of the year award and you can see that the long neckers they finish calves they have a cow calf operation and they operate a fertilizer company and you delve into the article and it talks about them working together so they're working together they work together they describe them as a tag team but the man is identified as a farmer and she's identified both in the title and within the text as the wife now i want to be careful because you know for many women this role of farm wives we're going to look at this more later on in the class um this idea of farm wives gives them status and prestige as well okay so it's not to diminish this title or to negate it in that sense again the main argument is that it doesn't really reflect um accurately the role that women do on farm family farms so it makes um it can make their their contributions um partially invisible um so the second example i want to look at in terms of thinking about you know how is the agrarian ideology um contributed to um making women's role invisible or contributing to this gender gap so if we think about the gender gap within agriculture one of the most significant gaps is that in terms of land ownership okay so historically men um have had access to land and ownership of that land and women have not historically remember we're doing a historical overview and we're going to look at how that's changed um later in the class and this is not insignificant this is materially incredibly important because land is so significant in terms of generating wealth for individuals or families um can provide power status um in the early days of america of course it meant that you could vote when you could only vote if you owned a property okay so land everywhere is important so what the us um um what we inherited were um laws and views from britain um that were then embodied in agrarian notions around the family farm and that is that property um should be owned by men okay so what we can call it it was a patriarchal system okay patriarchal system okay patriarchal system so land is owned by men controlled by men and passed down through generations of males and what i like to bring up this example is it's a really nice example of the power of social norms which is what we were talking about last week okay so um initially women weren't allowed legally to own land or property once they married okay and this was the law of coverture okay so women when they married were considered then to become really an appendage to the male okay she didn't have an independent existence so wives were not allowed to own property and they weren't allowed to earn their own income okay they really sort of were just a dependent on the male so that was the law in the u.s which we inherited from britain those laws were overcome women fought against them and they were overcome in the 19th century um but then what we've seen is the power of social norms which if you remember from last week are those informal rules informal rules about how we're supposed to behave and what we said last week is the social norms can actually be more powerful than the law themselves in terms of influencing how we think and our values and how we behave and so forth and they can be really difficult to challenge so casting our mind back to jefferson and thinking about the historical roots of these social norms again the idea was that women were supposed to be subordinate to husbands that in contrast to men working on the land did not entitle you to property and what we saw you know right through until the last couple of decades was considerable inequities between men and women's ownership and control of land and related assets okay so women really held joint ownership of the land they rarely signed for loans vehicles and equipment were really in their names um and legal records um often didn't account for their economic contribution so important important discrepancies um between men and women's control and ownership and power over property and related assets so what this meant was that was fine probably so long as your family relationships were good what happens though if uh marriage dissolves or women want to work or women want to make some different decisions about their property so this is a quote from the 1970s so for me this feels like very recent history um that explains for 20 years mrs allen scar worked alongside her husband to keep their wisconsin farm profitable during a typical 12-hour day she milked the cows in the morning and evening cared for the chickens helped plant harvest strip the tobacco crops she regularly baled hay and drove the tractor the scares agreed to share their farm revenues until they divorced in the 1970s and the court ruled that all profits from the farm belonged to mr scare in marriage he was legally entitled to his wife's services um so uh hopefully we'll have some time to come back later in the semester and look at um so we have these laws related to land um the major ones were overturned in the 19th centuries but different pieces of them didn't get overturned until the 1980s for some of them okay so women could be left with nothing so you're in a family farm you work you think you're sharing something but if you divorce um it's all for naught because you're not entitled to the land um all the profits from your labor so thinking about today what we've seen since world war ii is and how many remind me how many of you are from farms again a whole bunch of you are from farms lots of you are from farms so you know that since world war ii farms have we've had a lot fewer farms right so peaked in the 1930s so the number of farms have declined but the farms that have remained have become larger and more specialized if you want to be successful today you have to have a pretty large farm that's fairly highly capitalized fairly highly specialized in crops or livestock and so forth what that means is that for anyone who wants to get into farming good luck right if you don't inherit the farm it's almost impossible to get into farming to raise the kind of capital to buy the land what's an acre of land going for now in iowa 8 000 15 so it depends how the quality of the land eight to fifteen thousand dollars an acre okay um so to be able to purchase land the machinery the equipment and so forth almost impossible to get into farming so even for men it's hard so if you want to get into farming you better hope that you were born into a family okay and that you get to inherit it so for men it's hard it's even harder for women okay so i put this up here just to sort of illustrate again there are no laws barring women from inheriting land no laws and if you divorce now it's going to be completely different than what confronted mrs skier okay but there are important social norms which mean that even today daughters are less likely to inherit land than sons are even if they want to inherit it okay so how would you explain that how would you explain it what do you think attributes for this difference in terms of you know how would you explain why boys are more likely to inherit land than girls or sons than daughters how would you explain it well are they just born that way huh i have an older brother yeah and he always helped my dad on the farm and he'll definitely take it over one day so it's just kind of how it fell okay so you have a brother he's like he always helped your dad on the farm and he's likely to take over the family farm it's just the way things go um any other thoughts i feel like boys are more interested in farming earlier than girls okay boys are more is it born that way is it genetic i don't know i just like how they like they just like are more willing to jump in right away and get their hands dirty well like girls especially being your age are more likely to stay inside and stay in the comfort zone ah so girls are likely to stay inside not want to get dirty and boys are just more interested mary i feel like that's going off of that not to feel like the opposite trail but that's just forced into what we're supposed to do like people just assume that we want to stay inside because when i was growing up i wanted to go outside but my uncle would be like no stay inside and play with some barbies or something some barbies that'll help prepare you for i'm not sure what barbies help you prepare for but it's just what society wants to mold us into right yeah i think societal norms um definitely exist for the men too like women are expected to like be indoors and be the nurturers men when they um when they get a baby they're like you're going to take over the farm so you need to come out you need to learn how to operate your machinery you need to learn how to do this and then that social norm definitely plays into them and having the farm later on yeah very nice okay great great comments um and if we look at the research the social science research on this which helps us understand what is it why even today when we think of men and women being equal that we see this discrepancy this gender gap in terms of who's inheriting the land is it really that we're born different is it really simply can we explain that women aren't interested so what you guys articulated is exactly right is we can look at the socialization process and we talked last week about how you know all kinds of people not just our parents but our neighbors our uncles our grandparents television influence you know how we think we should behave what roles we think are appropriate you know whether we should just you know um display more masculine or feminine traits and these are things that again no one tells us we're supposed to do it we learn it we pick it we pick up social cues from our mothers and our fathers and and other people about what we're supposed to behave and maybe if we try and bend those rules we get reprimanded so we look at the family farm we see the power of the socialization where you're exactly right right from the time boys are little um there's just this you know again unspoken assumption but boys are encouraged um to you know get on the equipment learn how to use the equipment play with the machinery engage in productive um farming in a way that women are not and when people look at you know what's one of the biggest obstacles to women getting into farming into taking over land it's machinery okay so if women haven't learned from parents and others you know to be comfortable around machinery to know how to use it you know attach implements fix it okay talk about it you know deal with the smell and everything if you're not familiar with that it can make women both feel inadequate because then they're dependent on men to deal with the equipment and it can make other people not see women as real farmers so machinery is this real barrier between women seeing themselves as farmers and other people seeing themselves as as farmers and is a reflection of the socialization process so the last example i want to talk about in terms of thinking about this agrarian ideology is in terms of farm labor man must toil from sun to sun but a woman's work is never done that's a very old adage we've probably all heard some variant on and so here again we want to think about how is this idea this agrarian idea that the farm and the household should be separate men and roles should be separate how has this contributed to women's invisibility and a gender gap and what we're going to argue what scholars argue based on the research is this idea we've already hinted at it through looking at commercial and talking about the farmer identity is that the problem with this ideology is it doesn't capture women's full contributions which means that we often as a society aren't aware of how women contribute or when we know what they do we don't think that they're actually of the same value as what men contribute on family farms and i put up this quote by fink because i think it's so lovely the magnitude of women's input and its centrality to farm production have not been carefully assessed in a system that used women so fully but evaluated and rewarded them so legally okay so not fully accounting for women's contribution and acknowledging it and rewarding it so we're going to look at two um aspects of this the productive role and the reproductive role so the the productive role is is typically within this ideology what we think of when we're thinking about what happens on the farm so the productive role is you know what we produce the market for home consumption for an income it's the work um that we do that is considered to have some productive value use value exchange value and so forth so if we think about historically what women have contributed on family farms according to jefferson and other proponents of agrarianism women are simply in the home right doing the domestic labors in fact all the research tells us this that is not at all what women have done historically now their roles have changed okay so we can look you know women for long periods of time till the early part of the 20th century were engaged in they were responsible for milking the cows collecting eggs raising chickens it could be for home consumption for the market they were primarily responsible for growing preserving food for the household maybe selling some of it and increasingly as we talked about as farms have become more specialized women's roles have also shifted okay so now you know how many moms are primarily responsible for the bookkeeping and the accounting does anyone have a mom hands up okay so a bunch of you okay so a bunch of you from family farms your mums are primarily responsible for the bookkeeping the accounting that's a role that's strongly associated with women and what we see increasingly today is women's importance in terms of off-farm labor if you look at usda data united states department of agriculture data there's an enormous proportion of family farms that could not sustain themselves without the contribution of off-farm labor of someone in the household or more than one person working off-farm to bring in an income to help sustain the farm business how many of you have someone in your family farm who works off-farm to help bring an income okay so a chunk of you so really important so again we often think of that as separate but the family farm often couldn't survive without that income what's really interesting when we look at how women talk about themselves how other people talk about women is how internalized it is that okay they might be doing this productive labor but it's not really maybe what is their primary job or they should be doing and so the language that gets used used typically talks about women as being more in a supportive role as the helper the helpmate of the farmer and we see this over and over again it's fascinating okay so we see language which is filling in helping doing what needs to be done this is how women and other people talk about women when they're doing productive labor in relation to the family farm so this is uh this is actually from a book that came out this year but here's a photo of a woman operating a tractor it says she's assisting with field work she's not doing field work she's not farming she's not she's assisting okay um this is from sex who i mentioned early did some of the most important groundbreaking work that helped make visible women's actual role on the farm she did a lot of in-depth interviews with women and what was really revealing again was how women talked about themselves so here is a woman saying you know i don't help a lot you know that idea i'm just helping i'm assisting you know just when i'm needed and then she goes on to explain everything she does i care for the calves i bottle feed them every day i carry the milk out also i drive the tractor when he my husband needs me i shovel corn at harvest time during hay making i'm out there every day and sometimes i work in the fields okay so this is just i don't do a lot i'm just helping out um but we can imagine if what would happen if she wasn't contributing okay um she wasn't contributing is this simply helping or is this an essential contribution to sustaining the family farm business so again part of what we try to demonstrate today is that you know how we talk about men and women how we imagine them to be on the family farm have very real material consequences and the example to illustrate this is the united states department of agriculture census which is conducted every five years and it tells us i don't know what everything we need to know about farming but a lot that calls itself the voice of agriculture so the census has been around since 1840 and it tells us who's farming where are they farming how much are they farming what are they farming how much are they earning a lot okay but because women because of the power of this ideology that women didn't actually contribute to the productive side so the usda didn't even bother collecting data on them because it was assumed that they didn't really play an important role so we don't even have to count them they weren't counted till 1978 almost 140 years later how many census were done to understand the full picture of agricultural production but we won't talk about half of that i don't know how many of you have worked for policy makers or commodity groups or researchers to know how important this data is and how widely it's used to develop policy programming extension education education so again if you're thinking we had all this information to develop all these important things but we didn't include women it can lead to those things where again we'll train women how to make butter but not how to care for livestock so women played an important role in terms of productive labor but also reproductive and so um so this is what um again you know agrarians think this is the appropriate role for women this is what they do and this is what they should do they shouldn't be working in productive labor they should be at home raising children cooking cleaning washing and so forth um the point here is that you know women regardless of how much work they had to do on the farm still had to come home and take care of their domestic responsibilities right so it doesn't matter how much you were helping or assisting there were still kids to feed and food to cook and you know beds to make and so forth which this poem illustrates um where this woman is saying when she returned home after working the fields all day her domestic toils incessant play she still had to cook make beds feed the swine men clothes and so forth so people talk about this idea of the second shift there's also this idea of the third shift but the second shift so it doesn't matter how much you've worked all day you still have all these domestic responsibilities awaiting you so the point here is that we know that women do this work we often don't acknowledge how indispensable it is to sustaining the family farm to the success of a family farm we wouldn't have family farms if we we just had men on farms right you actually need families to reproduce the next um family who's going to um um inherit that farm um women's domestic role is also important in terms of um freeing men to do other tasks i don't know whether you picked this up because um paul harvey talked quickly but he has this line about you know the the farmer worked all day in the fields and then he comes and eats supper and then he goes and spends all evening at the school board what doesn't get mentioned comes underneath the supper no mention of who did the shopping or the cooking or the preserving or growing the food or cooking it or doing the dishes who did all the work that allowed you to come into the fields who allowed you to go after the school bed who put the kids to bed and bathe and so forth so again it's not to diminish either people's roles which are both important but to fully acknowledge both of them okay so this idea that women's reproductive work is often undervalued um that it's seen not as work but as natural it's like women you know women just do this automatically you know we're naturally mothers we naturally want to care we naturally want to cook and clean and so forth so what i want to finish up with now um is in this class moving forward we're going to um think about the different ways that this agrarian ideology is is changing has been challenged and is changing and what i want to do is just to think about okay we've been thinking about this history since 1860s what's a historical example of how this agrarian ideology was challenged what's a historical example that shows how women challenged this idea um that you know um women just worked in the household that we didn't contribute anything important that we're not capable of being farmers and so forth so i just wanted to finish up with this as a little bit of fun i think we've all heard of rosie the riveter who is the cultural icon in the us um showing um the important role of women who you know went to work in the factories and the shipyards and so forth when men went off to war and the farm equivalent were the farmerettes and the tractorettes have any of you guys heard of the farmerettes or the direct has anyone heard of them no far no historians in the class okay this would be a fun project i think so in world war one we had the establishment of the women's land army okay um so um this was an initiative to take women from the city or towns or from farms themselves um to work in farm roles okay and they were known as farmerettes okay here's women who shockingly wore pants um which you didn't do in those days who wore pants but learn how to you know drive horses who plowed who harvested who planted and so forth who did the roles um that were necessary in terms of farm production and of course there were all those questions are women strong enough are they capable god won't the smell put them off i mean women don't like getting dirty do they so here are these women challenging those stereotypes about appropriate roles for men and women and the second one is from world war ii um which was the tractorettes um and this was an initiative um that um international harvester was centrally involved in the equipment dealer um and this was an effort again you have men going off to war who's going to produce the food how can we sustain the farm okay so we needed more women to be engaged um in farm work and so this is a whole program um there's these beautiful pictures of classroom outdoor classrooms and so forth but you had dealers go out and train women educate women so women had to learn how to operate machinery attach implements they had to learn how to fix the equipment and of course do different farm work if they weren't um familiar with it so again a nice example um we often assume a lot about what about what we think men and women can do should do and often we continue to think that until something disrupts our thinking and i think these historical examples about what women did in world war one and world war two which we know they're doing all the time within the family farm it's just that the rest of society often doesn't know it because of how we talk about farm families and men and women so how is how are many of these ideals beliefs and stereotypes challenged so just to conclude so what we're trying to argue today is this agrarian ideology um you know you know which has been um with us which jefferson was a powerful proponent of has played a really important role in shaping how we as a society um think about family farms how we as a society think about um the appropriate roles for men and women on those farms how we identify who's a real farmer and implicit in that who's not a real farmer and i put the quote up by brandt because i really like this because i think um it captures what we're trying to say about the agrarian ideology that the way we speak about men and women on farms may not correspond to the way they really are so if you're from a farm and you know what your you know moms dads aunts uncles grandparents and grandmothers know and you'd have a sense of how how problematic this agrarian ideology is that it doesn't accurately reflect um what takes place on a family farm and women's full contribution so again coming back to why does this matter and you know why do we care so we've tried to highlight a couple of examples of where um this ideology has had important social and material consequences okay where women's critical contribution is often invisible or undervalued and that this has had consequences in terms of how the kind of education women might get whether women are expected to take over the farm we can think of other examples that we can talk about later in this semester but things we'll have guest speakers come in and talk about this too that if you're not considered a farmer why would a banker loan you money and what we'll find is that women were discriminated against in terms of getting bank loans because bankers and others didn't see them as real farmers or they didn't have the collateral because their name is not on the bank when we look at farm organizations who's leading them who's organizing them so very real consequences not seeing women as full participants full contributors on family farms has had very real consequences in terms of limiting women's full participation and engagement on farms and of course what we're talking about now is a lot of focuses on we want to we want people to be engaged in agriculture producing food sustaining agricultural systems in the u.s is incredibly important education and one of the most exciting things is we're seeing that increasingly women want to be part of this so what we're going to turn to now and we're going to discuss throughout the semester is what we've seen in this century which is a growing effort by men and women to break down the grass ceiling okay so men as well have been eager to help um have been eager to help um shatter the grass i don't know whether you can shatter a grass ceiling mow the grass ceiling i'm not sure what you would do with the grass ceiling um but address plow okay but plow these um historical and and equities within agriculture and so what we've been seeing and we're going to talk about this now that we have a sense of some of the history under our belt where have we been um we can see the importance of challenging some of the social norms and discourses around family farms and the contributions of men and women and we see men and women challenging that we see women increasingly asserting the identity of farmer that women may be women on your farm it's similar uh women increasingly saying i'm not a farm wife i'm a farmer as well as my husband or my husband works off farm and i'm the farmer so women increasingly asserting the identity uh women increasingly um working to access close the gender gap access the resources they need to be successful farmers and we're also going to see examples of where women are creating new networks and organizations to help them be successful to get the training and the skills they need um to be successful and i think all of this is helping us to increasingly see um women so thank you and we will see you on thursday so so so so so
