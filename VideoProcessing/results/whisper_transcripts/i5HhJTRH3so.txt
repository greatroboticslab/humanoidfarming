Education
 Well, hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for another episode of Two Economists and a Lender, where we take that deep dive into the most important economic issues facing agriculture. I'm your host, Carly Jacobson. We also have David Widmar and Brent Loy again here from Agricultural Economic Insights to analyze those factors that we have to consider when evaluating financing options for a new piece of equipment. As our lender expert today, we get Chris Steinkamp. He's one of our AgDirect Territory managers who often finds himself helping producers with this very question. So we're looking forward to picking his brain today and hearing from him about those real-life scenarios he encounters in his years in the ag financing industry. So, Brent, how about you kick us off? Right. Thanks, Carly. It's great to be back here again this month and talking again about equipment, this time a little bit of a different take on it. Really, how do you, you know, get control of that equipment? Do you lease it or own it? And a decision that I think is pretty commonly faced by most of us that have this equipment. And so we wanted to kind of dig into that a little bit and help you kind of think about, you know, making your own decisions about leasing versus owning. Now, farm machinery is really one of the most important things that we can talk about. We've talked about a couple times. We talked about the equipment and investment and expenses and how to understand what equipment really is costing. You know, we talked about how important that is in your operation because this equipment is going to account for a significant portion of your expenses as a farmer. And just think about it, you know, back to the most common lease arrangement of a 50-50 share lease. So the landowners providing the land, but the farmers expected to provide that equipment as well as the labor. And that equipment is a big, big investment in today's farming. We also talked about insourcing versus outsourcing, i.e. the idea of do we have things custom done versus doing it ourselves? Or do we even do custom work for other people in our May broadcast? So if you want to refresh on those, I think those are good webinars to go back and take a look at. So what we're going to do today is talk a little bit on leasing versus owning as the pros and cons. And I'll be honest, this is one of the, I think, more complex decisions that we can make. And as a professor, you know, I used to get paid to analyze complexity. And that's what we did. And I could take a decision and spend, you know, weeks kind of analyzing it in my spreadsheets and in my office. And, you know, you can really dig into all kinds of facets, but that's not the way most of us do it in the real world. And so what we want to do is help you kind of think through pros and cons, give yourself some things to think about. So when you go to make those decisions, you're more informed about it. And the other thing I think we find with this decision is that there's a lot of decision and inertia with respect to lease versus buy. So, and I, and I know, and I was telling the folks on the webinar yesterday as we were preparing for it, you know, we tend to do what we've done in this particular instance. So if we haven't leased, or maybe we released a long time ago, we tend to have this tendency to say, no, I'm just, I'm a buyer, not a leaser, or I'm a leaser, not a buyer. And I think it's important to kind of evaluate those decisions on a regular basis and not just get stuck into assuming one way is, is better than the other. Because there are times I think when one decision can be better than the others. And that's what we're going to try and help you with today. So let's get started with a simple question, which is which statement best describes you? I currently lease farm machinery. I've leased farm machinery in the past. And I've never leased farm machinery. And I have a good feel for what the answer to this is going to be. And as I think about it. And Brent, I tried to cheat, I tried to Google to see what the answer was. And I couldn't find a good answer to this either. So I'm looking forward to the results here. 70% responded, they have never leased farm machinery. 11% said they currently do. And another 20% have leased machinery, farm machinery in the past. So I didn't know what to expect there. So I appreciate everyone participating in this. I want to talk a little bit about some things that we need to think about with respect to evaluating the leases. And these are three considerations that we can compare on the ownership side of the equation, but also the leasing. And the first one is the ownership costs. And think back to that webinar we did a year ago, where we talked about the dirty five. And so it's depreciation, economic depreciation, the interest, repairs, taxes, and insurance. And that's the actual expense of owning that and using that piece of machinery. In this example, a tractor. And one of the challenges with this is we don't actually know what the economic depreciation is until we actually sell the tractor or we park it in the hedgerow. And so we really have to think carefully about that. We can make some assumptions, but there's ownership costs. How much does it cost for me to operate this machine on an hour basis or an acre basis or in just total dollars? Now, what's really important to keep in mind, this is going to seem simple, but it's really key, but subtle point is when you buy a piece of farm machinery, you buy the right to that machinery forever in perpetuity. And so you have to pay for the entire asset upfront. And where that comes in to be important is on the cashflow side of things. So let's say for the sake of debating it, we're, or the sake of this presentation, we're financing it. It's a straight up finance. And we got four to five years worth of terms. We just bought this entire tractor that we can use from, for now and for the rest of our lives. But now we got to finance that over a much shorter timeframe, maybe four to five years. And oh, by the way, we have to have a down payment here at the, at the closing. And so there's a mismatch between the life that we might use this tractor. And when we need to actually cashflow the service of that. The second, the third point here that we got to keep in the back of our mind, the third metric got to keep in the back of our mind is the tax expense. These are the depreciation we're most familiar with. This is the tax depreciation. And you know, how can we write off that expense of that asset? Well, you're going to want to talk to your accountant. We're going to say that a lot in this presentation, but there's a range here again, another mismatch potentially where we can section 179, all or most of that expense in the first year, or we can spread that out over maybe five years with some accelerated depreciation. And so when we, the ownership, the thing to keep in mind with ownership is the actual cost of owning that asset can be very different than the financing cashflow obligations and then the tax component. So we're going to set up some pros and cons here. I'm going to take the easy side of the column, the pros, and then let Brent talk about some of the harder side of the equation. One of the big pros from ownership is that last part on the taxes, it's the depreciation and tax planning. If we're getting close to the end of the year, you know, you want to make an investment in a piece of equipment, you can make that piece, that investment, and you have the flexibility to maybe accelerate some of that depreciation to offset some of that income. That's a great tax planning tool. The second point here is the opportunity to accrue equity. So when we talked about before that mismatch between the financing or the cashflow and the ownership, it's going to be sort of a quick way to force us to pay off that equipment or service that debt faster than what we might actually use up the economic depreciation. And so that gives us a potential at the end of servicing the loan that there's still some equity in that piece of machinery. And that's sort of kind of a savings account type thing going on. And the third point here is flexibility on the usage and life cycle. When you buy that asset, you can sell it a few years down the road, but it's easy for you to increase the number of hours you put on in a year or easy for you to use it a few more years to get, as my dad would say, get all the goodie out of it. And so you have some flexibility here and how much you use it and for how long you use it. Again, that's with buying this asset and having the right to use it for as long as it runs or as you choose to use it. So Brent, you want to talk about some of the cons here? Sure. And I think you set up one of them already. There's this mismatch between usage and financial obligations. And the idea here again is, you know, you're going to buy, you know, you go buy a tractor today, that's got a long potential life on it. You're probably not going to use all of that in the next, all of the value of that in the next five years, but you have to pay for all of it. So that is a kind of a little bit of a mismatch there in terms of, you know, what you've got to put out for what you're using, because at the end of the day, you know, we're buying equipment to serve a purpose on our farm, to till the soil or plant the corn or soybeans or whatever it might be. The other con is there's, you know, there's some uncertainty about the salvage value. And as the owner of it, you have all of that risk as the owner of what the salvage value might be. And in other words, what it's worth by the time you want to get rid of it, that risk is yours. And it can vary depending upon economic conditions at the time you decide to get rid of it. So there's, there's some unknown there that, that provides you some uncertainty. So that's maybe a couple of the cons on, on the ownership side. Going back to the framework we set up earlier, let's use the same framework. And now let's apply what this looks like in a leasing arrangement. Okay. So the ownership cost. Now we're not in a leasing scenario. It's, it's different. We are paying for the right to use a machine for a very specific amount of time, maybe specific, a number of hours over a specific number of years. And so all this sort of right off the bat, this idea of holding onto it for forever is off the table. So that changes the calculus a little bit. So we talked about earlier that ownership costs. I really encourage you to go watch that previous episode. And one thing to take away from this is economic depreciation and interest is, is not part of this, this ownership cost equation on the leasing side. We still have repairs, taxes, and insurance, but now we have lease payments. And so we're sort of substituting those on the ownership cost. Now for the cashflow, it now lines up again, right? We're have three to five years of, of using it. And we need to service that over that three to five year time horizon. So the cashflow start to line up. And finally, the tax expense, again, you're going to want to consult with your accountant on this before signing on the dotted line. But if the lease payments are a tax expense and allowable expense, that's going to be able to line up with the years that you're using, that it's going to offset that cashflow that you have to outlay. But again, you're going to want to consult your accountant on that. So again, on the pros and cons list, we think this is a helpful tool to weigh benefits. Not everything here has the same weight. Okay. But we're going to lay these out and we'll let you start put the weights as to how they, they play out in your decision-making on the pros, as we talked about earlier, is that improved cashflow. Okay. So not only did we talk about that, that it lined up, but also the cashflow can be considerably improved when we're not trying to finance the entire assets value in a short window. We're only cash flowing five years of that use or five years of that economic depreciation. The second part is the limited balance sheet demands. We might not need to make such a big down payment up front at the beginning of a lease. We're not having to carry the entire value of that piece of equipment as a liability on our balance sheet. And so there's some opportunities to free up working capital, but also some of this intermediate term debt as well with a lease. And in terms of the cons, there's this kind of idea that there is potential for some confusion and fear of surprises. What happens if I turn that equipment back in and there's some major repairs that need to be made? How, how much might that be? Some questions about, you know, just how this is going to work out. And I think the taxation issue is another one where, you know, we've said it multiple times, keep in mind, there are some gray areas. You really need to talk to your accountant about how this lease is going to be handled in terms of expensing the payments. The other kind of con is that while it's, it's a con that we have to buy that whole piece of equipment that we're not going to use all of it up in five years, the advantage is that we get to write that whole thing off. And so there's some present value tax savings that we got to expense off part of piece of equipment that we're, you know, we're not going to wear out completely during our operation. So you kind of missed out on the ability to do that. And then this question about equity building, which again, I think we have a question mark is sometimes this view is a really a negative view on leasing. And it's kind of a gray area, I think, because we don't know exactly how much equity are going to build with the purchase as well, because we have that residual value risk. So what we're not doing is we're not forcing savings into the farm operation like we are, I like to think of as almost forced savings on the purchase, because you're, you're, you're putting aside money into that piece of equipment, storing it there for parts that you aren't going to use. So it's a way to kind of build some savings. But on this side, you don't have to do that. So that can either be a pro or a con, I think, as to how you think about it. A couple of things we want to talk specifically about the leases before we wrap this up is not all leases are created equal. And we're going to touch on this quickly here, but there are capital leases and they're operating leases. And there's different implications for the tax side of it. And you're going to always want to consult with your accountant. In fact, it's going to be probably common that you're going to go to your accountant, you're going to share some things that you're thinking about, you know, I'm thinking about this lease, and they're going to ask you some questions. You might have to go back and ask that dealer or that financing partner some to provide some details to your accountant. So just keep that in your back of your mind, they're going to be wondering, is it a capital lease or an operating lease? And the second question to keep in mind, when you're thinking about this is what happens at the end of the lease term? Do you have the option to turn back or walk away from that piece of equipment? Or is it the expectation that you need to purchase that equipment? So keep these questions in mind, these are going to be the ones you want to do some additional homework on. Brent and I are going to walk through sort of some tips for evaluating the situation, but then also a little bit of a checklist. And before we get into that, I want to mention that leases are another financial tool. And just like any tool in your toolbox, we have to make sure that you as the user are using it appropriately, but then also we're using it in the right situation. And that's what we want to talk about here is the situations. Is this a good fit for my operation? And the answer will be different across farms. So even if two people walk into the dealership and they have the exact same set of information and they walk through everything we talked about up to this point, they might split here based on if you're a beginning producer, that could be, at least could be an appealing option for you because of cashflow or an equity situation, not enough equity. If you're looking for rapid growth, leases could be an option for you. And transition or succession planning, or maybe there's a cashflow or a budget sheet challenge, leases might be a little more attractive. The second point here is step back and think about the business climate. What's tax policy looking like towards depreciation? As Brent talked about, one of the advantages is maybe accelerated depreciation or section 179. Well, there are times in history when 179 isn't as, the allowance isn't as big or section 179 is really not even an option at all. And so we got to think about that when depreciation is less allowable, then leases start to be a little more favorable. Think about the farm economy. Think about manufacturer programs that might be in place as well. Sometimes these tip the scales in the lease, in leases favor or in not leases favor, depending on how things are going. I can guarantee you if equipment's flying off the lot, it's going to be a little hard to see a manufacturer program come in to make these leases a little more attractive. Last slide here before we get to Chris is a checklist. So these are some things that you should think about for yourself is what type of financing am I considering? What are the tax implications? What happens at the end of that lease? And also what are the financial trade-offs as we talked about above? What are your tax total expenses? What are your cash flows? And what are the balance sheet considerations? And the third point is how does this fit in my overall goals as my operation? You always got to keep that in consideration as well. And the last thing I like to keep in mind is if you only focus on one thing and you only look at one metric, you can always talk yourself into the conclusion that you want to go to. So here's a scenario where you're going to be able to say on one hand, these are the reasons why I would do it. And on the other hand, these are the reasons why I would do it. And we always have to be looking at both of those hands and weighing the difference and recognizing that in some environments with different sets of information, we might tip the scales or tip our decision into a different direction. Yeah. And I think that's the most important thing here is you want to evaluate your options. I mean, we have options and I think it's good business practice to evaluate those various options and come back to those decisions at different points in time. And just because we decided one thing one time, it doesn't necessarily mean that that's going to be the best way going forward. And if you've ever heard us talk before, I mean, one of the things we like to talk about is let's get out a piece of paper, write down some of those pros and cons, some of the things you thought about, file it with your leasing decision file in your file cabinet. And the next time you come to do it, pull that thing back out and start thinking about it and has anything changed. And I think that that's a helpful way to help you get organized and think about, you know, making the right decision. All right. So now we're going to get Chris patched in. Chris, you're the lending expert this month. Thank you so much for joining us today, but also helping us prepare. As Brent and I were preparing for this, we were saying this is one of the hardest topics that we've tried to cover in this broadcast series. And so you've really helped us think about that a lot. So thank you and welcome. You bet. Thanks for inviting me today. Glad to be here. So you work with AgDirect. So tell us a little bit about yourself and that program. Okay. Yeah. So I'm an AgDirect territory manager. I cover about half the state of Iowa. And my main job role is I work with the equipment dealers in my area, promoting the AgDirect product to their end customers. For those of you who don't know much about AgDirect, AgDirect is a financing and leasing program offered by participating dealerships. So we're hooked up with about 2,200 dealer ownership groups across the United States. And within that 2,200 dealer ownership groups, there's over 4,500 dealer locations where AgDirect is offered. So our main focus is working with equipment dealers to focus on their financing and leasing needs for their end customers. But we also offer financing and leasing options on customers that are buying via the private party and auction channels as well. So we can kind of become your one-stop shop for all your equipment financing or leasing needs. I have one question to kick this off that I always find interesting to think about is if you're in an elevator riding up to the 12th floor of a hotel, assuming it's not a pandemic, and a producer says, hey, I'm thinking about the, you work with AgDirect. I was thinking about this new tractor and I got a lease versus a purchase decision on my hand. What should I do? And what are the two or three points that you want to make sure that they capture in that elevator pitch ride? Yep. So we hit a lot of pros and cons of ownership versus leasing earlier in the presentation. But I think two that really drive home the point is comparing the cash flow side, the payments, how the cash flow of the lease versus a loan would work and how it affects your financial statement. And then also the tax implications. There might be some benefits to doing a loan with all the depreciation that's out there right now. There could be some benefits of leasing from a tax perspective. So, you know, recently with the large amount of depreciation that's been out there, leasing from a tax perspective, you know, probably hasn't been that favorable, but there are certain situations producers need to look at where that might be the case. They may need to entertain the lease from a tax perspective. You really opened my eyes to this idea of how sometimes the tax code could impact this decision-making process a whole lot. I want to switch gears here just a little bit. And you've helped put together a little bit of a scenario that producers might see when they're going through this decision. So I want to flip the slide here and I'd like for you to walk us through how this decision might be presented as they're looking at this purchase versus lease decision. Yeah. So what we put together here, I mean, this is a hypothetical example just to kind of put some numbers behind all the stuff that we're talking about here. But this is a used John Deere row crop tractor, currently less than 880 hours on it. We're looking at some lease options versus loan options. So if you look there, we've got a walkway option lease and also a lease to own. So if we focus on the five-year walkway option lease, that's a $300 per year lease. And if you look at the payments and you get to the residual on that walkway option lease, you have the option at the end of that lease to either turn that tractor back to AgDirect. You can refinance it. You can look to renew the lease. So you do have the, you've got a lot of options there at the end. You can turn it back if you want to. Then if we go move over to the right, the five-year lease to own, that's the type of lease. When you get to the end of that lease, you don't have the option to turn it back. So essentially you need to buy that tractor, refinance it, trade it, or renew the lease. The option to hand it back to AgDirect isn't on the table. And then down at the bottom there, we compared a five-year loan with a 20% down payment. So the whole gist of this is to look at the payment differences across these different options and how it can affect your decision to either buy or lease a piece of equipment and also how it can affect your financial position from a working capital and also a cash flow need position. It's a great way to think about the information that producers are going to think about. And it's sort of a starting point, right? This is talking a lot about the cash flow and some of the details that you mentioned between the walkaway versus the lease to own. But this is sort of the first level of information. Then we got to walk through all the other stuff in the checklist that we talked about. And as you can see, there's a pretty big difference. And if you just take one year, right? 2022, there's a pretty big difference in those numbers. And we got to think about those and then think about how that fits in with the bigger context of that whole decision. I was just going to point out, so as you look at those, you've got a little bit higher payments on this because you have the option to walk away from that lease and plus the residual value will be less, right, Chris? And over here, we're purchasing that tractor at the end, but we've got more left to pay for. Whereas down here on the outright purchase, we're paying that whole $250,000 out over those five years. And then at the end, there's no more obligations. And the other benefit to lease from a payment perspective is like that five-year lease to own, if you have the option, we can raise payments and lower residuals all day long. So if you have a situation where you want a $30,000 a year payment on that tractor, we could probably set that payment where you need it back into that buyout. It gives us a little bit more flexibility in just a standard five-year loan when you're just kind of stuck with however that amortizes out. So from a payment perspective, leases can give us some flexibility to help meet your needs. So I'm going to switch back gears here. And let's talk a little bit about a few potential pitfalls that producers might need to watch out for. So we showed this first piece, okay, and we've mentioned some of these, but what are a few other pitfalls that producers are going to want to ask questions about as they're thinking about this option? The example we showed there before, we had a walkaway option lease and a lease to own. So going into a lease, you'll want to know for sure that the type of lease that you're getting, because at the end of the day, you don't want to think you have a walkaway option lease and get to the end of that buyout and come to find out it's a lease to own. So definitely clarifying that up front. If you are looking at a walkaway lease, the hour limitations will come into play. So make sure that if you're looking at a 300-hour-per-year lease, you have enough hours-per-year usage on that lease to accommodate your needs. Then also, if you might go over, also know what the over-hourage charges that would occur at the end of the lease if you would turn it back. And then another thing is also knowing what the return clauses are if you do a walkaway option lease. So if you get to the end of that lease, you got to have a good feel to know what kind of condition that tractor or that asset needs to be in when you turn it back to the leasing company so that there's no surprises of getting some excess use charges and things like that coming back at you. Yeah, we're starting to see some questions come in. And one of the questions is about, do you recognize the lease payment as a payable on the balance sheet? And I can give an answer from an economist's perspective. Maybe, Chris, you want to address that in terms of the farm credit perspective or not. I think generally, we try and recognize if you have obligations, the idea of a balance sheet is to show what you actually are on the hook for. So I would think it probably goes on there. Yeah, I think it depends on the lender. But I would say most of them probably put that on as a current liability somewhere in that section. Yeah. And the way to offset that is it's often shown as an asset. And I believe that's the way FCSA is showing that on their financial statements. So we usually show both sides of that. But it's a good question, right? I think that's the key here is this is a question that we need to be talking about and asking about and have that conversation with your accountant or your lender in this case to really understand that. So that's a great question. And you're going to have to really get into the weeds a little bit to find the best fit for you. Do leases allow for the repairs of the asset to be paid by the leasing company if it's no longer under warranty? I can jump in on that one. So my experience is I haven't seen many lease companies that have offered that type of option. A lot of times it falls back on the warranty that the manufacturer has or if it's a used piece of equipment, you know, some sort of warranty that the dealer added into the cost when they when they sold that that piece of equipment. But, you know, to answer the question, I very rarely see a leasing company that is going to handle eating all the repairs or other costs associated with with those things during the lease. Yeah, I think I think that would be hard to find to get somebody to take that risk. Because if you just think about it, you know, I might know you're super trustworthy, but but when you have to put that offering out there in the entire marketplace, they'd be taking an awful lot of risk doing it doing a deal like that. So here's a good one. Any thoughts around leasing bins and machine sheds pros and cons? Yeah, there's within within Farm Credit Service America in our in our partnership with Farm Credit leasing, we actually we do a lot of grain bins and buildings. I'm not on that side of the business. I'm more on the equipment side, but know a little bit about that. So with with the depreciation schedules that sometimes bins and buildings fall into, they're anywhere from could be 10 to 20 to 30 years depending on their use. Leasing those is a way to kind of help speed up your write off by writing off those payments versus depreciating that asset. So there there is some benefits to the leasing the grain bins and machine sheds depending on the type of use and how they're classified for depreciation. Chris, those would usually be lease to own type of leases, correct? Yeah, a lot of those are yeah, they are. They are structured as lease to owns. Had a total loss claim on a combine 10 years from retirement is now a good time to consider leasing a machine. Also doesn't the low current interest rates make leasing less attractive? So I'll start by saying, you know, kind of one of the things we're trying to convey today is that we think when it comes to ownership of the asset and control of the asset, you have two options, lease and own. It's usually a good practice to consider those and not just assume that one's better than the other. So I think the first part of that is, is it a good time to consider leasing? I think yeah, it probably is a good time to consider leasing a machine from that perspective, at least go through kind of the pros and cons and the numbers of doing it. In terms of the interest rates, I don't know that the low interest rates make leasing necessarily unattractive per se. Low interest rates are going to cut the interest portion of ownership payment, but you still have to pay the principal portion, which is a significant portion. Like when we look at that last example, Chris had, you know, those payments are large and that's mostly principal payments that are coming through. So, yeah. So, I mean, there's a lot of folks forget that there is a cost of funds on leases as well. And I know loan rates are as low as ever. So are lease rates right now. So they're basically kind of pretty comparable, one and the same, you know, depending on this fellow situation, you know, 10 years from retirement, it probably depends on what type of combine that he wants to go with. If he wants to go with the newer one, it might make sense to lease that for five years to help with the cashflow and look at maybe putting it on a loan for five years after that to help spread that thing out. But yeah, get him into a newer asset where he doesn't have to worry about repair costs and stuff as much up front. Yeah. I think it really, you know, it's kind of, kind of depend on your situation, your finances, all of that kind of stuff when it comes down to it. And that's a good point about the leasing, because if you think about what's going on, somebody else is buying that piece of equipment and loaning it to you. So they've got to fund that purchase. And so there's, they're charging you for that capital as part of that process of doing, you know, the lease. Moving on, does it make sense to lease a particular piece of equipment that's only used one to three months out of the year, like a combine versus a tractor that's potentially used 12 months out of the year? The amount of use, I think, I don't, I don't know if that reasoning by itself is enough to kind of tip the scales one way or the other. I think one of the things you want to look at with the lease is, you know, how, how many hours are you going to use it? What, what is it costing you to use that piece of equipment per hour, as well as what do you think the resale value is going to be of that equipment? And if you're, if you're buying the whole piece of equipment, you're going to have to put in a lot of money to buy that residual value. Do you, how do you feel about that residual value? What do you think the, how well do you think that residual value is going to hold up? Because as we talked about, that's one of the risks you take with, with the machinery ownership. I'm not necessarily sure that that one to three versus 12 months is main driver, but maybe I'm missing something, Chris. Yeah, I think it boils down. I agree with you. It's not so much, you know, how many months out of the year you're using it, but I think it boils down to financially, you know, if you're looking at cost per hour, cost per acre, that's probably maybe the angle more you need to look at versus I'm just using this thing three, you know, three months out of the year or 12 months. I think it's more, more of a financial decision and, and your bottom line and how that affects you. One of the reasons why that question might be relevant is because we probably have a pretty predictable number of hours we're going to put on a combine, right? You, you, you could probably sit back in, in, in January, 2021 and say, I'm going to put X hours on a combine. If you reevaluated that, you're going to be probably pretty accurate. So that might set itself up to be a little more attractive on a lease. Now let's think about the tractors. There's some tractors you can probably predict pretty well, how many hours you're going to use, but if it's the tractor, that's got the front end loader on it, that you starting almost every day, it's sort of the tractor that you're always using. Right. And that's where that, maybe that ownership has that flexibility, right? You can, you buy the right to use that for as long as you want to use it. And so part of this is recognizing that we use these assets differently and that tool, that leasing tool is going to have different appeal based on how we might use the various assets in our portfolio. And I, and I think one of the things that maybe we're, we're hinting around, maybe we haven't said as explicitly is the leasing versus owning can maybe in some cases open up different possibilities to you. So in other words, if your cashflow is a little tight, leasing might open up the option that you could buy that newer piece of equipment that if you had to buy it outright would not be possible. And so I think it, it kind of changes your potential decision set. You might be comparing leasing a newer piece of machinery to owning an older piece of machinery. And then that, that kind of changes your, your decision making a little bit. And so that's one of the things I think leasing can do is open up the set of alternatives for you a little bit. So Chris, I have two questions for you that I want to make sure we get to. The first one was, uh, leases get a bad reputation, uh, in my observation. What are your thoughts on that? Yeah, I, you're right. I mean, perception wise, uh, you know, when I talk to a producer, you know, about leases, you know, it's kind of funny every time it gets brought up. A lot of times first word out of their mouth is I don't want to lease. And then if you get them to elaborate a little more, you know, it's, it's kind of funny. It comes back to, they had a bad leasing experience on something outside of a piece of equipment. What I hear a lot of is, you know, they've got a bad taste in their mouth for leasing because of car leases that, you know, when they came out in the late eighties and early nineties, you know, people jumped on them and then felt they got taken advantage of somewhere throughout the lease, either when they turned it back or, uh, you know, it goes back for, you know, knowing your return clauses, uh, going into a lease and what to expect. So I think leasing gets a bad rap from some of that, or, you know, somebody leasing a copy printer, uh, you know, there's folks that do that and they've had a bad experience. So to hear the word lease and it's stigma that, oh man, I got burned. I don't want to do anything with that. You know, leases are bad, but at the end of the day, if you break them down and really get them to understand that, you know, leasing equipment, you know, it's, it's more straightforward and, and, uh, a lot more upfront than leasing some of the other stuff that have burned people in the past. Yeah. It's another tool in the toolbox. I think we want to just kind of remember is there as opposed to just writing it off out of hand. Chris, one last question. And I think that might be the end of our questions is the question I ask everyone. If you could give one piece of advice to producers, put it on a nice big billboard. Here we are November, 2020. What's that piece of advice you would want producers to think about today? I'm assuming most folks on this webinar are egg related for the most part. We've all heard the slogan got milk. You've seen the billboards got milk. Well, when it comes to leasing and owning, you got options is the billboard I'd put out there because there are a lot of options. And I think producers need to know what those options are every time they make the equipment buying or leasing decision so they can see all the options. So if I really had to hone in on something, a takeaway for people or a billboard is just to know that you've got options and to know what those options are. That'll do it for another episode of Two Economists and a Lender. Thank you to Brent, David and Chris for leading today's conversation. And for you in the audience, thanks for joining us. We look forward to seeing you online again next month. Bye everybody.
