 Hey everyone, my name is Josh Jennings and I'm a sales associate here at B&S Enterprises. B&S Enterprises is a family owned and operated full line Case IH equipment dealership. With various brands, B&S sells Yamaha for all your subcompact and compact tractor needs. Great Plains, Macdon, Gearenhof, Rhino and Bushhawk. B&S also has a lawn and garden department where we sell Cub Cadet mowers and Echo Power equipment. With three convenient locations, B&S is able to service all of Northeastern North Carolina as well as Southeastern Virginia. Our locations include Elizabeth City, North Carolina, Wilson, North Carolina and Sunbury, North Carolina. Here at B&S we have a rich family history where we were formed in 1969 by Bradley and Sam Jennings, two brothers who opened a farm equipment repair shop and decided to become a full line Alice Chamberlain dealer in 1975. And remained one until 1985 when Alice Chamberlain was bought out by the Dorts Alice Company. From 1985 to 1988, B&S sold Dorts Alice equipment and then later cut ties to Dorts Alice and became a full line Case IH dealership, which we remain today. Here at B&S family is important to us for we are three generations strong. The son of Bradley Stewart and the son of Sam Bryan are now the owners and operators of the company. Myself, the son of Stewart Joshua and the daughter of Bryan Bryan are also involved into the daily operations of the company. As Bradley and Sam used to always say, there's no job too big and there's no favor too small. Here at B&S we strive to keep that motto alive by providing excellent service and customer satisfaction.
