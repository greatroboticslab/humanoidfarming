Gaming
 For many years this has been Josh's daily game. But then one flashbang to the face. It's Farming Simulator 22. Hey, you. Finally awake. Hello. Aww, that's much better. Oh good. There's another question mark over here. If that was a help menu then I don't know what this one is. The help menu but over here. Yeah, it actually is the help menu but over here. Making money. No, I'm pretty sure it's just the help menu. Yeah. Okay. Well, we're going to need that layer. We definitely need help. Oh, create a farm. Here we go. That will be a start. Yeah, let's pick a farm. What should we call it? Uh... Um... What's the farm in Clarkson's farm called? I don't know. Diddly Squaw. Diddly Squaw. Squidly Dot, yeah. Squiggly Dot. Squiggly Dot. Squiggly Dot. What do we want? A tractor? Has like a logo. A barn. A chainsaw. A bull. A horse. A pig. A sheep. A chicken. Uh... Chicken. Chicken. Okay. And then have no chickens. Yeah. It's just to confuse everyone. Yeah. So they go in and they think, where's the chickens? There we go. We've got one thousand... We've got one million... One... One... One... A lot. A lot. Right, so we've bought a farm. Got one and a half mil to spend. Is there a shop? This is our map. Is there a shop? It really is a big jump. I can jump your entire height. That's funny. This grass is owned by Patrick. Who the fuck is Patrick? I don't know. Because for 24 years I've been living next door to... Patrick. Patrick. Oh the fuck is Patrick. Is he like our neighbour? Maybe, yeah. Is that him over there? Oh it could be, yeah. It seems so. Oh he can borrow five grand as well. Oh he can borrow five grand as well. Oh he can borrow five grand as well. Oh he can borrow five grand as well. Oh he can borrow five grand as well. We'll just do. Have I done? That really helped. On top of our one and a half million. Probably ought to buy a vehicle. Probably a... Star isn't it? Or are we... I mean what kind of farm are we gonna be... I don't even know. Is it all about crops? Or can you have like... I don't know. I just got it because it was free. Well yeah, same. Let's buy a tractor and piss about it. Should we go to the one over here or the one over there? That's jump. That's... Ooh. I can... Why can we crouch? What is the purpose? Stealth. Stealth farming. This out menu is not gonna know what hit it is. We should get some chickens or something. That would probably be a reasonable start. Chicken just to start. Why not? It normally is to be fair. Lots of people have them in their gardens and stuff don't they? They just need to provide food for them and then they create... Money. Money. Vehicle shop. Can I put a waypoint? No. Shall I just buy a car and... Yeah? That would be easy. You could use that five grand. We can use that five grand. We can... We can use that five grand. We can use that five grand. We can use that five grand. Yeah. We can use that five grand. So we should get some chicken or something. We should get some chicken or something. That would probably be a reasonable start. Chicken just to start. Why not? It normally is to be fair. Lots of people have them in their gardens and stuff don't they? They just need to provide food for them and then they create... Money. Money. Vehicle shop. Can I put a waypoint? No. Shall I just buy a car and... Yeah? That would be easier to buy a car and... That would be easier to buy. We could use that five grand. We could get like a golf buggy. Oh yeah. That's a start, isn't it? Or like a pickup. Errr... The pickup is 45,000. The... Buggy thing is 17,000. Oh, I may as well go for the pickup then. Alright. Oh, we can customize it. Oh. Imagine we have to walk there then. Yeah. Let's get going. Reset way, please. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Can we set waypoints? Nope. I'm not sure what a try. Brilliant. And these are the train tracks. Oh, it's... Oh, it's a river. Well... It is hoping we can swim then, eh? I can't imagine this game without drowning. Oh yeah, we can swim. I can't... Yeah, I can't imagine you can die. We'd find a way. I mean, I imagine the jump length in this, that you can jump that river. Right, it is the train station. Oh, I found a... Fucking hell. Light speed mode. Oh, sorry. Turns out there's traffic in this. It's a nice little village to be honest. There we go. This looks like a car shop. I think it adds to its charm. Right, let's... shop. Oh, here we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. All it's trying to rescue out? Maybe. It can take a more使いたい park dig into this. It brings it out to the park dig into the dochmer. It's a nice little village to win us. Hmm. There we go. Shop. Oh, here we go. Their first job was simple. All they had to do was get the equipment back to the farm. But what they didn't know was that in this game, everything drives like disappointment and helium. Why am I in the... Oh, look at it. Look at this. How do I... Oh, my God. That's incredible. I do not know. How do you accelerate? It's W. Oh, yeah. None of the buttons that I've tried so far can make you back today. What are you doing again? I don't know. The controller level. Oh, yay. Oh, my God. The controller level. Let's just go over the hedge. Oh, wait. This isn't the way we came. Oh, my God. This is... We're lost. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Okay. Oh, my God. Steering, this is terrible. No. Steering is so sensitive. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh. Well... I'm good. I'll see you there. Back at the farm, Alex had a vision. Animal dealer. You don't have any... Oh, yeah. We need an animal. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's a way to... That'll be... Yeah. That's a way to... Live first and then... And then get out there again. Rooster is apparently not necessary for reproduction. They just form eggs themselves. That's an interesting grasp of biology there. Or chicken pasture for 6,000. May as well go all in with the poop. Yeah. But then there was a tiny problem, to the tune of 331,000 pounds. Land is not owned by... What do you mean land is not owned by you? Oh. Well, is it... What's this fucking land then? It's just off. Oh. Do we have to buy land? No. Surely not. Oh, it seems this isn't actually a plot you can buy. Brilliant. Well, why start us here then? It's alone. Oh, I'm off. Oh. Oh. Stop. Can't see. There's cruise control. I can just see you in the background. How to... Plant trees, but not how to buy a farm. Let me Google it. Farming... Simulator... Land is not owned... Land... I... I... U. So, I think we're on plot 43? Yeah, I just can't work out what to do from there. Well, here we go. Space. To buy. Buy... Buy land. What do we want this one? Uh... I mean, we're here. We are here. Okay. It's 330 grand. Ooh. Yeah, that's a bit... Okay, well, we've bought it now. Yeah, we've bought it now. Let me get a chicken coop, then. Okay. There is evidence of your dangerous driving here. Me? Yeah, the tyre marks. Oh my god. Yeah. Oh, pressing tab just puts you in the nearest... Ooh. Oh. How many chickens do we want, then? Um... Oh, I don't know. I think we need a rooster, don't we? What's this? Yeah, definitely need a rooster. Oh, hang on, wait. Before we get chickens, should we make sure... Wait, is this food? I'm guessing you have to... Oh yeah, let's get some food. If... If you can't, we're going badly... Completely the wrong way. Hmm. Yeah. Oh. That's not the button, is it? What's the button to go into the shop thing? Oh my god, I've just spent... Oh my god. Okay. Okay. Um... You must buy... Buy grain from... There is a supermarket. I wonder if they'll have... Chicken food. Shall we head off to the supermarket, then? Let's go to the supermarket. Where's my car gone? I'll let you drive. Oh, no. I won't let you drive. I'll drive. I'll drive. Why can't I... What's the button to get in? Oh, that's it. One man vehicle. Right, I'll jump in the... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... No... No? I did... I did find it right that way. Right. Okay. I'll drive a new tractor, then. Okay. River, river, river, river. Wow. Thank god the brakes are like... Can I drive through it? You can. Weirdly. No, I think the supermarket was next to the car shop. Would have been good to find out where it is before we left. I think it's here, isn't it? Is this... Oh, no. This is a petrol station. It says shop on it. Has it got chicken food? Yeah. It does. Popped down the garage. It's a great. Chicken. Yeah. Popped to the offbeat. It's now stopped blinking. I can't remember where it was. I think it's this way. Oh. I'm mounted. Oh, yeah, it is. It is. Oh, my god. I particularly love this clicking through the road signs. That's my favourite detail. So, is this the shop? Looks like a shop. I'm going to reverse the line. Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get into a space. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. There we go. That'll do. Oh, I'm not even in the space. I can't go any further back. Oh, yeah, I can. Oh. Thank you. Here we go. Expertly parked. Yeah. Go get that parked. It's a BMW truck. Right, let's try and... Look at the wedge it. Oh, god. OK. There we go. Yes. How do we get in? Er... Sure? Like, the door is just... walled off on the other side. Imagine it isn't actually a supermarket. Well, there's not even a men... I thought the menu would be at the door. Yeah. Silly me, I guess. Maybe it's just like a place you sell to, rather than a place you sell. Maybe, yeah, there's... Oh yeah, that's fertilizer and sugar cane and stuff. Seeds, wheat... Let me remind myself of what we actually need. Oh, here we go. It's wheat. Chicken feed. Oh, that sounds chickeny. Chicken feed does sound a bit chickeny. Wheat barley sorghum, yeah. It's also got a chicken on the front. So I trust it. Oh, fresh wheat to feed your chickens with. Okay, so it's like Minecraft. Okay, let's get... I can customize the bag of chicken feed. As to what? We're gonna buy us eight bags. That sounds like enough for the time being. You can fetch your purchases at the shop. We're at the shop. We are at the shop? Where's my chicken feed? Oh, yeah, the actual chicken feed shop, though. Oh... Oh, would it... Oh, would it... Oh, it'd be at the vehicle shop. Right? Oh, yeah, yeah. Oh, fuck. Oh. Oh, you're alright. Oh, you're alright. Right. Off we go, then. I love all some games have bad physics, and then this game just decided to not have any. But what they didn't realize was that each one was roughly the size of a small bungalow. There's my chicken feed. Oh, they're massive bags! I thought... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. This is never gonna... Oh, my God. We have to do, like, runs. How do I... Objects too heavy? Well... Oh, do we need a little fault there? Oh, no. I'll buy a fault there. Oh, my God. They have physics on the bags, but nothing else. Yeah, I don't think that's gonna do it. Alright, I'll get a fault there. I thought they were, like, piddly little carrier bags. Oh, well, these chickens are gonna be well-fuckin-fed, aren't they? Oh, you leased it. Fair enough. Oh, you leased it. Fair enough. Right, I don't think... I don't know what I'm doing. Okay. Well, it's not that, is it? I'm just... I'm just... I'm just... I'm just... Uh... Is that as low as it gets? There's... There's gotta be a control here somewhere. Let me, uh... Oh, my God. Front motor. Vehicle. Lower hydraulic hitch. That sounds... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Front motor. Vehicle. Lower hydraulic hitch. That sounds... Oh, my God. Eeeeh... Oh, my God. Ok. Front motor. Front motor. Vehicle. Lower hydraulic hitch. That sounds... Oh? There we go. I can see how far I'm from here. There we go! I can see how far I'm from here. Oh my god. Ok. It's a bit high. Oh! Yeah but it's that an angle, you wanna push it forwards. Oh I see, yes. That's it. Wait is that as... Oh there we go. Oh! Oh my. Not that forward. Ok. Oh. Hang on I've got an idea. It's gonna take fucking ages. I've got an idea. Hang on now I'll put it. Right. Ooo! What? It's gathering all the controls. Oh my god. Yeah that worked. Did it work? Yeah. Hang on. Let me uh... I can't remember what the controls are. Ok. We'll just take them back. There we go then. Got one! Oh no no no no. Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Oh well you're gonna need to come back. I don't even remember to have a bad idea. Oh I'm sorry. I don't know. I think it's getting out of control. Right. Are you... Are you... Are you... Are you... Are you... Oh... Fucking hell. The scope is dead. Oh come on. Yeah. Oh. Oh dear. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh dear. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. It's alright. We're good. Are we good? Uhh. I think you've got a good handful there. Oh no. Just the one. Okay. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh. Oh. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. I've just found the chickens. I've seen this. If you've bought the chickens first then they just... first. They'd starve! Oh fuck. Go on. Why isn't it working? No. Shall I come give you... Yeah, that's the only way that we've actually got it to be. So what have we achieved in two hours of marmings a minute? Wow. We've got two bags of chicken. Oh my god. Excellent. Oh, is that even... there we go. That was a bit misshapen. Oh wow, you can... Why is it doing that? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Oh wow, you can... Why is it doing that? Why is it doing that? Oh! I wonder if with two people we can pick it up? I don't think so. It just says object too heavy. That's not it. Yeah, do you want it there? Oh my god. Erm. I don't know how you... ...upper it and downer it. No, not that. Let me have a look at the setting. Oh, I've turned on the radio. Off. There we go. Oh! Oh! Okay, N is down. Which means M must be up then. Oh, M is forward. Right. So is X. No. Ah, J is up. N is down. K is back. M is forward. Capisce. That makes perfect sense. Oh my days. Sounds so sad. There's another vehicle that we can buy that might help this. Yeah, is there like one with a crane on it. Ehhhh. Ehhhh. Oh, hang on. Hang on. Oh, hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Oh. Hey. Oh. Oh. Oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. No, no, no. Oh. Oh. What if I like... Oh, there we go. Oh, there we go. Oh I hate how it- why does this thing of all things have physics? Like nothing in this game has physics apart from fucking bags of chicken food. Okay, right. And then slowly slowly. Three, what is it, n, no, j. Oh my god that's so jolty as well. Can't even see what I'm doing! The other bag is at such a weird angle. Oh my god, it's gonna drop, it's gonna drop, it's gonna drop. Oh gosh, oh gosh. Right, oh god, okay. Right, and then what if I- Go on, off you get. Off you get. Oh that's just- Oh my gosh. Off you get little bag. Go on. I think you need to move it up a bit and then- Up a bit? As in back or up? Up. Up, yeah. And then- Oop! Get off you stupid thing! Oh I know, I've got a good- I know how we can get it off. No. Oh dear. Uh oh. Uh oh. Okay so if I reverse the tractor then. Uh oh. Uh oh. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh I'm in the wrong car. I can't get in the tractor without getting in the forklift. Oh there we go. Right, so reverse the tractor. We're going to have to get these three vehicles home somehow. And then reverse the thing. Oh wait wait wait wait. Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa. Oh. Oh. No stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop stop. Let me reverse it. There we go. Oh yeah. Of course you were going to give me a heart attack then. There we go. Alright, I will take these back then. Okay. Uh. Oh this feels heavier now. Uh. Where am I going? Um. So tell you what I'll bring. Well actually we need the tractor don't we? Let's not buy eight next time. No let's not. Uh we're going this way. You know where it is. The rest of the food. I know where we need. Against all odds and with several safety violations the grain was on the move. Well maybe I should take the tractor. Oh so are we not coming back? Uh. It's probably you. Yeah. I'll take the tractor. We'll need the pick up. We'll need the faultless to get the stuff off. Oh of course we do. But we need the tractor to get the things off. Okay whatever. Oh I'm on the wrong side of the road. Can I pick up a car? Oh my god. Oh my god. Don't you beep at me. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh no. That's really bad. I can't. I can't. I can't actually move. Oh I'm like I'm stuck. Oh no. There we go. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh no. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh no. Oh okay. Oh no. Oh no. That's really bad. You can't... you cannot... oh no, that's really bad. I can't... I can't actually move. I imagine he's stuck! Oh no! Oh! There we go. Just like that! Don't tailgate me, I can see you in the mirror. I'm going with the limit. BMW impression. Yeah. God, can you imagine? Imagine it spoils when we've just got six... bags of chicken feed that will... It cost me 11 grand all that chicken feed. Hang on, have we gone too far? No, we're... I imagine we're just up here, aren't we? Er... How am I on the way? Oh, oh, oh! Oh, that... That's why I'm working stupid! I found a good way of getting them bags of chicken feed out of us. Right. Oh! Oh! Yeah, that'll do it! It's alright, I can lift you up! Let me try and jostle them out real quick. Although I think they're actually out already, to be honest. Oh no! That's it! Woo! That's it! That's it! That's it! Well, we've got one out! Oh, there we go! Yay! Right, there we go! And then do I just... Do I have to... Hmm... Oh my gosh. I do not know! Okay? Help menu... Forestry... Fuck. Oh, oh, no. How do you lift these stupid fucking chicken feeds? Oh my god, hang on. Can I scoop the handle? With the grain finally home, all they needed now were the chickens. How many chickens do we want? Oh, I don't know. Like six? Six chickens sounds about right. So newborns are like five euros. Six chickens, two roosters. Oh my god, Alex. Hmm? You can lift the bags by the handles. Oh. Oh my god, we never thought to try the fucking handles. Oh my god, I'm not sure. I hear chickens. Right. Oh, the grain is pissing. The what? Oh! The grain was pissing out onto the floor. Oh dear. Oh, food. Food. A thousand litres? How big's a bag? A thousand litres? How big's a bag? A thousand litres? So we've got eight thousand litres. That's a bit much, innit? Oh, hello. More. That's a good start, innit? Yeah. Because then after a while they'll reproduce, so... We could've paid more and then put some little ones, but... We need to try and get that bag upright so... Wow! Got it... How big is a bag? It's fun! Do you look for food? That's... Not this fast. I think you need to... Look... C'mere real food is good, In a few round. Oh THE stolons are kleiner. A packed in. Wow. I think these are those are six. There's both ready to drive the system, but... Eh. Hot in. Totally planned. Oh四五 one! Oh. Holy mammoth. Oh. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh.ches. bag upright so i can get the handle why did we never think of that like that's so stupid so how do you do it uh so like you have to uh i'm guessing that's the handle oh i see oh no no no no oh thanks the mic i don't know what the button is there's no way of getting it up sadly just do some viagra right there we go right now i just need to try and scoop the handle into the oh i see you can use the handle with the pickup truck it's not like you can pick it up with your hands with the handle no like this oh that's much better isn't it like look how easy that was and what do you do you just sort of put it in the food area i literally just drove up to it and it started pissing out at the bottom yeah there we go look oh we're learning look at that and yeah it's going into the asylum nice cool should probably go and get a tractor at some point yeah let's leave them to it okay right well we've got chickens and we can either like collect the eggs i'm going to uh or let them um let them do their own thing uh hatch sorted yeah completely mate with chickens and financial ruin firmly underway it was time to farm for that they needed machinery big important looking machinery things that plowed things that loosened things that sounded expensive they had no idea what any of it was but they bought it anyway because it looked agricultural sugar cane potato corn headers spreaders power harrows it's a harrow well let's get a harrow then we have to go to the shop of course you do there we go oh nice i got it so how do you use it then i'm guessing it's the same as the forklift n m oh oh what oh oh oh oh well i don't want to do the concrete or v and it's doing absolutely nothing uh no it's not doing anything is it big carriage was vehicle workshop oh 300 no that's don't want to spend that sort of money just yeah do we small garage and get a barn for eight thousand uh let me see what plows are on offer is there a plow sale uh ah thank you that's totally the bit that i always skip because i'm terrible at it i reverse into the right end well i imagine it wait can it go back it does go on the back of a tractor doesn't it the plow ah ah nice look at you right off your pot then i'll get some chicken coop food okay oh oh there's I'm tired, Helen. I'll say exactly. Completely the wrong direction. While Josh wrestled with the chicken feed, Alex was having a different kind of problem. I may have broken the pickup truck. How have you done that? I drowned it. I went into very deep water. Oh Alex. It is now... yeah. Hello. How are we doing? Right. Look, good as new. Good as new. Exactly the same. Not waterlogged. We actually own this one as well. I'm going to come in 16x9. Okay. It barely, like... Oh god. Oh god. Oh never. Oh dear. Is there a way to lower the backflap? Oh there is. I think. No. Is there? Er... Oh I'm not... Er... Er... Er... How are we on some trotters? Oh! Unfold! Aha! It's X. Oh my god. The whole time. Oh. Oh. Well that's one. Except... no. Well yeah. Top note. Well yeah. Er... Er... Nice! Just scooped it in! We're getting the hang of this mate. We're getting the hang of this mate. Look at us. Profesh. That's what we are. It's profesh. I think that's it to be fair. I'm not sure we can... Let me try again. I don't think we can... I don't think we can... I don't think we can... Let me try again. Oh no. No. Oh no. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Oh no. No. Oh no. Oh no. How am I going to get out of this? Oh there we go. Okay. Right. I'm going to... We have more luck when I do it. With a run up. Okay. What the... What the... What the... What the... What the... Oh you see... Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. How am I going to get out of this? Oh there we go. Oh there we go. Okay. Right. I'm going to... We have more luck when I do it. With a run up. Okay. What the... Oh you still attack. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. We're buggered. Actually. Properly buggered. Okay. Let me... Oh. Right. Hang on let me... Hang on let me... Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no we're buggered. Actually. Properly buggered. Okay. Let me... Oh. Right. Hang on let me... Hang on let me... Hang on let me... Oh no! Fantasimum! You know what? I will take these two back. Okay! Unless not one of them. Oh god! Okay, right let me pick up two then. Let's go to the place. Let's... Where is it? That's it. You can follow me if you want. Oh yeah. Although I'm a bit slow. All they had to do was not flip the brand new truck on the way home. Also we're getting the wrong way. Yeah. Right. You can follow me, he says. Yeah, follow me. Because he's dead completely the wrong race. Oh! Oh no. Right. Oh no. Okay. Right. Are you trying to cross the river again? No. The car... It flipped. Oh it just flipped did it? And uh... finished. Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh no. Okay. Right. Oh my... Are you trying to cross the river again? No. The car... It flipped. Oh it just flipped did it? And uh... Oh... We bought one of them flipping trucks. I... I... I... I... I... I turned and I probably should have slowed down a bit. I can see a pink ahead of me. Yeah. Through the little gap between my chicken bags. Yeah. Hello. Yeah. What's happened here then? Oh... Oh... And one's in the bike shed! How are we ever going to get that out? I know. I'll tell you what... Let me try and put... Those two. Yeah. I can see a pink ahead of me. Yeah. Through the little gap between my chicken bags. Yeah. Hello. Hello. Yeah. What's happened here then? Oh... Oh... Oh... And one's in the bike shed! How are we ever going to get that out? I know. I'll tell you what... Let me try and... Yeah... Yeah... Right. Get your flap down. Say that to all the... To all the trucks! Yeah... Well... Can't you say that to all the trucks! Sorry... Oh... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! Look, I'm too bad! I'm too bad! I'm too bad! I'm too bad! I'm too bad! Nice! Oh! Okay, yeah... I'm gonna put this one down! Let's... Let's do this... The best way we can! Right? Don't roll with heart, Alex! Don't do that again! Okay... Right... Why is this man watching... Fuck off! You don't have a bed to do with your life! It's Patrick! It's Patrick! It's Patrick! It's Patrick! It's Patrick! It's like... Oh... Nice! Yeah, look at us getting the hang of this! Aw! Right... Now how am i gagne retrieve that from the pike shed? Right. Now how am I going to retrieve that from the pike shed? By the end of this save there's going to be bits of chicken meat thrown across the map. We are unable to access. Oh actually that's... Oh did it! By the grace of God. I think it's a shadow isn't it? Err... Oh no. I don't know why that's darker than the rest apparently. It's a shadow isn't it? Err... Err... Oh. Hell yeah. Is it... Duh... Yeah. I need to get that little splodge. I'm sure that's how they do it in Rip. Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh. Oh, oh. Right. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. There we go. And then when it comes to harvest we can buy a combo and harvest and then we get a reason to close some. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. There we go. And then when it comes to harvest we can buy a combo and harvest and then we get a reason to close some. Should open a bakery. Mmm. Mmm. The squiggly dot farm shop bakery. Oh. Oh. Oh. I'll buy some seed. Why have I made the field so fucking weird shaped? Uh. I mean. I mean. Great little game of which I can use this to get a new farm. It's a new farm. Oh. Oh. It's a new farm. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I actually really enjoy it, like, for its buggy little start, it's actually really detailed. Oh yeah. And the farming bit is good. It's just the game bit that's bad. I mean, it is farming simulator. It is not city traffic. City traffic river death simulator. Oh god, okay. Oh, I've got some weeds already. Have we actually? Yeah. There's more money. Grass is growing back. Grass is growing back? Yeah. Oh, fuck. Look at this shit. Why has that happened? Well, because it's grass. It grows fucking everywhere, doesn't it? So, should we leave it unlootened until we're actually ready to... Yeah, but then how do you stop it growing? Planting. You can sow crops using a seeder or a planter. Fill the machine with seeds from a pallet or a... oh, I'll silo first. Select the crop you want to sow. Lower the machine and turn it on. Keep the crop calendar in mind if you're playing with seasonal growth turned on. Seed pallets can be purchased at the shop! Because this is the harrow that I've got. Oh, I see. So the soil is now loose. So now we can plant stuff. And now we can, yeah, plant stuff. Oh, right, yeah, yeah. There we go. Oh, this is wicked. I can love this. So we need a seeder and we need a silo. So I'm going to get a silo in the build menu, wherever that is. So we need a lot of construction. Uh, yeah, so, um... Well, we need to take the tractor to the shop. Great. With the chicken food. Nice. Yeah. No, let's take this back and then we'll have a higher seat. Because we'll need to port enough for that. Of course we will, yeah. Uh, well, yeah. Actually, tell you what. I'm going to leave the pickup truck at the shop. Shit. Yeah, I can drive back. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Right. There we go. Got about a six point turn there. Yeah. Yeah. Hello. I do not know what to do. What are we looking at? Are you trying to buy, uh, food? I'm trying to buy seeds. Seeds, okay. A week. That's sweet. I have no idea where. Oh, lizard is the brand. It said lizard seeds. I was like, eh. Right. Let's not go crazy. Let's get two. That seems achievable. And then should we buy some fertilizer while we're doing that? Uh. Because we can load two seeds onto the truck and then carry two fertilizer bags back. Yeah, sure. On the forklift. Let's do two of those as well then. Whoa, what the fuck was that? A bloody deer just ran across the car park. As they do. Damn. Yeah. Oh, fucker. And then we shove it in. Nice. It was surprisingly well, even though I'm sure that it's not like you're supposed to. Oh, definitely not. Well, it might be, but I don't know how you'd ever play this single player. Fucking Christ. Yeah. Sounds horribly taxing, doesn't it? I mean, eventually I imagine you can get your AI people to grab stuff for you. I think it's a bit more automated. There you go. And a bit more automated. Nice. Okay, let me get these two then. Oh my god. Traffic just turns right in front of you. Yeah. What's up design this? It's like in the Euro truck. Oh god, I'm not in a tractor. Why am I trying to mount the hedge? Okay. Okay. Let's use the road, Josh. When I can see the road. There we are. Okay, how does what... Yeah. We can put crops in that silo. I don't know if we put seeds in there. Ah, okay. I mean, we still need that though. Yeah. Er, yeah. It's not a waste of purchase. Um, seed pallets. Ah, we need a seed pallet. That's what we need. Let's find out where the fuck you get that from. I wonder where. I'll buy the seed pallets. Oh, we're still planting some fucking wheat. I know. It's not like in Minecraft. I know, right? You can only buy the one seed pallet, so... Yeah, it's at the shop. It was now nightfall on Squiggly Dot Farm. The chickens were asleep. The forklift was likely being a menace to other bags of chicken food. And it was time to start planting seeds. Nothing like the dead of night to do some farming. That is when they do it in fairness, isn't it? Erm... Turn on power harrow. This is a power harrow. A power harrow? I thought it was a... for a dozen or no seeds for all of these grapes is going to gift. And, in between, we've opened up. I'm going to sayкам, am I going to select seeds for each? Is it going to 준비 consciously off...those of your people? This fruit cannot be planted in August. Oh right, yeah you need to plant it. At least it stops you. Well, it's there for when... It's there for September. It's only a month away, I suppose. Okay. That's er... Oh my goodness. Well at least there's no rough to get food for these chickens. Just waiting until September now. In the end they did not farm. But they did something much harder. They tried. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure.
