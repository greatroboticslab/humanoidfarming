 Hello everyone, in this video I am going to show you how to find the supplies when you're looking around the farm, when you resupply the acid lab. So let's get started. Of course the first thing you need to do is eliminate all the enemies or at the very least the most of them. Once you've done that then you look around for the supplies and it should always look like this. It should have a blue cover on top of the green cart. Once you're near the green cart, you should know it should have a green area on top, it should be on the minimap as well. Once you've found the cart, you need to get a tractor. There should be two to three tractors laying around the farm, you can pick any you like. Once you've got into a tractor, then you need to reverse into the cart and then there you go, you collected it. Then you just need to drive to the location which will be on your minimap. On the way you are driving back, you will have to do some drive by shooting, but it should be fairly easy to do. Once you get to the area to drop off the cart, it should tell you on the top left what button to press to let go of the cart. Once you do, you just leave out the area then you drive off and that's it. And that's how you do this resupply mission for the farm. So I hope this video helped in any way. If it did, make sure to give this video a like. Thank you for watching this video everyone.
