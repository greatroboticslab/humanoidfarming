 I was not coming back to the farm. I was not coming back to family business and I did exactly what I said I was not going to do. So I'm the fifth generation. Family's been farming for over a hundred years. We were in a bunch of produce crops and then got into turf grass in the mid-seventies. My grandma Warner, Lily, realized that the farm was out in more of the rural area and the customers were in the city. So she said, you know guys, y'all go to the farm and you're doing a great job but I'm gonna go meet the customer where they are. And so she started our first ever garden center in Pensacola, Florida. Fast forward a few decades and like grandma Lily, Christina Werner McGinnis, now fully involved in what she said she'd never do, saw a new need and found a way to meet it. Dad asked me one day, he said, go over to the garden center and listen to our customers. Do a little audit, tell me what you hear. I came back and I reported back to him and I said, everyone's having a problem with their lawn or garden and they're coming to us asking us for a solution. As we head into the heat of summer, our lawns and our gardens get more of our attention. But what about the soil? Well, that's where the soil test kit comes into play. I said, dad, I'm just gonna develop a really easy soil test and that turned into a whole different side of our business. So we developed soil kit and that is now an affiliate company which is called Agritech Corp. We've merged the stubborn hard-headed farmer and all that he or she knows from the farm into software solutions that the consumer can understand. Think about it, the extension agents in the lab are only open certain hours. We make this test and the answers accessible 24-7. Free shipping online. You get a soil kit, you're able to buy this online, it delivers right to your mailbox. Regardless of her original intentions, through all kinds of weather, including the occasional hurricane, Christina has literally kept growing the family business. I got here today by doing exactly what I said I was not going to do. I came back to the family business. The legacy of the Warner family is an ongoing legacy. It just keeps growing and it is absolutely Alabama.
