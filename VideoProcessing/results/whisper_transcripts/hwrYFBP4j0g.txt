 We've all heard the term organic gardening. What is organic gardening? What makes it different from regular gardening? And why does it matter? In today's video I'm going to give you seven things that organic gardeners do differently from regular gardeners along with 30 practical suggestions for ways that you can implement organic gardening practices in your own garden. But if we haven't met before my name is Angela from Growing in the Garden and I love to share garden inspiration and helpful tips so you can be successful in your own garden. What is organic gardening? In its simplest terms organic gardening means gardening without the use of synthetic chemical pesticides and fertilizers when you're growing your garden. Organic gardening focuses on creating a healthy environment for plants to thrive from the very beginning rather than gardening in a more reactive way to negative things that happen in the garden. So why does all this matter? Why is it important to garden organically? At the end of the day growing a garden takes a lot of work. It takes a lot of time and money and water and resources. You're doing the best you can to ensure that the food that comes from your garden is as full of good delicious things as it can be and it is free from pesticides and other chemicals. Your garden is also a better place at the end of organic gardening. It's kind of like that thing I'm always telling my kids when we go somewhere that they need to leave it better than they found it. That's what we're doing with organic gardening. We're creating an environment in our gardens and in our soil and we're leaving that environment better than we found it. The first principle is to focus on the soil not the plant. Synthetic and chemical fertilizers are a quick way to give nutrition right to the plant and that is often a quick fix for problems in the garden. Instead when you add organic matter and organic fertilizers to the soil you're actually feeding the soil which will in turn feed the plant. It's a slower process but ultimately a better one for the soil and for the plant. Here are four simple ways to feed your soil. At the beginning of each season top all your beds off with compost. Test your soil to see if anything is needed and if something is needed in your soil choose organic amendments like blood meal and bone meal rather than synthetic amendments. Add vermicomposting bins to your beds and let those worms create those beautiful rich worm castings which are garden gold for your soil. Growing cover crops and turning them under into the soil is also a great way to feed your soil. The second thing that organic gardeners do differently is they aim to prevent diseases rather than just reactively treat diseases that they see in the garden. Here are a few ways to help prevent diseases in your garden. First off choose disease resistant varieties of plants. If a particular disease is a problem for you or has been a problem choose varieties that are disease resistant. When you water, water your plants in the morning rather than at night and try not to get water on the leaves. Damp leaves and damp plants overnight make plants more susceptible to certain diseases. Develop a system of crop rotation in your garden where you are rotating the different families of crops. Diseases build up in the soil and if you're consistently planting that same crop in the same place then you're more likely to have that disease in your soil. And finally if you do get diseases in your garden dispose of those plants in the trash bin rather than in your compost pile so that you're not continuing to spread those diseases to your garden. The third thing that organic gardeners do differently is weeds. Weeds are a common nuisance in the garden and sometimes it's difficult to get on top of them. Here are a few things that you can do to manage weeds without the help of chemicals. Manually pull weeds before they go to seed and you're removing hundreds of seeds usually and you're removing that plant from your garden. If you leave that weed in place and then allow it to go to seed and it's dropping seeds it's really a vicious cycle and it's hard to get on top of that. Another idea is to garden in raised beds. Raised beds naturally have fewer weeds than in bed gardens. In areas where weeds are a really big issue consider growing a cover crop for a season or two to choke out those weeds. The fourth principle for organic gardeners is to focus on having a healthy enough plant that a little bit of pest damage isn't going to be a huge issue. One of the most important things that you can do for healthy plants is to water consistently. Understand correct watering principles and apply them in your garden. Consistently watering your garden keeps the plants from being stressed out. Stressed out plants are definitely more inviting to pests. Rather than giving your plants frequent shallow irrigation, focus on giving your plants less frequent deep irrigation. That encourages the roots to grow deeply and plants with deep roots and help you to grow deeply and grow deeply. So plants are better able to withstand environmental pressures. Provide adequate nutrition by feeding your soil but don't over fertilize. Excess growth from too much nitrogen makes plants more inviting to pests. Don't over feed your plants. The fifth thing that organic gardeners do differently is to manage pests mindfully. Don't just reach for a bottle of chemicals every time you see a bug in your garden. First off, learn the difference between beneficial and harmful insects. There are many great resources online and in books for discovering local pests that are a problem and also local beneficial insects. Learn what all stages of those insects look like so that you can learn to identify which are beneficial and which are pests in your garden. The second thing to do is to do nothing. Healthy plants can often withstand a little bit of pest damage without harmful effects. Don't be too quick to react and treat even with organic methods. Use barrier methods such as row covers in your garden to prevent damage from pests before they even happen. Prevent the bugs from getting to those plants in the first place. Sticky traps, when used correctly, are a very effective method for flying insects. Handpicking caterpillars and other large bugs and insects is a great job for kids and very effective. Handpicking the morning when temperatures are cooler and bugs are a little more sluggish. Check the undersides of leaves. That's often a favorite hiding place. Spraying off just with water is often a very effective treatment as well. Using BT is effective on certain caterpillars and leaf eating bugs. The sixth thing that organic gardeners do differently is choosing the correct plant, planting it at the right place, and planting it at the right time. As gardeners, we often like to stretch the boundaries of what can grow in our area, but this is often really stressful on plants. And when plants are stressed out, they're more inviting to pests and diseases. So when you focus on growing what grows well in your area and choosing the right part of your yard to grow that in, you're often a more effective gardener. First off, choose varieties of plants that grow well in your region. Varieties that don't need extraordinary measures and you to do a lot of different things to help them be successful. Learn about the different areas of your garden and the different microclimates in your garden. Do you have an area that gets a little cooler or a little warmer or an area that often has excess moisture or is a little bit drier? Select varieties of plants that are adapted to grow well in those particular areas. And finally, use a planting guide meant for your local area. Plants have a preferred growing temperature that they grow well at. When you plant at the preferred growing temperature for that plant, they're much more likely to thrive. The seventh thing that organic gardeners do differently is to practice companion planting and polyculture practices in your garden. What is polyculture? Polyculture isn't. Polyculture isn't row after row of the same crop. That would be a monoculture. It's much easier for pests to find what they're looking for when there's row after row of their preferred crop. When a garden is host to a wide variety of plants, it more closely mimics nature and increases the overall health of the garden. Here are a few ways to implement polyculture and companion planting practices in your garden. Learn the preferred companions for plants in your garden and plant them nearby. If you're growing several of one particular crop, instead of planting them all in one location in your garden, intersperse them throughout your garden. Interplant several different plants with similar growing needs in the same garden bed. Add a wide variety of perennial and annual herbs and flowers to your garden. Those perennial herbs and flowers will attract all kinds of beneficial insects. Allow your herbs to flower and those will attract beneficial insects and pollinators to your garden. Over time, the compound effects of implementing organic gardening practices are going to be a good way to plant them. And then, the organic gardening practices in your garden will continue to grow and build. Begin where you are and implement the practices that seem the most doable and the most reasonable to you. As you implement and use these practices, the benefits will continue to grow in your garden. Thank you so much for watching. What an awesome variety. Thank you. If you need a better environment.
