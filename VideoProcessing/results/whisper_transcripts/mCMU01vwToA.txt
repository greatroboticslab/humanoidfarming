 My suggestion is big bail as much as you can. And then unless you're doing retail, obviously do small bales. But if you're unsure what the presses or the exporters are going to want, I would big bail it. It's actually easier for us to handle. We prefer to run big bales because we're just, that's primarily what we run.
