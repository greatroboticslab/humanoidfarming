 It's adapting to temperatures changing, growing seasons shifting. Hold on. How do you adapt to growing season? Think about it. You're a farmer. You've grown a certain crop the same way your whole life. Suddenly, it's getting hotter, so the best time to plant is different now. That could ruin your whole year. Right. But now, you can get data on your phone. What's the soil temperature? How much rain? When will those pesky bugs show up? You can plant at the new right time.
