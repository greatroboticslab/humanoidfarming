 How to make an AFK Chicken Farm in Minecraft Bedrock First, dig a hole like this. Place a double chest with a hopper leading into the chest and a slab on top of the hopper. Have a dispenser facing into the slab and glass around the rest of the slab. Place another layer of glass and then some slabs on top of that. Place lava in the middle and then a slab on top of it. Have another hopper going into the dispenser. Place glass around the hopper and more slabs on top of the glass. Dig under the dispenser and have an observer facing up. Dig a few more down and have an observer facing downwards. To work the farm, place chickens in the top compartment here and you're done.
