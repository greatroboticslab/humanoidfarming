 Hotbeds. This ancient technique of growing food dating back to the Roman times is perhaps one of the most powerful pieces of a self-sufficiency garden. Hotbeds serve two key functions. The first is that they allow you to sow outside two to three months earlier than usual without needing a polytunnel and the second is at the end of a growing season you have an abundance of rich compost that you can use around the garden. I learnt all about hotbeds by the UK's expert Jack First who's written a hotbed book and is a good friend of mine. I was struck by just how beneficial they were after visiting him in 2022 and decided to make three hotbeds this year. The cold frame placed on top of a layer of compost creates a frost-free growing zone allowing you to directly sow crops in January and February to harvest from March onwards. Excellent for the hungry gap and germination speeds are insane with seedlings appearing around two to three days after sowing. One hotbed in the self-sufficiency garden ended up yielding over 30 kilos of food in eight months and gave loads of compost.
