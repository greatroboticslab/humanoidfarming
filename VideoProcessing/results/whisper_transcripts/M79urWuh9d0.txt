Education
 Let's get the economy going. I've always liked that expression, but we also need to propose solutions and support market stakeholders. Advising, improving, interpreting, and preventing are the activities that I thrive on. It's even more important when you realize that agriculture and food processing are at the root of society. Working in collective marketing and international and rural development allows me to make an impact. Better understanding and responding to the globalization of markets is what motivates me to take my research to the next level. Do you want to make the world a better place?
