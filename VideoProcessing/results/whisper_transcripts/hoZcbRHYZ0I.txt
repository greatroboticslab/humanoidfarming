Education
 We are an alcohol and drug treatment facility and we're here to help people change their lives. We're located in a little town called Glen Ellen. We're out in the country about an hour and a half north of San Francisco. We have been open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week since 1949. It's important for the clients to not only feel safe but to feel like somebody cares. Here at Mountain Vista Farm, we care. Mountain Vista Farm is not a hospital by any means. The food here is outstanding. Well, people come to Mountain Vista Farm because they want to change their lives. You know, to come up and not use drugs and alcohol for 30 days, it's not that hard. A lot of people haven't had that laughter for many years. And when they come here to Mountain Vista Farm, they get clean and sober and all of a sudden they start having smiles on their faces. You see the laughter coming out. Family members, when they come, one of the biggest things they say is that, I've got my husband back. I've got my wife back. I have my son back. People leave here clean and sober, ready to start their new life. helping people start their new life. ¶¶ improvementd. co-looking susceptibleеля
