 This is my emu Fred. Fred! Here, have some of it. He's very bitey. And we name him Fred because he looks like Fred Flintstone. Oh, that was my finger. He's really a Fred. Bite her. I like your little beak. It's really cozy. The way it just throws it back into its mouth. This thing is bitey. Hi bitey. All animals are the same. Corn goes in. You gotta chew the corn. Chew the corn.
