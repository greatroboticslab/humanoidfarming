 We were pushing guys to get out and get something done. And I think you were even on that side of the fence, too. The cool temperatures kind of had, you know, us a little nervous, but even more so our customer group. And we were looking at the forecast saying, hey, rain's coming. I don't think this is going to get any better. And some guys went out and got some of those earlier planning dates and they were very rewarded for doing so. So the conditions never got back to as fit as they were in mid or early April for some of those guys that really went and got after it. Soil conditions that when they're fit in April, start planning.
