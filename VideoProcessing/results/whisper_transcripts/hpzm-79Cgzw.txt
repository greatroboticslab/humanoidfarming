 The German company Wilkins Electronics has introduced a versatile robotic lawnmower named Cosmos. This advanced device is designed for automatic lawn care and is equipped with cutting-edge technologies that ensure efficient and autonomous grass mowing. Cosmos can service lawns up to 1,400 square meters in size. The robot operates on a 20-volt lithium-ion battery with a capacity of 2.2 amp-hours. Providing up to 45 minutes of runtime on a single charge. The primary advantage of Cosmos lies in its functionality. The robot uses a laser radar to map the area and plan the optimal route, enhancing its efficiency. It can be controlled via a mobile application, allowing users to set a work schedule and monitor the process remotely. For safety, Cosmos is equipped with ultrasonic sensors and height detectors, preventing collisions with obstacles and ensuring secure operation. The Cosmos robotic lawnmower combines innovative technology, reliability, and ease of use, making it an excellent solution for lawn maintenance. The Dutch startup AGZ has developed a unique robotic tractor named the AGBOT, designed to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural operations. Equipped with advanced technologies, the AGBOT can perform a wide range of field tasks with minimal human involvement. It is capable of operating autonomously for up to 23 hours, handling activities such as cultivation, deep tillage, and other field operations. Through the AGZ portal, farmers can pre-plan all necessary tasks, creating multiple scenarios for each operation based on changing conditions. By integrating advanced sensors, artificial intelligence systems, and remote control capabilities, the AGBOT is an innovative solution that has the potential to transform traditional farming practices, increasing efficiency while reducing impact on the environment. Another version of the autonomous tractor from the Dutch company AGZ named the AGBOT 2.0 has set a benchmark in agricultural technology. In 2023, the AGBOT 2.0 successfully covered 12,500 hectares, demonstrating its reliability and performance under real-world conditions. This model features a four-cylinder DOTS diesel engine with a power output of 55 kilowatts, providing sufficient power for various agricultural tasks. The tractor is equipped with an electric transmission, achieving a maximum speed of 13.12 kilometers per hour, enabling efficient field operations. Certified for autonomous operation without constant operator supervision, it allows farmers to optimize labor costs and improve productivity. Capable of autonomous operation for over 24 hours, the robot handles tasks such as cultivation, deep loosening, and other field operations. With advanced sensors and artificial intelligence systems, the AGBOT 2.0 operates effectively in diverse conditions while minimizing impact on soil. You are looking at one of the world's first high-tech robotic farms specializing in the automated production of fresh vegetables and greens using artificial intelligence. The farm was established in California by the startup Iron Ox, whose mission is to revolutionize agriculture by making it as sustainable and efficient as possible. The developers have created a system where robots and artificial intelligence work in tandem to ensure sustainable and autonomous food production. The key components of this farm are intelligent robots such as Grover and Ada. Grover is a powerful mobile robot that moves heavy hydroponic plant containers around the farm. Ada is a robotic arm responsible for planting, care, and harvesting. By integrating robotic technologies and artificial intelligence, Iron Ox showcases what the future of agriculture could look like, sustainable, efficient, and environmentally friendly. The German company Frumico has unveiled its new fruit harvesting robot named FACO Shake & Catch OE4, designed to automate and enhance the efficiency of orchard yields. This self-propelled machine uses a unique vibration and fruit collection technology, allowing it to shake trees and gently catch the fruits simultaneously, preventing contact with the ground. The robot operates using a vibratory mechanism that carefully shakes the fruits from the branches. An integrated umbrella system captures the fruits and transfers them to a conveyor, where they undergo initial cleaning to remove leaves and small debris. The fruits are then directed to a container moving in parallel with the machine. This method enables the harvesting of up to 6 trees per minute, achieving a throughput of up to 25 tons of apples per hour. The machine features a highly adaptive chassis with adjustable suspension, allowing it to operate effectively even on uneven terrain with slopes of up to 12%. Engineers at Exact Robotics Company have developed a unique robot named Trax, designed to automate tasks in vineyards. This robot is built to handle labor-intensive operations such as soil cultivation, inter-row weeding, and precision spraying. Trax is an autonomous tractor equipped with a 56-horsepower diesel engine, enabling extended autonomous operation for 30 to 35 hours. The robot combines mechatronic systems, artificial intelligence, and high-precision sensors. It can autonomously perform tasks based on detailed data about terrain, soil moisture levels, and plant conditions, reducing chemical usage and improving work quality. Control and monitoring are facilitated through integrated navigation systems that utilize GPS, camera, and sensors to prevent collisions. Trax is already available on the market and is actively used by winemakers. The company carpenter Metalicia Anya has introduced the compact CM01, an advanced solution for harvesting fruit such as apples, pears, and other produce in challenging agricultural environments. The primary feature of this machine is its integrated conveyor belts, which automatically collect fruits and direct them into containers. These belts operate across four height levels, making the system versatile for orchards with trees of varying heights. The platform is powered by a fully electric drivetrain with a total output of 20 kW running on a 48-volt system. This design reduces maintenance cost and eliminates emissions. For ease of operation, the machine features front belts with a vertical folding mechanism and an automatic container exchange system that completes the process in under 30 seconds. The platform's maximum load capacity is 400 kg, and its controls are user-friendly, integrated into a modern display with diagnostic capabilities. An engineer from Nissan has developed a unique device called the IJIMO, designed to assist farmers in rice cultivation. The IJIMO robot resembles a large robotic vacuum cleaner and weighs just 112 kg. It is equipped with two rotating rubber brushes that mimic the movements of a duck's feet. These brushes stir up the water, creating a cloudy effect that hinders weed growth by blocking sunlight from reaching their roots. Additionally, the robot can operate autonomously thanks to built-in GPS, solar panels, and Wi-Fi connectivity. The robot is controlled remotely via radio signals and is powered by solar energy. A prototype of the robot is currently undergoing testing in Yamagata Prefecture in north-eastern Japan. While Nissan has no immediate plans to mass-produce the device, interest in the Agamo robot could drive the development of similar technologies in agriculture worldwide.
