 Agribusiness Management focuses on sustainable processes to enhance the performance of small, medium and large-scale enterprises in globally competitive agriculture-based industries. Agribusiness Management also aims at enhancing entrepreneurship among primary producers of agri-food products and traders and other intermediaries in the value chain. AIT is the place for integration. Agribusiness Management is where we combine technology, industry and education, bringing solutions that work. We can test and learn about successes and failures from examples around the world. Smart agriculture with smart planning and development will improve productivity, safety and the standards in Thailand and globally. I am now doing research in Agribusiness Management. My research focuses on developing a policy use and understanding the advantage, attitudes and perceptions of Agribusiness Management stakeholders in the new technology like blockchains in order to advance the values and quality of food. I choose to study Agribusiness Management because food and agriculture is important in all aspects of our lives, and businesses carry a crucial role to move the industry forward. I choose this school since here you will experience diverse cultures of people from various backgrounds and you will be equipped with significant skills to thrive personally and professionally. I am a first year doctoral student. We are taught by faculty members who are experts in their field. I am also enjoying the multicultural environment here. AIT is one of the best universities in Thailand for those people who would like to access the postgraduate in the international programme.
