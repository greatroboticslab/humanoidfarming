 I tell you what you TYM guys get a little overconfident driving with that loader up. Don't these things flip over like the green ones? No they actually use steel on the back of these things. Hey it's Brock here with Rock Hill Farms and today we're going to bale some hay with several different types and sizes of baling equipment in an effort to decide for myself and to help you decide that if you want to bale your own hay but you're not a big time farmer what's the right size equipment for me from a tiny little mini round baler to your full size balers you know what's what's going to work for me what's going to work for you and I hope I can answer that question a little bit today. So I've traveled a couple hours out into Oklahoma to visit my buddy Jake who is the owner of the tractor yard and I've brought the Takakita 3x3 round baler and the rake that goes with it so that we can compare it to the hay baling equipment they have. They have a mini round baler that does like a 2x3 it's a much much smaller baler than this that's also less expensive. They've also got the next size bigger than this which is a 4 foot by 5 foot round bale and that's almost getting up into your big equipment but you can still run that with a mid-sized tractor like the 574 that I've got. So right now we need to do some raking and then we're going to walk around and look at all of these different balers and all these different rakes we're going to run them all and then try to give you a summary based on Jake's family experience with him and his dad having baled hay on this property for a long time and ran a lot of this equipment before. I'm going to get their thoughts on this new equipment and see how they think it compares in terms of price and capability and and just give you as much information as we can about baling hay with smaller equipment. Here we've got a New Holland RF 450 utility baler makes a 4x5 round bale. It's physically a little bigger than the 3x3 I brought up here it also costs twice as much. That 3x3 baler is going to run you about $24,000. This one you're going to spend at least 40. We've been looking at them used they were several years old had a lot of bales out of them and they were still going for over $30,000. You know you ask if you're getting what you pay for or if you're just overpaying tough decision. We're pulling that with a Zetor 7341 I don't think this tractor has even been made for a long time. The bigger the baler then the bigger the windrow you need to the bigger rake you need small baler small rake small windrow here we've got a Branson 5835 and that is pulling a dramatically bigger rake than the one I brought up here it's it not just bigger it's a completely different style of rake too So this is the style of rake that I see used the most often in my area and it makes a larger windrow than the rake that I brought with me which is designed to pair with the smaller balers and it makes a lot of balers and it makes a lot of balers and it makes balers and it makes balers In my area the most common hay equipment that I see in use is New Holland and John Deere and probably New Holland even more than the John Deere and I asked one local farmer why he uses New Holland so much he said it's a lot cheaper than John Deere and it still makes bales At the end of the day you just want something that's reliable but like I said a minute ago to run this four foot by five foot round bale you need a pretty good sized tractor and it's a lot more expensive than the other options I'm getting ready to show you so if you're looking at needing a $60,000 tractor and a $40,000 baler at minimum with new equipment you're talking about a hundred thousand dollars just to make hay bales and if you don't have a very big property it might be hard to justify that now obviously you don't have to buy new equipment but I'm just comparing prices on new equipment right now Hey you almost look like you knew what you were doing I think it to you Mike yeah so as the owner of a dealership Jake is trying to make a decision right now whether or not he wants to carry small hay baling equipment and offer that for sale to his customers maybe even a package deal with a small tractor and a small baler that'll work together and he's trying to decide if he wants to do that and if he does it what size machine should he go with and what manufacturer all of that so this is going to be helping him do some market research and what we'd like from you is tell us as you're watching this would you spend your money on this would you spend your money on the smaller one what about the bigger one just let us know what you think of these now I have a full video walking around this specific baler which is a Takakita 3x3 it actually makes a 35 by 35 inch bale here's your model number the guy that imports these is Phil from small farm innovations he brought it down and he walked through all the details on this baler so I'm not going to repeat every bit of it if you want to see every detail about this baler I'll put a link at the end where you can watch the video I did with Phil the biggest thing we're focusing on today is size and style and type of balers now this one I think is really cool it's got kind of a unique system that it uses a two-point hitch that swivels in two directions makes for easy pickup and makes it follow the tractor really easy it's got an electronic connection right here you plug this into a control box and this is how you control your baler and that's wired up to the battery it was really easy to set that up it's just a quick connect plug and then a battery cable that runs down here and gives it power and honestly that system that's being used is basically exactly the same as what's being used by the bigger four by five baler that cost a lot more now here on the other tractor that we're using we have the rake that came with this baler a lot of people like to buy these smaller baling setups as a package deal to get your cutter your rake and your baler all in one affordable package so this little rake is torn down for transport we need to set that up real quick and then get some raking done well Jake's leveling that out I want to point out that this rake is a dual purpose it's got a cam on it and as it comes around when it hits that cam your rakes come up and release the material if you want it to rake you set that cam you pull a lever and that cam has the rakes come up well it's on that side next to the chute that creates your windrow you flip that cam the other way and it's just one lever you just pull a lever you turn it the other way it'll be like it is now where that back rake is coming up and it's releasing that material more spread out so right now the tines are coming up when they're at the back that is tedding the way we had it before the tines are coming up when it's at that deflector shield that's raking so so so as we looked at that four by five baler that's suited for someone with a larger piece of property and a larger tractor if you've got more than 50 acres and you have a tractor that's 60 to 70 horsepower you probably want that big baler but there are a lot of people out there who have less land or a smaller tractor who are just trying to operate on a budget who might be a lot better off getting this size of equipment you can easily run this rake with a 25 horsepower tractor which has 18 horsepower at the pto and we even ran the baler on a 25 horsepower tractor just to prove that it would handle it and that 25 15 had no problem with that three by three baler another advantage to this smaller equipment is transport if you're not only bailing your own property but you sometimes go off property to bail for someone else or you have multiple properties in different locations there's a huge advantage to the smaller equipment because i have a mid-size trailer and i was able to put the baler the rake and the cutter all on one trailer and take them with me if you have to take three trips to get your bailing equipment to a property you better be getting a return on that as opposed to the idea of showing up with all your equipment in one load so i mentioned earlier that i got this equipment from phil at small farm innovations and i'll put his contact information in the description of this video and i can tell you for a fact whether i decided to go with the smallest of many round balers like you'll see in a minute or this size here or the next size bigger the first phone call i'd make before buying would be to phil at small farm innovations he has personal experience and expertise on all of these different sizes and he can help you pick the one that suit your needs looking at the three by three i feel like that's suited for someone who has anywhere from a 25 horsepower tractor up to 50 to 60 horsepower and a property between 10 and 50 acres and these are just my personal opinions it's not locked in stone obviously another consideration is what size of bale do you want to have it's more common to see the larger bales but in some applications you might not even have the ability to handle the large bales the three by three bales only weigh 350 pounds and anyone can roll those around if you've got horses and you don't have heavy equipment to move big bales you can easily move those bales around by hand these miniature round bales are an extreme version of that they might only weigh 60 pounds probably less if they're not wrapped too tight and i think these are ideal for someone who has 20 acres or less and a compact or subcompact tractor and they are a similar design in how they operate but they're going to cost you a lot less the last option i haven't talked about is a square baler and i've got one and i'm going to show it in the future but that's not what today's video is about whoo doggie hey not bad for sitting for five years yeah needed a little help getting started well if i sit for five minutes i need a little help getting started i've made thousands of those things yeah the only bad thing is that but i had a guy make that grapple right there i can pick up two at a time with that grapple not bad just light so you can't stab them with a hay spear so you just build a grapple for them so what we have here is three sizes of balers that are ideal for three different tractors three different people three different properties it all depends on what you have and what you want to spend but all of these serve a good purpose so i appreciate you taking time to watch the video i'll put links on the screen to a couple more of our videos and i'll see you next time
