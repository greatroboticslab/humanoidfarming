 There's nearly 100,000 farms in Missouri. That's second only to Texas. But did you know that livestock can harm our rivers and streams? Cattle can trample tree growth, increase sediment washout, and erode our stream banks. And animal waste can spread bacteria in the water. The good news is Missouri farmers are working hard to protect our water resources through conservation practices. By installing alternative watering systems for their cattle and fencing them away from the woodlands and streams, vegetation can grow resulting in cleaner water, cleaner air, and healthier natural habitats.
