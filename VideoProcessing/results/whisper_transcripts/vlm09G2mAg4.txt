 A subsidy is basically a sum of money that the state gives to people from a certain industry to keep the price of the product or service they're selling lower than it would have normally been. Let's assume it costs Bill $10 to produce a hat, whereas someone from China can do it for just $5. In this case, a $6 per hat subsidy from Uncle Sam can help Bill all of a sudden produce hats cheaper than the Chinese. In some cases, subsidies benefit society as a whole. For example, by encouraging people to develop new technologies such as solar or wind energy, or by encouraging NASA to explore the universe. In a lot of other cases, however, they do more harm than good. For example, producing cotton would normally not be all that profitable in the United States because the costs are higher than in less developed countries. The US therefore heavily subsidizes this industry at the expense of people from some of the poorest parts of the world, in some cases, who are not able to compete. Brazil, for example, got upset and took this matter to the World Trade Organization. The result? Well, the US is now subsidizing Brazilian cotton producers as well, instead of rethinking their entire cotton subsidy approach.
