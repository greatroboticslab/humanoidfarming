 Hi everybody, I'm Spencer Myers from AgDealerTV and I'm here in Hanover, Germany for Agritechnica. This is one of the world's biggest trade shows showcasing agricultural machinery from all over the world. There are 13 different pavilions here from different countries showcasing the different manufacturers from those countries. Behind me is the Canadian pavilion showcasing some of the brands here from Canada showing what we have to offer as well as seeing what the rest of the world has. So we're displaying here as part of the Canadian pavilion or one of the Canadian pavilions, this particular one organized by STEP, Saskatchewan Trade and Export Partnership, in conjunction with the Canadian government and all of the implement manufacturers. And why? The reason that it works for us to be part of a group pavilion really comes down to the logistics of setting up for a show like this, as well as some of the cost sharing that can go on. We're also in many cases going after a similar market or a similar type of customers. So it works. We have complimentary products in the same stand. How do you obviously see potential in the European market for your company? Yeah, it's less so the Western European market. There is some potential. But really this show brings people from around the world. So it provides us access to customers that are looking to buy equipment from Africa, from Asia, from Eastern Europe, as well as Western Europe and North America. So it's really a gathering place for the world of agriculture. Well, what we're doing with Ag in Motion is we're offering an opportunity for international delegations to come to Saskatchewan and test drive the different pieces of equipment, and new technology in Western Canada on our property at Ag in Motion just outside of Langham. So we're bringing the idea out to the world that if you want to purchase a large number of pieces of implements from Western Canada, you can test it out first on our property. And why have you chosen to be part of a Canadian pavilion rather than being on your own? Well, I think for us as a trade show, it's important that we're seen as working with the manufacturers. And those manufacturers are also our customers. So we really want to work hand in hand to make the business transaction that much better. Can you list off a couple of advantages, just technical or logistical advantages that you see by being a part of this show rather than on your own? Well, I certainly think, you know, being here as a group, we're able to access better space at the show, better services, because we're working as a unified group. And just like any other company, the bigger you are, the more friends you have, the better you'll be able to look to your customer. And why pick Agritechnic at a customer? Well, I think Agritechnica is probably the one show that in Europe offers the Western Canadian manufacturers the best place to market their type of agriculture technology. There are other large trade shows in Europe, such as Paris and Italy. But this one has the most number of farmers that attend that also have dry land farming technology and farm in low rainfall areas, much like Western Canada. There's no law rule in Europe. There are also most farmersários that try to производ either creat infrastructure monde jumper qui jumpfondबяг control��화aFC大 markets and local.
