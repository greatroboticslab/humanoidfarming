When we visited Tom Renner and his collection of antique farm machinery near St. Louis, we weren't able to fit it all into two episodes. This third show will feature more of Tom's collection, including his vast array of walking plows. These are different type of plows. Some of them were used as lister plows. They're not really potato plows like a lot of people think. I mean, you could probably use them that way. But the potato plow was shaped like the lister plow, except it had holes in it or rods on it that the dirt could fall through and the potatoes would lay loose. These are primarily lister plows. This is a slat-bottom plow right here. This was used predominantly for sticky black soils or clay soils where the moldboard wouldn't scour properly. And when you had the slats out, you put twice the amount of square inches of pressure on the slatted part right here, and it would have a better chance of scouring in those sticky soils. These two plows right here are early, early prairie plows. This one here is a little later. It's actually got a rolling cutter on it. Might not have actually come with a rolling cutter, but somebody's added it. The one next to it doesn't have a rolling cutter. It's actually got like a knife, and I'm sure that was better than no colder at all, but it had to present some problems when you were in grass. But that was basically when the prairie was settled. This was what we had to plow with. And this bar on the side, when you got to the end, you flopped the plow over, and it rolled on that bar while you made your headland and came back again. This is a smaller pony plow. Here again, this is a John Deere, an original John Deere. You can see there. It's a Lister plow, and that another pony plow, followed by another pony plow. This is basically a little plow you'd use in the garden for putting in a row, whether it be peas or whatever, and that was just a hand cultivator. This is a horse-drawn cultivator, and basically you steered it with your hands. You moved the shells in and out, and if your horse was a little off to the side, and that you could move your shovels to get back and forth. Totally wooden frame, except for the steel up there on the wheels and that, but a very, very early cultivator. This is a John Deere left-hand plow. Doesn't have a colander. Has a jointer on it, and that not completely rare, but not very common either, being left-handed. Another John Deere plow. This is your potato plow. A lot of times confused with that Lister plow over there. Basically, you went down your row. This shovel right here heaved the potatoes up. The dirt fell through, and the potatoes were supposedly laying on the top of the ground. It was pretty common. Almost every farmstead had one of those, because most everybody raised their own potatoes. This is a John Deere rollover plow. And that. And basically, when you got to the end, you kicked that latch, and you went right back in the same furrow. And that. Eliminate all the furrows in the field. Basically, you start on one side of the field, and you just turn right around, and went right across the field all the way. Another John Deere plow. This is really a rare plow here. They called this a rod plow. And that. There again, it was for soils that were very sticky. Some people used them in soddy conditions and that. These teeth right here were supposed to let it float. Very shallow. Yeah. It. It was a very early plow. It basically had a use in special places. Special soil types. Here again, this is an old prairie plow. For turning that stubborn sod over. No rolling colder. Very early version. And that long mow board, which gave it that. Supposedly lightened the draft. And made it a little bit easier pulling. But I'm sure with the sod, it still had to be a load for a team of horses. This is a molding plow here. A little later plow. Got a coler on it. Right. I like. Basically. I like to remember it as it was when I was a kid. You know. With. I don't care if it was a stove out of the house. If it was a wood fired stove. You know. An old. Old fan. An old, old chandelier. Old butchering equipment. Or anything like that. That was. That was related to the farm. I'm not a big furniture collector. Unless it was. A particular piece of farm furniture. And that. But. Anything that relates to the farm. I like to collect and keep. On the wall. These are the chaps that hung over the hames. Like on the harness right there. They hung over the hames. Basically. It was supposed to keep your lines and your spreader. From getting hung up on your hames as much. This is a set of. Of. Mule bridles. Mule harness. Got the gall wings. Or pigeon wings. Whatever you want to call it. On the bridles. Like that. That was primarily used just for mules. This right here is a pack saddle. Let me put this. On basically a mule or a horse. And that. And you. Put this over his. Shoulders here and that. And. You tied your packs on his saddle right here. This row of shellers is predominantly. John Deere shellers. I rescued several of these out of. In pieces. And put them back together. And. And this is an economy 10. John Deere. I think was sold out of St. Louis Missouri here. This is a new idea sheller right here. A McCormick. This is an old cast iron sheller. This is a pretty rare sheller right here. When you got your good ear. You throw those ears out. Put them in that sack. You put them on one of those to dry it good. Keep them away from the mice. And then since it was open pollinated. Not hybrid. Kind of what you saw is what you were going to get. Today if you had hybrid corn. What you saw wouldn't be what you'd get. If you tried to replant hybrid corn. It would grow. But it wouldn't be anything like the parent stock would be. And then. Now you had a dukes mixture of kernels. The ones on the ends would be the rounds. And that. The ones in the middle would primarily be flats. And the ones on the end would be. Kind of a dukes mixture. Small rounds. Large rounds. Whatever. And that. Then you'd run them through that grater. Which is. Right there behind you. And that would basically separate them by size. You'd have your rounds. Your flats. And that. And then you would. If you had a set of plates. For one of those planters. You'd have. A round plate. A flat plate. Large rounds. Small rounds. There was. 50 different plates for each planter. And then you had your specialty corns. Like popcorn. Sweet corn. That type of stuff. This. Ideal corn tester here. Has got a hundred cells in it. And basically. You put some type of heat. And you put some cotton pads. Put moisture on them. And that. You'd have like a heat lamp down there. And they're kept in a warm place. And if you had. 99 of them grow. Or sprout. You had 99% germ. And most farmers back in the day. You sampled your own corn. To see what germination was. Because you raised it on your own farm. And maybe it was a year. That you didn't have such good germination. So you generally ran a test. Like in February. To see what your germination was. To see. Hey this is corn. I should keep. Or shouldn't keep. You know. This is a little later. Model John Der Scheller. Wooden cast iron. And not that. One over here. That number 10. Is an early one. The economy. Primarily made of wood. This is a metal 1B. This is a sunshine Scheller here. This is a diamond. Two hole Scheller right here. Another John Der Scheller. here. This is a clipper fan mill. You use this to clean your seed. If you were to keep your seed beans, you'd put your seed in here and you'd run it with your hit and miss engine or some type of power. What's unique about this one, most of them you shovel the seed out of the bottom. This one actually has an elevator. They elevate the clean seed into your sacks. You could alternate the sacks on to go from one sack to the other one. Here's another type of seed cleaner right here. Got different type of grates that go with it. This right here is a very early thresh machine. This table goes down here on this end here, basically. Basically, you fed your bundles of wheat in here like this. It had a spike cylinder in it. If you look at it, it's basically just a miniature combine. This is the straw rack or straw walkers like you'd have on a combine today. A spike cylinder wouldn't be a bit uncommon. The southern combines use spikes and still use spikes yet today in that. This would be a horse drawn. One horse, single horse, John Deere cultivator. Another John Deere plow. This is a Chattanooga rollover plow right here. You just kick the pedal right there and that releases the latch and your moldboard swings right over. The other one is a little bit more. I like to show it to people that are interested, who are primarily interested, or remember it, and have a real feel for the fact that it's old. They used it when they were a kid or something like that. A lot of the machinery comes in, the pieces come in that are in bad shape. They need a lot of work, a lot of restoration. And very little comes in here that looks like it does today. There's nothing I'd rather do than, I guess, than go out there with a team of horses and rake hay. But I have less than no patience, so it won't happen. So, predominantly, all we use the horses for is fun activities. You know, we go to some of these plowing events and steam shows, and I've worked with a couple different fairs on these relay races with horses. And that's, you know, we've kind of put our own program together. And I do several of those for different fairs and that. And that's generally in August when we're not so busy. And that's a good time, fun time we do with those. But as far as actually going out and farming, no, I don't. This is a McCormick Deering, primarily it's wheat or oat drill, but primarily it was used for wheat. And what you do with this drill is you'd go down between the rows of corn, it had these shields on the front, and you'd actually walk a mule down between the rows. And you've got to remember rows in those days were 40 or 44 inches. And it was a nasty job, but you did this prior to harvesting the corn. That way when you harvested the corn off, shocked your corn, your wheat was already established. And that, so a lot of the farms, depending upon your area, had one of these. This is the same thing right here as a John Deere, a Van Brunt, except it doesn't have the shields on it. And that, but I talked to a couple farmers that had used them, and they said, you wore a raincoat and a rain hat regardless of the weather, just to keep the corn leaves from cutting you to pieces. You had to have something over your face all the time. This is an apple cider press right here. These are wine barrels. This was a strainer. This was actually off of our family's wine press right here. It's been in the family for over a hundred years. And that, we used this for years to make wine. This is something that's quite unique right here. This is an iceless well cooler. And that, and a lot of farmers just used a bucket and they crank it down the well to keep your cream or some of the goods you had in the house that wouldn't fit in the ice box cool. But this basically was a, for that particular job, you kept your pie, your butter, your cream, milk, anything like that. You wanted to keep cool. And this basically kept it at ground temperature because it was probably 25, 30 foot, not in the water, but right above the water. And you cranked it up and down at mealtime to get what you needed out of your, basically your iceless cooler. And then after lunch was over, you put it back in a well. Over here we have wooden chicken coops, wooden or steel chicken feeders. Up above here we have brooder nests where basically you kept a centen hen with a nest full of eggs so the coons wouldn't get them. Two different kinds of those right here. This is a harness vise right here. Basically you strapped your harness, the part you were going to work in, right up in here. You sat on it like this. That took the pressure off. You snapped them shut like this and you worked on your harness where you were going to stitch it or rivet or whatever you're going to do. It's a harness vise. There's another butter churn there. We can talk about this a little bit. This is a Loudon hay sling. And basically when you had your hay wagon, you put a pair of these on the floor of the wagon and you had your hay loader or you pitched it on by hand and you filled your wagon up. And then when you got to the barn, you gathered up this hay sling and gathered up that hay and you hooked it on a hook on a rope that was going to pull this big bundle of hay up into the barn. It got to the top. You brought it in on one of these track carriers right here. And then you tripped the one side of it. That opened up the sling and it dropped down in a pile. You had the horse down on the ground and he was pulling the rope that was pulling this bundle of hay up in the barn. And that was fine when he went forward like this, pulling on that rope. When he got to the end of where he was going and the hay was up in the barn, he had to back up. Well, normally you'd use a straight single tree, but this single tree right here attached to the britching. So when he backed up, he didn't step on the single tree and mess up the rope. And that's what these are all about right here. Basically kept the single tree from dropping on the ground and the horse from stepping on it. These are pitments, different pitments for mowers. This is an old hand pump. Basically you stuck this in a pond wherever you want to suck water from. And you pumped it out into whatever kind of a vessel you wanted to put it into. This right here is kind of unique. This is a rope maker. You attach five pieces of twine or a lot of people now use actually plastic tine. And then you've got a little treadle that holds out here to keep them separated. And then some body stands here and cranks it. And then when it comes out, it's a perfect rope. And that they do a beautiful job. And that and they're pretty rare and collectible. This is a little pony sled back here. Wooden pony sled, bobsled. And that. We had a couple downstairs, but there for horses a lot bigger and heavier. This is a bread mold here. I do know that. Basically you put your dough in there and you knead it in that big wooden tub there. And it's a bread mold. Oh definitely. You know, and I deal with the younger people I deal with today. I mean they're, you know, very computer savvy and they want everything you can possibly get on a new piece of equipment. You know, in a line of computer equipment and fancy stuff like that. I'm not against it, but most of the stuff we farm with is larger equipment. But we don't have any auto steer or any of the fancy. It's still mechanical. It's still mechanical. Yeah. And I'm very involved with the problems with all the automation. Because I hear of everybody's problem. You know, if it happens, I know about it. You know, and I guess that's another thing that turns me off. I just, when I get to the field, I just want to go. I don't need to be fancy. I don't have to lift something by hand, pull the lever rather than push a button. I just want it to work. And I want it to work all day, every day. You know. This is a 1900 John Deere two seat Surrey. It's pretty original. Still got the original leather fenders on it. Still got the original authentic guarantee sticker below the seat. Made of genuine oak and hickory wood and guaranteed for a year against defects or faulty workmanship. This is some of the variegation of it and that, but it certainly was out to be a 1900. That's an enclosed buggy here. We have three John Deere buggies here. This is a two seat, a single seat, and a single seat with a top. They're all Deere's. This is a Lansing box wagon. This is a Birdsell box wagon. Here Birdsell made several different things. It was well known for thrash machines and Birdsell was very well known for its clover hauler. They sold a lot, a lot of clover haulers. This is kind of unique right here. This is a livestock wagon. Basically, if you had hogs or sheep to haul and you had to get them to market, you needed a way to get them there. Basically, this is how you did it. You run them in this end. It had a top on it so they couldn't jump out. You took them to market. And haven't seen many of these at all. This is another belly dump dirt wagon. Pretty original yet. Most of the wood and the fellows and the spokes and the hubs are all original on it yet. Basically, you kicked the lever here and tripped it, and the bottom fell out, and you jumped your load of dirt or coal or gravel, whatever it was. This is a hay tedder. And hay tedders aren't uncommon, but this one is uncommon because it's almost all totally wood. All the kicker arms on it are wooden. It's a wooden frame, a wooden tongue. What's really unique about it is you use this lever right here, and you're actually pulling the gear mechanism, the frame, into these bull gears on the wheel. And it's very crude, but very simple, and evidently worked very well. This hay tedder's over 100 years old, and for it still to be alive in this kind of condition speaks pretty well for itself, especially with the wood and that. It's very unusual. OK, on the far end, we have a spinning wheel, and that basically people used to take their wool from the sheep and spin it into yarn, and then make all type of clothing and that with it. After that, we have a coffee grinder, a large coffee grinder. And then there's a butter churn. I think it was a 10-gallon butter churn there. And then we have an old horse-drawn hand cedar. Following that, there's an apple cider press. That actually cut the apples up as well as squeezed them. And that. And this is kind of a unique item here. This is a rollover pony plow. There's quite a few horse plows that roll over, but this is a rollover pony plow. And it's almost in brand new shape yet. And then we've got this old, very primitive wooden fork right here. And next to it here, we have a copper still in that, for making your favorite beverage. Basically, I like to remember it as it was when I was a kid, you know, with, I don't care if it was a stove out of the house, if it was a wood-fired stove, you know, an old, old fan, an old, old chandelier, old butchering equipment, or anything like that that was related to the farm. I'm not a big furniture collector, unless it was a particular piece of farm furniture and that. But anything that relates to the farm, I like to collect and keep.
