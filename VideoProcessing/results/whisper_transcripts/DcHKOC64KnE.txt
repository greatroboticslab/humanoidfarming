 She said I'd throw myself away They're just photos after all I can't make you hang around I can't wash you off my skin Outside the flame Is what we're leaving now You won't remember anywhere I can go with the flower Don't say it doesn't matter It doesn't matter anymore I can go with the flower I can go with the flower You believe it in your head It's so safe to play along Little soldiers in love Falling in and out loud Something sweet to throw away I want something good to die for To make it beautiful to live I want a new mistake Loses more than hesitate You believe it in your head I can go with the flower Don't say it doesn't matter Don't say it doesn't matter Let her run and roll I can go with the flower I can go with the flower You believe it in your head You believe it in your head You believe it in your head Love, love, love
