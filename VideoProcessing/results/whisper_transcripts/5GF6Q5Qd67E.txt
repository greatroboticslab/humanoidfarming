Science & Technology
 This giant silver structure is called a grain bin, and it's where a lot of crops go after they're harvested. This particular one can hold about 8,000 bushels, or 220 tons, of corn. To store this much grain in one place, the farmer has to make sure it's dry, because if it isn't, it could get moldy and spoil. Farmers do their best to harvest grain with moisture below a certain level, and modern combines can even track this data in the field. But sometimes the weather or other conditions don't cooperate. Thankfully, grain bins are designed to help dry things out. Now, before we look inside, I need to mention that grain bins can be extremely dangerous, because it's possible to get trapped in the grain and suffocate. Only a farmer or a trained professional with safety gear should ever enter a grain bin, which is why we're staying on the outside and looking in with our cameras. After the farmer fills this bin, a giant fan connected to a heater forces hot air through tiny holes in the floor and up through the grain, drying it out. It's really loud! Long augers from above stir the grain, helping air to circulate so everything dries evenly. Eventually, the grain reaches a safe moisture level for storage. And when the time comes, the bin is emptied by an auger built into the floor. Once it's empty, the bin is ready for the next harvest, so the farmer can fill it up and dry it out all over again. And that is the way it works.
