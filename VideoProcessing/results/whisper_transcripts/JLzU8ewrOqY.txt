 Welcome to the University of Maryland's Department of Plant Science and Landscape Architecture. We invite you to explore our Agricultural Science and Technology major. Hi, my name is Dr. Bill Phillips and I'm the director of the Agricultural Science and Technology program here at the University of Maryland. The Agricultural Science and Technology major is divided into three specializations. First is the Agronomy, Second is Environmental Horticulture, and Third is Agricultural and Extension Education. The Agronomy major is focused on the sustainable production of food, feed, fiber, and fuel crops. Students in the Agronomy major take courses that focus on crops, soils, animals, and the environment. Overall, students from our Agronomy program go on to work in the area of Agronomy, where they either grow high yielding, flavorful, nutritious foods sustainably, or assist others to produce our food. Environmental Horticulture is understanding the role plants play in building healthy living environments. From traditional fruit and vegetable farms to urban farms. From plant production to public gardens. The Environmental Horticulture Specialization at the University of Maryland focuses not only on growing plants, but growing people. By planting the foundation for you to cultivate a career creating healthy living environments. Whether that is growing the food we eat, or the crops we drink, or producing the plants that create the oxygen we breathe, it's completely up to you. We just ask you have fun along the way. Your degree in Agricultural and Extension Education can be a gateway to teaching in K-12 schools. Or leading an outreach educational project for agricultural industries. Maybe a revolutionary way to help nonprofits help solve food, fiber, and fuel challenges. Get ready for the future with the University of Maryland. Let's go! Do you enjoy hands-on learning and teaching others using real-world applications? There's a great population that needs help in understanding how food, fuel, and fiber are produced. Are you ready to help? Maryland is often said to be America in miniature. At the University of Maryland, it's a field of opportunity for individuals interested in studying agriculture and Extension Education. Our holistically designed program enables students to take courses in all the different areas of agriculture and education. Take some time to check us out! How do you grow high-yielding, flavorful, nutritious food sustainably? I'm Dr. Nicole Firolino, an assistant professor and Extension Specialist in Agronomy in the Department of Plant Science and Landscape Architecture. The Agronomic Field Research Program performs research to provide guidance and recommendations to growers that help them maximize yield and farm profitability, while minimizing negative environmental impacts. We evaluate crop varieties, new crop production products, and new management strategies and technologies, all with the goal of balancing high yields and protection of the environment. We are even evaluating novel crops such as industrial hemp, which may provide increased revenue to growers and positive impacts to the environment. Hello, my name is Dr. Macarena Farquoo, and I am an assistant professor at the Department of Plant Sciences and Landscape Architecture at the University of Maryland. So, in our lab, we mainly focus on working with fruits. We want to really, as a lab, help and contribute to developing novel strategies in order to improve overall fruit quality. And that includes increasing the flavor of the fruit, the texture of the fruit, the color of the fruit, but also the nutritional value of fruits. And we try to do this sustainably. Join us in learning how to grow high yielding, flavorful, nutritious foods sustainably. For more information, please visit www.psla.umd.edu.
