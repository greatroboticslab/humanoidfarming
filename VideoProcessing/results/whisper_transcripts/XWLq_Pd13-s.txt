 Hi, I'm Jesse Vollmer, the co-founder and CEO of Farmlogs. I grew up on a 1200 acre row crop farm myself and I founded a company, Farmlogs, to help make it easier for growers to access information that can really help us run our farms better. So for instance, we monitor rainfall at the field where you don't have to go and check a gauge anymore. We can, with the push of a button on your app, on your Farmlogs app on your phone, get information about what's happening in the field, rain, heat accumulation as well. And then this year we're actually able to measure and monitor crop health and then alert you to problems in the field in season. So at a very high resolution we're able to use satellite imagery to monitor and pinpoint those yield threats on the farm, which is really exciting. We're able to catch these problems that you wouldn't be able to find by just walking the fields and alert people to that. And what's very unique and special about the Farmlogs offering is that we don't just give you another rainbow color map that you have to then interpret and try to understand what is this information telling me, where we often feel like we're getting overloaded with new information. And Farmlogs is incredibly simple where you get a map that shows you the exact spot that has a problem in the field and only that spot that has a problem. So you can walk right out to the area that you need to scout. So you can sign up for free at farmlogs.com and learn a lot more information about that. We also have a world-class customer success team behind Farmlogs. So if you have any questions there, they'll help as well. This video is brought to you by farms.com
