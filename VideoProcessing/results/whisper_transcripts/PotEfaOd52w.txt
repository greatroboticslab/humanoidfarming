 Data management today is often done the traditional method, pen and paper, or with a complicated data management system. There's increasing compliance and regulations that farmers have to deal with and they're just drowning in the extra work. It's time to use some new tools that make it easy for farmers to log all their jobs, record their harvest in real time, map their fields and connect their weather station with their farm management systems. My name is Russell Davison and I work for FarmWall. FarmWall is an orchard management platform designed exclusively for fruit and tree crop growers, with you the grower at its core. It's quick and easy to set up, user friendly, mobile first and desktop supported. It was founded by a team of Norwegian growers who co-own Norway's largest fruit farm. It's used by over 8,000 growers globally today. Growers use FarmWall today to gain full control over their farming operations. Track, record, organise all that information to allow better decision making year on year. FarmWall offers an easy to use mobile app and web portal to organise daily activities in the orchard and improve communication between their farming team. The information needed into FarmWall today can be used to take full advantage of new tools and technology in your orchard. With FarmWall growers can get an overview of the fields on your farm, work in a team with farm operators and advisers, see what your crew are up to today and what still needs to be done before a next weather event.
