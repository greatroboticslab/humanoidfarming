 Did you know that one tablespoon of soil contains more living organisms than the entire population of humans on Earth? Keep your soil healthy this growing season by using compost, which adds essential nutrients. Use cover crops in between growing seasons to preserve the soil. Once terminated, the roots and biomass will decompose, adding organic matter. Plant a diverse range of crops and flowers to support a wide array of microbes, and use mulch to retain soil moisture. Mulch also provides a layer of protection for microbes.
