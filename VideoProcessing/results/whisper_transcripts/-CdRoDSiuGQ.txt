 Grass-fed versus grain-fed. What's the difference? So grass-fed beef has been fed in grass its whole life and you can see on the label of this there's no pesticides and there's no antibiotics there's no chemicals in it. So if you have a cow that's eating grass its whole life there's a higher chance that it's going to be free from glyphosate, free from pesticides. The meat is going to be more nutritious there's going to be more nutrients in it. When you feed a cow grains at the end of its life it's going to be fattier it might taste a little differently but those grains are probably sprayed with pesticides like glyphosate they could have mold, mold toxins. There's all kinds of stuff they can get in those grains. So I feel strongly that a grass-fed grass-finished beef is going to be better for you. It's more nutritious. It's better for the animal. The animal stays on pasture its whole life. The animal's healthier and in the long term it's definitely better for the land and the planet because those animals eating grass their whole lives are regenerating the soil and improving the health of the actual ecosystem they're in. So I believe strongly that grass-fed beef is worth the extra cost. In my opinion it tastes better. It's more nutritious and it doesn't have a lot of the potential pesticides and other issues that can come along with grain-finished beef.
