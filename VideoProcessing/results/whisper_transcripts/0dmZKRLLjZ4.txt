 Beef. From farm to fork. Humans have been farming animals for food for thousands of years. And today that's still how we get most of the meat we eat. Including beef, lamb, pork and chicken. Cattle raised for beef live on farms like this one in Devon. There are around 200 cattle in this farmer's herd. He works hard all year round to take care of them and make sure they are happy and healthy. The farmer looks after the cattle until they are around 2 years old. The usual age at which they are turned into the beef we eat. In the United Kingdom there are strict laws to ensure that all animals, including the ones we farm for meat, are properly cared for and treated well. Each animal is tagged so that it can be kept track of through each stage of its life. This is called an ear tag. The cattle live in different conditions depending on the time of year. In the summer time, when it is warm, they live outside in the field and eat fresh grass. In the winter they live inside, as it is too cold and wet for them to stay out in the field. They live in a barn like this one and sleep on straw keeping them warm and dry. On this farm, when they are inside, the farmer gives them a special feed containing barley, oats, sugar beet, minerals and vitamins. He also feeds them silage, which is preserved grass. The cattle can eat up to 30 kilograms of fresh food every day. On top of this, each animal drinks about 50 litres of water. That's enough to fill a bathtub! When it is time for the cattle to be turned into meat, they are taken to an abattoir to be killed and become what we call carcasses. They are then left to mature in large fridges. Once mature, each carcass is then made into lots of different beef products. At your local Tesco store, you can see the different cuts of meat including beef joints, steak, mince and burgers. Ready for you to buy and enjoy for your dinner.
