And you don't need any fancy crow lights, you don't need any heating mats, you don't need any special space. We're not talking about scraps from the kitchen. We're not talking about hydroponics. We're just talking about veggies and soil that you can grow year-round. Show off your fantasy reality, whoa, that's yours but I'll keep doing mine.

I want to see what you're growing and what's going on in your zone and in your garden. Go ahead, post over there. It's Container Crops on Facebook and you can always find me on IG at The Scaredy Cat Gardener. I'm going to make this short, quick and simple. We're going to get right into it. Okay, like I said, I'm not talking about kitchen scraps that you can restart veggies from. I'm not talking about citrus trees that you bring inside. This is real food that you can grow indoors year round. You don't need any expensive equipment, expensive grow lights, no shop lights, nothing like that. So what are these 10 vegetables? Okay, so first up we have carrots. Like most root veggies, they require little sun. Next up we have bush beans. Unlike pole beans, bush beans require little space and it's one fruiting crop that doesn't require a lot of sun. Scallions. They're preennials. You can keep it growing just by snipping the leafy green parts off as it grows. Number four, sprouts and micro greens. You can grow them in soil and propagation trays. And guess what? They need no drainage holes because they require very little water. Believe it or not, number five on my list is garlic. And although you can only grow the garlic greens, they are still delicious and work well in many recipes. Salad greens. If you pick the baby leaves, they can be grown also very close together. Greens you can grow inside include things like loose leaf lettuce, chard, mustard greens, arugula, and there are many, many more. Radish. Believe it or not, they can be grown inside. But they have shallow roots and require just a little bit of space. Peas. You need to pick a non-vining variety that grows upright to maybe about 18 inches and they'll do just fine. Beets. Just like radish have shallow roots. Thin them and use the leaves like micro greens. Baby beets. Baby beets mature in about 60 days. And one of my favorite. Micro tomatoes. Now these are special mini varieties. They only grow about maybe 10 inches tall. 12 at the most. And you can use a one-gallon pot and produce lots of juicy red cherry tomatoes. Now you will need a few supplies to grow these. The normal things you'll need, of course, your containers and some soil and some water. Those are the common things that you know you'll need. It would help if you have a south-facing window. If you have an area that's humid where you can have some humidity or create your humidity. And then you need a space that has some good air circulation. And that's it. Now if you don't have a south-facing window but you just have a room that gets a moderate amount of sunlight. Then these 10 veggies will do just fine. This is an amazing thing because sometimes when we grow in small spaces, we don't always have a lot of outdoor space to grow in. And this will allow us to grow more indoors. So I hope you guys enjoyed this list. And by all means, this list is not all-inclusive. This is just my list. This is my favorite list. Hopefully, it'll get you thinking outside of the box. And you can create a list of varieties and things that you can check into to see if you can grow them year-round indoors. Also, I want to say that growing indoors sometimes is a benefit if you live in an area that has a very short growing season. Because of the weather, the cold, or the sunlight, the daylight, growing inside can be a major benefit to keep you growing your own food. Okay, guys. So that's going to do it for today.
