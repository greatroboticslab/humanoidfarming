 So Julius Malema, the man who sang Kill the Boar, Kill the Farmer, wants to seize all the white farms in South Africa. But what happened in Zimbabwe when this very thing occurred? In the year 2000, Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe decided to seize the highly successful and productive farms of the around 4,500 white farmers in the country. Mugabe supporters, many claiming to be war veterans, descended on the white properties, forcibly evicting their owners. The sieges were violent. Both white farmers and black farm workers were killed in this process, and looting and destruction were commonplace. But unlike the whites, who had decades of specialized skill and knowledge of farming, Mugabe's loyalists who took over were clueless when it came to the practice. And in the country that was once called the breadbasket of Africa, starvation and famine set in. The seizure of the farms caused economic collapse, with the government printing more money to meet its obligations and causing hyperinflation, which incredibly at its peak was around 80 billion percent per month and caused the printing of the $100 trillion Zimbabwe bank.
