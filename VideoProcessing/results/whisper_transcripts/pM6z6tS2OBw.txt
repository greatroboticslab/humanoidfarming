Science & Technology
 Velocity, the cabinet rotary milking system. The Velocity is designed to never stop turning and increase your milking speed like never before. With its robust low profile cabinets, the cows flow easier and faster without the obstruction of vertical stall posts, creating a stress-free and efficient working environment. The cluster washer folds out for attachment to the teat cups and retracts for milking. A support arm guides the cluster into the milking position. It swings out of the way on detachment, reducing significant time and labour. With the Velocity, you can select between a high-performance composite deck technology or the more traditional concrete deck. It is designed to provide an anatomically correct and faster milking environment for any size cow. 24-7 performance and longevity for a stress-free milking environment. This is Velocity.
