Howto & Style
 You want to know the fastest way to get germination outside of water and using a quality Mountain View seed? It's going to be this tool right here. And it's just a simple garden weasel that you can pick up from your local big box. You can order them off of Amazon. But what it does is it incorporates the seed into the soil. Once you've incorporated that seed into the soil, it is now more protected from the birds that people worry about all the time. And it also holds more moisture and it gives you that seed to soil contact that is very critical for the establishment of that new seed. You don't need peat moss. You don't need straw. You don't need a cover. Just use the soil that you already got.
