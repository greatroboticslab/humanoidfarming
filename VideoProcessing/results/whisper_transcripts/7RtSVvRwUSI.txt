 Reduce the evaporation with shade, wind buffering, and organic matter, which comes from the shading element of the trees. Then we need to take all the fresh water as possible that falls on the land, interrupt its flow on the surface because there will be floods in dry areas regularly. All the rain usually comes at once. So we need to capture it with features like this with swales. Then we've had a wet period here, so you can see this is starting to soak water. This has been really full and now it's all soaking in. Enormous amounts of water go into the ground. This is 100% fresh water. So this starts to flush the salt. Then when you plant trees on this swale bank in time to the rain, they start to increase shade, extending the water further, wind buffering to extend the water further, reducing evaporation, adding organic matter, which extends this fresh unsalted water further.
