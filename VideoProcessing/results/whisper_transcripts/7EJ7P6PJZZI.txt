 So we're doing prep work here. I just want to show quickly the benefits of mulching. I just took off all the leaf litter that's been on this bed for the last half a year. I just want to show this is a dandelion. Just to give an idea of how good that soil is. Look at that. Pull the whole thing out by the root in one move. Which indicates a good 15-20 centimeters of pure gorgeous soil. As you can see it's full of roots. Full of life. Totally aerated. Let's see a little closer. Alright. Look at that. And of course, you can even, if you look, this is the last dandelion that I pulled up. If you look closer you can see how much the worms have been working on it. Look at that. See all those holes? Each one of those is a worm's nest. And you can see the mixture of black carbon, brown clay, crumbles. Gorgeous. Super easy to weed. There's some other guys doing the work right there. Super easy to weed. Retains moisture. Keeps the weeds away. The ones that do make it through are very easy to weed out. So I prep this bed in five minutes or something like that. And then, like I did over here, sowing. What I'm doing now is, I'm just sowing fast growing crops. Here we have lettuce, coriander, fenugreek, lettuce, atriplex or tensus. At least this whole bed here will fill in within the next week or two. While the tomatoes and cucumbers put on weight up in there. Heated at night time. Greenhouses. Little greenhouses. Little greenhouses. Little greenhouses. And that's the way you do it. One bottleneck at a time.ателя. Joe. familiar inص
