 You're here in Northfield at the Countryman Peony Farm. And all around me is the smell of peonies. We're just trying to be good stewards of the land and just carry on Mr. Countryman's legacy. People aren't buying just a peony plant. Some might think they are. They've got a piece of history. We have 185 acres. Number of plants, I'm guessing 4,000 plants. That's a ballpark. Somewhere in the area of 600 varieties. Peony Express is a ride! So we started a new tradition on Father's Day. So we meet for breakfast and then come out here. My husband's not here so he doesn't know I'm gonna buy a plant. But I am. Enjoy the beauty. Just gonna hold on to it as long as I can. Bill Countryman can't pay the guy enough accolades from years past of what he did and what he created here. He was a botanist professor in Norwich so he wanted a collection. So you have a French collection, a British collection, and then just early, mids, late, the blooms. You saw the size of the roots coming out of the ground. I know. And right now is the start of the bigger bloom and it's gonna run for another week. Fabulous! I'll be right there. And we're not peony aficionados at all. Retirement for us. Yeah. I'm a retired Connecticut trooper. I worked for the FBI for 30 years. We can say it's retirement. It's harder work physically. Much more mentally rewarding. Yes. Happy lucky day sir! Your lucky day! And I do think that the stars aligned at the right time. Somebody somewhere thought that we would be the right people for this place. So please walk, enjoy. Okay? I love interacting with the folks. Hold on. I've only rolled it once this year. So just today we had people from St. Johnsbury, Jericho, all over the state. Yesterday was New Hampshire. New Hampshire, two hour drive. And Connecticut. Last year we had people visiting from China who came here three times over the few weeks they were here. That plant's been sitting there parked for 16 years. So 16, 17 years. That plant's in there and it's still surviving. So that goes to show you how hardy the peony is. Monster roots. Yeah. This is a great state to live in. This is where to be. This is part of the state of the people. But everyone talks about, oh that's God's country. We're here. We're here.
