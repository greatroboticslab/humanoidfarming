 For a long, long time I didn't know what's happening to the cows and the chickens in the dairy and egg industry. So once I learned that they forcefully impregnate the cows, take their babies away, kill the boils, exploit the mothers for five years until they kill them, grind up the male chickens, so it's a lot of injustice in there. And once I learned that I said, okay, I'm a hypocrite saying that I love animals still consuming those products. So that's when I went vegan, like four years ago. We show videos from the international animal agriculture. It doesn't matter if it is organic or factory farming because it's always an animal. These are videos from all over the world, even from Germany. So regularly we just let the people watch the documentaries, maybe for 30 seconds, and then we speak to them and we ask them questions to really think about it, to take a breath and maybe then talk because these are very, very hard documentaries. Nobody wants to see it, but everyone wants to eat it. You're not going to talk to somebody that never thought about veganism and get them vegan in a second. You are just going to plant a seed and then the next person or the next video they're going to see is going to put a little water on the seed and at the end the plants of veganism grow. And we can be the last person to talk to them and they're going vegan or the first video of killing of animals they're going to see in their life. Some people might criticize that we are hiding ourselves behind the mask, but the concept is first the meaning of V for Vendetta, which is about uncovering injustices and fighting against it. Then the second reason is when you go up to a cube of truth and watch the videos, it's better for you not to feel observed. So when someone is wearing the mask, you don't feel like he's judging me or he's gauging my facial reactions. So it makes it easier for people to watch the video. I just came from there and I saw them all wearing this mask. First of all, it's cool. It absolutely attracted my attention. And also, I just had a really nice conversation with a dude there. And we talked about, that's really human to kill animals. And we shared our different opinions. I think it's good. Because normally you are working your own life, in your normal life, you don't think about these questions that often, that deep. Because eating meat for us is just too normal. The question I always ask at the beginning is, what do you think? What are your feelings about that? And then I always precise that there's no wrong or right answer to that question. And then I always say, okay, so are you against animal cruelty or do you not like that people harm the animals? And everybody says, no, I don't like that. And they say, but do you pay every day for the people that do that? And they're like, yeah, that's the point. And I'm saying, like, yeah, it's not about judging people. It's just about making them realize and connect the fact that they are paying for people to do what they don't like to see the people do. Tell us about the vegan, the violence against animals in the charter, in the big factories, animal factories. And we have a small talk about to be vegan for one week. So I'm not vegan now. And I'll try it for one week. Being vegan on my own wasn't enough for me because I realized that's a good step to do something yourself. But I want to spread information to more people and in a nice way. Sometimes in my own environment, people get kind of aggressive when you tell them you're vegan. And they get like bad punches. Here it's a good way to get positive information and to spread something which is maybe contributing to a better world.
