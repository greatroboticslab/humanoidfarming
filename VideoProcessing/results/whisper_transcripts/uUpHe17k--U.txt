 Kurt, today we're revisiting the climate conversation and in a past episode we chatted a little bit about climate change and some of our perspectives with like methane and Taylor Swift's private jet, but now we're here to find out the farmer's perspective. Yeah, as our guest today we had the editor of Southwest Farm Press, Shelley Hughley in Texas, and she talked a lot about how she and her husband on their own farm have been working to make their farm more resilient and how they adjust their practices, you know, to improve the conservation on their own place.
