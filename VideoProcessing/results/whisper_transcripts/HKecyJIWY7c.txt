 I'm Andrew Bavarnik, I'm the global head of the UNDP's Green Commodities Program. Well our aspirations at the highest level are extremely ambitious, it's really to change the way the world produces these key agricultural commodities so that they can be produced in a way that is economically beneficial to the countries, are affordable to the consumers, but are produced in a manner that are environmentally and socially sustainable, that do help act as drivers of rural development and poverty reduction, yet at the same time they're not imposing pressures and negative impacts on the natural resources and the ecology and ecosystems in these countries. And the way we are really trying to tackle this is to try to work at the national level, at the national scale, with the national governments and their sub-government counterparts and with the markets to restructure systemically how commodities are produced. Changing and improving, strengthening legal regulatory policy frameworks and their enforcement is absolutely fundamental if we want to see sectoral shifts, only the government can do that. How can governments, as well as other key stakeholders and even producers, work together to create these systemic solutions? And the way we're doing that is we have been pioneering national commodity platforms and these platforms are a space to facilitate and construct these partnerships so that these partnerships can happen in reality. I think that people are recognizing the need for multi-stakeholder dialogue space at the national level to really create the systemic change we're looking for. We need everybody involved at all levels of the global economy. And change is slow. Particularly if you think about agriculture, farmers, they've been producing their products in the same way for a very long time. You know, you need to educate almost a whole new generation. And also governments, quite understandably, are hesitant to open up dialogue with other participants in a meaningful manner manner with economic sectors that are so crucial to their country's development. But we are convinced that this process, this way of working, is not just a drop in the ocean. It's like a stone dropping in a flat lake. The ripple effects, and we see these ripple effects, are enormous. And slowly, more people join the platforms, the platforms become more meaningful. We start seeing change generated by the platforms that then reinforces more interest. You know, the reason we're going after systemic change is by definition. It's changing the system and therefore will change the way the countries operate. It's not a temporary fix. to turn it to the end of negative change to between the play."
