 Today's medical-centric topic is Too Little Breast Milk? How to Increase Low Milk Supply Breastfeeding is an excellent way to provide essential nutrients and strengthen the bond between a mother and her newborn baby. However, some mothers may experience low milk supply, making it a frustrating and overwhelming experience. In such cases, mothers can try several ways to increase their milk supply. 1. Breastfeed Frequently Breastfeeding frequently is the best way to increase milk supply. Feeding the baby on demand helps stimulate the hormones responsible for milk production. Ideally, a mother should aim to feed her baby every 2-3 hours during the day and every 3-4 hours at night. Breastfeeding can also help build a strong emotional bond between the mother and the baby. 2. Skin-to-skin Contact Skin-to-skin contact between the mother and the baby can promote the release of hormones that stimulate milk production. Holding the baby close to the bare chest of the mother without any clothing or blankets in between can help the baby feel warm and secure. This practice can also provide the mother with an opportunity to bond with her baby and help reduce stress levels. 3. Breast Compression Breast compression is a technique that can help increase milk flow during breastfeeding. The mother can apply gentle pressure on the breast tissue with her hand while the baby is nursing. Breast compression can help the baby get more milk, and it can signal the body to produce more milk. 4. Pump After Feedings A mother can use a breast pump after feedings to stimulate milk production and increase milk supply. Pumping can help empty the breast more completely, which can signal the body to produce more milk. However, it's essential to avoid over-pumping, as it can lead to sore nipples and decreased milk supply. 5. Stay Hydrated and Nourished Drinking plenty of water and maintaining a balanced diet can help support milk production. A mother should aim to drink at least 8 to 10 glasses of water per day and include foods rich in protein, calcium, and healthy fats in her diet. Eating oatmeal, fenugreek, and other foods that promote lactation can also help increase milk supply. 6. Consider Herbs and Supplements Certain herbs and supplements may also help increase milk supply, such as fenugreek, blessed thistle, and fennel. However, it's important to speak with a healthcare provider before using any herbs and supplements, as they can have side effects and interact with other medications. It's crucial to remember that every woman's breastfeeding journey is unique and is common to experience fluctuations in milk supply. It's important to seek support from a lactation consultant or healthcare provider if experiencing challenges in breastfeeding. With patience, perseverance, and a positive mindset, mothers can work towards increasing their milk supply and provide their baby with the best possible nutrition. Thank you for watching our video.
