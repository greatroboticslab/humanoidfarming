 helps the voiceless creature hello everyone welcome to my channel the wet tutorial today we are going to study about the preservation of fodder so preservation of fodder can be done by two methods first is hay making and second is silage making so reason why we need to preserve the green fodder first to make availability of fodder during scarcity period and second is to avoid the wastage of excess fodder produced during the peak season but before starting this subscribe my channel and also click the bell icon and if you like this video give a very big thumbs up let's begin so in this video i'm only going to cover the hay making so let's start with the hay making before going into the depth of hay making like its processes and so on let's first know what is hay so hay is the product obtained by cutting and curing the entire herbage of fine stemmed grasses or legumes so that the moisture content of the product is not more than 12 to 14 percentage then let's see some of the suitable crops for hay making oats sorghum maize dicanthium species doob grass cowpea lucerne sandham etc then let's study about the requecides for the good hay good quality can be produced by considering the following points first is selection of crop the crop to be made as hay should have soft pliable stem second is harvesting of crop the crop should be harvested at two-third flowering stage as it is at that time the plant will have the maximum nutrient in it delaying the harvesting further would divert the nutrient from the plant to the seed production resulting in low nutritive value of the harvested crop third is hay should be leafy and green in color as they reflect the nutritive value of the hay fourth is he should be free from molds and weeds and fifth is he should have the characteristic aroma of the crop then let's study about the methods of hay making so there are four methods of hay making first is field curing second is by hanging third is cogs and stacking and fourth is modern method so in hanging method it can be done by three types first is on tripod second is on fence and third is on racks and in modern method it can be done by two types first is by electrical drying and second is by shade drying so let's study each of them in detail first is by field curing the herbage is allowed to lie in the field for few hours until it is well wilted and then it is ranked into small loops heap known as windrows in order to hasten curing the windows can be turned after every four to five hours and then in the evening moisture reduces 75 percent to 40 percent and in next day it requires one to two turning moisture content in the second day comes to 25 percent and end of the curing moisture will be reduced to 20 percent normally 70 to 75 percent sunshine hours requires and remember that it is not suitable for rainy season then let's study about by hanging method this type of method can be used when the grasses contain more amount of water like if the grasses are wet by the rain water so by hanging the water runs off quickly and drying is rapid so on tripod method three iron poles are fixed on the ground at different height over which the crop is hanged then second is on racks on the higher spot in the corner of the field iron bars are posted across each other and hay is put on it but the main problem is that the air circulation is very less and third is on farm fences so it is of similar kind like we can hang the crop on the farm fences so it can be dried rapidly then the next method of hay making is cocks and stacking the hay is tied into the bundles to minimize the loss of leaves due to shattering in the beginning when moisture content is high the bundles are kept erect supporting each other for air circulation and then the moisture content is reduced the bundles are kept in the stacks then the last method of hay making is modern method when weather is unfavorable for the hay making the crop is sharp into the small pieces which can be dried into the following ways first is electrical drying in this method the hot air is passed to the small pieces unit the moisture content is less than 12 percent the drying is performed in the hot chambers then second is shade drying hay curing is done under the shed of convenient size with a slanting rod supported by the pillars then let's study about the judging of cured hay in order to judge whether the hay is properly cured two thumb rule methods are available first is scrap method and second is twist method so in scrap method with the nail try to scrap the epidermis from the stem of the plant if the epidermis can be peeled from the stem then it is not sufficiently cured then the twist method in this a small amount of hay is twisted in the hands if the stem breaks a little and no plant juice comes out from the twisted stem the hay can be assumed to have been cured well then lastly let's see the factors influencing the nutritive value of the hay first is chemical changes in which it includes plant and microbial enzyme oxidation leaching and microbial actions second is the plant species which we choose third is the stage of cutting fourth is mechanical damage and lastly fifth is changes during the storage here we ends the hay making and in the next video we are going to study about the silage making the silage making stay safe and let's meet in the next video you you
