 I'm in Macy's and I see this cookware and it says PFOA free. So I do a little research and it turns out this company, Anilon, is the subject of a class action lawsuit for falsely advertising that their cookware is free of PFOA. Now PFOA is only one type of forever chemical, also known as PFA. These are compounds that accumulate in the environment, accumulate in your body, disrupt your hormones, and are potentially implicated in cancer. Know what you're cooking in and don't cook on anything that's nonstick because it's going to have these harmful chemicals. If you want to cook on something, you've got to cook on a purely stainless steel pan like this, not on something like this.
