 Day two in October Nature Study Club is all about harvesting apples. So we learned all about apples together. My littles did their seasonal apple rhythm, and my junior explorer did a similar activity, but hers was a little bit more complex, looking at the full apple life cycle. Then we read some of our favorite apple books about different types of apples and the apple orchard riddle. And then we took a trip to the apple orchard ourselves to harvest some apples that we would then use to make applesauce from the recipe in the unit. So we made this simple applesauce. The only change that we made is we did omit the sugar. This was a special opportunity for my three youngest kids to practice their cutting skills and to be a part of creating an entire recipe from farm to table.
