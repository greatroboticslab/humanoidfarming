Howto & Style
 Did you know if you grab a lychee, cut it open and take out the seed, then immediately put it in some water, let it soak for six hours. Then grab two cotton pads, wet them, and sandwich the seed in the middle of them. Place it in a Ziploc bag, and then place it somewhere warm and dark. After a few days, open it up, you'll see. Oh, it's shrouded. Grab a pot with soil and plant the seed boots down. Sprinkle some soil on top, water it thoroughly, and throw into a seedling. When it's planted into a bigger pot, boom! When it's at least eight inches long, plant it outside and grow some lychee.
