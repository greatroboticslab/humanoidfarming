 This may look like a space mission control centre, but it's actually a major European fruit and vegetable auction in Belgium. It is run by Belle Orte, one of the largest fruit and veg selling cooperatives in Europe. Every day up to 4,000 tonnes of fresh produce are sold here. The organisation has strict produce procedures to ensure good quality standards and prices. For growers, sustainable production also means a fair income. We aim for the best possible price in the market for the production of our growers. We also want to let the consumer enjoy our fresh produce in a healthy way. If you want to build trust of the consumer, of even our buyers, in the production of our growers, then you're also looking at a long-term relationship between what happens on the field, what happens at the producer side and what happens at the consumer's home. Fair market conditions, sustainable farming and quality standards are some of the pillars of the EU's new Common Agricultural Policy, CAP. Its future goals are to combine social, economic and environmental approaches to create a sustainable model of European agriculture. Let's leave the auction and head to two farms in Puta and Hala that are part of the Berlotta network. Both farms have made changes to make their production more sustainable thanks to financial support from the CAP. Under this huge greenhouse where thousands of tomato plants grow, nothing goes to waste. A co-generation system produces complementary energy which is released into the local grid. Thermal insulation screens help save heat at night. Natural methods are used to protect plants from disease. And the irrigation system ensures the most efficient use of water. The excess water is collected and after it's purified. It is reused on the plants. So it's a closed cycle, nothing goes to waste. We also use the maximum amount of rainwater in order to meet our water requirements as efficiently as possible. A LED lighting system installed in the greenhouse helps compensate the lack of light during winter months. The advantage of LED lights is that they consume less power so we save energy and we can also provide optimal light for the plants' needs. Farms of all sizes are playing an important role in the transition towards a more eco-friendly agriculture. Sustainable solutions like those used in Puta's tomato production are also used in this family-owned strawberry farm in Halle. They apply natural remedies to protect plants from disease as well as using new technology. Like this autonomous robot that uses UV light to fight powdery mildew. It's a machine that helps reduce the use of pesticides. We mainly use a natural strategy. We use organic and natural methods as much as we can to fight plant diseases. Only as a last option do we use chemicals. Of course it is important that we all make these efforts because in the end it does affect our final product. There is also a growing demand from consumers for more environmentally friendly and pesticide-free fruits. Lots of vaccines with healthy chemicals. Well good you go.
