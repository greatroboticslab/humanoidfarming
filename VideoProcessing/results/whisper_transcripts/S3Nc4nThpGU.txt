 Look at how advanced Japanese farmers are when it comes to farming. They grow rice while it floats on water. When the rice is fully grown, they bring it to the edge and harvest it. Instead of removing the old roots from the field, they plant a new crop along with those roots. The old rice roots act like natural fertilizer, which helps the new crop grow really well.
