It is a beautiful January day. Happy 2024. I cannot believe it is the new year already. 2023 sped by, which I know we say for every single year, but this one fell especially fast. So many big exciting things happened. And for our first video in the new year, we're going on a little adventure. This is going to be me, Grant, and Gage. We're going on a little road trip because we bought some things for Christmas on an auction. We're going to be picking up three pieces of equipment, a box scraper, a disc, and a mower. There was another thing that we were going to buy, but I'll get into that a little bit later. Right now we are just preparing for our day on the road. First item at hand, fill up the pickup with fuel. We are going to be using the 2022 Ram pickup. 2500. Got this about a year ago and put a little over 30,000 miles on it so far. Thing pulls like a champ. Here we have our cellar fuel trailer. We do not have a big bulk def tank on the farm. So we use the fuel trailer, which keeps about 100 gallons of def on it. We use this to fill up tractors and also my pickup. It's really nice that I don't have to start a pump or anything. I just flip that switch. Runs off battery. Always ready to go. This trailer comes in handy even when we're not doing mobile fueling situations out in the field. We use this thing all the time. We have a lot of stuff in the back of this pickup. So we have a feeling our day is going to take us on some more adventures. So we have chains, chain binders. We have some ratchet straps. We have a variety of different shovels, a bucket, some wood, hammer. Always good to be prepared. Pepper, good morning. Say hi to everybody. We are going to be using the flatbed deck over trailer today to haul our things. Might have to make a few different trips. We have gauge greasing the wheel bearings and then we will check the tires, hook it up to the pickup. You see us use all of this big fancy equipment, huge tractors, combines, implements that we're pulling behind things. Just really large scale farming. And in the grand scheme of things, we are not a large scale farm by any means. But today we are starting out kind of a new series. I wanted to show you that things do not have to be so big. You can start farming or at least start building your arsenal of equipment for much cheaper on a much smaller level. So I'm excited to show you the things that we're picking up today. This backup camera system is so nice. Just follow that little black dotted line. It lines you right up to the hitch. Check that out. So nice. First step is to lower the trailer down. Once I've gone as far up as I can on this wind hitch, then I just press down this little latch and the rest of the jack springs back up. Just like that. Next we're going to hook our safety chains up. Always have your chains crossed like that. Then we are going to make sure that that is latched all the way forward. Make sure that's clipped. And then the last thing is to hook up this. There you go. Trailer's hooked up. Here is the first item that we're picking up. It's a box scraper. But I think we're going to have to come back and pick it up. Because all of this stuff was sold on a retirement auction. And this little pile of stuff in the trees is the only thing left. All of the tractors and equipment on this farm are gone. So we're going to have to come back with something to load this up with. Tires are not in excellent condition. But we only paid $700 for this thing. Excited to get it home and take a look at it. I don't know if that's going to make it down the road. Look at that. No bueno. Not there. Not moving. We came to retrieve this mini JLG telehandler. I'm going to load it onto this trailer and use that to load our purchase equipment up. All the way in. All the way in. That's good. We are back. Time to unload. Get this thing out of the weeds. So the idea is to load the box scraper on the front and still be able to load the telehandler on. But that thing is ten foot wide. The trailer is only eight foot wide. But luckily we're not very far away from home. There will still be some Tetris to get all the fit. Okay. We don't want to smash the hoses. Okay. Now pick up slow. Slow. Okay. Oh, it's been yellow at me. Okay. The cylinder is extending back here. Oh man, look at how bent it is. Okay. Suck the boom in a little bit. A bit of speed mover. Get a better look at the back of this thing. Yeah. Someone's put recent hoses on it. Tires are kind of shot. So Grant, can you run me through your thinking? Buying all of this, I'm going to say a little bit nicely, junk on auction. What is your thinking behind this project? So I want, like this is for the yard obviously, but we get so many comments like how do people start farming? And so I want to buy like a 40-20, which there was a 45-20 on the sale, which sold after all these attachments. So I was planning on buying all the attachments and the tractor, but the tractor went for too much money. So I ended up just having all the attachments and we're going to have to find the tractor eventually. So if you know where a 40-20 is, call me. How does that look? Should I push it this way a little more? Our plan is to scooch this as far forward as possible and then hopefully still be able to fit the telehandler behind it. I don't know if that's quite enough room. We're going to ride. Now we just make sure everything's strapped down. Always need a bigger trailer. Always. Seems like pretty good shape. Perfect little winter project for us. And not get stuck. Not get stuck. So we are at our second stop of the day. We're disking. And it is to pick up the disc. Now I'll be real honest, Grant did not tell me when he purchased any of these things, which is fine. Grant is a big boy. He can do what he likes. But he didn't really tell me what we were getting into. So we pulled up and this is what I'm looking at. Keep in mind, we paid $200 for this. What? Oh, I should have looked at this. Oh my word. This thing is garbage. Grant. We got more bad news, Laura. This thing is garbage. I mean, I can see that, but tell me exactly what you're referencing. Well, so the hydraulic hoses. The main cylinder is not even hooked up. The cylinder is not hooked up. It's just chained, which is good because the hydraulics are not going to. Great. Can we all, can we? What happened? Can we, can we push it down? Yeah. Run me through your thinking when you purchased this. Okay, so I want to get a little, like I said, I was going to buy a little tractor. And we were going to farm like the old days. A little tractor like that over there. And I thought this would be a great way to start farming. We need a little disc for a seed bed prep. And I was like, oh, perfect little disc right here. Oh my goodness. But we're going to haul this behind the trailer. Yeah. All right. Let's go see if that tractor will start. Sometimes I don't know where you get these ideas. Looks to be the box scraper that we just bought, but in a different set of weeds. Thinking is that we are going to try and get this tractor started. No. 4020. This is exactly the kind of tractor that we had in mind. Look, this is exactly what I want. Oh, there's no key. We'll use this to help us. Yeah. Look it up. There's no key. Really thought we were going to have a key for this thing. What are we going to do now? Nothing. Here, you guys keep doing that and we lift. Ready? Oh, it wants to. What have I done? Are there any good redeeming qualities? $200. $200. What? It's worth, oh man, it's bent. If we want to get this home right now, we got to go to Brian, get his portable air compressor. Bring it back here. Air up the tires. Unload this thing. Look it up. Toe it home. Hope for the best. I'm going to call Brian, get an air compressor. So we got permission to get in this shed. Option C. Now this would be a cool tractor to buy. I'm guessing it's a 30. It's probably a 3010. Because it's a 3010. It's a 3010. It's a 3010. It's a 3010. It's a 3010. It's a 3010. It's a 3010. It's a 3010. It's a 3010. It's a 3010. It's a 3010. It's a 3010. It's a 3010. Because it's a four cylinder gas. I don't know what you guys think. 3010? If you have an old tractor like this for sale, especially if you have one identical to that one out there, I want that one. What does that tractor have that you want so badly? It has a quick hitch, side hydraulics or side console hydraulics and a loader. So, and wide front. Gage, pull this thing out. Oh, it wants to. Gage is pretty impressed with this skid steer. We have a bob cap. This is a John Deere. I think he likes this thing. I like John Deere skid steers. I've always liked John Deere skid steers. I really love them. Fan of this one? Yeah, this is really moving. Wow. All right. So, we borrowed an air compressor. We're going to use that to air up the tires. So, thank you Brian. Came to the rescue. This is not the first time Brian has rescued us in situations like this. He helped me change a flat tire actually on this trailer this summer. We are installing a hitch on the back of this trailer here. Grant, have you ever towed anything behind this trailer? No. We bought this trailer. I thought it was weird that there was a hitch back here, but here we are using it. Pretty handy. Arrow the tires up and then we will use a skid steer to help us attach the disc behind this trailer. Luckily, it's not too far of a drive home. All right. You're going to have to hold it. Okay. All right. Let's see if I can do this. I'm a little bit nervous because Grant has absolutely no visibility and I don't know how well he can hear me in the pickup truck. I'm going to hold the hitch like this, being careful that my fingers are not on the way. I don't want to get them pinched. Keep coming straight back. Okay. Hold on. Slow down. Slow down. Slow down. Come back a little bit more. Okay. Stop. Right there. Okay. So, it's not lined up exactly, but I'm hoping Gage can move it with the skid steer. Yeah. Watch it. It slips. It's going up. Come on. Oh, right there. Okay. Come forward. Okay. Stop. Stop. Stop. Got it. Nailed it. Woohoo. Perfect. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Oh, just wait. Okay. What a mess. Oh my goodness. I love it, Laura. Oh, my goodness. I love it, Laura. It is garbage. It is garbage. Alright, you guys. Is this thing going to make it home? You think this is funny? I don't know. It's something all right. It's something. It's something. It's something. It's something. It's something. It's something. You think this is funny. I don't know. It's something, right? We dropped the JLG off at home. We are at our third stop. We are going to be picking up a mower. We will be using this John Deere 544E to pick it up. Let's see if it starts. Fired right up. Excellent. Let's see if Grant can drive this thing. Thanks. Thanks. Do you want to read? No. And hater position is push �winds. Take a look at this cute old tractor. Should be able to just hook a chain up, lift it over to the trailer. She's not in the best condition, but she'll do for the jobs we have in mind. I think that'll work. And it is a wet rocket! Today, it is a feminine. And our last stop of the day completed, ready to go to its new home. Look at how cool the tire tracks are that that loader left. Pretty nice loader, I'm impressed. That worked really well. We got all that stuff loaded up and home just in time. It's starting to get dark outside and it cooled off really fast. It started to get cold towards the end of that. But I hope you enjoyed our little road trip day. We are still, like I said, on the lookout for a tractor. So if you have one or know of one, my email is listed in the description of this video. I'm really interested in getting an old tractor. I want to build my collection of cool old farm toys. There's going to be a lot more videos to come on this topic. So if you have any ideas of implements you'd like me to purchase, future videos you'd like to see, for sure we'll be doing an in-depth video on everything we purchased. And I'm sure there's going to be a lot more to come. So I appreciate you coming along for the very first video of 2024. Thank you for being along for another year of my farming journey. I'm excited to see where this year takes us. And we will see you in the next one. Bye! Thank you. Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye!
