 Top 10 Agriculture Research Topics America's Agriculture in the Period of 1900 to 1920 This topic requires you to research the development of American agriculture between 1900 to 1920. This period is known as the Golden Age of U.S. Agriculture, and you should explain why it is called like that in your paper. In particular, consider the technological developments that allowed for a 50% increase in the area under cultivation. Explain how agriculture became a profitable and modernized business. Food safety issues in modern agriculture Food safety refers to handling, preparing, and storing food in a way that prevents foodborne illness. In your paper, you can examine the most prevalent food safety issues and their primary causes. Common problems you can review include improper food storage or cooking temperature, inadequate sanitation, confusing labeling, and poor hand hygiene. You can also suggest ways to prevent these issues. Agricultural Problems in Venezuela For this topic, you should research agricultural problems in Venezuela, a developing country in South America. Venezuelan agricultural issues stem from its over-reliance on petroleum exports, due to which other economic sectors, including agriculture, receive less funding. As a result, the country relies heavily on food imports, which puts it at risk of food insecurity. Globalization's Impact on Sustainable Agriculture There is an ongoing debate on whether globalization has improved sustainability in the agricultural sector. In your paper, you can analyze recent agricultural trends to see whether this area has become more socially responsible as the world has become more interconnected. Consider such issues as environmental degradation, displacement of small farmers, and the exploitation of workers. Agriculture in Honduras Existing Challenges and Possible Solutions In this paper, you should explore the agricultural challenges faced by Honduras, one of the least developed countries in Central America. Since this nation heavily relies on agriculture, addressing the barriers to the development of the sector is likely to raise Hondurans' living standards. You can investigate and suggest solutions for such issues as natural disasters, education access and quality, and product diversification. Agricultural Role in African Development Agriculture plays a vital role in African countries, which is evident from the structure of their GPD. In this paper, you may scrutinize how the development of agriculture has helped African nations increase their national wealth, decrease poverty, and improve food security. You can also investigate whether agricultural growth fosters the progress in other economic sectors in this region. Climate change's impact on agriculture and livestock This topic allows you to explore the multifaceted impacts of climate change on agriculture and livestock. For example, you may investigate how increased precipitation, induced by global warming, erodes soil and drains soil nutrients. You can also discuss changes in livestock egg and milk production, growth rates, and mortality resulting from climate change. Agricultural Biotechnology and its Pros and Cons Agricultural biotechnology deals with modifying living organisms, animals, plants, and microorganisms. As with any technology, this approach has pros and cons, which you should explore in your paper. Advantages include better agricultural product quality, lower pesticide need, and higher crop resilience to global warming. Some shortcomings are possible harm to human health and decreased biodiversity. The Effects of Genetic Modification of Agricultural Products Genetic Modification means altering the genome of a plant to add a new feature to it. Although most GM crops are used for animal food, some of them are available to humans. In your paper, you can investigate the health effects of consuming GM products. Alternatively, you can examine how genetic modification alters agricultural production, increasing plants' resistance to insects and reducing the costs of food and drug production. Impact of Bioterrorism on the U.S. Agriculture System Bioterrorism refers to intentionally releasing biological agents, like bacteria or viruses, to sicken or kill livestock, crops, or people. In your paper, you can explore the possible effects of this threat on U.S. agriculture. Examples include morbidity and mortality in livestock and crops, reduced food supply, and a loss of export markets. You can also assess the U.S. preparedness to respond to a biological attack.
