And for some of us, we might not have a backyard to do a big garden in or even have the time to take care of such a large plot of land, so the need for getting something that can strike the balance of easy caretaking while still getting to plant our stuff arises. Which is why today we're going to be going over the top three most popular indoor hydroponic systems that you can find which would be wonderful to keep your green thumb hobby going. Kicking off our list, we have the AeroGarden Bounty Elite Indoor Hydroponic Herb Garden.

Next up on the docket, we have the Moistenland Hydroponics Growing System. The Moistenland Hydroponics Growing System comes equipped with 12 planting pods that are made of biodegradable cocoa coir, which will make the plants and fruits grow in a clean and neat environment that contains no heavy metal, no antibiotics, and is non-GMO. As hydroponic plants are less likely to be targeted by pests than field-grown plants, no chemicals, pesticides, and herbicides will be needed. Also, thanks to its high-efficiency grow light, a 23-watt LED bulb, you'll be able to provide a full spectrum of light to meet your plant's growth without sunlight. Providing a mix of red, white, and blue light, plus an automatic 24-hour light circulation, 16 hours on, 8 hours off mechanism, this will accelerate the plants to root, to sprout, and to grow. Thus, you'll be able to harvest many times in one year. Thanks to its built-in air and water circulation system, the light panel not only will reduce the light heat, but also provide an air circulation that mimics the breeze in the nature and makes plants grow more efficiently. In the reservoir, a powerful and quiet pump makes the water flow around, which helps to disperse the nutrients and oxygen to make the roots grow healthy. Embedded with the Moistenland Hydroponics Growing System are two growth modes and adjustable height that features veggie and fruit modes for different planting. The veggie mode will enhance the blue light to make the plants leafy, and the fruit mode will enhance the red light to make the plants flower and get fruit. As the plants grow higher over time, you can adjust the height of the post to adapt to the growing height. The Moistenland Hydroponic Growing System comes with 12 planting pods, allowing you to grow fresh herbs, vegetables, salads, fruits, flowers, and more at a time. It's enjoyable to watch plants growing, ideal for indoor use, and you can place it on the kitchen counter, window, living room, or office. It's such an ideal gift for birthdays, Mother's Day, Thanksgiving Day, and Christmas Day. Rounding down our list of the top at-home hydroponic systems, we have the iDo hydroponic growing system. This indoor garden center germination kit is designed with a water pump circulation system, making it where plants grow faster than soil. Included in this hydroponic system is an air circulation system, which can be found along the light panel to help promote airflow and increase the success rate of pollination. Both the pump and fan turn on and off automatically while having a super low noise floor. Also, you can turn it off for 10 hours and then go into a cycle of 30 minutes on, 30 minutes off. You can even keep this little garden in your room while you sleep and not have a loud fan blowing in your ear. With its high-performance grow lights, the growing system from the 23-watt LED will help to stimulate the sunlight spectrum, promoting plants' photosynthesis in any weather. You can place this little indoor gardening system anywhere you want, from the kitchen to the bedroom or your own office. Two smart grow modes for veggies and fruits turn on and off automatically for the right balance of what you're growing inside the hydroponic device. For leaf plants growing harvest leaves, choose vegetable mode, which contains blue light, and then for making fruit plants grow stronger, choose flower and fruits modes, which increases the red light. And when your plants finally start growing up big and strong, you can adjust the height of the lighting part of the hydroponic growing system for various plants at different growth stages. Grow 12 plants at a time and get up to an 11-inch height for your plants in this hydroponic station. So there you have it, folks.
