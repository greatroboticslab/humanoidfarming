 The Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2021 comes into effect on the 1st of July 2023. We thought we'd clarify some points in terms of ground breaking activities and where they fit in the activity tier system that has been introduced. As I understand it, Matilda, the basis for going through a due diligence process is this concept of ground disturbance. Yes, correct. So what can you tell us about that? So the new Act requires ground disturbance, has categorised ground disturbance according to different tiers. So ground disturbance for agricultural activity, for instance, is separated into different tiers. You have tier 1, tier 2 and tier 3. So a tier 1 is very low ground disturbance activity, so it's moving less than 4 kilos of soil. Less than 4 kilos of soil. And then a tier 2 is between 4 and 20 kilos, and then a tier 3 is above 20 kilos. So that's one example. There's also other examples. I mean... Conceptually then, jumping in, simply seeding is going to move more than 4 kilos, or even 20 kilos of soil. Yeah, indeed. There's many agricultural activities that are going to fit into tier 3, purely because of the size and scale of agricultural practices in today's age. If we look at fencing, for instance, that's not an activity that will just fit into one tier. If you're undertaking maintenance on a fence that doesn't require any clearing, it could fall into a tier 1. For instance, fixing a strainer post. But if you're constructing a whole new fence, if you're clearing native vegetation, then you could be falling into a tier 2 or tier 3. Right. And I know there's, you know, the like-for-like concept as well that comes into play, and that might exclude people from going through a due diligence process. And we'll deal with that in a separate video. But, all right, let's come back to this ground-disturbing issue. So, yeah, you really have to determine which activity tier you fall into. But before you get to that stage, it's about undertaking a search on the directory to confirm whether there is any Aboriginal cultural heritage on your land. Once you know the answer to that question, it will then determine which activity tier you look at for your activity, and then which due diligence assessment process you undertake. Thanks, Julia.
