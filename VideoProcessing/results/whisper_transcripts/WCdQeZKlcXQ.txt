Howto & Style
 If you have a love for the great outdoors, are passionate about plants and nature, are inquisitive with the natural world and science, or just simply like being creative or nurturing something to its full potential, then a career in horticulture could be for you. Over the past 30 plus years, the skills gap has become greater in the industry with few people entering into it than are retiring. The UK horticultural industry is growing and there are opportunities for people from all age groups and backgrounds within it. Here we are in the new learning garden at Hyde Hall and primarily this is used for schools education, but the RHS has been actively involved in horticultural education since the inception of the School of Horticulture over 100 years ago. It prides itself in assisting students to become the best they can be, and the four RHS qualification levels along with the Master of Horticultural program have become industry standards taught in colleges across the country. There are two basic needs for an employer to employ a person in horticulture. The first one is about qualifications and training and check out your local colleges about horticultural courses that there might be available. There are no formal entry requirements for RHS qualifications at levels one and two, just an interest and enthusiasm for plants and gardening. So please explore the RHS website for details. The second is all about experience. As with any job, it is good to have some level of experience and this can be achieved in a number of ways. Some level of experience can be achieved through practical based training whilst undertaking a qualification. Similarly, volunteering at a local garden or nursery or other industry area is a great way to find out more about what you enjoy about horticulture so that you know what perhaps you like and dislike. A final thought. Horticulture is a vast subject. You never stop learning and every day can be different. With hard work and passion at its core, horticulture is a varied, rewarding and fulfilling industry, not just for yourself but for all that come into contact with it. Why not do your passion every day and get paid for it?
