 I'm Daniel Bennett. My business is DNA Business Development and I work with ambitious businesses in the agricultural sector helping them become more profitable by finding and securing the right customs for them. I'm based in Cheshire and I work from Aberdeen to Hampshire at the moment. So today we're going to explore getting found online, mastering SEO strategies to attract farmers searching for solutions. I'm sure we've all heard of SEO or search engine optimisation but what does that really mean? In reality what it means to us is when farmers search for information on Google, if your business can help then your website should be near the top of the list of search results. I guess we ought to recognise that Google isn't the only search engine. In fact there are more than 1,500 search engines. Fancy that. That's 1,500 search engines worldwide including niche search engines and ones that are unique to specific countries. Of those 1,530 are dedicated to general web searching and according to StatCounter who published global statistics, I can't even say that word, in August 24 Google accounted for over 90% of search traffic. Next at just short of 4% is Bing which is owned by Microsoft and there's others like Yandex, Yahoo, Beidou and the one I like the sound of most is DuckDuckGo. I don't know if any of you are familiar with those. Also we should be aware that people also use channels like YouTube, Facebook, TikTok and other social platforms to search for information. And another consideration is the acceleration in AI and for our farming friends of course I'm not talking about artificial insemination, I'm talking about artificial intelligence. If you ask Google to answer a question, for example, what does AgriTech mean? Rather than simply entering AgriTech, Google now presents an AI generated content to answer your question. And so we'll have a little explore AI further on as well. I have asked for feedback from attendees previously, some like the round the room intro, some aren't so bothered. But I believe part of masterminding is building a trusted network. So I think it's important that we all know who's here today. So I'm going to ask you to just introduce yourself and just say what your name is, what's your job, who do you work for, where you're located. I'm a nosy bugger, I like to know where people are. And later on we'll get into a broader conversation and hopefully we'll share some ideas and our knowledge and experience. So and perhaps if you've got a challenge we might be able to answer. So go on Annabelle, start with you. Who the heck are you? Where are you from? So I'm Annabelle Beaumont. I am a marketing coordinator for DSV UK and we are a hundred year old seed breeders who originate from Germany. So we specialise in arable crops and grasses. Great stuff. And I'm sure we have metasereals or something like that. That's the, yeah. Simon, who are you? Hi Dan. Hi Dan. Well, I'm a marketing business development consultant, much like yourself. And I've worked in many agricultural fields in the past. I'm based in, just outside Altrincham in the northwest. And yeah, I look after different people. Thank you, Simon. Tracey, what are you doing here? I don't know. Why am I here? So my name is Tracey. I run the digital marketing agency called Arctic B. And I work closely with Daniel on some of his farming clients, helping them with their marketing, particularly social media, web design and search engine optimisation. So we've got a small agency up here in Yorkshire. And yeah, we look after a range of different types of clients. Thanks, Tracey. Farouk. I normally forget to introduce you, Farouk. Hi, good morning, everybody. My name is Farouk. I work closely with Daniel, you know, just doing everything in the background for the marketing. I'm based in Nigeria. Thanks, Farouk. Yeah, this wouldn't happen without him. So I'm really grateful. So today we're here to solve problems that might be something, a specific challenge you're facing. You know, whether the subject SEO, maybe it's a current problem for you. I don't know. It might be just simply to enhance your learning and understanding. And today I'm going to show you some of what I do to help grow agri-tech businesses by blending marketing and sales activities to help find and secure customers for them. Morning, Yarl. How are you? Oh, good morning. Doing well. That's all right. Don't be late again. As you say, we're a smaller group this morning and we've just done the introductions. Do you want to just say who you are and where you're from? I'm Jarl. I'm the general manager of Landcatch Natural Selections based on the west coast of Olgun. We are a salmon breeding company in juvenile production. And I got a separate business as well called Tiny Fish, where we collect the very, very small fish across Scotland that are unfit to be transferred to sea for value-added purposes instead of letting them go to waste. So that's me. Cool. And have you done something to your wrist? Yeah. Silly things over the weekend. So just trying to give it some rest. Won't ask. Won't ask. Anyway, so today I'm going to show you a bit about what I do to help grow agri-tech businesses by blending marketing and sales activities. That's to obviously help find and secure customers for them. And if that's something you'd like help with, I can explain a bit later how you can work with me. I mean, there are many facets to finding and securing customers. And today our focus is getting found online. So that's mastering SEO strategy to attract farmers searching for solutions. The reality is, if you can get found online for the problems you solve, you have a powerful sales generation tool at your fingertips. So to set the scene, and sorry, y'all, I know you've heard this before. I'm going to get on my soapbox for a minute. I believe it's worth repeating. Agriculture is arguably the most important industry in the world. And yet, without being too political, it seems many of the wealthier governments around the world are deprioritising the sector. According to the United Nations, each day, 25,000 people around the world, including more than 10,000 children, die from hunger and related causes. That's just a staggering number. Some 854 million people worldwide are estimated to be undernourished. And increasing food prices may drive another 100 million into poverty and hunger. So I think farmers everywhere have a very important role to play, even if in the shorter term, they're forced through financial pressures to accept non-food producing schemes. And it's clear we need to drive improvements and efficiencies in farming and looking after our environment. And agri-tech has a massive part to play in this. And it's unlikely a single agri-tech solution is going to revolutionise food production. It's more likely to move the needle by one degree. But multiple innovations, each shifting needle by one degree, has a powerful compound effect. And innovation, so innovation is about, often about, marginal gains. And, of course, the challenge, big challenge here is farmers don't know what they don't know, if that makes any sense. You know, how can we firstly make farmers aware of innovations and then help them to understand how they've been officially impacted them. And this is why the Agritech Marketing Mastermind exists, is to share our knowledge, to share our experience, hone our skills so that we can better serve our industry and farmers. So the concept behind the Agritech Marketing Mastermind is to share ideas, get creative, explore what's worked and what's not worked for ourselves. This is definitely an interactive session. Great to see you've all got your cameras on. Nobody's in their pyjamas. Brilliant stuff. But this is informal. This is no death by PowerPoint from me. And in the group, we've got a wide range of marketing, cultural experience and knowledge. But we're all students and we're all teachers. And you could argue the true test of learning something is being able to teach it to others. So I hope we can all help each other. It's possibly, well, I don't think there's anyone competing here, but I always believe that actually collaboration is far more powerful than competition. So each Agritech Marketing Mastermind, we introduce a topic. And it's a short talk. Although today we have Tracy's our special guest, and she's going to be answering some of my grilling questions about search engine optimization. And as Tracy's already said, she runs Arctic P, a digital marketing agency that I work with. And she's going to share her specialist knowledge around SEO. Then we'll open up the floor. And of course, if you've got any questions, just wave your hand. Or you could do the digital wave if you're clever enough to use Zoom. I always forget. So just wave your hand or whatever. And we'll bring you in. And then at the end, we'll also have a round-the-room discussion anyway. And obviously, Yael, you've been here before. You know what happens. You don't get to stay silent. I will ask you some questions. I will drag you in, even if it's just to share your thoughts and experience. And, you know, when we hear people talking about their experiences, that really, to me, is a really powerful learning opportunity. Often, we don't ask the question we want to ask, but somebody else does. So that's really good. And, of course, if you've got any feedback on this session, please let me know. After all, feedback is the breakfast of champions. And, you know, I like to sort of, you know, keep things relevant and appropriate. At the end, I will stay on the Zoom for a short while, if anyone just wants a quick catch-up. But anyway, I mean, you might be wondering what gives me the right to talk about sales and marketing and growing businesses in the agri-sector. All I ever wanted to be was a farmer. And at the age of nine, I fell in love with farming. And actually, from then, knew what route I was taking. Most youngsters don't know, do they? But I was absolutely clear. So off I went to agricultural college, three fantastic years learning about farming and drinking beer. And then it ended up living my dream, driving big green tractors with yellow wheels in Essex. But I was persuaded by my fiancé a few years after that farming wasn't going to provide the lifestyle expected of me. So she was a graphic designer. And we very naively set up and designed a marketing agency back in 1990. None of this internet stuff. That's never going to take off, is it? So we did that for a long time, 26 years. And then she decided not to be married to me any longer. So I realised I needed to change something in my life. And I decided to go back to my love. And that was farming. So actually, I went to work on a farm in Yala Man for the summer. And if you've never been to Yala Man, I'd recommend it. It's a very special place. I then actually went to New Zealand for six months, where I was an agricultural spraying contractor. And when I got back from New Zealand, whilst I did spend a bit of time on a UK farm, I remembered how cold or wet it gets here. So I realised I could blend my business experience with my love and passion for farming and food production. And hence why we've now got DNA business development. So today's subject is getting found online, mastering SEO strategies to attract farmers, searching for solutions. Many of you here run agri businesses and may be wondering why, despite having the best products or services, farmers can't seem to find you online. That's what we're here to address. And we should also consider how the buying decision process has been changing over the years. Traditionally, the process looks something like contact your potential supplier, carry out research aided by suppliers, and then make your buying decision. Now, in many situations, the process has become research online, make a buying decision, and then contact your supplier. So this really, you know, so we need to ensure the research our customers are doing means they want our information quickly. And to do that, we need to get our SEO right and working for us. And so anyway, we're going to be joined by Tracy. And hello again, Tracy. Are you ready for a grilling? You need to turn your microphone on. I do. I am. So tell us a little bit more about who you are. Where have you come from? So, yeah, so I did mention I run Arctic Beach, which is a digital marketing agency based in Yorkshire. I will give you a bit of backstory and say that Arctic B is a symbol of resilience because I have come from a domestic violence background and had some mental health issues, which led me to set the company up. And that's quite important and quite relevant to what we're going to talk about today because actually having a backstory is really important when you're doing SEO. There's nothing like genuine content to get out there and get people to resonate with your story. So although it might not seem directly related to digital marketing, it actually is. And a lot of our clients actually kind of really resonate with that as well. So I set up Arctic B during the pandemic, during lockdown. I had, you know, it's a slow process to set it up. And I've now got a small team of people that work for me. I've got an office up here in Yorkshire. And, you know, we work for a huge range of companies. We work down on the farming side of things, but we've done everything from financial and FCA compliance companies to dog fertility services. So you name it, we've done it. So I think that's us in a nutshell. But for me personally, in terms of my skill set, my specialism is web design and search engine optimization. So I have a younger team that tend to take care of the digital marketing side of things and the social media. Although I do have my own TikTok channel, which I do myself. Doing quite well. I've got 16,000 likes on that so far. But I'm very much more on the website and the SEO side of things. Thanks, Tracy. It's good to, as you say, it's really, I love hearing people's backstories and that's why I tell mine. Basically, can you put some links below after the meeting? Yeah, we certainly will do. Yes, I will. Yeah. So, Tracy, what are the sort of main SEO issues that you see when working with agricultural-based businesses? Okay. So, several things. Firstly, I think that, obviously, that there's the lack of technical side of things. So some websites I look at, they're just not formatted properly or the navigation is confusing. So for a lot of websites that Daniel and I have looked at when we've taken them on, the navigation's been all over the place. It's just been really confusing to know where to start. And navigation structure has a huge impact on SEO because if you think about it, you're using Google and other search engines to call your website and the easier the structure works, the easier it is to find relevant information. So quite often, there's a lot of duplication, a lot of overlap for navigation structure. There's also sometimes just, it's just not formatted. So the metadata's not right in the background, page title hasn't been formatted. Page titles are hugely important in search engine optimization, but I've come onto that. But another big issue is actually how some of the websites look. So some of them have been put together by other companies or they've been put together by, you know, the person's done it themselves, might have done a Wix website. And it doesn't matter how much somebody is proud of the work they've done. If it's not informed by what the customer wants and if it's not professional, if it doesn't look professional, all the SEO in the world won't help because the bounce rate is going to be very high. Somebody's going to come on that website and they're just going to dismiss it and come straight off. So I would say those are the main things really. I would say the poor navigation structure and actually the website not being right are probably the two main things. And in terms of the website not being right, also a lack of call to action. So a lot of people have a website and they just put all their information on there and it's all about this is what we do and we're wonderful and we're great. The copy is not really written towards the audience. In other words, what we can do for you is more about this is how great we are. And a lot of the sites we look at are very text heavy and explain what people do without really giving across a proper value proposition. So in other words, what does the client want? What can we do for the client? And on the back of that, here's a call to action for us to deliver what you want, whether that's a web form, whether that's an email, whether that's a free consultation. So I would say those are the main issues. Okay, so I'm sort of hearing it, well, sort of structural, technical type things and how often, you know, when you go to a website and something doesn't quite work. And that can be as simple as an image taking so long to load or something like that. And, you know, I think a goldfish has the attention span of about six seconds. And I think most people are sort of somewhere short of that, aren't they? These days. So we have to technically make sure that things are working, otherwise people just go somewhere else. And like I say, there's call to actions where, you know, when you've got somebody, well, what do they need to do next? Let's tell them. And I really like, you know, what is your point? Why should they care? You know, so I am full of cliches. I don't apologise anymore for it. Farmers don't like to be sold to, but they do like to buy. And so rather than, you know, buy my shit, buy my shit, buy my shit. Sorry, I know nobody sells shit. But, you know, this is about engaging and helping provide that information so that they can make their decisions based on the value that you deliver because they see the value through possibly often third-party type stories and endorsement. Okay, so what about content? How do we ensure content is relevant for farming whilst maintaining our listing ranking? Is there a conflict there or how does that work? No, there's absolutely not a conflict at all. And that is a really important message. There's no conflict in delivering what you want to your audience and search engine optimization. In fact, it benefits it because, you know, sometimes you go online and you see something and you click through and it seems very clickbaity. It seems very much like a sales funnel and you're very aware that you're being sold to. You know, that kind of content did work for a while but people are wising up to it and people are very, like you say, if they feel like they're being sold to, they're very likely to switch off. What people want is something that resonates with them and something that is going to resonate with them is going to be authentic content. It doesn't actually matter what sector you're in. If you're delivering something that resonates, if it seems genuine, if it seems authentic, if it seems human, if you're talking to them in a very conversational way saying, hey, you know, we know you've got an issue and we understand that and this is how we can solve it for you, you know, we actually really want to help you, that's going to be much better than saying, oh, you know, we're great and we can deliver you know, 100% turnaround in your profits. People see through that kind of thing. People will see that as quite fake. They'll see it as disingenuous. They're much more likely to switch off. So, you know, I don't know if anybody's done this but one of the things that we quite often do when we start marketing as a first point is to do a business model canvas and then canvas map and actually really have a look at the audience, really have a look at their pain points, really have a look at what is affecting them. So in the farming sector, lack of time to do the things that they want to do. not really having the marketing skill and not, you know, it kind of stabs in the dark if you like. Issues with regards to, you know, times a year. So for example, you know, am I really focused on drilling at the moment? Is that impacting on my time? Has it been a really wet winter? And am I struggling actually to even get the product to market? So things like that are things that are going to resonate with the audience and it can be very seasonal as well. So just making sure that you know your audience and within farming, I mean, that's a broad scope. It really is. And to target all farmers or to target all end consumers actually is going to water down the message, which is why I'd say it's a good place to start a business model canvas and an empty canvas. You can find templates for those online because it really lets you pinpoint exactly who you want to reach out to. And from that, you can create an avatar or several avatars of who your ideal audience is. So is my ideal audience, for example, a young, aspiring, 20-something farmer who potentially is going to take over his father's farm at some point? Or is it, I want to go to the end consumer and I want to get in front of McCain's, for example, because I've got potato products. And actually, if they buy into it, then people are more likely to buy the product. So it's really pinpointing who exactly that person is. And when I talk about an avatar, that can be really, really specific. So when we create an avatar, we'll even name them. You know, it will be Bert who, you know, who lives in the Yorkshire Dales, who has, you know, who has a couple of dogs and his wife and a couple of children and he's this age and we really pinpoint who that person is and we'll take that person and we'll create a complete avatar of that person and then we'll repeat that for the different avatars because actually it's very specific and it really gets in mind exactly who you're talking to. It's the old daddies, isn't it? Try to speak to everyone, you'll end up speaking to no one. Yeah, exactly. It's really understanding who your audience is and what their pain points are and those pain points can be different for, you know, even within farming and of course, of course, within farming, we've got different types of farming. So you almost sounded a bit like a farmer in there at one point. So I was thinking, well, maybe you must have driven a combine and understand, you know. Oh, yes. Yeah, I have, by the way. So we've identified some problem areas and, you know, let's look at some of these in a bit more detail. So things like keyword targeting, you know, how can we fix our poorly performing websites? You said about the technical stuff first. Let's get the technical stuff right. We'll talk a little bit more about it at the moment. But things like, you know, we hear the terms of like keyword research and keyword targeting. I seem to remember years ago, the technique was get as many keywords as you could onto a page and then make it, the words, the font, the same colour as the background. And, you know, hey, all your problems were solved. Tell us a bit more, can we do that? Yeah, no, definitely not. So there's black hat and white hat SEO. Black hat SEO, it used to be acceptable. Now, actually, you could risk having your website completely blocked and Google does do that. They will completely block your website from search engines. So there has to be contrast between the text and the background. It's not just about putting white text on background. If you put pale yellow on a background, thinking it looks aesthetically nice or pale green, actually, you could be penalised by Google. Google are much more aware than they used to be of accessibility as well. So if somebody has a screen reader or visual impairment, they want to know there's enough contrast. They want to know that it's going to resonate with everybody. So it needs to be very functional and very clear. So using, I mean, some things I see when people create websites, for example, is they use script font. And like I say, they'll use pale colours because they like those colours, but they have no consideration for somebody. I mean, if you squint and look at the screen and that text disappears, that's not good. Google will pick that up. So making sure the website is accessible, making sure that it is built according to Google's, what they consider good practice is really, really important. And I'm talking about Google a lot because Google are the standard. The other search engines will follow. You do good practice and Google, you're going to do good practice everywhere else. Keyword stuffing is another thing. Sometimes I see websites that have lists. So for example, somebody wants to target different areas. So they might say, you know, farm shop deliveries in Preston, farm shop deliveries in Liverpool, farm shop. And they'll just put a list of keywords linked through to different pages that then have those particular areas on. But actually, Google's really smart at picking that up. They'll see that as keyword stuffing and the same if you over-optimize. So there are, excuse me, there are tools out there that you can put on your website. If you've got WordPress, there's a good one called Yoast. And, sorry, it will analyse your text and it will actually tell you whether you've got too many keywords, which is really useful. But the important thing is if you're putting keywords onto a website, they need to be contextual. So it needs to be written in a way. So the example I've just given could be we have a farm shop and we regularly deliver to Preston, Liverpool, Manchester and the surrounding areas. And if you want to see a map of the different areas, then you can click here and have a look. That would be much better than just having a list of those areas because that's contextual. Okay. Okay. And then we hear the term long tail keywords. I mean, for example, are farmers searching for the best wheat seed to plant on dry soils in England? Or, you know, or would they just be looking for best wheat seed? Or, you know, are they looking for, searching for drainage systems? Or would they actually say, I'm looking for a drainage system for my potato crop? Well, do you know what? In some respects, everybody here can answer that. When was the last time you did a Google search and what did you put in? Did you put in one word or did you ask a question? Yeah. In fact, I'll throw that open. How do you search? Well, what I do, and this is then also another question, so I don't want to divert too much, but I work through trusted distributors and less so on the Google search as business to business. Yeah, so my question was more on that because I don't do that search best wheat killer around. I call up a distributor and say, hey, I need a wheat killer or I need seeds. What do you recommend or what do you have in store? Except, instead of going out my way. So I don't know if that's different between business to consumers or business to business. You might have mentioned the others. I know you just picked up a call, but that's not a problem. You know, we've run. So actually, in the introduction, I was talking about how traditionally the buying process is changing and traditionally we would contact potential suppliers then we would carry out our search aided by those suppliers then make a buying decision. Now, I'm not making any reference to your age, but certainly, you know, it does seem that certain younger generations are now doing their research online and making a buying decision and then contacting the supplier. You know, so things are shifting and, you know, it depends, I guess, what they're buying and the demograph and all that. But, yeah, it really depends on certain situations, doesn't it? But, yeah, it's always interesting to hear how people use it. but, I mean, on a personal basis, do you search, you know, if you're, I don't know, buying something for yourself or planning a holiday, you know, really, it's gone are the days of going into the travel agents, isn't it? The first thing we do is we Google, don't we? Sorry. The most recent thing is for me when I was buying racks and we didn't have a contact is, okay, blacksmith in near Glasgow or in Scotland and then you go through it and contact the different local people before you then look more specifically, okay, what, this is freezing racks so then you look at the terms freezing racks in the UK and then pay for the extra shipping so I start typically local and then expand it to domestic for the specific products. Yeah, absolutely. Annabelle, what about you? How do you use search engines? Do you use search engines? I would say we, so our, so clearly people buy RC3 merchants so we want to sort of advertise how good RCs are doing we want to capture that attention so people do look on our website to have a look at the fact sheets and compare it on like the recommended lists and whatsoever sort of make their buying decisions so what sort of seeds that they do want to drill but yeah, it's trying to get those people to look on your website and make more informed decisions about what they, what they can purchase from us and yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks, Simon. Simon, we're probably of a similar generation, aren't we? Yeah, we probably are but it is related coming out of work mode and into consumer mode as a consumer myself, I use the near me tag quite a lot when I'm searching for something so, you know, obviously something restaurant, you know, bar, shop, whatever it might be, near me because it tends to bring you up the companies that have got their geographical locations sorted out and in terms of SEO, I think, you know, geo tagging and having, you know, your location, your Google business pages all sorted out and it's a different subject but it's all part of the same parcel really helps and it brings up the businesses near you that, you know, are more proactive I find. Yeah, you just made me realise how much I use near me I've never actually thought about it before. Now you've just said that. Well, you do, obviously you have to say to Google this is where I am and a lot of people don't like to do that but it doesn't bother me. Everyone knows everything about what everybody does these days so I don't worry about it, I just get on with it. Yeah, yeah. So actually Tracy, I mean, one of the things we were going to talk about was localised search terms. Tell us more. We are talking about Google on the whole, they provide real estate available to us, don't they? Yeah, shall I just go back a little bit because you asked about long tail keywords. Shall I just go through a little bit of keyword analysis and then I'll talk about geolocation. Google Trends is really good. That gives you an overview. It'll give you a top line of what people are searching for. If you're going to put a key phrase in, don't make it too specific. So for example, if you were going to put in, we'll talk about Farm Shop again, if you're going to put in Farm Shop Liverpool, it's not going to return anything but if you put Farm Shop in, it will. So Google Trends will give you a great top overline. And then there's Google Keyword Planner which is based on paid ads. But it's very useful to see that because the keywords that have the highest values assigned to them will generally use more. And then there are specific tools out there. We use Uber Suggest, there's some paid for things out there that will give you a really good idea for doing keyword research. So that's really important. And that will give you, if you like, your top line idea of what people are looking for. However, saying that, I'm going to put a caveat on that and say that you know your audience better than anyone else. And however many tools you use, there is a certain element of common sense in it. And there's no point in putting keywords out if it's not going to resonate for your audience. And that's why I asked the question, how do you search? Because increasingly people are searching for answers to questions or they're putting something a little bit longer in. You know, it's very unlikely that somebody would put into a search term, we talked about holidays, holiday to Florida or travel agent. They might put travel agent near me and then consider having a look at all of them. But actually, if you're thinking about going to Florida, you might start looking at things like where are the best places to go in Florida? Is Florida safe? Am I going to be eaten by a crocodile? So, you know, there's all sorts of things people are going to be searching for. And getting in the top 10 of Google is one thing. Obviously, that's whatever we aspire to. But actually, an awful lot of traffic can come from those long-tail keywords where people are searching for questions for those answers. And if you're smart enough and you've got those in a blog section of your website or throughout your website, the chances are you are going to find traffic that you may not have otherwise attracted. And by finding that traffic, what you're doing, especially when you're answering questions, is giving value-added content and showing that you know what you're talking about. You're giving value to that client. It's not a direct, we talked about being salesy, it's not directly overly selling, it's basically saying, here's an answer to your question, you know, I'm knowing what I'm talking about and I'm supporting you to find the answers. They're much more likely to think, hmm, okay, I'm going to check out the rest of this website. So long-tail keywords are really important and long-tail keywords work especially well when you're on a budget and you know that you can't compete with the top companies. So take, for example, you're selling liquid fertilizer, okay, we all know that Yara dominates the search engines. If you want to get in front of farmers, you may have to think about some more niche, long-tail key phrases that people are going to search for. For example, how am I going to cope or how am I going to regenerate my land after, you know, flooding and extremely wet winter, that kind of, you know, thing. So I'm not saying that's a specific key phrase you'd use, you probably know better, but basically making sure that you are delivering what that audience is looking for. Yeah, so long-tail keywords are really important. Now going back to the technical side of things, geolocation, again, this is where you have to be very careful with keyword stuffing and black cat SEO. Because if you go putting, if you're in Manchester and you're aiming for Manchester businesses, putting farm shop in Manchester in your page title could be quite a good thing to do. But do you really need to put Manchester in? Probably not if you're only aiming at people in Manchester. If you were having people coming from outside for tourist attraction, you might put that in because you're going to have people searching outside of the area. So what you want to do is use proper schema markup or rich snippets in the back end of your website. Again, there are tools that can help you do that to make sure that you're geolocating that in the right place, that you've got a Google map listing, that you've got Google My Business optimised, and that people, Google will know exactly where you are, where you're located. So when people do those near me searches, you're going to come up. But definitely, it's not something that you want to just over-emphasise in the copy because it just won't get you anywhere and Google will see straight through that. So making sure that you've got a map, making sure that you've got proper schema markup is really important. And that schema markup is not just about maps, that's other things. Reviews is a really huge thing. So Google reviews obviously are advantageous of using Google, but there are other review sites like Trust Parlour, and there are widgets out there that will aggregate reviews from across the board and actually just serve up your five-star reviews on your website and put proper schema markup in. So reviews are really important as well because what Google are looking for is what quality can I give to the end user? I know the end user is looking for something in a particular area. I know that this is what the end user is asking the question about. Right, okay, this particular website, not only are they located in the right place, their content is authentic, everything they're doing seems to be relevant to that end client, and actually they're really popular. Look, they've got 12 reviews saying how wonderful they are, whereas the next person hasn't got any. So they're more credible. So they're more likely to come up higher in the search engines. It's quite a complicated algorithm. But all of those things are really important in consideration in making sure that you are geolocated correctly, that your keywords are picked up, and that Google knows that what you're delivering is good quality. Just a caveat on that, Google are very good at picking up fake reviews, and so are end users. We do review management as well, and I can tell you I can spot a fake review mile off. So that's something, again, that's black hat SEO, that's something you want to avoid. Yeah, but that authentic content is really, really important. Just make sure that it's genuine, it's authentic, it's geolocated, schema markups in place, and that you're, you know, you're absolutely doing everything the right way. So the content needs to answer the questions that your audience is asking. Yeah, absolutely. The real technique is to understand the questions they're asking, and, you know, I've said this before, if you said to a farmer in the 1890s, you know, how can we help you make plowing faster, they'd have probably have said another team of horses. So you've got to be careful the way that you ask questions, because, you know, now we are here in 2024, actually, not only, you know, they probably back then, they couldn't even conceive of the idea of a tractor plowing an acre in 20 minutes, where say we're plowing an acre in a day, but actually, a lot of land's not now plowed at all. So, you know, we're sort of trying to put our solution onto them. What we've got to be careful is actually there might be a totally different way of thinking, but because you don't know what you don't know, that was one of the statements I made earlier. So we've got to be think very carefully about what are those questions that are going to be asked, and actually ensure that we do ask them. I think that goes back, sorry, Daniel, I think that goes back to doing, if you can search online, is have a look for Business World of Canvas and Empathy Canvas Map, if you haven't done one already, because it really does focus you on those pain points, and from those pain points, you can formulate those questions. things. Okay, that's cool. So just in terms of things like link building as well, I mean, we're looking to build our authority. Daniel, can I ask a question before? Of course you can, yeah. Related to what Tracy just said on the reviews and rate things, and it goes back to a conversation we had with Daniel weeks ago on the Thursday session on social media. is I in particular, but maybe the other business, I don't know what you guys are into, but I'm an animal production, salmon production, that has a very negative social license, and immediately if topics are being brought in a public domain, we were discussing social media, but it could be the same for reviews or comments or ratings. There are activists that from principle just don't like the business that they that I'm in, and will downgrade and comment and put in negative rating that does not reflect the business performance, but their principles on the industry. Is it then better not to even put yourself in any of these public domain websites that comment, rate, or review? So I have actually done these. I should just say, I've just done my master's degree in digital marketing, and one of my modules actually I did some research on reviews, so I'm kind of aware of the stats, et cetera. Firstly, it's important to say that people do not trust five star. If somebody has all five star reviews, the consumer is less likely to trust it. They're much more likely to trust a review profile that has a smattering of negative reviews. It depends on how many you've got. Obviously, if you've got eight reviews and two of them are negative, that's more ratio concerning, but actually they will trust it. The other thing is, because we do review management, how you respond to those views can actually be more positive for you than not having a negative review in the first place. So, for example, have you ever gone and booked a B&B, seen a negative review that's just been left, as opposed to a negative review where the owner has come back and went, we're so sorry that you've experienced this, we've taken this on board, we're actually going to try and improve it and this is what we're going to do. You're more likely to think that is an owner of a B&B that cares. So, negative reviews per se, I wouldn't be worried about them. The other thing is, if you're getting a large portion of negative reviews, if they're fake, you can flag them. There are tools that will do that. So, if you think they're fake, if you think you're competitive, you can do that with Google. Google aren't so good at actually taking them down. People like Trustpilot actually are quite good removing negative reviews if you think they're fake and they're not verified. But, if you are getting negative reviews, is actually use it as an opportunity to look at, is there a common pattern? Are people saying the same things rather than being defensive about it? Because I've seen that. So, for example, we did an extensive piece of work with a double glazing company. A double glazing has got terrible rep. And this company were getting consistent reviews saying the same thing. And all the owners of the double glazing company kept saying to us was, it's just people not wanting to pay their bills. They're trying to get out of paying money. But actually, what we did eventually was pulled together the data, pulled together the common threads, then went in and delivered some customer service training with that company in order to improve the issues that those consumers are raising. the consequence of actually doing that back work was that over time, their review rating went up. It was about 2.2 when I started and it went up to 4.5. So addressing those underlying issues is really, really important. I mean, there's no doubt if you put your head above the parapet, you're going to get some shots fired at you. You know, we are in an industry where not everybody agrees with what we do. And, you know, but actually, I suppose if at least you're getting noticed. But as Tracy says, you know, if you actually deal with them in a sensitive, proactive manner, then actually, I mean, it's like in the old days, I was taught as a sales person to go and seek complaints. Because actually, if somebody does complain, you've got the opportunity to actually make it right. And you actually loyalty is built based on that. So, yeah, you've got a way up for yourself. the culture of your business and where you are. But, yeah, personally, I think, well, you know, if you don't do anything, that's worse. You know, being vanilla is, and actually Sandy Kirkpatrick, if any of you remember him from our storytelling sessions, you know, being vanilla is really not very valuable to anybody. Try and talk to everyone, you talk to no one. It's all that sort of stuff. So I don't know if I helped. Sorry, I didn't notice you yellow hand waving at me. I wasn't into it. There you go. If you want to chip in, you know, shout at me, because I didn't even notice the hand raising. Can I just say something else on that point, actually, just really importantly, not having any reviews at all could be detrimental because if you avoid putting yourself out there as a review profile, 70% of customers do use reviews, and that includes B2B when they're making a purchasing decision. So they will actively seek them. If they don't find them, it's going to raise a red flag. Also, if you don't put reviews out there, unfortunately, people can go and set a trust pilot thing up on your company without your knowledge. They can just go and do that. Any consumer can go and do that in order to leave a review. And the problem is at the time you get that one disgruntled person who is determined to have their say, however justified, all that is going to happen is you're going to end up with one awful negative review. Whereas if you've already built a positive review profile, that is one amongst many, and then you've got the opportunity to deal with it. So I definitely would not avoid putting reviews online. I definitely would have a proactive review strategy. Yeah. Take control, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, that's really valuable. But morning, Tom. I'm really conscious actually. Hasn't time flown past? I will finish at 11 o'clock because I know that we all have our diaries. And, you know, so 11 o'clock, you know, please feel free to leave. And like I said, we will hang around for a little while afterwards. But there's no embarrassment, no rudeness because, like I said, I know we have diaries. So just in terms of, I want to very quickly touch on, you know, you talked about the website optimization, but I suppose in particular, we all tend to, when we start putting websites together, the first thing we do is we think about our desktop website. But the reality is that, I mean, traffic to websites is, I don't know if it's higher, but certainly equal to traffic via mobile devices, phones and such like. So, yeah, tell us a little bit about, you know, that sort of website stroke mobile optimization. So websites should always be mobile first and especially for farmers, because if you think about it, they're out and about in the field, they might be looking at something while they're out. So it should always be mobile first. See so many people build the desktop without considering mobile. And actually, the software that we use, we can practically render a different kind of mobile version completely. It's not that it's just responsive. It's that there are elements that are hidden for desktop and elements that are hidden for mobile. So it should always be mobile first. And if you use, if you do a search for website speed test, Google has a speed test. I can get Daniel to send the link out. And you can actually check your website for mobile and for desktop to find out what speed is, find out its accessibility score. In fact, that's a really useful measure of how much Google will value your website because what you should be aiming for is a green score across the board, both on mobile and desktop. There's also tablets as well. But generally, if it's mobile friendly, it'll be tablet friendly. So it is really important. And the other thing, and we do get unstuck, we do get caught up with this sometimes, is that there are different browsers. So for example, I've just built a website, tested it across the board, tested it on different mobile devices, tested it on every browser going except for Safari, get in front of the client and the client says, and this is me putting my hands up and saying, he's completely scrambled in Safari. So actually, it's not live, it's fine, it's in production, so we need to go back and do some work on that. So it's really important to just test it across the board and make sure that it works really well. Really valuable point there. And like I said, I mean, just think about how you use your phone. I mean, not to say that farmers set the old auto steer and then go on the internet. They would do that, would they? But, you know, they are using their devices in probably more than desktop. And we know that mobile traffic is huge anyway. And again, conscious of time, but I just, we mentioned AI earlier, artificial intelligence. What impacts that having then on the way farmers and consumers, for that matter, find the information they want? So there's nothing wrong with using AI. Google doesn't penalise AI. The social media does to some extent. They can spot AI generated content and they will tend to, you will have a, you will have a less reach. But actually on Google, Google Gemini is a good alternative to chat GPT. You might want to give that a go. We'll say the good thing about Google Gemini is it does actually get UK English and chat GPT. Just can't seem to grasp that. Everything comes out of Americanisms. So, so they do actually have their own AI tools. So for them to penalise it just wouldn't make sense. But what they want to know is that it would be very, I would say, probably not a good idea to just generate something in AI and just slap it in. What they want is to know that it's human quality. So it's well written. So it depends on the prompts that you give AI to get the result. And also I would rarely put out raw AI content. Take it as a basis and then write it so that it's personalised so it actually comes from the heart. You know, it needs to be written with proper human quality. You know, is it engaging? Is it interesting for the audience? Sometimes AI can be a little bit robotic. Is it relevant? Is it valuable? AI, again, tends to give you what they think is valuable. They give you what they think is relevant. You know your audience better than any machine in the world. Is it original and is it authentic? Now, original authentic is really important because any AI will not give you original content. It's most of the AI out there that we've used to do for SEO is generative AI, not cognitive AI, which means that it doesn't have that intelligence to think. So if you say give me original content, it cannot give you original content. It is going to give you a mixture of what other people have done before. And I will give you a specific example of something we've worked with where we put a post together and the client provided the copy and they said, can you please put this copy on? The client didn't tell us they've generated it from AI. Completely AI generated and then the client had a complaint that actually they've plagiarised somebody else's work. Why? Because AI had output exactly the same content for several different businesses. So you have to be really, really careful I would never, ever put more AI content out. So use it by all means. It's a valuable tool, but just make sure that you are personalising it and you're making it authentic. Thanks, Tracey. Yeah, absolutely. And nothing beats that authenticity, does it? That's, but sure, use. And actually, a confession. Farouk and I develop these sessions. We start with using AI to look at what sort of drives the background of the conversations, but we just use it as a starting point and then sort of, you know, personalise it for want of a better word. So we do find it a very useful way to get things started. But then actually, you know, and of course, if we talk to AI, often it is American, it doesn't understand farming and things like that, but it's still very powerful. Well, look, I'm really conscious of time. I mean, I define myself as a business development specialist, which means I'm blending marketing and sales strategies to grow businesses. And, you know, we grow businesses by finding and securing customers. You'll turn to a business you buy a business. So it's all very well getting found on Google or elsewhere, but really it's about, you know, SEO fitting into a broader business growth strategy. You know, we need to grow, you know, we need to build our sales funnels, don't we? I mean, sorry, Annabelle, I know you talk about obviously a lot of what you do will go through distributors and merchants. So you might not be so directly involved in that sales funnel, but you've still got, you know, in effect, you want to educate and inform your ultimate customer, but they still need to be very clear about where they can buy from. So very quickly in closing, you've got two minutes, Tracy, because we'll finish at 11 o'clock. How do we blend? How does it all fit together into our business? Yeah, absolutely right. SEO is not the end and like, you know, not the beyond the end or like we said, it's, if you've got a poor website, there's no point in doing SEO anyway. I see the same with paid ads. People do paid ads on a terrible website and then wonder why it doesn't convert. So I would say take a step back and have a really good holistic look at everything. Your branding, is your branding right? Have you got a brand kit? Is it consistent across the board? Is, have you got your messaging right? Have you got your values sorted? Have you got your mission and vision sorted? Do you know exactly what you're, what you're doing and what you're, what you're putting out there? Um, so make a brand kit is a really, really good starting point. Um, the business model canvas and the, the empathy campus map is a good starting point. Those are the things I would suggest that everybody has in place. Um, from that, um, build a, um, an omni-channel marketing, um, strategy that basically uses a sales funnel. If you search online, you can look for the race sales funnel. That's quite a common one to use. How are you going to build brand awareness in the first instance? How are you going to have micro conversions and micro conversions as the act part of the funnel, which is where, um, you're gathering email addresses, for example, and building a mailing list because then you're capturing your audience on the next stage from just brand awareness. And then how are you actually going to convert them? And that conversion shouldn't just be based on digital, um, online marketing. Sometimes actually picking up the phone is going to get that conversion. That can be even more powerful. Yeah, there's nothing like human interaction. People crave human interaction. And then at the end of that funnel, how are you going to engage and foster, loyalty in that client? How are you going to nurture them? How are you going to value that relationship? And that goes, you know, getting a positive review is one thing, but actually you want your client to be recommending you to other people as well. So there's a lot of consideration there. We definitely say that search engine optimization works best when it's integrated into a complete holistic branding and digital marketing strategy. Thanks, Tracey. That's brilliant. And, um, uh, you know, normally we have quite a bit more of a round table discussion. I, I'm not saying Tracey talks a lot. I would never infer that, but I, I'm hoping. And I do know Tracey quite well, so I think I can get away with saying things like that. Um, and normally we have more of a round table discussion, which Tom certainly is aware of, um, but we've run out of time. Um, I say we will hang around at the end.
