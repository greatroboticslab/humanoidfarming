 It was a long two days testing. We tried to cover every area we could but it comes a time then when you have to sit down and work out which one you think comes out on top and that certainly wasn't an easy process. Everyone had a different perception of what is value for money. We ended up with two or three hours of quite vigorous debate. There were moments there where we certainly disagreed. There were moments where we were never going to agree I suppose but we had to accept everyone's opinions at the end that we got through it. I think we came up with a good result. We all felt pretty similarly about how what charter we felt should win and that in the end was the Massey Ferguson 7615 the Dyna 6. For 130,500 the machine dynaed at 145 horsepower at the PTO which we felt was very close. It actually exceeded the manufacturer's specification on that. We also felt that in terms of specification and the spec that you got for the price was very good. It had four different locations in the cab that you could change and alter the transmission from as well as a considerable amount of adjustment in the transmission and engine settings that could suit individual buyers. It was probably a tractor that would suit everyone in the market from the simplest most basic operator right through to your contractor that could really put it to serious work and utilize all those features. All of these tractors are your top end tractors. They all have their pluses, all have their minuses. I'd get out there and try them all and just see which one perhaps suits the environment you'll be working in. I think the key thing for customers here is they need to really sit down and work out what they're actually going to be using the tractor for and then try and tailor the tractor that they're buying to suit their application. We felt overall the Massey was the most well rounded tractor in terms of it handled the power harrow well, it dynaed well and it also lugged the supercracker exceptionally well. This coupled with the features that you got for the money we felt was the reason why it won on the day. You know who needs to Oh. Hey, Moan! Oh, really? I would say in class of the house plus for the food district. I was just madance.. ...you get rid of the moans... Whenever you're all of a sudden, it took me both as much as possible.
