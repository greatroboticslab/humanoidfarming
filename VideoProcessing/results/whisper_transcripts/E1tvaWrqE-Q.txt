 38% of the total land surface around the world is dedicated to agriculture, with around a third of this used to grow crops. Just four varieties of plants make up the vast majority of what's grown, soybeans, corn, wheat, and rice. But there are many more strange and unusual types of farms that you probably never knew existed, from kiwifruit to strange spices. Here are the top 15 most amazing type of farm crops. 15. Sunflowers Originating in the Americas, and known to have been cultivated for at least 7,000 years, there's nothing quite like passing by a field full of thousands of wild sunflowers, and watching them during the day as their heads turn to face the moving sun. With vibrant golden petals and towering stems, they've become a popular crop around the world for a variety of benefits. The main reason they're grown is for their seeds, which are rich in oil and highly nutritious. Sunflower oil is not only a healthy cooking oil, but also a valuable ingredient in many processed foods. And the seeds themselves are a popular snack, known for their protein, fiber, and healthy fats. Beyond their food uses, though, sunflowers provide several other important benefits to farmers, particularly for their ability to absorb heavy metal and toxins from the soil, which is a process that's called phytoremediation. This makes them useful in cleaning up contaminated areas and improving soil quality to help prepare to grow other crops. So sunflowers play a vital role in the year-to-year crop rotation, helping break pest and disease cycles and improve soil fertility. These nectar-rich flowers also attract bees and other pollinating insects, which further supports biodiversity and crop pollination. And sunflowers, too, can act as a windbreak in fields, reduces soil erosion, and help conserve water. Thriving in well-drained, sunny locations with plenty of direct sunlight, they're an adaptable crop as well. And usually planted in the spring, they grow so quickly they can normally be harvested within just a few months. 14. Microgreens Microgreens are edible plants that are harvested at the early stages of growth and have become increasingly popular in recent years in recipes. It's not just the way that they look that earns them a place on the dinner plate, though. It's because they're nutritional powerhouses, often containing up to 40 times more vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants than their mature counterparts. Offering a wide range of flavors, from the peppery bite of arugula to the spicy tang of radishes, they can easily be used to enhance the taste of most dishes. Beyond their flavor and nutrient content, Microgreens are also rich in substances that have been shown to be associated with several other health benefits, including improved digestion and enhanced immune function. With all these reasons for growing them, there's something else that's made them an increasingly popular type of crop, and that's their rapid growth. Within a short 7 to 21 days, they're typically ready for harvest, depending on the variety, which is such a quick turnaround time that farmers are able to cultivate fresh greens year-round, even in indoor settings. It is possible to quickly turn around a profit by growing these Microgreens in a small holding, but if you have the space and the time to expand this over a larger area, it can be highly profitable. By selecting the best quality seeds and varieties that are in demand by nearby restaurants and businesses, such as arugula, kale, or radish, Microgreens can be grown hydroponically or outdoors, and will only need 4 to 6 hours of indirect sunlight per day, or alternatively, be placed under grow lights. 13. Mushrooms They may not be the first thing you think about as a growable crop, but there's a huge demand for mushrooms around the world, and the only way to keep up with this need is to grow them in controlled conditions. They provide a rich source of essential nutrients, including vitamins like B-complex vitamins and minerals such as selenium and potassium, and offer these benefits while having a low-calorie content and high-protein content, making them an excellent choice for those seeking a nutritious and low-fat protein source. Also naturally low in cholesterol and sodium, they have an umami flavor, which enhances the taste of various dishes, from savory soups to hearty stir-fries. They come in a wide range of varieties, too, each with its own unique flavor profile, ranging from the earthy taste of shiitake mushrooms to the delicate, nutty flavor of oyster mushrooms. Cultivating them not only produces a sellable product, but can also be beneficial to the environment, particularly because their mycorrhizal relationships with plants, and they can help nutrient absorption and promote healthy soil. Furthermore, some mushroom species are utilized in mycoremediation, a process in which they help break down and remove pollutants and contaminants from the environment. It's rare, though, for them to be grown outside, and are usually found in vast indoor farms where every element can be controlled for the best yield. It's not as simple as sowing seeds and waiting for them to grow, either, as specific techniques are needed for the type of mushroom being grown. Common methods include using substrates like sawdust, straw, or compost along with spore inoculation or mycelium transplantation, with the exact technique depending on the mushroom variety. They do, though, need specific temperature, humidity, and lighting conditions. These can vary significantly between different mushroom species, meaning growers need to carefully set up and monitor their facility accordingly. 12. Ginseng Ginseng is the root of a number of related plant species that have been popular for thousands of years, particularly in Asia, because of its medicinal properties. These advantages come from the root's adaptogenic properties, which can help the body to adapt to stressors. It's said to enhance resilience, reduce fatigue, and improve overall well-being, and it's been proven to stimulate the immune system, therefore helping the body to fend off infection and disease. As well as these physical benefits, some studies have shown that ginseng may improve cognitive function, including memory, attention, and mental clarity, so it's often used as a natural remedy to combat mental fatigue, as well as for its energy-enhancing ability, potentially increasing stamina and vitality, which is particularly appealing to athletes and people seeking a natural energy boost. It also offers anti-inflammatory effects due to the presence of certain bioactive compounds, which can be useful to those with chronic inflammatory conditions. Furthermore, ginseng is rich in antioxidants, which help neutralize harmful free radicals in the body, potentially reducing the risk of chronic diseases in the first place. It is therefore in very high demand, but it isn't exactly the easiest of things to grow at large scale. The herb thrives in well-drained, moist, and shaded forest environments, often found nestled beneath the canopies of trees. Ginseng plants are typically propagated from seeds planted in late summer or early fall, and require a cold stratification period to break dormancy. Germination may take several years, with plants requiring four to six years of growth to reach maturity before they can be harvested. To ensure this optimal growth, ginseng farmers must create a forest-like environment with 70% to 80% shade, which is achieved through shade cloth or natural canopy of trees. Weeding and pest control is a constant process to protect the delicate ginseng plants from competing vegetation, potential threats. But when done right, it can prove to be extremely profitable. 11. Kiwi Fruit The kiwi fruit is a small, furry-skinned fruit with bright green flesh and tiny black seeds, and it's primarily grown in regions with temperate climates. They're high in vitamins and minerals, especially with vitamin C, which is known for its immune-boosting properties. But the fruit also provide vitamin K, vitamin E, and several B vitamins, as well as essential minerals like potassium and folate, all of which contribute to overall health and well-being. They are loaded with antioxidants, too, such as flavonoids and carotenoids, and are excellent source of dietary fiber, supporting digestive health by promoting regular bowel movements and aiding in nutrient absorption. They contain a number of compounds that aren't found in many other places as well, with one of the most beneficial being an enzyme called actinidin, which aids in the digestion of proteins. This enzyme can be helpful for individuals with digestive issues and promotes a much-improved level of nutrient absorption. Requiring mild temperatures, well-drained soil, and plenty of sunlight, the plants are propagated from cuttings or grafted onto root stalks, and require strong support structures like trestles. Regular pruning is also essential to manage plant growth and encourage fruit production, and harvesting usually takes place in late summer or early fall when the fruits are firm, sweet, and aromatic. Kiwi fruit farming is a particularly big industry in China, where 2.2 million tons are produced each year, with New Zealand, Italy, Greece, and some of the world's biggest growers. 10. Lavender Creating fields carpeted with deep purple hues, lavender is not just an aesthetically impressive plant, but one that also offers a number of benefits. This versatile herb is known for its therapeutic, culinary, and cosmetic properties, making it an in-demand product for various industries. It is probably best known, though, for its calming and relaxing effects, with lavender essential oil being widely used in aromatherapy to help alleviate stress, anxiety, and insomnia. Its soothing scent has the power to ease tension and promote better sleep, and it also has natural antibacterial and antiseptic properties, making it a valuable addition to skincare products. With its ability to help soothe skin irritations, reduce inflammation, and even aid in the healing of minor wounds and burns, lavender-infused creams, lotions, and soaps are sold all around the world. It's also been used for centuries in the traditional medicine for its potential health benefits, such as potentially helping to alleviate headaches, muscle pain, and digestive discomfort when consumed as an herbal tea or used in herbal remedies. It, too, is popular in cuisine, where it adds a twist to various dishes and beverages, with a floral and slightly sweet flavor. There is a good agricultural argument for growing lavender as well, with a number of advantages coming from choosing it as a crop. It has low water requirements, which makes it a more drought-tolerant and eco-friendly crop, and it can be used to earn a living from land regions prone to water scarcity, without putting an excessive strain on local water resources. It's also very good for attracting pollinators such as bees and butterflies, so it contributes to biodiversity and helps support the health of ecosystems. 9. Chinese Water Chestnuts Chinese water chestnuts are an aquatic tuber plant that's been cultivated for centuries in Asia, and more recently around other parts of the world. These crunchy, sweet-tasting tubers are a good source of dietary fiber, providing digestive health benefits and aiding in weight management, and are also low in calories and fat, making them a healthy addition. Importantly, they're rich in essential minerals such as potassium, manganese, and copper, which contribute to overall well-being and form an important foundation for a balanced diet. The reason they're so popular, though, is their crisp and juicy texture, which adds a crunch to both raw and cooked dishes. They're commonly used in Asian cuisine, particularly in stir-fries, salads, and soups, where their mild, slightly sweet flavor pairs well with a wide range of ingredients. In traditional medicine, Chinese water chestnuts have been used for their potential medicinal properties as well. They're believed to have diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects, which help with various conditions, particularly those where extra support is needed for kidney and bladder health. The large demand for Chinese water chestnuts poses an interesting problem for farmers because they need wet conditions to thrive. They're typically grown in shallow water or marshy areas, and farmers often create paddies or plots of land with a controlled water supply to ensure the proper conditions. The water helps maintain an ideal temperature and provides buoyancy for the developing tubers, which grow underground, anchored by the submerged stems. The water chestnut plant absorbs these nutrients from the water and the sediment, and this creates a sustainable and eco-friendly system of cultivation. To harvest them, they need to be dug up from the muddy bottom of the water-filled fields and carefully so as to avoid damaging those delicate tubers. After collecting them, they're then typically cleaned and peeled and then can be enjoyed fresh or stored for future use. 8. Grapefruit Grapefruits are large citrus fruits that were accidentally created in Barbados in the 18th century when sweet oranges were crossed with pomelos. With a distinct tart sweet flavor, it has an extremely high vitamin C content and can help boost the body's defenses against infections if eaten in large enough quantities. It's also a good source of dietary fiber, which is beneficial for digestive health and also has been linked to cardiovascular health benefits, such as helping blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease, and lower the levels of bad cholesterol. The antioxidants in grapefruit, such as flavonoids, help protect blood vessels and reduce inflammation. And some research has even suggested that certain phytochemicals in grapefruit may inhibit the growth of cancer cells and could be beneficial to recovery in certain cases. Grapefruit will grow in various conditions, but to get the best quality fruits, the process needs to be carefully managed. These trees require well-drained soil and plenty of sunlight, and they're typically grown in regions with warm subtropical climates such as Florida and Texas in the United States. They're normally propagated from the seeds or grafted onto the rootstock to ensure the right fruit characteristics, and proper pruning and maintenance are essential throughout their development. to encourage healthy growth and fruit production. Farmers also use various pest control methods to protect their fruit from common threats like citrus pests and diseases in the lead-up to the harvest. Even though machinery is available that can retrieve the fruits when they're ready, it is still best to pick them by hand, as they can be easily bruised. The timing of the harvest is also critical to ensure the fruit reaches its peak flavor and ripeness. But once harvested, a grapefruit can be stored for a surprisingly long time, making it available to consumers all throughout the year. 7. Goji Berries Goji berries, which are also known as wolfberries, are small, bright red fruits that have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries, and in recent decades have become popular as a superfood elsewhere. They are a rich source of antioxidants, including vitamin C and beta-carotene, which help protect cells from stress and support overall health. And they're also packed with essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamins A, B2, and iron, making them a valuable addition to a balanced diet. Goji berries are thought to be particularly helpful in maintaining eye health because of the high concentrations of beta-carotene. And they have anti-inflammatory properties too, which can help alleviate chronic inflammation associated with various conditions, such as arthritis and cardiovascular disease. Another significant benefit of these berries is their potential to improve skin quality, again because of the antioxidants that can help protect the skin from premature aging caused by UV radiation. Some studies suggest that goji berry extracts may even enhance skin hydration and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, so it's no surprise they're so popular as a health supplement. They aren't, though, the easiest crops to farm, and careful cultivation practices are needed to ensure the production of high-quality fruit. Goji plants are normally grown in places with a sunny climate such as China, Tibet, and Himalayan regions, where they thrive in well-drained soil with a slightly alkaline pH level. They can be propagated from seeds or cuttings and require proper spacing to ensure growth and sunlight exposure, and can be trained to grow on trellises or support structures, so it's easier to harvest the berries when they're ready. It's when they've developed a bright red color that they're ripe, and once they've been picked, they can be dried in the sun to preserve their shelf life without losing their nutritional value. 6. Chestnuts Chestnuts have been a staple in the diets of a number of cultures for centuries thanks to their nutritional content. Relatively low in fat compared to other nuts, they're a good source of dietary fiber, which adds in digestive health and are rich in complex carbohydrates, providing a valuable source of energy. This means they're a good addition to diets focused on sustained energy, and can be particularly beneficial for athletes and active individuals. Also, a great source of vitamin C as well as B vitamins, including B6, which plays a crucial role in metabolism and brain health. They further provide quantities of minerals, particularly potassium and copper, which can help regulate blood pressure, support cardiovascular health, help with the formation of red blood cells, and assist in maintaining healthy bones and connective tissues. With all these benefits, they're regularly farmed in various different places, but require specialized cultivation methods for the best results. Chestnut trees, mainly Castania sativa in Europe and Castania dentata in North America, or require well-drained soil and plenty of sunlight, and are usually propagated from seeds, although grafted trees can be an alternative. Chestnut trees live for a long time, once matured, they can bear fruit for many years. These chestnuts are harvested in the autumn once the shells have hardened, and are fairly simple to collect, as they can be picked up from the ground or shaken from the tree branches. After harvest, chestnuts can be stored for several weeks in a cool, dry place, and from there can be roasted, boiled, or used in a variety of culinary ways, from stuffing to soups and desserts. 5. Naked Oats Naked oats, also known as hull-less oats or naked barley, are a special type of oat that, unlike traditional oats, have a husk that's attached loosely to the grain, which makes them easier to process. As with all oats, they are a rich source of dietary fiber, particularly beta-glucans, which have been linked to helping lower cholesterol levels and improving blood sugar control. And they're also an excellent source of complex carbohydrates, providing sustained energy throughout the day. Unlike refined carbohydrates, which can lead to spikes and crashes in blood sugar levels, the carbohydrates in naked oats are slowly digested, helping to maintain stable energy levels and keep hunger under control. They contain minerals and vitamins, including B vitamins such as thiamine, panothetic acid, magnesium, phosphorus, and iron. These nutrients are essential for various bodily functions, including energy metabolism, nerve function, and red blood cell production. They are packed with antioxidants as well, which help protect cells from damages caused by free radicals, and can help fend off chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease. As these oats are without the natural protection of traditional varieties, they aren't as simple to grow, but farmers with the right environment can make larger profit margins, with the end product being sold at a premium. Once a suitable location has been found, high-quality, disease-resistant seed varieties for this specific growing region need to be acquired, and they're sown in the spring and early summer, with proper spacing between rows and plants being essential to ensure adequate airflow and prevent disease. They'll then be ready to harvest late in the summer or early fall when the grains have fully matured, and the loose husks make it far easier to separate the grain from the chaff during the harvest. Very little further cleaning is needed, and the naked oats can be used in the same way as other oat varieties. 4. Maple Syrup Maple syrup is a very popular type of natural sweetener that originated in North America. Made from the sap of sugar maple trees, it's a great way to add natural sweetness to a diet. As compared to refined sugars and artificial sweeteners, it contains fewer calories and has a lower glycemic index, which means it can help regulate blood sugar levels more effectively. For individuals looking to reduce their sugar intake, maple syrup can be a much healthier alternative. As a naturally occurring product, maple syrup is also packed with essential nutrients such as manganese, zinc, calcium, and potassium. Manganese, in particular, plays a vital role in various metabolic processes and antioxidant defense mechanisms within the body. It is also, of course, known for its unique flavor, which includes a hint of caramel, vanilla, and a little bit of woodiness. This distinctive taste enhances a wide range of dishes, from breakfast pancakes and waffles, to salad dressings and marinades, with its versatility making it a popular ingredient in both sweet and savory dishes. It's available in various grades, with the best quality syrup being very valuable to farmers. In regions where they thrive, you'll often see fields full of maple trees with the sole purpose of providing the sap for production of the syrup, but there are several production stages before it's ready to see. At first, the trees are tapped, where in late winter or early spring, small holes are drilled into the trunks and tubes are inserted. These allow for the sap to pour out and be collected, and in the largest operations, will drip directly into a tubing system that transports it into a collection tank. From there, the sap is put into an evaporator where it's boiled to remove the water, and this is when it begins to thicken into the consistency of a syrup. It's then filtered to remove impurities and sediment, and then be graded based on its color and flavor, before being bottled and ready to be poured on your pancakes. One of the good things about this method of production is that it doesn't affect the long-term health of the ecosystem. Responsible farming focuses on maintaining healthy sugar maple forests and minimizing their environmental impact. And also, the trees are not harmed during the tapping process, meaning they can be used for many, many years. 3. Spinach Spinach is a leafy green vegetable that's an important part of nutrition in countries around the world. As a rich source of vitamins and minerals, particularly vitamin K, A, C, folate, iron, and potassium, it offers many different benefits. Vitamin K, for example, which is in high levels in spinach, is essential for blood clotting and bone health. A single cup of cooked spinach provides several times the daily recommended intake of this important nutrient. Furthermore, vitamin A supports healthy vision, skin, and immune function, while vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that aids in wound healing and immune system support. With plenty of other benefits, such as helping with eye health, assisting with regulating blood pressure, and helping to lower the risk of heart disease, spinach is a true superfood, even more so because of how adaptable the plant is. Traditional soil-based farming involves preparing well-drained, nutrient-rich soil for planting spinach seeds, with it thriving in either open fields or protected environments like greenhouses. But in recent years, farm technology has helped to significantly increase yields. Hydroponic and aquaponic systems allow growers to control factors such as the temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels, which result in efficient and year-round production. With hydroponic systems using the nutrient-rich water solutions to feed the plants directly, and aquaponic systems integrating fish farming with vegetable cultivation, which create a sustainable and symbiotic food production process. 2. Bell Peppers Bell peppers, with their bold colors and crisp texture, are certainly a flavorful addition to dishes, but also a highly nutritional one too. Offering numerous health benefits, they are rich in essential vitamins and minerals, particularly vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin B6, folate, and potassium. These nutrients play vital roles in bodily functions and contribute to overall well-being. Vitamin C, which is particularly abundant in bell peppers, is a potent antioxidant that supports the immune system, promotes healthy skin, and aids in wound healing. A single bell pepper can provide up to 150% of the daily recommended intake of vitamin C, making it an excellent source of this essential nutrient. There is also a source of vitamin A, which is crucial for vision, skin health, and immune function. The vitamin B6 in bell peppers is essential for metabolism and brain development, while folate is important during pregnancy. Potassium, which is present in high levels, supports heart health by regulating blood pressure and maintaining proper muscle and nerve function. And they're a great way to provide carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin, which are essential for maintaining healthy vision and reducing risk of age-related macular degeneration and cataracts. And they almost act as natural sunscreens for the eyes, protecting them from harmful UV rays and oxidative stress. With all these benefits, there's a big drive to ensure everyone has access to bell peppers if they want them, and they're farmed on an enormous scale. They thrive in well-drained soil that's rich in organic matter, and once a suitable location has been found, high-quality bell pepper seeds are chosen based on the desired variety and characteristics. There is no right time to harvest them beyond being the size and color that you're looking for. Amazingly, though, they'll change color throughout the season, and the precise timing of the harvest depends on the intended use, as green, yellow, orange, and red bell peppers all have distinctive flavors. 1. Saffron You'll know it as the most expensive spice of all, but one that can transform a dish. But what is it that makes saffron so special? It's also known as the red gold. It's one of the most expensive and coveted spices in the world, and comes from the stigma of the crocus sativus flower. Its cultivation, though, is one of the most meticulous and labor-intensive, which is why it can be worth as much as $5,000 a pound. The main reason it's so sought after is its distinctive flavor and aroma. Saffron gives a rich, earthy, and slightly sweet taste to dishes, making it a valuable ingredient in a number of cuisines worldwide. And fortunately, a small amount of saffron can go a long way, as it's known for its potency and the intensity it adds to both sweet and savory dishes. It also adds its bright color to any dish, and acts as a natural and healthy alternative to artificial food coloring. Its vibrant hue makes saffron-infused dishes visually appealing, but it offers far more than just the color and the flavor. Saffron has several potential health benefits, too, as it contains compounds like crocin and saffronol, which have antioxidant properties and may help protect cells from oxidative stress. Saffron's also been studied for its potential to improve mood, alleviate symptoms of depression, and enhance cognitive function, and has, for thousands of years, been used in traditional medicine for its potent anti-inflammatory properties. Actually extracting saffron, though, is tricky. It requires growing huge fields full of the crocus sativus flowers, with the flowers typically blooming in the fall, with each plant producing multiple flowers. The saffron threads then have to be harvested by hand from the flowers, which are carefully plucked in the early morning to preserve their freshness and flavor. Each flower produces only a few precious threads, and the red-orange stigmas are carefully separated from the rest of the flower, as only the stigmas contain the saffron spice. The separated saffron threads are then dried, either by gently toasting them in a dry pan or placing them in a warm, well-ventilated room. Proper drying is crucial to prevent mold and preserve saffron's quality before they're packaged in airtight containers to protect them from moisture and light. Amazingly, it takes as many as 75,000 flowers to produce around a pound in weight of saffron, so it's easily one of the most intense crops of all. Saffron farming also requires specific growing conditions, with well-drained soil in a sunny or semi-shaded location. They are typically planted in late spring or early summer and require a dry, dormant period during the summer months, and usually in specific regions that are known for their favorable conditions, such as Iran, India, Spain, and Greece, all regions that have a long history of saffron cultivation and have perfected the art of farming the spice over many generations. I'll see you guys next time. Thank you to our channel members.
