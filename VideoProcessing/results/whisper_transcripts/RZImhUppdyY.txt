 I've got something serious to say to you. I've made a big decision. You are no longer the tractor driver on this farm. What am I then? I've decided I'm going to make you Farm Manager. Really? Yep. I want you to run the farming side of it. You're fired. What? You're fired. You can't fire. I'm the boss. I'm the Farm Manager. You're fired. I'm not fired. You are. I'm not because you haven't heard how this is going to work. Tell me that and then you're fired. Here's how I want it to work. I've got to concentrate this year on making money out of that bit of the farm which isn't farmed. Yes. You've never even been here. No. And then that means I'm not going to have the time to really concentrate on this bit of the farm. On the arable. Yeah. So I'm going to put you on the arable. And I'm going to concentrate on this. And I've just had a thought. Mm-hmm. Why don't we make it a competition? Who in the next 12 months can make the most money? Me out of unfarmed land or you out of farmed land? Farmed land. I like it. So we'll get a whiteboard. We'll put it on the wall. And then it's Jeremy's profit and costs. Caleb's profit and costs. Yep. OK? And then it'll run through the year. Mm. I think that'll be quite good fun. I think it'll be fun as well. And I'm going to win, so it's fine. You aren't going to win. I'm going to win this competition. Right, get out and get back on your tractor and go manage the farm. I don't need to now. I'm going to go and have a nice walk round. Analysise the soil. Analysise? Hmm. That's a word, isn't it? Analysise. No. Analysise. Analysise. Analysise. To get my farming the unfarmed project off the ground, I did some research. And discovered that my local supermarket was charging 6p a Blackburn. Which meant my hedgerows were fruity gold mines. Look. 6p, 12, 24. There's 50p there. Another 50p there. And there. And there. Pound there. There's 30 quid in this one bush alone. Easy. In order to maximise profits, though, I'd need to harvest them as cheaply as possible. So, rather craftily, I asked if I could borrow a blackberry-picking machine to see if I liked it. Shit. It's a bit bigger than I was expecting, mate. Just a big, big, big one. How are you? Yes, I'm very, very good. We've got the grain wagon. I'll just back him up. And if you could pull over to the right, is that all right? If you pull over to the right? Yeah. Sorry, mate. Do you mind backing up? Thank you. So that that wagon can get through and go over those. All right. Cheers, mate. Thanks. I'm a car park attendant. That's what I've become now. What are you doing? I'm loading a lorry. Yeah, well, it's in the way. Your farming's... Your farming is in the way of my farming. No, your farming's getting in the way of my farming. It isn't. I just need to get this in. Look at that. You don't even know what it is, do you? No. What are you doing? Blackberry-picking. Why don't you load the wagon up, then come and see real farming happening? Real farming my arse. What? The things I bought that now, look. Yeah, I'm trying to... I thought if it's too quiet. You're wasting picking up with乳 and whatever's going on. Can we diffuse some??
