I want to tell y'all something. This is the first time that we've done anything like this with the ladies. We had two rehearsals. I didn't know I was going to be directed. I found out because I just happened to be in the church when they were rehearsing. And I'm thinking, my friends. But I tell you, God has shown up, and God has truly been in this place today. today. These ladies have all just decided and committed of themselves to come and participate and to sing. There's such a sweet spirit of unity that's on display today. These ladies just came today to give God praise and they came to tell him thank you. How many of you today have a thank you in your spirit that is reserved for no one but God? A whole lot of people in your life you can say thank you to, but there's a special place that you should have reserved within your life and within your heart that belongs only to God. So we're just going to tell him this morning thank you for being so good to us. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for being so good to me. Thank you for being so good to me. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We praise the Lord. It's all good.

Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm sweating. I just... I'm amazed at the faithfulness of God. How God will pull you together when the enemy tries to separate. God says, if you just put me in the middle of what you're doing, I'll be in the mist. And whenever God is in the mist, unity will be in the mist. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. So many times, the enemy has tried to rock us and throw us off our step or, you know, shake us. But God has an amazing way of stopping the shaking. Amen. When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Lord will lift up a standard against him. Amen. I want to tell these ladies, you have been a standard this morning. A standard of what it means to be a godly woman. to walk in unity, to stand together in faith as sisters in the Lord. I want to tell you that I am grateful for each one of you. And I'm proud of each one of you. And I thank God for each and every one of you and what you have done on this day because you've set an example but fellas, fellas, they've set a bar. They done put a bar up here and not the kind of bar you drink at. They set a standard. They set a standard. And next time, we have some more ladies in this place. And my expectation is that everybody will be up here. Every lady that's a part of this ministry. Even mother back there in the green. We're going to get you a spot too. We got you a spot. We holding one for you up here. But we give God praise today for being so good, so kind, so gracious, so wonderful. And we don't consider it just a given that his grace and his mercy covers us. But we should have an expectation if we're walking with our Father that he is with us in every step. So I am, again, proud, proud, proud. Band, let's give God praise for the band too. Thank you. Ladies, I don't know. We're going to, I know what I'm going to do. I'm going to, we're going to sing on off the platform. And I'm going to show you how we're going to do. One more time. Now, our repertoire right now is kind of limited. We only got three songs. As a group, as a group, as a group. We, we got more than three at the church, but, but I'm saying these, these ladies here, y'all, y'all got a three song repertoire. Amen. Amen. I'm okay. All right. So we're going to sing ourselves right on off this platform. Y'all ready? Just won't. Forever. And ever. And ever. For all. All you've done. All you've done for me. Simple blessings and glory. And honor. And ever. Said they all. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Just want to praise you. Forever. And ever. And ever. And ever. And ever. For all. All you've done. All you've done for me. All you've done for me. All you've done for me. Yeah. Yeah. Blessings and glory. And honor. Said they all. Say blessings and glory. And honor. Said they all. Thank you. Thank you, Jesus. For bless. Thank you, Jesus. For bless. Thank you, Jesus. For bless. Thank you, Jesus. For bless. And honor. Thank you, Jesus. All you've done for me. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. For bless. Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia. What a time, what a time, what a time. What a time. time and I just want to thank you all for coming out to support our endeavors here at Harvest Time Church. We thank you as friends and family and loved ones. We know when you invite people, people don't have to come but we just want to say thank you for coming out to support us because people really don't have to support you and so I just want to personally say thank you from the Harvest Time family for for just coming out being who you are and to come out to celebrate with us and maybe this will not be your last time but we hope not that you just come to see us but we want you to experience the love of God. We want you to know that God is in this place and God is on the move. God is working it out and we thank we thank God that this is the body of Christ. This is what it looks like and so I just want to thank all of you for just coming and sharing with us and just just letting God do what God does and so and one thing I do want to say that when you come into the house of God you should come in with an expectation. If you expect nothing most of the time you get nothing. So if you just come in just expecting to meet God just right where you are it doesn't matter where you are what you're going through if you just come in with just a little expectation God will meet you right where you are and he will do exceedingly and abundantly above above all that you could ever think or ask according to his riches in glory. And so I just wanted to say that God wanted me to remind us that when we come into a place we're not just coming into a building but we're coming in to have an experience and an encounter with him. An encounter and an experience that will last us all week long until we come back again together corporately. But just come into a place knowing and expecting God to show up and guess what? He always will show up because when it's about him when the spotlight is on him he can't do anything but to show up because it's all about him. He says everything that we do we should make it about him and so here at Harvest time church we want to make everything that we do everything that we say about him. And now I'm up here to take up the offering. Come on down ladies and gentlemen. Come on down. Father we just want to say thank you for today Lord. We thank you because you said you will give seed to the sower. So we thank you Lord for the seed. We thank you Lord that in your hands you will multiply it. We thank you Lord that whatever you have purpose in our hearts to give that is what we will give. And as we have purpose to give it to you Lord we know that you will bless it a thousand times over. And so Lord we thank you that these seeds and these tithes and these offerings God are to upbuild your kingdom. Your kingdom not our kingdom but your kingdom. And so Father we thank you let every heart be touched Father to give the measure that you have put in them to give. And so Father I want to thank you for each and every person here God. I thank you Lord that you will bless them and you will multiply them. I thank you Lord that this monetary these monetary gifts Father go all throughout the nations. And so Father we say thank you. We thank you and we thank you. And so Father we thank you even now for the increase. And so Father you give us increase so that we can increase your kingdom. And so Father we just thank you. We bless you. We honor you. And we glorify you on this day. In Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And we also have what we call a dollar offering that we do. It's just a dollar, but in the hands of God, it is a mighty dollar. And so this dollar goes all around the nations, changing, not just changing situations, changing lives. Just a dollar offering. And so the young people are going to come by and just, if you have a dollar, they'll come and pick it up from you. And they'll bless you as they pick it up. Collect the dollars. The segunda dollars. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes, hallelujah. Hallelujah. All right, man. Hallelujah. Let's give God praise for the best band in Huntsville, Alabama. Our own band in Huntsville, Alabama. You know, they are anointed to do what they do. And I just want to thank God for each and every one of these brothers who knows that this is just not about music, but it's a ministry. It's a ministry, a ministry that changes lives, changes hearts. And that is what God gives us gifts and talents for so that we can honor him with them. And I want to be partial. I got to be partial because my husband and I always talk about this. We never thought in a million years we would see what we're seeing on the platform. But to see our son, Michael. I know he doesn't like attention, but you guys have no idea. We didn't even know that was in Michael. And I just want to thank God that God is true to his promises. If he's made you a promise about your children, no matter what it looks like, no matter what it sounds like, no matter what the enemy tries to do, you just hang on to what God has spoken over your children. And you continue to speak what thus says the Lord over your children. This is miraculous for us. This we never saw coming. But when you take your seed, no matter how old they are, when you give them back to the Lord, when you just say, God, even though they're this age, that age, whatever it is, I'm going to dedicate my seed back to you. Back to you, God. And God being so faithful, he says, whatever we put in his hand, he'll take care of that. He will multiply that. And so for all of us who have children, if you put them in God's hand, don't worry about it. God knows how to take care of them better than you ever could take care of them. And you're just they're just on loan to you anyway. But I tell you, and I want to say that to all of the mothers and fathers who have children out there, who you're still just waiting to come in. Don't worry about it. Just continue to pray about it and watch God do what God does. And he will do it. We are living testimonies of that, that God is gracious and God is merciful. I have a whole lot of announcements to go over here. But as you can see, we have a lot of announcements in our bulletin. So I'm just going to hit some of the highlights and move from there. And so we know we have discipleship training Sunday mornings at 9 a.m. right here in the sanctuary. You know, Harvest Time Church really does a lot of things. It may look like a small building, but God has really blessed us to be able to be international, to do a lot of things for our community in the city, you know, all over the world. We also have an apostolic school of ministry, which starts on Mondays at 6 p.m., which registration is coming up, which will be on July the 28th, starting at 530. So if you want to come out and you want to learn more about the kingdom of God, you may want to register for those for that school. So you really will grow. You will learn about who God is, know who Jesus is, who the Holy Spirit is, and who you are in him. And so I would admonish everyone to come out to that. And on Wednesday nights, midweek Bible study, but we don't call it Bible study here. We call it training and equipping service. So if you want to be trained and equipped, because this is a training and equipping house. You know, each church has a different assignment, but this church in particular is a training and equipping house. So Wednesdays at 630. On Sunday morning, on Thursdays, we have intercessory prayer. On Thursdays at 930 a.m., Saturdays at 7 a.m., and Sunday at 9 a.m. So we do a lot of praying around here. We do a lot of praying around here because without prayer, you can't do anything. We do a lot of praying around here. And so we also have we're going to have our men's retreat, which is going to be July the 18th through the 20th at the Reeler Resort. And so far, I've heard that we have 16 men that will be there. And so when you get a whole bunch of men together, we expect God to do something amazing in the mix of men, getting the men lined up, getting the men where they should be, where they need to be as they grow, when they grow in the Lord and they do what God has called them to do. They can run their households more efficiently. They can lead wherever they are more efficiently. So there's nothing better than having a godly man. Also, we're going to have our annual barbecue, which is going to be on July the 18th. And we start at 4 p.m. And we start at 4 p.m. And we start at 4 p.m. So everyone come out. Everything is free. It's free, fun and food and fellowship. So just come out. Bring as many people as you'd like. We just want to see your face. And it will be at the Legacy Center is where it will be. And so just come out and have fun and just relax. Let your hair down. And just enjoy being with other like-minded believers. And so I just want to invite everyone to come out to that. And so did I miss anything? Apostle didn't miss anything. Okay. All right. So now is the time in the service where we're going to hear from the servant of God. Kingdom Kids. Who's got Kingdom Kids? Gabby. So everybody who's going to Kingdom Kids, you can go with Gabby. The ages are four. Well, the new, the babies up to zero to, what do you have, four, six? Is it three? Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All the young people go with Gabby. Go with Gabby. All the babies go with Gabby. And that's Gabby back there standing back there holding. The baby. So who's, who's teaching the Kingdom Kids? Who's teaching the Kingdom Kids? Who's teaching the Kingdom Kids ages all the way up to 13? So as they're getting that together, we want to invite all, actually we want to acknowledge all of our visitors for today. If we have any first time visitors in the house, you can stand up or raise your hand. So Harvest Time can greet you. We thank you all for coming out to worship with us. We thank you. And I'm sure they have little gifts for you there. So anyone who didn't get one, please raise your hand. Okay. And she'll, they'll come by, they'll take care of it. So no, no gifts today. Okay. No gifts today. They didn't tell me that before I got up here. So no gifts today. But anyway, so now moving on. So now we've come to the part of the service where we are going to invite up the servant of God, the man of God, who is going to give the word of God. So can everybody stand with me as we welcome up to the platform, my husband, Apostle Timothy W. Battle, a man of God, a servant of God, a man after God's own heart. The man that I love. And I love you all. So I love you. I love you. So I love you. I love you. Okay. So let's take care of it. I love you. I love you. I love you. We love you. I love you. Hallelujah Hallelujah Come on, let's give God praise Hallelujah Come on, let's give God praise Thank you, Lord Thank you, Lord Thank you, Lord While you're standing Father God, we just want to say

Thank you, Lord Thank you, God Thank you, God If you have your Bibles with you Would you stand with me, please And turn to the Gospel According to Luke Gospel of Luke All who's able If you could stand, please Gospel According to Luke The 15th chapter Of Luke We will be starting at the 11th verse When you have it, say amen Amen And it reads like this It says Then he said A certain man had two sons And the younger of them Said to his father Father, give me the portion of goods That falls to me So he divided to them His livelihood And not many days after The younger son gathered all together Journeyed to a far country And there wasted his possessions With prodigal living But when he had spent all There arose a severe famine In that land And he began to be in want Then he went and joined himself To a citizen of that country And he sent them And he sent him into his fields To feed swine And he would gladly Have filled his stomach With the pods That the swine ate And no one gave him anything But when he came to himself He said How many of my father's Hired servants Have bread enough And to spare And I perish with hunger I will arise And go to my father And will say to him Father I have sinned Against heaven And before you And I am no longer Worthy to be called your son Make me like one Of your hired servants And he arose And came to his father But when he was still A great way off His father saw him And had compassion And ran And fell on his neck And kissed him And the son said to him Father I have sinned Against heaven And in your sight And am no longer Worthy to be called Your son But the father Said to his servants Bring out the best robe And put it on him And put a ring on his hand And sandals on his feet And bring the fatted calf Here And kill it And let us eat And be merry For this my son Was dead And is alive again He was lost And is found And they began To be merry You may be seated In the presence Of the Lord Again I want to Give God glory And praise And honor For allowing us To have this day Of fellowship And family Here at Harvest Time Church I bless God I bless God For Those who Invited Family members And friends To come out And I thank y'all For being here today It's really cool To see some people That I haven't seen In a while And to hang out At church with them Some people We used to hang out Other places Amen Okay Where was I Let me come back I'm on the podium Right now Alright So So But I just want to I just want to thank God For For everyone That's in this room Because I believe God has a word For us today This is a very Familiar passage Of scripture We've all heard I'm sure Many sermons From this story Of concerning The prodigal son And It speaks to Many areas Of our life And of our walk Because If we are Really true To ourselves And true And tell the truth At some point Or time In our life We could identify With this prodigal person Because All of us Have not always Walked with the Lord The way that we are Supposed to walk With the Lord Amen And so There have been Seasons and times In all of our lives Where we Were out of Out of order Or out of line And so We can We can relate To this prodigal son But how many of you Know that That when When you come To yourself Something changes Inside of you You begin to realize That you are not Who you're acting like You know Sometimes we spend time In our life And we'll We'll be in What I call A fairy tale world We're living Like somebody else Even though That's really Not who we are And And And And it takes Something Every now and again To bring us To ourselves To where you Realize who you are And often times It takes you Having to get In Some filthy Conditions Before you realize That you were never Meant to be In the filth It's amazing What kind of Lessons you can Learn from a pig pen I want I want to Use this morning As a subject I know Who I am I know Who I am And I'm Going to use This like a little Sub subject Lessons from The pig pen Lessons from The pig pen You see That I use that Analogy Concerning this pig pen Because There's one thing About a pig No matter how much You clean it up No matter how much You polish it up He was designed To go right back To the mud And he likes And enjoys The pig pen Because he's Comfortable there He don't mind Being nasty Let me say it That way But see Some of us In our life We have just Spent moments In the pen And we We We Entertained The pen But it really Wasn't where We were created To exist And so Sometimes We have to Come to ourselves Before we realize That this place Is too filthy For me God did not Create me To be A pig pen Dweller And so We have Lessons That we have To learn And sometimes He don't Let you Learn those Lessons In clean Places Anybody In this room Ever had to Go through Some things That kind of Left a mark On you Left some residue Left some Left some dust Before you Learned The lesson That came With the experience And so It's all about How dirty You really Want to be There's Lessons That you Can learn Without Having to Get filthy But Unlike this Son He had to Go through Some things Anybody In this room Ever had to Go through Some things And the Things you Went through Were nobody Else's fault But your own Because you Moved too Soon You acted Too quickly You did it Your own way You didn't Follow instructions And it Cost you An experience And an encounter In a filthy Condition That happens And I Believe Jesus Wants to Give us Some Wisdom Here Using This man's Story And I Want to Share this Wisdom With you This morning So that You can Learn it From this Man's Story And you Don't Have to Learn it From your Story Amen Amen So if We look At this Passage Of Scripture Let's Go to Verse 11 Said There Was a Certain Man Had Two Sons Wasn't Nothing Special About this Man Nothing Special About the Sons Just a Man Which Leads me To the Fact that There ain't Nothing Really special About us That brings Us to the Places and The situations And the Circumstances That we Find ourselves In Is only That we Just happen To be Where we Happen to Be And but This man He's got These two Sons And the Younger Of the Two Sons Comes to The father And he Says to The father Father Give me The portion Of goods That falls To me In other Words Father Give me What belongs To me Now There's an Issue That this Son has And I Want to Talk about This This This Son Because This Son Has What I Call a Disconnect Issue He He He's Disconnected In many Ways From his Father Even though He is His Father's Son He's Still Disconnected From his Father And I'll Show it To you Because You got To look At the Attitude That the Son Takes When he Approaches The father He Comes to The father And he Says give Me Now Now I I Told Myself I Wasn't Gonna Be Messy Today But Since We We We All Family I Guess It Right Anybody In this Room Ever Go To The Lord And Before You Before You Sought His Face You Sought His Hand In Other Words What Am I Saying He He's Gotta Give Me Attitude Have You Ever Had A Period A Time In Your Life Where The Only Way You Approached God Was To Give Me Something God There Was No Relationship There Was No Connection To The Father's Heart It Was Only To The Father's Hand You See Sometimes We Have To Learn How To Change Our Approach To The Father Yeah You Gotta Learn That You Should Pursue His Heart Before You Reach For His Hand You See Because If You If You're Not You're Disconnected From The Part That Will Sustain You You See And Then He Comes To The Father He Asks The Father For A Portion He He Said Give Me The Portion That Belongs To Me See A Real Son Or A Real Person Who Is Connected To Your Heart Would Realize That The Whole Thing Belongs To Him Everything That The Father Has Belongs To The Son But The Son Can't See That Because He Wants What He Wants Anybody In This Room Went To God Wanting What You Want And Then Sometimes He'll Give It To You He'll Say Let Me Give You This Portion Because That's What You Think I Am You Think That's All I Got For You You See This This Son Had A Portion Mentality There's A Difference Between Someone Who Realizes That The Father Provides More Than A Portion There's A Difference Between Someone Who Realizes That What The Father Really Truly Has For You Is More Than Just A Portion But What He Actually Has For You Is An Inheritance A Portion Lasts You Only For A Moment An Inheritance Is Generational See An Inheritance Has The Power To Change Not Only Your Circumstances But Those Who Are Going To Come After You You See It's Not Just About What Belongs To Him And That's How We We Often Times Will Approach God In The Same Way Not Realizing That He Has Actually Greater For Us Than We Are That Than We Are Settling For You Know When We Learn That Our Father

The Place Is Broke Because It Says That The Land Now Has A Famine In It And He Finds Himself In Want But See When You Have A Portion Mentality When You Believe That You Can That That Your Portion Will Sustain You And Not Your Connection To The Source When You Have That Type Of Mentality Eventually It Will Always Lead To A Condition Of Want You Always Going To Find Yourself At Some Point In Time In A Place Where You Going To Be Need Notice How This Famine Came After He Had Spent Everything That He Had Because The Portion Cannot Sustain You Without The Father See When You Disconnected From The Father So Did Your Portion The Portion No Longer Was Connected To The Father You Get It All Right All Right So So So So Now It's Difficult For You To Survive And I'm Not Talking Just In The Physical But I'm Talking In The Spiritual I'm Talking In The Emotional Have You Ever Found Yourself Disconnected Emotionally From God From God Okay All Right So Now We Go Down To Verse Fifteen Verse Fifteen

To The Heart Of The Father It Will Bring You To A Place Where You Live In Survival Mode Your Whole Entire Life Begins To Become Nothing But Survive Have You Ever Been There When The Only Thing You Were Interested In Was Making It To The Next Day Survival Mode Is Not The Lifestyle Of A Kingdom Citizen Survival Mode Is Not The Lifestyle Of One Who Has Chosen Jesus Christ As Savior And Lord You If You Truly Are Serving The Lord You Ought Not Be Living In Survival Mode But You Should Be Living Abundantly Above Whatever The Situations Or The Circumstances Of Life Might Bring You See Because You Realize That Your Survival Is Not About What You But Your Survival Is About Who You Have Who Are You Connected To So My Lifestyle My Life Is Not Dependent Upon What Someone Else Or This World Can Provide To Me Because The World Is Not My Source I Used To Tell The People At My Job All Time This Is Not My Life This Is Just The The The The Way That God Has Released Provision Into My Household That's What This Job Is And I And I Said And When I Leave The Job Will Leave Because It Ain't Needed Anymore So So So So This Man Finds Himself Now In Survival Mode That Is Not A Kingdom Lifestyle See The First Thing That Everybody In Here Has To Realize Is That You If You Belong To Jesus You Are You Are You Are Really Not What We Like To Call A Christian You Are A Kingdom Citizen You Belong To The Kingdom Of God And You Are A Kingdom Citizen You Have To Begin To See Yourself As A Kingdom Citizen Because Citizens Have Rights Citizens Have Benefits Except In America Stop They Cutting Them Right Now Let Me Stop They Try They Try Citizens Have Benefits Amen Amen And You Have To Understand That Because You Belong To The Kingdom Of God There Are Some Things That God Will Not Withhold From You Because You Belong To Him That That That's Why I Say We Cannot Settle And When You Live That Way You Are Settling For Living In Survival Mode But We Cannot Do That As Kingdom Citizens So In Verse 16 It Says This He Says And He Would Gladly Have Filled His Stomach With The Pods That The Swine Ate And No One Gave Him Anything Look At That First Thing If I Go Back Just A Little Bit Into Verse 15 It Said That He Went And Joined Himself To A Citizen Of That Country When You Find Yourself In Survival Mode Thank You Holy Ghost You Will Connect Yourself To Anything You You You You Will Allow Yourself To Become Connected With Something That Does Not Truly Benefit You This Man Found Himself Connected To Someone From This This Country And The Person Who He Got Connected To Was Not Really There To Help Him He Just Put Him To Work Go Feed My Pigs And And Then It Says That No One Gave Him Anything That Includes The Person That He Was Connected To That's Why He Says He Would Gladly Have Eaten What The Swine Were Eating This Person That He Connected Himself To Really Brought No Value Or Benefit To His Life That's What Happens When We Disconnect Ourselves From The Source When We Disconnect Ourselves From The Father And Choose To Live According To Our Own Will And Our Own Eyesight We'll Find Ourselves Connected To Things That Will Not And Do Not Bless Us So He He Says He Would Eat What The Pigs Ate But Then In Verse 17 It Says But When He Came To Himself He Said How Many Of My Father's Hired Servants Have Bread Enough And To Spare And I Perish With Hunger Verse 17 God Will Allow You To Come To The End Of Everything That You Put Your Faith In To Show You That You Can't Make It Without Him God Will Allow You To Come To The End Of Everything That You Put Your Faith In Just To Prove To You That You Can't Make It Without Him God Will Bring You To The End Of Every Source That You Thought You Had Am I Talking To Anybody In Here Every Provision That You Used To Count On Every Ounce And Strength That You Used To Lean On Every Area Of Stability In Your Life He Will Allow You To Come To The End Of That Just To Show You And To Bring You To The Realization That Without Him You Still Don't Have Enough To Survive You See And That Even Goes To Our Our Our Lives Even In The House Household Of God Because Some Of Us Have Learned How To Rely On Things And Not Actually Rely On The Father Even When We Do What We Do For Him I'll Show You Because Some Of Us Trust More In Our Anointing Than The One Who Anointed You You Trust More In Your Anointing Than The One That Anointed You Some Trust Some Trust More In Your Gifts Than The One Who Gave You The Gift God Told Me To Tell You This Morning That Without Him Your Gift Won't Sustain You Without Him Your Anointing Can't Keep You And Eventually What Used To Verse 18 And 19 He Says I'll Rise And Go To My Father And I'll Say To Him Father I Have Sinned Against Heaven And Before You And I'm No Longer Worthy To Be Called Your Son Make Me Like One Of Your Hired Servants When You When We Come To Ourselves What Happens Is We Find Ourselves In A Place Of Conviction See When You Come To The End Of You You You Begin To See Yourself For Who You Really Are And You Begin To See That Without God You Can't Make It On Your Own Conviction Will Bring You To A Place Where You Will Reflect And You Desire To Be Restored Back To The Place Where You Used To Be But Don't Don't Allow Condemnation To Enter In Where Conviction Is Functioning Because Condemnation Will Bring You To A Place Where You Feel To Desire And So He Comes To Himself And He Says I'm Gonna Go Home And I'm Gonna Reconnect Myself To My Father And So In Verse 20 He Says And he arose and he came to his father. Now, the expectation for most of us, because most of us look at ourselves and say, okay, God, we're unworthy. We're not worthy. But the truth of the matter is that God saw you worthy. He sees you worthy of the sacrifice that he made for you. And so when we come back to him or when we find ourselves coming back to him, we need to change our perspective on what we expect him or how we expect him to react and respond to us. I'm going to ask it like this. How many times have you come back to the Lord expecting a beating and God hugged your neck? Expecting God to whip you and God loved on you. You see, God is not in the business of being mad at you. And he that's not that's not his heart. That's not his desire. What he desires is for us to realize that we need him. We turn from our ways and we repent, repent, which is what this son does. And then when he when we repent, he restores. That's how it works. You see, the expectation that you have should not be the same expectation that you have from the world. The world's expectation is that if I come and I mess up, there's a penalty. And that penalty is going to hurt. And God says, come back to me, repent and turn and let me restore you. Right. Let me reconnect you back to my heart. That's his desire. That's his desire. And so in verse 21, well, verse 20 says, but when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion. There's some people in this room this morning. You've made a choice. You've made a decision. To come back to the Lord. And bring and turn and repent and return to him. But you still feel a far ways off. Just like this son. You can't you can't sense his presence yet because you're still a far ways off. But look what the father does. In the scripture. It says, and when he was still a great way off, his father saw him. And had compassion. That's your father. Ran and fell on his neck. And kissed him. And the son said to him, father, I've sinned against heaven and in your sight. And I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. So many times that's that's our testimony. Because we know. The pen that we've been kicking it in. Come on, man. We know the pen where we've been hanging out. We know what we've blown. We know what we've wasted. We know our circumstance. And we feel just like this son. And we want to tell the Lord. Lord, just let me come and be a servant. In your house. But see, the thing about it is you weren't a servant when you left. You were a son. And God's plan has always been to restore you. Back to sonship. And to who you were really created to be. You see. Portion mentality. Will cause you to settle for being a servant. When God has called you a son. But when he restores. He restores completely. Verse 22. He says, but the father said to his servants. Bring out the best robe. God has the best in store for you. And put it on him. Put it on him. See, the robe identified who he was. The robe was. The servants didn't have the robe. It was only the sons. So he says, go and get what identifies him as my son. And put a ring on his hand. And sandals on his feet. And then. He said, now. Now. That you've been restored. Let's party. I know. I knew I was in the right house. All the party people up in here. Where y'all's fans at? I know. All right. And bring the fatted calf. And kill it and let us eat. Why? Because my son was dead. And is now alive again. He was lost. And now he's found. There's a lot of lessons. That you can learn. When you spend a little time in a pig pen. And it shows you. But the primary lesson that it shows you. Is that that was never where you were created to be. God has greatness for you. He called you sons and daughters. Not servants. And today is a. Would be a great day. If you don't feel restored. To get restored. Go ahead. Give us a second. Today would be a great day. Let's give God praise today for the work. You see at the end of that story. That son realized who he was. He realized his true identity. I pray today that God has spoken to someone's heart. To show you and to let you know. Really truly who you are. And if you spent some time. In a place. Or in a season in your life. That truly. Really is beneath you. Come to yourself. And realize. That your father. Has an inheritance for you. And not just a portion. It's amazing when I think about that. Most of the time. We can't wait on an inheritance. Because what the inheritance will bring you. You can't see it all. And most people have a problem. With what they can't see. But believing that it's still yours. That's called faith. Faith. That's all that word is. Faith. You have to have faith. To receive. What you haven't seen yet. God. Has it though. In store for you. If you will allow him. To give you more than just a portion. But to give you. Everything. Everything. That truly. That truly. Belongs to you. Health. Belongs to you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Healing. Belongs to you. Truly. Truly belongs to you. This. Truly belongs to you. make a choice. You have to make a decision. Today, I believe there's some people in this room today that need to make a decision. Am I going to continue to settle for a portion or am I going to stay connected to the Father's heart and receive my inheritance? That's the choice. That's the choice. Father God, right now in the name of Jesus, Lord, I just pray right now. God, and I thank you for your word. I thank you for what you shared with us today. And Lord, I just ask right now that it lands and it falls on good ground. Lord, each person, Lord, I pray that they receive their portion today. And God, I just thank you today for showing us the difference between having a portion mentality and knowing and understanding that we truly have an inheritance. God, we bless you today for what you have done in our presence and our midst. And God, we thank you and give you glory for the fruit that will come from it. And Lord, we just say thank you. We love you and we bless you in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Let's give God praise once again. Before we leave this place, we always make sure that we extend the invitation to kingdom discipleship. And we want to make sure that we never miss a moment or miss an opportunity. If there may be someone here who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior, then you would like to give your heart and your life to the Lord. Today will be a really good day to do it. And so if there's anyone in this room today who feels led to give your life to the Lord today, if that's you today, will you come? Amen. Well, there may be someone here this morning that you have a relationship or you've had a relationship, but for whatever reason, your relationship has not been, you've kind of fallen away from that relationship and you want to restore that relationship and come back and renew your relationship with the Lord. If that's you today, would you come? And the last thing that I always like to do is just make sure that if there's someone here today who needs prayer and you would like for us to pray with you today, if that's you, you can come as well. And I want to, I want to welcome Linda. She came this morning for rededication to the Lord. So let's give God praise today for Linda. Let's thank her this morning for rededication. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Let's pray. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. So we have a relationship with the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. And you want to rededicate your life to him. And you want to come back and become a part or act a part of his body. Amen. Amen. Amen. Well, all we can do is accept your answers, and we welcome you back into the body of Christ, and we thank you for coming, and thank you for rededicating yourself to the Lord. Amen. Father God, right now, in the name of Jesus, Lord, we just pray for Linda. Lord, we ask right now, God, that you continue to touch her heart, Lord, continue to speak to her. Speak to her. God, continue to show her that you love her. Lord, I want to thank you today for speaking to her heart, Lord, and letting her know that you are still with her, God. And, Lord, I want to thank you, and I want to thank you, God, for putting it in her heart to come back and be restored to your body. God, we bless her today, God, and we thank you right now that you are going to do great things in the days to come for Linda. And, Lord, we thank you that you are doing miracles, signs, and wonders, God, right now, even in her life. And, God, we bless her right now in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. That's really, truly something to celebrate when someone comes back and rededicates their life and gives their life back to the Lord. And so we give God praise and honor for that today. Amen.
