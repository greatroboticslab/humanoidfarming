 Music My name is Garth George. I'm from Marwain, Alberta. Company name is Aviator Farms. We have a mixed grain operation with cattle and grain. And we do about 6,000 acres of grain farming. Music We came across the Vale at a trade show. It's been something I've been looking for. I use it because I don't have enough grain bins on property, so I move a lot of grain off combine. With the situation there, I had to use a lot of custom trucks. So my custom bill was getting quite substantial. When I saw this, it eliminated probably about six to seven extra trucks, down to my own two personal trucks. And when you load it in eight minutes, it beats the 45 minutes that a semi was sitting here, not being used with a driver, not doing anything. So it definitely upped the production. Music The surprise for me was the reduction in manpower. So what I found out accidentally is at night time, we just send them home after supper for a good night's rest. Us younger guys that were halt driving trucks, etc. during the day, jump on the combines and we fill our two semis, which allows us to have about 10,500 bushel of storage. Music The agility of moving this cart is very efficient as well. We farm a lot of quarters, so we're constantly moving from field to field. We can give it a quick lift. You're gone and you're down the road safely. Set it down in the field And then usually by the time you get there, the combines are happy to see it. Another great option with it is that I found is that for the grain cart operator, it's way less stress on them. Trying to load a semi off the cart, you got to move back and forth. They're worried about overloading it. They're worried about spilling. Whereas the grain cart operator can pull up right beside this, just do a constant dump and drive away and not have to worry about nothing. The semi drivers love it better because it's more controlled. It's like loading at an elevator. They control their weights. They got it down to timing, when to shut off, when to move ahead. It's way seamless and more user friendly than just dumping out of a grain cart. It's all about efficiency, this thing. Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music Music
