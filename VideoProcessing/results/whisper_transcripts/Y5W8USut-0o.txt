 Imagine owning your own home with no down payment. It sounds too good to be true, right? With USDA loans, it's a reality. But this loan program is not perfect. Let's break down the pros and cons of USDA loans to see if it's a good fit for you. Let's talk about the pros first. USDA loans does not require a down payment. That makes it more accessible for home buyers with limited savings. But you can put a down payment if you wanted to. This is a single loan program. Unlike down payment assistant programs that involve multiple loans, USDA offers a single loan covering all costs. And it really simplifies the process. I think down payment assistant programs are great, but I have had issues in the past with clients that they didn't find out until later on in the loan process that they didn't qualify for the down payment assistance program because sometimes there's terms that change. There's all kinds of things that happen. It can be pretty nuanced to get these down payment assistance. So this could leave you scrambling to find down payment or closing costs at the very end of the home buying process, which is super stressful. So the fact that this is a single loan program, it does make it a little bit easier in my opinion than down payment assistant programs. This program is open to all buyers. So both first time and repeat home buyers are eligible for USDA loans. This is more flexible than FHA loans. With an FHA loan, you can't be a homeowner for three years. There are some exceptions to the rule, but that's the general guideline. So you could be a current homeowner and still get a USDA loan. There are some stipulations there like you can't already have a USDA loan and things like that, but it is a little bit more flexible than some other loan programs like the FHA. If you're a W-2 employee or if you're self-employed, you can both get USDA loans. You just have to provide two years of W-2 or business tax returns, and you have to have two years of employment and college can also count toward those two years of employment. There's no mortgage insurance with the USDA loan. FHA and conventional loans that have a down payment less than 20% will most likely have mortgage insurance. Mortgage insurance is an insurance policy that protects a mortgage lender or title holder if the borrower defaults on payments. Now with the USDA loan, there is still a fee that we'll talk about later in the video, in the con section. The USDA loan can have competitive interest rates. It's currently at 4.125%. Now this is for the direct USDA loan, not for the guaranteed USDA loan. For the guaranteed USDA loan, the interest rates are usually closer to the market rate for interest rates. In one of my other USDA loan videos, I break down what the exact difference is between the direct USDA loan and the guaranteed USDA loan. The USDA loan provides various ways to cover closing costs. So closing costs can be rolled into the loan if the property over appraises. So that means that the home appraises for more than what you're planning on purchasing the home for. So if you're planning on purchasing the home for $300,000, it appraises for $315,000. Then you have $15,000 where you can use that for closing costs and some other things like some repairs, things like that. Another closing cost option is sellers can cover up to 6% of closing costs. In my experience, closing costs are usually anywhere from 3% to 6% of the purchase price. So usually the 6% should cover most, if not all, of the closing costs. Gift funds can also be used to cover closing costs, and there's no cap on that. Another cool thing is you can combine all these methods for closing costs. So if closing costs are 6% and the home appraised over purchase price, let's say 4% of the loan amount, and then you could also get 1% closing costs from the seller and a 1% gift or, you know, any other percentage, whatever it ends up being. But it is really cool, I think, that you can combine these methods. You don't have to just use one. Those are the pros of USDA loans. I think it's a really great program, but it can be a bit confusing. Having a real estate agent that is familiar with the USDA loan process can make things go smoother. So if you need help finding an agent, I can help you with that. The link is in the description. And also in the description is a link to my free homebuyer course, and I basically break down everything you need to know about buying a home. Now let's talk about the cons of getting a USDA loan. It's limited to specific areas. Properties must be located in USDA approved areas. Sometimes it might be only like 30 minutes away from a bigger city. Sometimes it can be a lot further than that. So some areas might be too rural for some people. There's also income restrictions. Income limits apply for both the direct and guaranteed routes. Everyone who lives in the home's income is taken into account. So even if your mom is going to live with you and she has social security, for instance, that's going to count as income. Child support, things like that, all that's going to count for income. So because of these income limits, this program isn't going to work for everybody. There's also property standards. So the home must meet specific health and safety standards, adding to potential limitations and requirements. So this can sometimes complicate the appraisal process. Some of the guidelines are a little picky in my opinion, like not having chip paint, things like that. These are the kinds of things that give USDA loans and similar loan programs a bad reputation because they are particular about some things that conventional loans are not picky about. Because of that, it can make it more difficult to get under contract with a USDA loan than a conventional loan, for instance. There's a longer loan process. The USDA direct route may have a longer loan closure time compared to traditional loans. It's usually about 45 to 60 days. In most markets I'm familiar with, 30 days to close is kind of the standard. USDA guaranteed loans take about 30 days to close, but it may just be a little bit longer than that, maybe about five days longer, since USDA loans have to go through a two-tier approval process. There's limited property types. So only single family dwellings, condos, modular, and manufacturer homes are eligible, excluding other property types like duplexes, multiplexes, things like that. Now with an FHA loan, you can get a duplex or multiplex up to four units, but not with the USDA loan. Now let's get into what I think is one of the major cons of the USDA loan, which is there is a fee to get a USDA loan and a yearly fee. So this is in place of the mortgage insurance. Now this only applies with the USDA guarantee loan, not the direct. The initial fee is 1% of the purchase price, and the annual fee, which is paid monthly, is currently 0.35% of the loan. The silver lining here is this is typically less than what you'll pay in mortgage insurance for an FHA loan. But unlike PMI, this fee does not go away. It remains there for the life of the loan. The home has to be your primary residence. So USDA loans are exclusively for primary residence. It's not available for investment properties or commercial properties. Also, anyone on the mortgage must live there. So you can't have someone co-sign for the property. If you want to learn about FHA loans, check out this video or this playlist about affordability.
