Howto & Style
 G'day, I'm Mark from Self-Sufficient Me, and in this video, I'm gonna show you what I've been growing and sowing in the veggie garden. Let's get into it. We're in our last month of winter here, and for a subtropical climate, it's been surprisingly cold. Even though I'm still here in my T-shirt, some plants have suffered, and others have done really well. Typically the colder climate crops. So I think what we'll do is we'll start from the front, because that seems like obvious, and we'll work our way back, all those rows of raised beds, right back to the banana trees. There's a lot to do, so let's just, like I already said, get into it. Crikey, I'm glad you're tall, because it's hard enough to see the garden bed for the veggies as it is. They're so crammed in there. We've been eating a lot of these dwarf peas here. See this mini trellis? For weeks now. They just multiply and multiply. You can't keep up. We've been gorging ourselves on them, and they're beautiful. Back a bit here. We've got broccoli. Finally, they are starting to grow heads. But just look at how healthy they are. And you know me, I don't use any pesticides. I don't even use organic pesticides. And when I do, it's very rare. But this last whole season so far, I haven't squirted these plants with anything at all. And when I do come across a pest, like a little grub here, I just take them off and dispose of them. Nature does the job for me. This here is our main onion bed for this season. And I've experimented with just filling it full of all these different kinds. It's probably about eight or so different kinds of onion in here, including garlic. Some of the spare garlic I had left over. So I thought, you know what? Instead of just leaving them die a slow death, let's just cram them in. And so far, so good. In this lush bed here, I've got cauliflower. Now, do you know where the name cauliflower came from? It's actually Latin. Collis, meaning cabbage. And we've got cabbage growing in here as well. This cone-shaped variety called Sugarloaf. It's one of my favorite varieties to grow. And it's a heritage variety as well. And the last part of the name of cauliflower is floss. I think that's how they say it, like floss your teeth. Anyway, it's Collis Floss Cauliflower. That's how the name came about. The rest of this bed, I've planted some more garlic, squeezed that in, and it's doing very well as well. And also, I filled some extra gaps with some baby cabbages. They only grow about that big. And they grow actually quite fast. So when these cauliflowers are finished, these little cabbages will be coming through, and they'll get more sun. And then we'll be able to have a succession crop just before summer. And the last bit at the front here, it's like a stage set up, isn't it? You've got the smalls at the front, and then the big talls at the back. It looks absolutely beautiful. But I've done that for a reason. The sun, low in winter, and it's coming over this way. Sets over there. That way, the small crops get more of the sunlight. This kale, we've been chewing through it faster than a rabbit, in a box full of carrots. And here, look at these massive, they look like cauliflower broccoli. Well, they are from the same family, of course, but these are Romanescos. Romanesco, something like that. I've never grown these before, but I love the look of them. They've already started to form heads, but I can't wait till they're ready because I'm so keen to chow down on them and see what they taste like. In this second row, we've got three long beds. Remember that Floridian weave? The Florida weave that I showed you in a video, holding up these Roma tomatoes? Well, it's doing a pretty good job. The tomatoes themselves, look, to be honest, they could be growing a little bit better. They're taking a while to fruit and they've got a little bit of disease on them. But through this type of winter, I'm not surprised. Tomatoes, they don't like the cold very much. And unfortunately, this is still the best time of year for us to grow them. So they're just gonna have to suffer, and I'm sure they'll pick up soon. Underneath, I've sowed some spinach just to have an undercover crop. Why not fill in as much gaps and space as possible and make use of the growing season? And here, I'm running an experiment of growing Aztec corn. This is the purple stuff through winter. And if anything, it's grown okay, a bit stunted, but the bees, at a time of year when there's not many flowers, these bees, including the native bees, are absolutely loving these cornflowers. And speaking of pollinators, that's precisely what I had in mind for this bed here. I'm turning this into a pollinator grabber, but also a multi-herb raised garden bed. Kind of centralized to bring in the pollinators. In here, we've got marigolds, lemongrass, bush basil, parsley, tarragon, sage, thyme. I don't need oregano, because I've got a whole bunch of it over there. I've sowed seed for dill in the middle and coriander on the sides. So it's gonna be a mixture of perennials and annuals. Let's get this bed pumping so that it can help the garden out, but also be a one-stop shop for grabbing a handful of herbs for the dinner table. And the last bed in this row, a few bits and pieces. This old tomato bush, just about the end of its time. It's fetus all the way through winter, beautiful cherry tomato, but it's nearly gone. And of course this habanero chili here, we made a great chili sauce, as you know, out of it. And although it looks like it's suffering now, in about a month or so, I'll give it a bit of a trim and it'll just shoot back better than ever. And right next to it are these skinny beds here. I just love these skinny beds. They fitted really well in this gap. I'm growing some artichokes. Speaking about chokes, I'm sure some of you, especially those meticulous gardeners, would love to choke me because I haven't done the whippersnipping around these garden beds. A little bit untidy, I know, I'll get to it, all right? But if it's ornamental you like and meticulous, I think this is one of the best veggies to grow. And I'm gonna do another video about ornamental vegetables to grow in the garden. But for me, it's hard to go past the beauty of the globe artichoke. On these other two skinny raised beds, besides a few marigolds in the corners to attract pollinators and make it look good, I haven't decided yet what I'm gonna plant in here. I'm thinking maybe some beets, a few different types, should balance out the artichokes nicely. What do you reckon? On this side here, I've got a few old beds that need refurbishing from last season and collecting some of the seeds, Egyptian spinach and such. I've got some mint that's growing really well there. And there's a tomato that I'm salvaging, decided to leave it in there and see how it went. It's doing all right. I've got strawberries in barrels. They're doing okay. They're suffering a little bit. I'm working on them. And I've got garlic as well with some tomatoes too that came up in the compost that I used to put this garlic in. I've overwintered some sweet potato here in this plastic pot. I'll empty that out soon and I'll see what we've got. And then I'll also start replanting it for spring in some more of the other beds that I've prepared. And as usual, this magnificent Thai basil, no matter how many times I cut it back, it is still flowering profusely and growing back fast and actually helping to keep the bee populations through winter time. These two round beds had Jerusalem artichoke in them. I'm still yet to harvest and refurbish those beds. You might remember I did a video on this one here, creating this trellis and planting some beans. Well, the beans didn't go too well. Only two of them came up because the rest got dug up by mice. So I've given up and I've planted cucumber seeds in here instead. So hopefully they will then climb up here and populate and maybe not get as quickly eaten by those little rodents. In this new row of birdies raised garden beds, I'm doing a potato experiment, three different ways. There'll be more about that when I bring the video out, but just to give you a bit of an insight, this one here are planted with the wrist method. And this one here, the same types of potatoes, but done in a drill to backfill slowly. We'll see which one turns out better, all the same. And this last one has store-bought potatoes that had gone green. And they've been planted with the wrist method as well, just pushed down underground and then mulched on top. And we'll see how they go compared to the seed potatoes that I got from the nursery. This last bed here with all the pumpkins on it, because quite frankly, we've got so many pumpkins, we don't know what to do. I'm gonna be planting turmeric in it. When I refurbished this whole row and got rid of our old raised garden bed, I dug up a whole heap of this turmeric. Check it out. It's a ton of it here. And I'm going to, of course, dry some of this and use it in different ways, use it in cooking, make some pickles out of it. But what's left over, I'm going to plant back into that last bed and it will turn into our turmeric bed. Just probably, again, maybe a wrist down. I'll have a whole bed dedicated to turmeric. Moving down to the tunnel trellis here. I've got to give it a bit of a water while I'm talking to you, because I've just sowed some seeds. And on this right-hand side here, I've sowed a whole bunch of different types of cucumbers, closest to the trellis here. And the aim is they're going to climb up and hopefully going to get them to about here. They're going to have cucumbers hanging down. That's the vision anyway. Back from the cucumbers, I've sowed some Utah celery and also some dill just in a few pockets all the way along. On the other side here, I've sowed primarily beans and about four or five different types of beans here as well. Unfortunately, I've had to sow a whole lot of them to hopefully outdo the field mice here. My theory is if I sowed more than I really needed, I could always thin them out. Hopefully the mice will miss some and I'll still have a good crop germinating. Well, that's the theory anyway. And on the inside, I've sowed some multicolored radishes. They should come up rather quickly, as long as I keep the water up to them. Look at this pumpkin here. Got to find a way to get that out. Maybe a chainsaw. So I'm going to have a, hopefully, a meeting of beans and cucumbers in the middle here. Wouldn't that be spectacular? Fingers crossed it works out. And down the back here, I've got our largest and oldest birdies raised garden beds. These Aluzinc steel ones, they've been here since 2008. Looking a bit beshoveled, aren't they? Well, that's because I have this big pumpkin vine coming through here and I didn't want to disturb it. But now we're over pumpkins. I'll see if I can find one here as I go along. I see a few actual rotten ones. Here's one. But we've got half a dozen or more over there. Maybe, maybe there's a dozen over there and there's more scattered all around. Look, they're beautiful. They're a lovely pumpkin, but there's only so many pumpkins you can eat and give away. People are getting sick of us giving them to them. Anyway, here, you don't know it because you can't see it, but this is our asparagus bed. I used to grow ginger here. Remember that? How to grow a ton of ginger, where I look like a hobo in the thumbnail? Well, that is going to change. I'm going to convert this whole bed into an asparagus bed. I'm going to plant more asparagus in here and fill this whole bed up. And those two there will probably turn into, one will be sweet potato, and the other one, maybe peppers or hot chilies or capsicum sweet peppers. Not sure yet, but that's the idea. And finally, down the back of the patch here are the bananas. There's some new bananas that I've planted. I've replaced these old pawpaws. This one can go too. Ooh! You're out of there. It's not producing much anymore. And that's that. No use keeping space for something that's not producing. These here are blue javas. They're not a blue inside the banana, but they are blue skinned. And then you've got a red Ducati. All of these are dwarfs. I'm sick and fed up of trying to bag these bananas up here. Although they've been growing fantastic, these big tall ones, I'm just getting a little bit too old to climb ladders that high on a flimsy banana tree and try to bag that fruit so that we get some before the fruit bats get them. Some people say, slowly but surely, Mark, you're growing bananas. And I say, that's very true. Well, I hope you enjoyed this video. If you did, make sure you grow that thumb right up and give this video a big growing and sowing thumbs up. Also share the video around because that helps my channel out heaps and subscribe if you haven't already. Thanks a lot for watching. Bye for now. 10 minutes. …
