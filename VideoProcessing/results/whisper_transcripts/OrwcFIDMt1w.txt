 Hi everybody, welcome back to AgriTech channel. Today we will take everyone to visit a large apple farm in the United States, with more than 900 apple juice factories concentrated mainly in New York and California. Tons of harvested apples are transported here for processing every day. Watch until the end of the video to see how they grow, harvest, and process these apples. Apple planting begins in mid-February. The John Deere 230 tractor will dig up the soil, and workers will place the apple tree stump down. Then two rollers will press the soil around the base of the tree. Plants that are not watered after planting will die very quickly. Therefore, farmers will install a drip irrigation system to provide moisture to the soil to help plants grow quickly. When the trees are two months old, they will fertilize the entire apple field. In winter, workers will remove dry apple branches. To prepare for sprouting when spring comes. Sometimes machines also help work become faster. Spring is the time when the apple orchard blooms. Apple blossoms bloom whitely, covering the vast field. Apple blossoms bloom whitely, covering the vast field. Apple blossoms bloom whitely, covering the vast field.

Upon meeting where bees come to adults like almost every bird. This variety of cities muito Bird's drin-Week-een scorer fallumble pathel. The bees are diligently doing their work. The time of pollination lasts about three months. Depending on the apple variety, yields will vary. When the apples are still young, spray them to increase the percentage of apples and reduce the risk of premature fall. In large apple orchards, using machinery is always the most effective option. Spraying helps regulate harvest time to ensure optimal quality fruit. Spraying helps regulate harvest time to ensure optimal quality fruit. The sprayer with two centimeters accuracy is manually operated. After many years of care, the sprayer is used to be used to be used to be used to be used to use the sprayer. The sprayer with two centimeters accuracy is manually operated. After many years of care, the apple orchard has ripened red. The apples are ready to be harvested. For apple orchards for export, apple picking also requires meticulousness and care. As for apple orchards to process, modern, optimized machinery is used. This machine uses a controlled shaker arm to accurately locate the position of the trees. Then, a strong vibration wave is created and transmitted to the tree. The apple will fall to the ground. Falling or bruised apples will not affect future production.chénovasắt Mm-hmm . Apples lying on the ground are thoroughly collected by the machine as it passes by. The machine's harvesting speed ranges from 1 to 5 tons per hour. For this AP100 harvester, the fruit is collected and put on the conveyor belt. Designed to remove leaves, rocks, and dry twigs. Most harvested fruits are transported to factories without the need for cleaning. Most harvested fruits are transported to factories without the need for cleaning. The cleaned apples will be transferred to containers. Tons of apples after being harvested will be transported to the factory to process and produce apple juice or apple cider vinegar. After being transported to the factory, apples will be transported through the washing area. Remove all outside dirt. Wash until the apple is shiny before pressing the juice. Workers check and remove damaged fruit. After that, these apples will be transferred to the crusher for grinding. Next, squeeze all the juice with rotating rollers. The pulp and juice are completely separated. With modern technology and strict hygiene and safety controls to produce the best products to consumers. Water is poured into bottles with a fully automatic line. After closing the lid, it will be sterile. Going through many different lines, thousands of bottles of apple juice will be packed into boxes. All stages use modern, automated machinery without the need for humans. Interestingly, right? At the end of the video, we will take you to Washington to see how farmers here pick apples. The picked big apples will be gently dropped onto the conveyor belt. Designed with protective cushions to prevent apples from being damaged before being dropped into the container. Do you want to personally pick these delicious apples? Let us know in the comments section below. Thank you for watching the entire video. Goodbye, and see you again in the next video.
