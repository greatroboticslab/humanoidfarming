Howto & Style
 Grass grows in a sigmoid curve, an S curve. It starts slow, grows real fast, and then goes into senescence. So the reason for the herbivore is to come in and prune that off to restart this fast juvenile blaze of growth period. In nature, this is done with three M's. Moving, mobbing, and mowing. That's the way nature does it. Moving, mobbing, mowing. And so we duplicate that with the daily management of moving them on to a small area, giving them that for a day, and then moving them on to the next area. That stimulates the production so much that in Augusta County, where we live in Virginia, the average farm in the county requires four acres to feed one cow per season. Here, we take less than an acre.
