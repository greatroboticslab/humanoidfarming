Science & Technology
 The agriculture industry in Australia uses 5.3 million tonnes of fertiliser each year to both maintain and increase plant growth. Not only does this create a financial burden to farmers, it also results in serious environmental impacts. Legume roots produce a major fertiliser nutrient naturally. Nitrogen is produced in nodules that form on the roots of legumes by the rhizobium bacteria contained inside. The bacteria take nitrogen from the air and convert it into ammonia, which is a fertiliser for the plant. The key in having the correct bacteria in these root nodules defines what yield and what amount of nitrogen that can be fixed. So it's really crucial for the farmer to know whether they have the correct rhizobia, the current rhizobia, and whether it's working as it should be working. Bacterial diagnostics currently consist of growing the bacteria, which is time poor and labour intensive. The other alternative is next generation sequencing, which is expensive for farmers. MELDI-ID combined both of these diagnostics. Their novel method uses a mass spectrometer machine and genetic sequencing of protein markers to detect and identify the different strains and their unique fingerprints. This method is quick, accurate and affordable. What we actually do is we generate a fingerprint of that root nodule and then we compare that fingerprint with a database that we have, which has all the current rhizobia inoculants in it. It means that they will need less fertiliser to apply because all that nitrogen of the legume is put into the ground and it's available for the wheat or barley crop after the legume component. So they're saving time, they're saving money and they're actually doing something good for the environment as well. Mitra Meditation Booth Colossana Kotir Do Do Do Do L Do Do Do
