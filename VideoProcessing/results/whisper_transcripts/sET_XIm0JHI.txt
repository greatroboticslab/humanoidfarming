 Today we're planting thyme here in our culinary garden. Thyme is a wonderful perennial plant that doesn't need much tending or care. Its root system is very shallow, so it makes it great and easy to transplant like we did here. We certainly love thyme in this household, and we often add it to many dishes, like our homemade chicken soup and beef stew.
