 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 2025. First of all, there is no planned fire alarm today. In the event of an emergency, the fire exit is located through the door you came in through. If you would like to tweet or post about this event or exhibition, please use the hashtag Summer Science and we are at Royal Society. I would also like to remind you that this event has been live streamed and recorded on our YouTube channel, so there's no need to record this talk and please also make sure that your phone is on silent. This talk will be followed by a Q&A, so get ready to ask questions and after the Q&A, we'd ask you to please make your way out of this room so that we can get ready for the next talk. I am delighted to introduce Dr. Jim Foraker, Royal Society Research Fellow and Principal Investigator at the University of Bristol. He joins us today to talk about what makes plant biology so unique and how to delve into his research on a key question in plant development. How do plants know when to move on from one life stage to the next? Please give Dr. Foraker a round of applause. Thank you. Thank you. Brilliant, thank you. It's a lovely picture of moss, so we can stare at that all day if we're not. There we go. An even lovelier picture of a house plant I've got at home. So I mean, it's very interesting talks on big topics today. AI, neuroscience, black holes. Well, I'm going to tell you how Swiss cheese plants get cheesy. You know, this is a big issue, guys. As you can see in my slightly moth-eaten living room. And I hope to convince you by the end that this is important to understand how plant development changes through their life cycle. I do see my mum in the audience. I'd just like to say thank you very much for coming over recently and not pointing out the state of my rug. It's appreciated. So yeah, thanks for the introduction. I'm Jim. I'm a plant developmental biologist at the University of Bristol. It's a slightly vague title, but when I'm talking about when plants grow up, what I'm really talking about is maturation, is plant ageing. It's not so much getting higher vertically. So if you're here for a talk on stem elongation, you're going to be disappointed. But, you know, there is a lot of overlap between them. And so it's a bit of an overview of what I'd like to talk about. Firstly, a bit of a pitch for developmental biology, why I find it so interesting. Then, really, a bigger pitch for plants and why plants are perfect for understanding development. Then, a kind of quick intro into how plants do transition through different life cycle stages. And then, I kind of whiz through what's going on in my lab at a moment to understand this concept. So, you know, when I talk about developmental biology, what I'm really talking about here, and what developmental biology really describes is the transition of a process from a single cell embryo, okay, just one cell that undergoes a series of repeated rounds of cell division and specialisation to give rise to the fully formed exquisite baboon that you see before you today. And for me, this is really the most interesting question in biology. You know, forget your bird song, your spider wedge, your fig wasp fratricide. It's how do you get from a single cell to this differentiated body with myriad different cell types and tissues, but have all got the same number, same copies of a genome. There's no genetic differences between any of these cells. They look completely different. And I think this is fundamental. It's so interesting. It's how, it's really the basis for multicellular life. And it's so important that we understand it. And so, when it comes to studies of developmental biology, people use all sorts of different fun systems. A very popular one is the nematode worm here, C. cenobditis elegans. And this is a great system for understanding biology, developmental biology, because it's a rare example where we can predict every single cell division that gives rise to this fully differentiated worm. Through from the first cell, that first division, generating two cells and four cells, we know exactly what's going to happen. Okay? To give rise to, I think, 959 cells in hermaphrodites elegans and 1,033 cells in the male. So, a wonderful little wriggly system here. It's not always so predictable. In mice, for example, another fantastic system for understanding developmental biology. We can't predict things so well, partly because cells move about and actually migrate during mammalian development. But we do have increasingly high-definition knowledge of the actual processes that are underlying development. So, in the study that this image is taken from, this research group has carried out sequencing of all the gene expression in every cell, lots of cells throughout the three-week gestation period of a house mouse at intervals of about six weeks to give this really high-definition gene atlas of how development changes during, how gene expression changes during development. And, you know, it's fascinating to understand this, but of course, this has huge implications for medicine and for human benefits. So, it's advances in treatments for cancer, for generative diseases, congenital defects, solutions for fertility issues, how we can grow organs to provide new research cures and for transplants are all predicated on advances in developmental biology. You know, moving from medicine for a moment, if we understand plants and plant development, you know, we can generate crops that are higher yielding, more nutritious and more robust in changing environmental conditions. So, understanding development is really key. So, what's going on in developmental biology? How are these processes regulated? How do we get from a single cell through to that baboon? Well, there are really three major pathways that regulate development and the most critical in my mind is genetics. So, all these cells that I've talked about have exactly the same genetic code, the same chromosomes made of the same DNA strings. But what differentiates an eye cell from a kidney cell from a epithelial cell is when and where genes are being expressed. So, when I'm talking about gene expression, I'm talking about genes being turned on. They then make RNA, which is GCSE biology, I hope you can remember, to strings amino acids and ultimately finally into a protein. So, it's not so much changes in the DNA that differ between cells, it's really when and where these genes are being turned off that give rise to all the different cell types. And despite this being kind of slight, you know, very intuitive to us today, it was really quite a long time before we realised there was such a link between genetics and development. And it was kind of really pioneering experiments on fruit flies in the 70s on these hopeful monsters, mutants, that gave a lot of insight into this. So, these poor flies, they noticed that mutations, for example, that would give rise to a leg on the head. And in the case here of this bi-forax mutant, normally flies only make one pair of wings on their thorax. But if you have a mutant here where you express a thorax D on the abdomen, you actually get two pairs of wings. So, it was these hopeful monsters in the 70s that really gave a lot of insight into the genetic basis for development. And genetics really kind of then provides instruction manual for how development works. And often it's hard and fast and we read this manual and we know exactly what the process is going to be. But all the time, there's also environmental inputs that really determine how this instruction manual is read. Okay, so environment, it's, you know, this kind of cliche nature versus nature. But in terms of development, the environment has a big impact on development as well. So, in the case here, sorry, if this graph is a bit small, you can see that in the last hundred years, height in both men and women across the world has risen by about 10 centimetres. And that's not because genetics have changed. Now, we still have the same genetic variants as we had in 1896. It's really because health has changed and because nutrition has changed, that's actually led to the altered human development. Plants are, you know, really, really dependent on environmental signals because they can't move and as we'll get to. So, a bit of a plug for people at Bristol here. There's some really wonderful research going on at Bristol, working at how wind affects tree growth. And they're going around measuring how wind bends trees in the forest. Yeah, sounds like quite a nice life really. I get stuck in the lab. So, yeah, really, really big inputs for environment and development as well. And finally, the third pathway, slightly more minor, is hormones. Kind of, perhaps most famously in the case of social insects, such as honeybees. So, these honeybees are genetically identical, absolute clones. But this one on the left was fed a particular diet that triggered the production of a certain hormone that therefore led to reproductive development and that bee turning into a queen, whereas the bee that wasn't fed such a nutritious diet stays on as a drone. And all these pathways they interact. So, you know, this would be environment, the diet that led to the production of hormones. Genetic variants lead to altered hormone production, hormone sensitivity. So, while I painted them as three separate pathways, really, there is a lot of overlap between the three. So, kind of moving on, perhaps there, from the kind of overview of developmental biology, a bit of stuff on plants. So, I've talked, most of the examples I've given so far are derived from animals. And of course, it's important that we study animals. Some of my best friends are animals. But why study plants then? Well, I mean, it's a bit of a fatuous slide, really. But plants do it all. Okay? I mean, there was no soil on earth until the algae crept out of the water 500 million years ago. It started dying off and compacting into soil. You know, plants make the air that we breathe, the brush cotton sheets that I don't sleep in, but some people do. You know, the homes that we live in, and most fundamentally, of course, tagliatelle. So, I mean, the more we understand about plants, we're absolutely better on whatever level. Another reason we should work on plants really is just the sheer beauty of photosynthesis. Okay? I mean, when plants get hungry, they're not hanging around waiting for a delivery driver, working out what's a socially acceptable tip. Okay? They're rolling up their sheaves, they're getting on with it, and they're making their own dinner. Okay? They're sitting there, they're taking in water, carbon dioxide, and they're using sunlight, which is really, when you think about it, the original five ingredient or less recipe. Okay? And this is absolutely fantastic. They're just using sunlight to make their own food. I mean, I think about this a lot. You're just sitting there, and you're kind of making tagliatelle. I mean, would that be so incredible? Maybe I think about this too much, but it's brilliant. And, you know, photosynthesis, it used to be boring. You know, GCSE photosynthesis is a drag, but the more you think about it, the more kind of plants using sunlight to make food. It's just fascinating. But that all being said, while photosynthesis is fascinating, it's not really what I study, and that's partly because I struggle to say the word. But I'm more interested in the developmental biology. So not this kind of wonderful biochemistry that's going on inside the cells, but the genetics that are really determining what a cell is actually going to become. So if we kind of drop back to animal development for a moment then, in terms of animal development, there's this really critical phase, which is embryogenesis. So getting from that single cell, multiple cell divisions here, giving rise in this case to the chick. Okay? And it's really embryogenesis during animal development. That's the critical period. That's when you lay down the animal body plan. Okay? By the end of embryogenesis, you get a chick, and that's fundamentally what a chicken's going to look like throughout its life cycle. Okay? So some things do occur in development post-embryonic clean animals. You know, if you think about humans, hemoglobin chains, for centally through to kind of juvenile development, you get wisdom teeth, you go through puberty. So there are aspects of post-embryonic development in animals, but nowhere near as much as there are in plants. Okay? So in plants, you do get this period of embryogenesis. Okay? You do lay down the body plan. You know, if you've ever got any seeds at home and you pick them apart, you do see that embryo inside of a seed. But following that period of embryogenesis and seed germination, in case of seed plants here, not all plants make seeds, you then get really long period of post-embryonic development, which is really when the plant body plan is laid down. Okay? Because plants are able to continue to produce organs throughout their life cycle, which is fundamentally different to animals. Okay? If you chop the leg off a kitten, it's not going to grow back. Okay? However much you apologise, however much glue you use, it's not coming back. Okay? In plants, don't worry about it. Okay? They're getting eaten all the time by herbivores. You know, if a plant struggled when a caterpillar came along, we'd be in trouble. Okay? So this is fundamentally why plants are so interesting, why their development is so wonderfully unique relative to animals, because of this power to continue to produce organs throughout their life cycle. Which is, you know, some animals do a little bit, but plants, it's absolutely core to how plants grow. And you know, if you're gardeners, you know, if you prune and they come back. And the reason that plants are really able to do this is because they produce these structures called meristems. Okay? And for me, this is really the most beautiful structure in all of biology, the shoot apical meristone. And what it is, is you've got kind of a pool, I'm not sure this is working, a pool of stem cells in the very kind of growing tip of the shoot. And plants are able to maintain these pools of stem cells throughout their life cycle. You know, wheels start from stem cells, but in animals, these stem cells kind of become progressively less potent, and they can't generate new cell types throughout their life cycle. Fundamentally different in plants, they keep these pools of stem cells that can continue to grow and to replicate and to ultimately produce the organs that emerge from them. So in the case of this shoot apical meristem here, oh, it's working. This is leaves, this is a tomato meristem, this is a young leaf emerging from the meristem. This is an even younger leaf here, you can see some hairs on the back of the leaf. And so this guy is going to keep dividing, keep dividing, keep dividing, and as it divides and grows up, it's also producing cells that will differentiate to produce the lateral organs in this case. leaves, but it could also be flowers later on, it could be the root down below. And so it's through maintaining these pools of stem cells, it means that plants can grow so plastically. You know, because plants can't run away, if there's danger, a plant can't run away, a plant can't migrate in changing seasons, so it's got to sit there and take it. And you use these stem cells to actually produce different organs depending on what the environment demands of it. So the area of developmental biology that I'm really most interested in is how plants transition through different developmental phases. So just like we go through different difficult phases, plants also undergo something similar. So in this life cycle of a stereotypical flowering plant, life starts out as an embryo, as I kind of pointed out before. And once that embryo germinates, plants grow as a juvenile vegetative plant, so they continue to pump up leaves, but they are juvenile. They then transition to adult growth. And this is, we'll come to this, this is really my bag, this juvenile to adult transition. And following that, they go on to produce flowers, undergo meiosis, produce the gametes, and the life cycle starts again. And of course, understanding this is of fundamental importance. Because if we want to understand how plants transition to flowering, that's got huge importance for all our crops that produce seeds and fruits, okay, from barley to berries. Okay, that's all dependent on flowering time. And so understanding the timing mechanisms that control when plants go through these developmental transitions is of fundamental importance as well as interest. And just as you can kind of see the manifestation here of different phases of development, you can also see that really in the meristem as well. So this is this very cute little tomato meristem again. On the left now, you can see a juvenile meristem. It's a bit smaller. You can actually see the leaves have slightly different characteristics. They're not so hairy. And once the plant has transitioned through to the flowering stage of reproductive development, you can now see these kind of bulbous flowers that are emerging from the meristem. So these different phases are also kind of tractable within meristems too. So this kind of juvenile to adult transition. This is the transition that I'm most interested in. We call it vegetative phase change. So it's not as flashy as flowering. You know, people work on flowering, it flowers out a bit. But this is much more nuanced. It's kind of a bit more of a deep cut. But there are lots of traits that do change with vegetative phase change that are fundamentally important. So, you know, if you look at this lovely passion flower on the left here, juvenile leaves are smaller, they're kind of spear shaped, whereas adult leaves are trilobed. In this, a swollen thorn acacia, very glamorous. These guys produce swollen thorns for symbiotic species of ants that grow on a tree and protect it from fungi and from other insects. But the acacia can only produce these at adult stages of development. So these early leaves, lower down, they're not producing the thorns. They can only do it when they transition to adult growth. In corn plants, the epidermal characteristics of juvenile and adult leaves are very different. In aspen, this is a cross section of a leaf stalk, a petiole. And you can see that the vascular arrangement, if you looked into the petiole, is very different in the juvenile versus the adult leaf. And this actually explains the kind of quaking aspens that you see across northern America. So, you know, kind of fluttering leaf phenotype of aspens. They can only do this when they're adult plants, because the vascular arrangement in the juvenile petiole means they can't actually flutter. It's pretty cool, isn't it? And finally, to our Swiss cheese plants. Again, I didn't notice it for a long time, but juvenile Swiss cheese plant leaves aren't cheesy, are they? They're kind of entirely, they're fully heart-shaped. Whereas once they get a bit older, once they transition to adult growth, you do see these invaginations. So all sorts of traits and commercial traits as well are important when we switch from juvenile to adult growth. And there is a wonderfully conserved genetic mechanism that actually regulates this, this timing mechanism that says, right, you know what? Time to grow up. You're no longer a juvenile plant. Kick on to make adult growth. And it's basically the outcome of some gene expression patterns for different sets of genes. I don't want to go into too much detail, but during juvenile development, the activity of a set of juvenile genes decreases. And once they go down, the activity of some genes that promote adult development goes up. And it is hyper-conserved across all flowering plants. So it's a really wonderful tool to try and understand how plants regulate developmental timing. If we can work out what's controlling this temporal decline, we're going to have some really big insights into how plants effectively measure time, really the nature of a developmental clock. And I don't want to go into too much detail, but if anyone is so inclined with genetics, the juvenile genes actually encode microRNAs. So they don't necessarily encode for proteins, but small bits of non-coding RNA. And what these non-coding bits of RNA do is actually target the adult genes. So when you've got lots of these microRNAs during juvenile development, you completely suppress the activity of the adult genes because these microRNAs, they bind these targets and they degrade them. So once we no longer have much of these juvenile genes, then the adult genes can get on and trigger a switch to adult growth. So while DNA makes RNA makes protein, it's very important, you do get these very kind of quirky bits of RNA as well that have big effects genetically. So just before I kind of give you a flavour of what we're doing in the lab, I would also like to give a bit of a pitch for my favourite plant, Arabidopsis saliana, which is effectively the fruit fly. You know, people work on animals, they've got fruit flies, they work on nematodes, they work on mice. Well, in plants we mainly work on Arabidopsis. And sadly, my very glamorous Arabidopsis didn't quite survive the first great western train journey with me, but you're welcome to come and have a look at it afterwards if you like. And the reason that Arabidopsis is so good for doing experiments on is it's very quick growing, it is very small, it's both self and out-crossing, so very good for genetics. It's got a small genome, we can transform it. So it's got all the hallmarks of a really good experimental system. So it is a bit of a, I won't swear, it's not a very impressive weed. And it grows in cracks in the pavement, you'll see it in cracks in the pavement in kind of March or April time all over the UK, and you wouldn't notice it at all. But it is really the workhorse of plant genetics. So what do we do with Arabidopsis in the lab? Well, just to kind of give you a flavour of how we're using Arabidopsis to try and understand developmental timing. And then the big questions, and I've kind of alluded to it already, is what's the temporal mechanism, what's the developmental clock that leads to the decrease in activity of these juvenile genes? And so this is work being carried out by a fantastic PhD student, Ethan, who's taken a couple of different approaches to try and understand what's going on here. So one approach is to actually try and mutate the genetic motifs that control gene expression patterns. And we can ask the question, okay, can we identify some fragments of DNA, some motifs of DNA that are really important for this temporal expression pattern? And we're also using some computational approaches to when we actually identified a candidate regulator that we think is really important for promoting the activity of these juvenile genes. So we're making good progress there. But what I will say, this is really robust. Now we've tried to break this developmental clock through lots of mutagenesis for many years, and we really struggled to do this. There's loads of inputs that are making this clock so robust and so kind of hard to get rid of this temporal decline. Another approach we're taking is less of a temporal approach and more of a spatial question. And so in this question, in this approach, Harriet, another fantastic PhD student is asking, where is it in the plant that effectively promotes the transition to adult growth? Is it the cells of a shoot apical meristem? Okay, these stem cells that sit right in the hub here, do they function autonomously? Okay, to actually promote a transition to go on to adult development, to go on to flowering? Or are they dependent on signaling from elsewhere in the plants? And this is a really classic question in plant development. People were doing this in the 60s. How autonomous is this shoot apical meristem, or how dependent is it on signaling from leaves? And so to tackle this, how it's been inducibly blocking signaling from young leaf primordia into the meristem. And so we're asking the question, if we block that first signaling, we block plasmodesmata, these tiny little pores between cells, does that affect the rate of developmental transitions? And how it's starting to get some really nice phenotypes there. Kind of a fairly new project that's been going on in the lab, which is in a collaboration with Dr Hong-Juyin, who's joined us from Langzhu University. He's asking this question, okay, so we have juvenile and we have adult plants. From the plant's perspective, when they're stressed out, what bits of the plant should they lose through senescence? Okay, you see plants go yellow, a bit scraggly, your broccoli's going yellow in the fridge. And the reason they're doing this is it's a very active process to reabsorb nutrients from tissues that they no longer leave. Okay, so from the plant's perspective, should they sacrifice juvenile tissues, or should they sacrifice adult tissues first when they're undergoing a bit of stress? And so Hong-Juy's done some really nice preliminary work and she's found that in some genetic mutants that we have that are precociously adult, these guys stick in the dark for days and they're very happy. Okay, whereas these wild type plants, you can see they're already starting to go yellow, which is suggesting that adult tissues are more work-worthy, more valuable to the plants. They're kind of holding on to these for longer and not undergoing senescence. So this is a really exciting new project we've got going. Moving away from Arabidopsis, a question that we've been working on for a little bit of time now is really what is the ancestral function of these juvenile genes? Okay, so to whiz you through 500 million years of plant evolution, about that time some green algae flocked out the sea, landed on the earth and started, they gave rise to all the land plants. They weren't always plants on land, living plants in the sea for a lot longer. And following this colonisation event, there's a big split. Okay, so the bryophytes, your mosses, your liverworts, your hornworts went one way. These guys don't make leaves, they don't make roots, they don't make vascular tissue. Whereas things that did make vascular tissue went the other way. So including your ferns, your gymnosperms or your flowering plants. So we know a lot about juvenile genes from our work in flowering plants such as Arabidopsis. But these genes are absolutely ancient. Okay, so the adult genes evolved in the algae, and the juvenile genes evolved at the base of a land plant. So the question is, well, what are these juvenile genes doing at the base of a land plant at a point in plant development where they weren't really going through the same transitions? Because things like mosses and liverworts don't undergo vegetative phase change. They have a completely different life cycle. But these genes will be completely conserved. So why bother keeping these genes if they don't just work on vegetative phase change? So Sabine here has taken a comparative approach to understand what the ancestral function might be doing by comparing moss, which is a lot more robust in a plastic container on a train, with flowering plants. And if our genes are doing kind of roughly similar cellular things, then that's probably the ancestral function of the plant. And actually, kind of a really big hypothesis we've got really, is that quite a common trend in vascular plant evolution is delayed meiosis, a delayed production of gametes, which is things like mosses and liverworts, they can't wait to get on with it. Okay, they produce gametes very, very quickly and move on. Whereas things like trees wait for 50 years before they're going through flowering, producing gametes. So we think these juvenile genes might have been important to just kind of give that a little delay early in land plant evolution. They've really been co-opted for extending the plant life cycle ever since. And kind of just to finish with a more translational bit of work that we've been doing, and we started working on a new or new to us crop called Camelina sativa, false flax, or gold of pleasure. I don't know if anyone's ever used Camelina oil, very nutritious, lots of omega-3s. It's a really, really healthy oil. It's got a fantastic omega-3 profile, but it's really understudied and undergrown. And all the work that has been done on it is really focusing on the seed. So trying to improve the lipid profile. Not very much work has been done on the preceding phase of vegetative development. So we're trying to understand how our favorite genetic network could perhaps be manipulated to speed up Camelina development, to get it through its developmental transitions more rapidly so we can actually go on to produce seed that have such high potential for human health. So Rohit here, Dr Rohit Kumar has been doing some fast work. We've just generated now some transgenic lines where we've manipulated the gene expression for our favorite genes. We've produced juvenile and also adult mutants. And so we've realized that the same genes are functioning in Camelina as they are in Arabidopsis, which is really good support for our work going forward. And as a kind of inverse approach, as well as wanting to speed growth up, so in the case of Camelina, we want to get to seed production more quickly. In certain crops, you actually want to slow it down. If you've ever grown coriander, the moment it bolts, you're screwed. Okay, so what we really want is a slow growing, leafy, vegetative, juvenile coriander plant, which is a new project that we're going to start in September. So we're working on coriander and we're working on rocket. And I'm very excited with those. I'm also very excited because the student who's going to do it has just been setting records on university challenge. So finally, the lab pub quiz teams are going to have some success. So just a kind of few take-home messages. So I hope I persuaded you that developmental biology is interesting. It's this process from getting from a single cell through to the fully differentiated body throughout the life cycle of an individual. That plants have this fantastically plastic way of dealing with the environment. I say plastic, I mean flexible because they can't run away. They've got to sit there and they've got to adapt. The reason that plants are so plastic is because of meristems. And finally, the developmental transition we're most interested in is vegetative phase change. There are a number of different traits that are really associated with the difference between juvenile and adult development. So thanks very much to my wonderful lab. The only person that I didn't give a shout out to was Lucia, who's given fantastic support. And also most important to the Royal Society, who is extremely generous in their funding and have funded most of this work. Thanks for coming. Thank you. I think we have time for a couple of questions, if anyone's got one. Yep. What's the advantage for plants of delayed reproduction? Yeah, sure. Well, something like algae, for example, at the moment that is a diploid cell, that immediately undergoes meiosis. So this trend towards delayed meiosis allows plants to, I think it's really a consequence of competition. Because the longer plant evolution goes on for, the more competition you've got. You've kind of got to grow a bit more vertically, compete with your neighbours and actually get the resources available to you to then go on to produce your offspring. So if you're undergoing moe's immediately on the forest floor, your offspring have never got, you've never got a chance of doing it because you've not, you don't really have a chance to actually get enough resources from sunlight because the canopy is growing over you. So there's a large trend in terms of kind of competition of growth, of growing outside of canopies to get the resources. And you can't, you can only do that once you've got a bit older, once you've got a bit bigger to actually start producing the flowers. And then just from an energetic perspective, you're, if the bigger you are, the more leaves you've produced, the more energy you can actually put in to producing your, your pollen and your eggs. Thank you. Thank you. That was really interesting. On your phylogenetic tree, do mosses have those juvenile genes as well? And if so, why don't they use them the same way as the vascular plants? Yes, absolutely. So they do. This is the most, these juvenile genes is microRNA, is the most conserved microRNA in all of plants. So it is, you can't really get rid of it. So it is crucial. But mosses don't really make, they kind of make leaf type issue things. They don't make leaves, as I've talked about, it's kind of different leaf type from juvenile to adult plants. So that's really the big question. What are these genes doing in there? So we've now got some data to suggest that we think that they're important for repressing the adult genes. In this case, what the adult genes, are kind of slowing down proliferation. So actually, by having these juvenile genes in this context, it's repressing the adult genes, and it's actually allowing the plants to grow for proliferative growth for longer periods. And also, it does look like they do affect meiosis. So when we mutate the adult genes, these moss plants have screwed up meiosis. Their spore capsules look really sad. So it looks like there is an interaction between these juvenile genes and the adult genes during this diploid phase of the plant life cycle, where it's really important, where they actually undergo meiosis. So there's some kind of conserved effect, perhaps, in delaying meiosis, and also perhaps something unique going on in mosses with this pathway as well. Thank you. I think that's all that we have time for, but that was absolutely brilliant. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
