Howto & Style
 What happens if Pivot goes into bankruptcy? What happens to me as the leasing or the farm owner? Are we still going to be able to keep that 20-year lease and there's no interruptions in service when the project goes from one property owner to the next? So definitely a fair concern, especially since this is your family's land generationally. And I think a really great thing is with these solar projects, each site is its own separate project LLC and legal entity. And all existing contracts and agreements would matriculate with that project if it were to be sold in an event like that. So the grazing partner, the water agreements, our vegetation agreements, solar O&M agreements, those would all transfer over. And so the site would be able to continue operating in an event like that. I think also it's helpful to know that with solar arrays like this, we do post decommissioning bonds with the county. And so if there were an unusual event like that, and the solar array did for some reason have to be removed from the site, there is funding set aside for that as well.
