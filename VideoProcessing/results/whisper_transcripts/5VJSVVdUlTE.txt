 Look at the ingenuity of Thailand's farmers. When they raise pigs, they build farms over large ponds and release fish into the water below. The fish grow large by eating the pig's waste and excrement. Then, the farmers catch the fish from the water and sell them. They also take their large pigs to their fields and use them to plow the land and prepare for crops.
