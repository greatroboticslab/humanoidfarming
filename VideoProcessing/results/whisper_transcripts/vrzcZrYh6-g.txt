 Thank you. All right, what is growing on? So I am in front of one of these fields that Jim just got done scything. Actually, the area I'm walking through now was scythed a few days ago. He just turned this and we're going to go over and check out this baler that he's developed, built, and he's actually baling his own hay. So really exciting video, I think. Stay tuned. Getting ready to go over to the other part of the farm here and show you this thing. I have seen pictures on Facebook before we got up here, but I have not seen this thing operating in person. So hold tight. What are we doing over here? It's not turning the hay. Turning the hay? Yeah, this kind of, this is a little older than I usually. I'll mow it until the dew's off, let the field dry, then turn what I just mowed. This I didn't get to. So, but look at, this has been sitting here two days. And look how green it is still underneath. It bleaches on the top, the green underneath, but a little drier. You know, most of the old time haymakers, what they would have done is took this windrow and spread it. But what I found is I still can't get it done in a day. And if I keep it in the windrow, you'll see how easy it is to pick up when I go. So I can just like go along and pick up the whole windrow. So if I keep it like this, I can do that. And it only takes a day longer. And the hay almost seems better because it, the whole bunch doesn't get bleached. Just the top gets bleached. You know, I'm trying to still figure it out. Jim, that's a custom fork. I mean, do you even buy those things anymore? No, they just don't make them. So a hay fork, what you want is something to let the hay slide off. That's why there's only three prongs. And then this cup so that when you push along the ground to pick up the windrow, it's coming up out of the ground instead of digging in. And then the handles are so much nicer. These are all antique store finds. But they're usable, wonderful tools. So the pro tip there is hit your local antique store. Yep. Usually they're hanging on the wall. Same thing with that buck rake. That's the antique store. So yeah, this will be ready to bale tomorrow now. I can see how the rows you did this morning are still green. They look like what you're flipping almost. Yeah. But the thing is, with the dew, it was wet when I mowed it. So just by flipping it, you know, I should do that. But we're going to bale some hay, so I ain't going to worry about it. But I like how you can see how it kind of nips it together when it drops it in the windrow. So it moves as one piece, especially longer ones. I can almost stand it on end. This is a little shorter than what we'll be baling. But you know, come down here, you know, I mow two hours in the morning, spend 20 minutes flipping it. Maybe flip it one more time for 20 minutes and then bale it and that'll take another couple hours. So, I mean, but it's something that puts me in control of my garden feed and the animal feed, which is pretty nice. Oh, you're not relying on the local farm store? No, and I don't mind relying on local farmers, but the thing is, they're all relying on this, you know, way of doing things that's so tied to machinery. And that whole pandemic has really showed me how a supply chain can be, how fragile it is. You know, the trucks stop running, I mean, they can't even build cars because they don't got the chips, I guess. And all these new tractors all got chips, I bet. I guess that's why the oldies but the goodies are so sought after, huh? Well, that's the thing. Those, yeah, they could all be fixed with, you know, anything. The metal parts you could remanufacture by a blacksmith, you know. But I guess the, you know, the big deal would be to go back to horsepower. And that buddy, or the new friend of mine, Willie, that's what his plan is. He's got the BCS for now, but he's hoping to do horses with a sickle bar. He's ground-driven. And then some kind of a solar-powered machine that makes small round bales. Okay. Bale time? Bale time. Bale time. Bale time. Whoa. Pretty cool, huh? Bale time. Now, this is where you come in with that other rake after? Well, what I'll do is bring the machine down to the hay now, and then I'll be able to push all these wind drills up to the machine. But I found it was easy. I mean, it's kind of bumpy with all the ruts here, so I found it was easy to do that. But I just like how you can push that much hay, you know, with just a hay fork. A little manpower? And this has grown up a little. Right after you mow it, it's... It moves easier? It's not pushing it all. I can see the old ruts you were talking about. Oh, yeah. Wow, this is a wet field. Now we're getting into the taller grass, but we won't push. But, you know, this has been sitting here three days, and it's still pretty green underneath. That gives me a workout. That's harder than scything? Yeah, definitely. Oh, so here's the machine. That's the machine. That's the machine. We say machine. I mean, Jim, when I think about hay, I think about, you know, this $100,000 setup, this big expensive tractor, this baler. This didn't require $100,000, did it? No, I probably got maybe 200 materials in it. I bought some good wheels. I bought lumber that was smooth on one side. You wouldn't believe it, but the hay, when it's dry, is really slippery. So it slides in and out on the smooth surface of the wood, so the smooth is inside. And all it is is a box that you load with hay, and then compress with a ramp. It takes a while. I guess if you were here by yourself, you said maybe about 10 minutes of bale? 10 to 15, depends on how tuned I am to it. And how many bales have you done this year? Oh, like 75. Just 75? Well, this whole field is in the barn. Wow. Isn't that amazing? I have to get a couple of shots of that when we get back. And, you know, I modified how I do it. I do two compressions, because I want it really tight. Can you fit one of these rows in the balers? I wasn't able to, but they're getting shorter as I got down here. So, yeah, it's amazing how much will go into it. You know, you don't think that that little bale holds so much hay. Are you typically cutting all of this stuff before it goes to seed, Jim? Nope. So, we're getting seed in here too? Yeah, especially the early crop, you get a lot of dandelion seeds. But, I mean, we'll show you in the garden how, as long as the sun isn't exposed in the soil, it's not an issue in the garden. As long as you keep a crop on it, I mean, a layer of hay on it so no sunlight hits the ground. The first compression, okay, so I just, it's a lever, and the ram drives it and squeezes it out. Okay, and I back it off. The Russians didn't do that. And then open the door again. Is this your own modification to the design, Jim? Yep. Okay. Open the door again and push it all the way back against the ram. And then fill it again and then ram it. Okay. And then fill it again and ram it and then I'll probably have to steal some of that. Have you weighed one of these bales? Any idea what they're coming in at? No, we should do that. You want to put one on your produce scale when we get back? Produce scale won't be heavy enough. We can just do a regular one. A human scale? Yeah. So this is it. This is your main source of nutrition for the garden. Yeah. It's my own. Well, yeah. Well, you know, I've been doing the goat stuff and making new beds. Sheed mulching. And so for everybody watching in Florida, we're using the compost, broken down mulch from the city and in Maine we're using the grass. Yep. And again, grass is a big, broad spectrum. I mean, there is all kinds of clover and little leaves. So it's not just glass. It's more diverse than just grass. What do you mean? You're not using selective herbicides to keep all these different weeds out of here, Jim? No, we like them. This is all beyond organic, right? Wow. I just stuffed that whole bit in there. It's gone, huh? I think I'll be able to get enough. A lot of people wouldn't want hand work, but I mean, I don't mind it. I'm doing everything else by hand. Because this hand stuffing the Russians didn't do either, but I want the bail really tight. So it holds together. So they would just do one press and be done with it? Yep. And like I said, they had a needle that will thread it like I'll show you what I'm going to do. But I like this closure that kind of locks it. The guy had this and I found those at tractor supply. So it kind of sucks it in. So this just keeps the ram from going all the way back when I stuff it in. So I have some maneuvering to get it going with the leverage. So this is nice. Yeah, it didn't make that much difference. Nice job getting all of that back in there. You're not messing around you really stuck that thing Jim. Yeah, it really makes the bale tighter. This is a little wet still with the dew but I'm amazed at how it allows me to leave some pretty green stuff. You really didn't have that before. So you know I compressed it from here to there. And then I back it up, open the door, shove it in about three or four inches. And I thread the, see the Russians used the thing with this all closed and shoved the needle through and you had to thread it. But I saw I could just open the door, thread it around, thread it around, right there. Now you said you've tried some different strings and this is the one you had to go with. This is true baling twine, yeah. Everything else broke. So that's the top string. Now I'll do the bottom string. Same thing. Now the back. Something I might make a different design because I have to thread it behind this upright for the wheel. That might have been a mistake. It ain't that big a deal. And then I don't cut that one. Try to keep the twine kind of in the center of the bale. Because sometimes it slides to the outside when I close it. Lock it up again. Same thing here. Pretty good. Compress it again. Leave it compressed. And then tie it up. Again I have to thread it behind this upright for the wheel which is kind of a pain sometimes. Maybe you could put like a little, I guess a tube. A tube. I thought about it. I think that would work. I think there's things that change on it. But most of the time it goes easy. But if there's hay right there it becomes a little pain in the ass. I want to make sure it kind of moves. And then I cut it. Just tie a, I don't know what that's called, a loop like that. And then thread that through. And you can still, if you crank too tight you can break this twine too. You can. Yeah. But I mean you really got to crank on it. So then I just tie a loop here. So hopefully you'll be able to use these again. Because they'll be the right length. Just pull that instead of cutting it. And then there's a typical hay bales that are just cutting. Right. And the same thing. Tie a loop in the top one. And open the door. And then to press it out. Put like a spacer in. The Russians use some kind of a T thing. That seems to work pretty good for me. So that'll just push it out. It's definitely not as dry. I can feel more friction with it. And then. Oh so when it's moist it doesn't come out as easy? Yeah. I mean it's when it's dry it's really slippery. So it'll probably not come out as easy. And it's coming out. Oh. Ta ta. Whoa. I mean it's moveable and stackable and. Got hay? Got hay. Nice. Yeah I mean that is self-sufficiency for a farmer. Because with animals that is always the thing that you know having hay for them. But you still gotta have storage. Jim the human hay baler. Yeah. Jim I think people are probably starting to get the impression you like hard work. Yeah. I do. Not scared huh? Nope. One other thing I learned because I was talking to Aaron from Tide Mill. He was saying in wet fields one of the big problems is. When you're moving the hay around. And you drive across it. I can't remember if it's the tatter or one of the machines. And you got wet ground you push it down into the moisture and make it wetter. So I was finding the same thing here. On the wet ground. And I was like, I don't know if I'm going to put it down into the moisture and make it wetter. So I was finding the same thing here. On the wet ground. I'd be kneeling on the hay and stuff in. So I started putting this down. And that ain't a problem. I got another pro tip. Yeah. If you got a wet field. I mean it was standing water three days ago. Alright. There we go. I grabbed that boy. Oh the presser. Mmm. I'll get it. I'll get it. I'll get it. Oh. I'll get it. Oh. I'll get it. Oh. I'll get it. I'll get it. Oh. Oh. Oh. The presser. Mm. I'll get it. Oh. Okay. Oh. So Jim there was no plans for this or anything online you just went by a standard hay bale and kind of came up with your measurements well the guy on line talked about his throw on the ram and then the size of the box so I kind of used his but I ended up shortening the throw and something goes I think it's a 36 by 13 bale and I think the other ones are 36 by 14. okay because I think my measurements how I put this together that should have been anyway it was an inch off how I figured it that's a little bigger than you wanted or smaller smaller Jim the human hay baler yep so this is the first compression which I probably could get away with but they'd be much looser baled I guess we're just hand tying the twine it makes it a little easier when they're tighter huh yeah and then I kind of found it if I stuff bottom and top because oftentimes the first bales I was doing would have one awkward it'd be like one was shorter because it wasn't as much on the one end of the top so if I stuff at the evenly top and bottom the strings are more square when it finishes just little tips if anybody's interested and try to get it really full because you got the lever action of the big long two-by-two-by-four that will let it compress and this is the one that I'm so glad I had this part sticking up because I used that to really start gives you that leverage yeah that's gonna be a good bail that's a nice tight one huh again just push the iron up so you can thread the twine cut the twine I wonder if you even just cut a slit out you know in the wood if it give you like a place you can slide that through yeah I mean that's what this is two board slits yeah oh you mean here yeah yeah they'd make it easier you're right open uh Hey, I want it to flow free. I don't know why. Is it caught in? I think it's because the hay is a little damp. There we go. Because otherwise it won't tighten up good. Jim, you definitely did this one in under five minutes. Yeah, yeah, cool. I mean, especially if I had somebody else getting the hay to me. Because that's half the, you know, getting it so it's close. When Alexander and I were doing it was a lot easier that way. And there was a little more in each windrow too. But you can see I'm cranking on it. Because I want it as tight as I can for when it lets going. And I'm also trying to keep the string as low in there, you know, close to the center that this slot will allow me. Because if it's up here, it's often sliding off the side. After you've done a hundred, you kind of get to know what works and what doesn't. I'll bet. I'll get to know what works and what doesn't. I'll bet. I'll bet. I'll bet. I'll bet. I'll bet. I'll bet. I'll bet. I'll bet. I'll bet. I'll bet. I'll bet. I'll bet. I'll bet you. I'll bet you. I'll bet you in the corner. I'll bet you in the corner. You're right. It's like the human hay baler. You're right, it's like the human hay baler. Boom. There you go. That's a day's worth of feed for the goats. In 10 minutes. Yeah. Plus I had to cut it. Yeah. I'm glad you got it. Yeah. Now I can show you the bull rake. So the more hay you leave in the field is it going to be in the way when you make your next cut, like if I get a third cut off it. So if you saw those little things, it would make it harder to mow. Plus you're wasting hay. And this, I don't know how this works and doesn't get stuck, but it's an amazing design. It's called the bull rake. This is another antique store find, right? Well actually some scyther guy I know. Somebody brought it back? From South Main said, I never use this. Somebody said they use it when they do hay fields. Do you want it? And I said, sure. So that was a gift? Yeah. From another scyther. Right, but I've seen them at an antique store. But somehow it just hops along the ground. And you kind of keep it upright. And it just picks up all the stray hay. That's a one pass machine, huh? Yeah. Sometimes. Again, it's wax. It's a little bit more than a rock. I think it's a little more than a rock. I'm going to pull it back. I'm going to pull it back. Yeah. When I was mowing up there, it was like really low. Because this has already grown up again. It's hard to believe how much it's grown in three days. That's three days of growth. That's three days of growth. Yeah, it's up like two inches So that makes a difference on how much friction there is here So you really got to move faster it gets harder Yeah And sometimes you just totally lose it Because I got this guy so there's a big right over there. Do you see that? Yeah, I thought that was intentional. No, I Back there because I started mowing that backfield and then we got all the rain and so there's like I don't know ten windrows back there that you know, the grass grew this much. I flipped it once but I don't think I'll get it Wow All right, you guys know I'm always picking on those grass holes, but this is the type of grass I can stand behind Growing and using makes a little bit more sense. So this grass. This is kind of okay. This is cool The typical mow your yard to look pretty Like a king doesn't really fly for me All right, so Jim the human hay baler talk about farm strong.
