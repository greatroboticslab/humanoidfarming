 Music The Rural Livelihood Improvement Program aims to revitalize farming and fishing villages in developing regions based on the region's diverse natural conditions and cultural backgrounds, and to develop technologies that will improve the incomes and livelihoods of those engaged in farming, forestry and fishing. Music The project for the rural areas of Indochina focuses on Laos. Music The issues to address are identified from surveys of local people. Music The region's resources are also surveyed. Music Jercas promotes the development of technologies that guarantee ongoing security of agricultural production and farmers' financial independence, and propose actual farming, forestry and fishery systems. Music These efforts aim to build new relationships between nature and people. Music We are identifying the current environmental impacts in the intensive cropping areas of wheat, maize and other cereals in northern China, and in the farming and livestock raising region in Inner Mongolia. We are also developing core technologies for recycling based agricultural production systems. Music The project for advanced application of local food sources focuses on building a food resource research network in Asia. Under the project, we are surveying food resources in the region and researching and developing technologies for food processing. Music In Southeast Asia, we are involved in exploiting unutilized biomass resources that don't compete with foodstuffs. In Malaysia, we are developing production technology for ethanol and other materials based on oil palm waste wood, cassava and other materials. Music So that the multiple benefits of forests can continue to be utilized, in Thailand, we are developing management methods essential to using forests sustainably. Music And in Malaysia, we are developing sound forest renewal technologies to improve forestry sustainability. Music We are developing technologies aimed at mitigating the environmental impact of aquaculture in tropical coastal areas, and developing sustainable aquaculture technologies. Music To learn more about the internal biological factors relating to the maturation of shrimps, and economically important aquaculture species, we are developing working aquaculture systems.
