 It takes real muscle to get through soil like this. It takes brain power to do it with productivity and ease. Whatever your fields throw at you, heavy residue, compaction, different soil types or wet fields, you need the right tillage depth and pressure control to lay the right groundwork for your next crop. That used to mean climbing out of your cab and manually adjusting depth, pressure and side-to-side leveling. A job that can take several minutes. Now it takes only 6 seconds right from your cab without ever needing to stop. TruSet technology from John Deere makes it fast and easy. Just by pressing a button, you can adjust tillage depth to fit your changing soil conditions or to break up compaction layers with 1 tenth of an inch accuracy. Plus, TruSet lets you run and document prescription tillage so you can incorporate residue at different levels throughout your field. Then check back to see how emergence or yield were affected. Using historical field maps on the touch screen, you can track areas of hardpan, traffic lanes or differing soil types. That lets you till deeper to break up compaction or adjust for conditions such as lighter soils. It's another way you can gain ground with John Deere. Available factory installed on select new tillage models or as a performance upgrade kit for many current tillage tools. Ask your John Deere dealer for details.
