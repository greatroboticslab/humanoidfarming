 music among the lagunious plant that you can cultivate and make quick money you have granite you have soybean you have other things now a lot of young farmers keep coming and asking and you know i want to start a farm but what crop you advise one that is very short and gives me fast cash this week we are still in the northern region precise meal district and we are still in the farm of kujo abimash here is in the person of alaji mashud the 2021 overall national best farmer so we are going to talk to him to briefly enlighten us you've watched last week about maize farming now let's bring you up to speed on what is happening when it comes to cowpea or granite so you learn something and make a choice alaji thanks for joining me once again thanks so much madam so if this is my first time of hearing granite farming what exactly what kind of crop are we talking about yeah granite is a lagunious plant okay and the advantage of cropping it is that it fixes nitrogen back to the soil okay so if you are doing crop rotation as a smallholder farmer right you can crop for instance if you have 10 acres of uh land you can use five acres for granite five acres for maize next year you rotate them rotation here means you send or you cultivate the granite where you cultivate the maize last year and then you bring the maize to where you cultivated the granite thank you okay so if you do that you see that the cost of your soil becomes very rich and then you get a very good yield on the maize what kind of land do we go and eat for cultivating this because you see i'm using maize and uh granite so maize and granite are always cultivated mostly on loose soils and uplands okay please what kind of preparation do i do before even going to buy my seeds yes yeah you know we have so so many varieties of granites okay but currently in ghana we have uh well we are always about we always use the local names okay we have what they call the chinese right uh and other varieties okay there are bigger ones there are smaller ones yeah but the chinese look very tiny okay when when you feed them right so and it gives a very good yield okay and that's what we are encouraging but on kujo abimash farms we do mostly granite seed okay we don't do green okay and our reason for doing granite uh seed is that we are supporting women in granite production okay so the seed doesn't mean you produce it right from the scratch or you buy from somewhere multiply and then give to them yeah we we we we buy seed from sari okay savannah agricultural research institute right they always produce the foundation seed and then we buy the foundation seed and then we produce certified seed okay for our our female farmers how much is this sold for 50 kilograms this year was around 1200 to 1500 i can if my memory says me right okay sometimes it's my farm manager who does all the procurement and other things and then we transfer money okay so it's around 1200 to 1500 so we buy the the foundation seed and then we produce certified seed and give it out to the women to to multiply it into green again and sell uh to the market but mostly we we serve as off tickets to them when they produce we just buy from from them from them at the market price right and also sell it out okay to potential aggregators right last week when your maize farm it was well spaced distant in between but this one it looks like everything is combined similarly when we are when we are we mostly we we when we are planting we plant there are distance okay or the space between the plants okay but you see when it grows up it forms a canopy uh-huh so that's why you see it uh as as if it is one okay but indeed when you go down you see that there are small small space in between all the crops are standing individual individual so in that case how many seeds goes into each one one we plant only one how long does it take too much about three months three months three months how many times do you harvest oh once once well we do only once we do one harvest okay at what stage is it now how many weeks old is it now in the next two weeks we'll be harvesting all this so do we have some granite beneath the roots now if if we if if i put one you see okay you see you see that there's granites under it oh nice i see them am i able to count this there are a lot of them there are a lot of them so this is how it looks like you plant one and then you uh you get this okay just one give you this place yes once you're saying yes all right allergy i see some spots yellow yellow spots so uh there are indicators that uh-huh uh it is becoming mature like that when it's maturing when you're seeing the yellow spots you see that the leaves will will will tend to yellowish and then the dark spots will be showing okay do you give fertilizer to granite yes the granite has its own fertilizer the lignose fertilizers okay some years back we're using uh is a glycine mix okay and then it gives us very good years how the majority of farmers who are into granite farming doesn't use fertilizers okay so how many times do i apply my fat line for maturity just once okay that's granite loves more rainfall or more sunshine what kind of weather is good no it's mixed because at a particular point it needs heat okay and then at some particular points it needs rain okay so mostly we start we we we cultivate granite before or we plant granite before uh maize okay so granite is always the first crop we start with and then before we we we move to maize okay before the fruits start coming beneath the root do you see any indications of that yes it will flow what do you see it will flower okay it will flower before all right i see some tiny flowers here okay so when you see the flowers you know that is that forming beneath them exactly okay all right after harvesting the granite what happens to this this one we use it for animal feed which animals can consume this small small and big ruminants okay it does sheep goats and cattle right so we everything you see here immediately we harvest and then we take our grains or our seed away we are going to take all distance to away we don't allow it to rot here okay we pick it and then we feed our animals again with it okay it's a pure animal feed right and it's very good okay is there any form of disease that also worry granite yes we have we have we have there are pests that attack the flowers and once they suck the nectar it means that you have four years okay so at a point we do control them by using either amaster or any other uh pest control uh chemical i was some of their growth stage do you start controlling or preventing it mostly uh first one month first one one month we control it all right we control by spring okay but mostly those packs the pets which attack granites are not all that dangerous okay okay to granite granite production right because at the time do the grasshoppers and other things will be disturbing and by then there's so much heat okay so once there's so much heat this will come resist the heat and then they also fall off and then the granite will move okay so when you harvest what happens to this after harvesting we we have you see granite uh production creates a lot of employment for women especially a lot of employment for for women because after mostly it's the woman who even do the upcoming and again they will harvest again for us so as they are harvesting they are paid okay and once they are paid you know that uh in the local economy you are generating more income in their packets so granite production basically once once we are uh whilst we are doing it as our corporate social responsibility it is also creating employment for the women in this community okay do you buy from the women fresh or dry no after harvesting they they'll dry and then we buy then they sell to you yeah so who do you deal with who are your business who are your targets yeah i mean where we have aggregators who sell to uh is it uh producer market something i mean they are they are in the tamale market because granite is not our main crop okay but we are just doing it for our social corporate responsibility yeah is granite farming profitable very very profitable very profitable like i said you mostly um produce without adding fertilizers okay so you only require the seed and plowing right and when you do that it makes you having the cost of production is very low but in a year how many times can i grow no once once once once we do we do it once you know if i'm in the southern part well and then i'm not so familiar with what is happening in the south okay so by the northern region we do it only one only once only once okay between uh april to august and then we are done with uh granite so by the close of this right this month you see a servicing it is gone okay so how many acres we find ourselves in oh we are just producing the seed about four acres of four four okay all right so um in case a startup farmer wants to go into granite farming how much minimum do you think i would be able to go like i indicated last week okay with the maize farms it depends on your capacity how much income you have and then you target okay either you are doing one acre right two acres three acres or four acres or ten acres so it's your income that determines how much like i said if granite seed is one thousand and plowing one acre is will cost you about 400 ghana cities then that's 1400 labor maybe may cost you about 1000 again if you have 1400 or 2400 then you then think of what can you be doing okay if you are doing so if it is uh 3000 is for one acre as crop budget then if you have six thousand ten thousand thousand then it means then that that's what will inform you as to what to do okay all right so you're watching the ghanian farmer my name is then you know join us every monday on joy prime television if you missed on joy prime make sure you catch up with us on our youtube channel

inquiries you can reach out to us send us messages and we'll help you to start your journey in the line of agriculture we are still in a northern region precisely in the immune district and we find ourselves in cujo at the marsh farms he does a lot of things here and so this week we are with him at where he's producing some seeds to supply to women who are into granite production this is basically just a small part of what he does on his huge passage of land we are about to wrap up our conversation on granite farming but there are a lot of young people out there who want to go into farming but it seems not to know where to start from or who to approach or what direction to start from what would you have to share any any tips well most ghana or youth doesn't want to explore you should be able to explore to see because there are lands there are people out there who are supporting like what we are doing for example if you are a female student who just completed university you want to go into farming we support women farmers to do granite if you are able to explore you find out what we are doing we support you okay with the seed then you are only you only be struggling with uh plowing services and labor okay so we can support you after that you come and pay back to us okay and then you continue so granite farming is one of the cheap cheapest farming you can do or as a starter you can start with okay with granite farming and then you move into other areas okay yes can a Ghanaian youth make a living from farming absolutely yes absolutely yes you can well i don't do anything apart from farming okay and i'm living you are a full-time farmer full-time farmer okay i don't do anything apart from farming right so why would i disgrace somebody or why would i tell somebody that you can live on farming meanwhile i'm living on it okay my family everybody is living on that and i'm i mean we're creating impact okay if i didn't if we're not making profit i don't think we even think of supporting women without even making profit especially with regards to and ground farming how do you deal with the issues of inputs because input from fertilizer to seed to other few things here and there how do you deal with this inconsistent especially their price fluctuation how do you do we we we always see farming as business okay so anything any business is going through our farming the farms too must also go through that price price fluctuation looking for market all those all those things we are also dealing dealing with it as when it's it comes okay so we don't have well the challenges are there but as it approach it it comes out we also approach it with the solution right so it's not it's not anything smooth somebody anybody coming in should not think it's so smooth i mean i'm just coming in there's money yeah no it shouldn't be like that okay just make your mind that there are challenges and we'll ask when the challenges come i must also approach it with the solution you don't give up once there are challenges maybe there a particular year like 2019 we had droughts here for almost 42 42 days no race ever i mean no that does not mean that we should stop we should also continue if there are prices i mean uh increase of fertilizer prices yeah that does not mean that we should quit or we should reduce our sizes we should also think of reinvest them you know when you look at farming as as an event i'm just coming to do and pick him pick my money and run away i mean that's where we'll be highly disappointed that's where you see that when there are uh price changes you don't have the money again but you should always for instance fertilizers uh this year i mean it goes between 350 to 450 or 500 guaranteed cities at least next year you should be thinking that fertilizers will go around 450 to 650 so you make your projections within that and then as you harvest and then you are selling and then you are solving other problems you should be thinking of the farm okay because the farm is your business so if you spend everything and then you think that next year maybe prices of fertilizers are coming down no no you will laugh at the wrong side of your mouth so you should always think that your your farm is your business and every business needs to grow and you must always reinvest in the business for instance even if you are doing an importation i believe when you go and buy a container full of a particular product from china or turkey or anywhere you'll be thinking that by next year i should be buying three or four containers in addition to the to the one you started with so in farming too it's just like that okay when you are investing only hundred thousand or one million galaxies you should expect that in the next four or five years as you invest in either five or six million than that cities and that's how it should be viewed right but not i'm just coming to do farming i believe it's rosy i'm just coming to pick the money i mean you know you farm and then you sow and then when the crops are out you harvest and then you take your money and go and spend next year you come against struggling no we don't do that all right so limit your expectations as you watch all our interviews on joy prime and on youtube minimize your expectation approach experts who have spent many years like this in the farming space to consult and get the guidelines and please if you invest the season and it does not go right that that's not mean that you should quit or say oh farming is not good it's frustrating so i'm quitting that is not it you need to keep up until you win my name is anyanam and when you see me in town remember i'm garnet finest farmer subscribe share the link if you want any further
