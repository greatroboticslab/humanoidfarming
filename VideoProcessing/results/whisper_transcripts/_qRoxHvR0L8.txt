 It's the first week of March, which means it's finally time to start our seeds inside for our outdoor garden. I've been using these indoor seed starting trays for a couple of years and I absolutely love them. This is from Patio Gym and it comes with a set of six, but I just have four here right now. Every single one comes with the tray liner and then the insert where you put your seeds and then it comes with the dome. It also comes with these little gardening tools. How cute! And then also plant markers so you can mark what each thing is. Now to make these mini greenhouses, it comes with these little LED lights and they snap right on and then you just plug it in and it's even adjustable for ventilation. Watch. Bam. There's the holes. Now you can ventilate. There's holes in the seed trays so when you water it, the excess water goes down into the bottom trays. Isn't that so cool? And because the kit comes with six and each one holds 12 seedlings, that's 72 plants you can start indoors. The entire kit costs less than 30 bucks on Amazon. If you want the link to this comment, the word plant below and I'll send it to you. Happy homesteading!
