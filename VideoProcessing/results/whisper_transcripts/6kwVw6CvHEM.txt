 Growing a garden and raising animals are a big part of life as a homesteader. But if that's all we did, would it be enough? Does homesteading encompass more than just being self-sufficient in food production or less reliant on electricity? What if it's something more, more than the obvious? Oh, it's a wondrous life, living off the land, what God has provided. Hello my friends, welcome back to the Southern Homestead. Background noises, sorry, my grandson is here with me. And I have just returned from the Homesteading Festival in Tennessee. I've been gone for about a week and my garden has absolutely exploded. There's so many vegetables that are ready for the picking. So my grandbaby and I are going to be picking a little bit of tomatoes and some green beans and cucumbers and whatever else might be ready. I am shocked at the size of these tomatoes. I am shocked at the size of the most beautiful tomatoes. It's so disheartening when you have the most beautiful tomatoes and the worms have gotten to them. But nothing goes to waste here on the farm. There's such a wealth of knowledge in all these homesteaders who have been doing this for so many years. Even though my husband and I have been living on our homestead for about 20 years now. I mean, I think we were homesteading. We didn't even know we were homesteading. But to learn from these people was such an amazing experience. And I thought maybe I'd share some of their tips with you. I've compiled some snippets from a few of my favorites, my mentors in the homesteading world. And I wanted to share that with you guys. I was fortunate enough to meet some of my favorites and able to get pictures and all the things. I felt like such a groupie. But these people have such a vast knowledge of how to grow food and how to grow it naturally, which is something that we strive for here on our farm. But besides the obvious, how to raise chickens for eggs or how to milk a cow or even how to grow large juicy tomatoes. They were able to share some wisdom, some tips, some things that are maybe not so obvious when it comes to homesteading. And I'll share those with you right here. Just making my way to the main gate at the Homesteading Festival in Columbia, Tennessee. Just making my way to the main gate at the Homesteading Festival in California, Tennessee. Creating a counterculture family. If life is a river and everybody else is going the easy route, swimming upstream takes a lot of effort. of effort because the more people that are going downstream the stronger that current gets so to create a family that can swim upstream takes some intention and thought and effort and this is not about homesteading it's about the hearts of your family it doesn't matter how much raw milk they drink and let me tell you we love our raw milk but that's not going to save any souls raw milk doesn't have any eternal value it gives you life today here physical life but it doesn't have any eternal value September 24 1982 I walked out of the newspaper office and said goodbye every single person in the world thought we were nuts never went out to eat we never went on a vacation we never went the farm was our vacation it's through relationship that people desire to be close to you and when they're close to you you influence them so how do you build relationship with your family the number one way relationships are built shared experiences I'm not talking about big Disney vacations I'm talking about the kind of shared experiences that nobody remembers because they happen they're mundane they happen every day and they're not these big flashy moments it's just the sitting at this dinner table eating together day after day after day that is how you create a counterculture family when we milk our cows one of the the two of the reasons we don't use a milking machine is I want to sit opposite the cow with one of my children they milk on one side I'll milk on the other because shared experiences is how you build relationship and your children are not aware of this and they're not even focused on this they could care less it's your job to create these moments that build relationship whatever it is but I tell you eating meals together that is one of the fastest ways to build relationship convenience ain't cheap and as soon as you buy single ingredient you start saving a lot of money you don't have to eat out as soon as you start doing this you'll never get better food than you get in your own kitchen make your own convenience food you can do pre-coated chicken you can do canned meat you can do leftovers I mean my signature when I do foodie foodie conferences and stuff in the urban sector I say you know how you know you're one of us eat leftovers oh oh it's a wondrous life living off the land what god has provided oh oh it's a beautiful thing oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
