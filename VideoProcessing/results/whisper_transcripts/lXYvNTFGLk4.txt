 Hi everyone, I'm Ariane Fuchs and I am part of Deutsche Telekom IoT. I'm joined today by Anna Valverde, Export Manager of Hydro-Conta. Thank you for joining us today. Hydro-Conta has designed a revolutionary system for smart meters to control water resources. How did you come up with this idea? Hydro-Conta is a Spanish company. We are located in Spain. Originally, since 38 years ago, we are water meters and remote control systems for agriculture. So, when seven years ago we decided to start to work on the human consumption market, we realized that the IoTs were already present on these systems and we decided to take it. In the agriculture sector there was no digitalization regarding the water management. Now we are able to read remotely these water meters and control these valves. Every time that we install this kind of system, we find a reduction of 20% in the use of water. And most important, around 50% of reduction in the energy that this water consumes coming from pumping. So, water as a resource can of course be connected to the concept of sustainability. What does sustainability mean to Hydro-Conta? Water is a resource that we need to take care of. There is no many water in the world. And the water that we have, the fresh water we have, 70% of this water is used for agriculture. It means that we need to really take control of it. The control of the water makes us more aware of the use of the resource and helps us to reduce it. So, Hydro-Conta is working with the Internet of Things. How exactly did IoT help you with this? Well, the fact that there is such a global coverage. So, the final user finds it very friendly to just take and install the system and start to work. Another benefit of this technology is the fact that the data transmission uses very low battery. And finally, the way the data is transmitted is quite good for us too in both senses. So, it's quite an advantageous technology. Anna, thank you so much for your time and for your insights.
