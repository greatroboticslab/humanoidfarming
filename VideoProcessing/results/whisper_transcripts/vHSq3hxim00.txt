Science & Technology
 Look at this. Farmers in Thailand lay down the rice straw at the base of chili plants, which saves them time and helps with weed control. In the meantime, the laid down straw decomposes and becomes fertilizer for the plants. Due to this, the yield of chilies is very good. Then these chilies are harvested using small harvesting machines and loaded into trucks. These chilies are then cleaned and sold in the markets.
