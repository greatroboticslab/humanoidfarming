 for machinery maintenance hello I am Rodrigo de Leon jr. Bato A so today I am here because I need to clean the treasure machine first so we need to clean the treasure after harvesting to minimize losses owing to shattering of grains clean your let tissue grains immediately to preserve the stability in dry smelling quality I vetted it I realized that you need to look down also no wall I am places that you want to go toюсь more quickly like this www.myd Thank you. As you can see here I am fixing the bolt because I say that some of the bolts were loosened so what I did was tighten it well. It's empty of oil. It might still malfunction. That's why we need to check it. We need to check the oil of the treasure machine equipment. Maybe it has run out of oil so we can put it on so that if we use it there will be no problem. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
