 Hello, I'm State Representative Jeff Spiegelman. With the recent Delaware State Fair, it seems like an appropriate time to reflect on Delaware's farmland preservation program. Our state's effort to permanently preserve farm acreage by acquiring its development rights is nationally recognized. According to state officials, more than 115,000 acres on nearly 800 farms have thus far been preserved. But this successful program is being threatened by repeated raids on its funding. In his last three recommended capital budgets, Governor Jack Markell designated just $2 million annually for farmland preservation. In fiscal year 2012, he recommended no funding at all. Under state law, the Farmland Preservation Fund is supposed to receive $10 million annually from the state's realty transfer tax revenue. But that law is being cynically ignored. Lawmakers have tried to restore the funding, sometimes without success. The Farmland Preservation Fund is a major part of the state's leading industry, and our state needs to maintain a critical mass of farmland in order to keep it viable. About a quarter of Delaware's land is already developed. Less than 40% remains in farming. Since 2002, Delaware has lost more than 31,000 acres of farmland. Our state missed an opportunity to get the biggest bang for its buck by not fully funding the program during the recession, when the growth of development and the cost of buying permanent easements was curtailed. Governor Markell needs to follow state law and provide Delaware's farmland preservation program with a predictable source of funding to protect agriculture, the $8 billion in economic activity it generates, and the 30,000 Delaware jobs it provides.
