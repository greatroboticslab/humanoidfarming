Howto & Style
 Today we are going to be talking about two heavy duty fencing staplers, the Dewalt and the Milwaukee. Both of these are designed to make stapling fire fence quick and easy but they do have some key differences. The Milwaukee is slightly heavier, hats harder and faster. Additionally when fully charged with a 5 ampere battery for example, can fire roughly twice as many staples as the Dewalt on a full charge. The Dewalt on the other hand is lighter but still packs plenty of punch and is a great option too. Both the Dewalt and Milwaukee are powerful fishing tools that make stapling fire fence a breeze. In short both these tools are great options and whichever you choose you'll be able to tackle the job of these. So whether you are a farmer or contractor either of these staplers are a fine addition to your collection.
