Education
 The Regenerative Organic Certification is a three-part certification holding the highest standards for soil health, animal welfare, and farm worker fairness. We have to think beyond just the soil and the plant. We have to think about the people who need to think about the animals. The generational thing is kind of an important thing too, you know, it's leaving the land better for the Haas family, but there's more than one family that are multi-generational here now. Regenerative Organic Certified ensures to your neighbors, to the industry, to your consumers, that your farm workers, subcontracted or not, are treated fairly. They receive fair pay and a living wage. They understand their rights as farm workers in the industry and that they work in a clean and safe environment. They have to be very good. Building soil has been the foundation of this vineyard since day one. Composting, cover cropping, running animals through the vineyard. All of this creates more organic matter in the soil, more microbial activity in the soil, healthier soil, and a more expressive end product in the body. The third pillar of the third pillar of the third pillar of the third pillar of the Regenerative Organic Certification has to do with our animal welfare. Here at Tablas Creek, we focus on the five freedoms. Freedom from hunger. Freedom from pain, injury, and disease. Freedom from discomfort. Freedom from fear and distress. Freedom to express normal behavior. Freedom from pain to pain. Thank you. All of our animals are grass fed, raised on pasture. Never confined. That means no CAFO. We always provide suitable shelter in case of storm. And basically the most important thing to know is that this certification protects our animals, it protects our people, and it protects the land. Okay, it's pretty simple. Organic farming. Take it to the next level is regenerative farming. Completely doable. We don't have to change that much of what we're doing. We have to be more thoughtful. Being forced to be more thoughtful is always a good thing. That's a great thing about the ROC. Tablas Creek is proud to be the first regenerative organic certified vineyard in the world.
