 Hello, I'm Katie Brandt with the MSU Student Organic Farm and Organic Farmer Training Program. Today we're going to be talking about the map of Michigan beginning farmer resources that I've been working over the winter to create. So as you look at it, there's about 70 programs listed, you can't see them all at this scale. But a couple I want to highlight the purple tree icons are land access opportunities. The red dollar symbols are money and credit and funding opportunities. The green barns are farms with hands on training opportunities. The yellow check marks are food hubs and marketing opportunities. And those gray stars are also really important. Those are advocacy organizations and they may be doing several of the of the of the things listed in the other categories. So to check out the map of how we can overcome some of those barriers. We're going to go to msuorganicfarm.org forward slash map. And this has information about the map, how to share it, how to create your own map. So it's very easy for me to duplicate the full map and then edit out or delete out listings that are no longer relevant. I'm working with my farm link here in Michigan to make one that is focused on land access, for example. From here, you can click on this. And one of the challenges with Google Earth is it's slow to load. And so I have zoom going. You can see I have a lot of windows open on my computer. I do have pretty good internet speed. So this would be perhaps a typical amount of time to wait for the Google Earth to load. Once it's loaded, I found it works very quickly. And that's one of the pieces of feedback that we've gotten from the survey so far. So my screen looks slightly different than yours because I'm the editor of this. But once you get in, you can click on present just like I did. And the first lists out the icon types that I talked about on the first slide and has information about where to take the survey, how to contact me. That's just at BrantK7 at MSU.edu. Then you can just begin the tour. So to go alphabetically through the programs, you start with Allen Neighborhood Center and the Hunter Park Garden House. With any of these that has a video, you just click on the video. A pop up will appear. The Garden House is really big on sustainability, obviously environmental sustainability, but also the equity side. And a lot of these are really great videos where you get good insights into what the organization is doing. In addition to that, I have a listing often with links that take you to the specific information that you're looking for. Typically, I've got the name of the organization, a web link, and then beginning farmer programs listed below. So you can just kind of keep moving through the programs in this way. Alternatively, what you can do is use the table of contents. And so you could find, you know, oh, I'm interested in the dairy grazing apprenticeship program. And this is a good example of a program that is spread out across the state. So the Kellogg Biological Station is the is the workspace for the coordinator of the program. But there's farms in in four or more counties around the state that are hosting this. This apprenticeship program. So another thing that you can do that's really nice. We're going to go to Drew Farm and Detroit School Garden Collaborative, another awesome program. And and from here, if you just wanted to check out. Oh, wrong way. If you just wanted to check out farms and beginning farmer resources in the Detroit area, you could zoom out. Do so a little more quickly on your phone, probably, and find whatever you're looking for Detroit Land Bank Authority, for example. I hope that you have an opportunity to check out and use and share this map of Michigan beginning farmer resources. The links are here. You can use the direct link to add it to a website, email newsletter, however you reach out to your circle of farmers. And we also have the MSU organic farm dot org forward slash map link that you can use. I encourage everyone to use the survey to share your feedback as well as thoughts on programs we may have missed. I'd love to add those in. A big thank you to North Central SARE for supporting the development of the map of Michigan beginning farmer resources. And I'd also like to encourage folks to consider being a part of the organic farmer training program. This is a 50-50 mix of hands on learning in the field and interactive learning in the classroom. Folks have the opportunity to visit 20 or more sustainable and organic farms here in Michigan, to write a business plan and to network with others in the program and with the farmers they visit. Another great opportunity is the Michigan Sustainable Farm Mentors Program. And this is also funded by SARE. This is a SARE partnership grant. And we've paired seven amazing, experienced, sustainable farmers with beginning and aspiring farmers around the state. So you can do this virtually by phone or Zoom to get the input you need to get your farm started. The last thing I'll say is SARE offers grants, the Farmer Rancher Grant, youth grants, that may be helpful for you in meeting your farm goals. Thanks so much.
