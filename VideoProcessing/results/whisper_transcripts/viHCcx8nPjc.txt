 Thank you for having me and it's exciting to be able to talk about some of the work that we've been doing here at the LSU Ag Center related to New and Beginning Farmers and some of the resources and just some general things that folks need to know related to how to get started. And so I'm just going to go ahead and jump right into the presentation. I'll give a little background about some of the things and what our program is about. The Grow Louisiana Beginning Farmer Training Program is a program that's funded by the USDA McGinning Farmer and Rancher Development Grant. And what we do is we seek to develop revenue generating farm businesses and we put a key emphasis on revenue generating because there are many different aspects of how people can and want to get engaged in local food systems. And so we focus on those revenue generating farms. We're based in the southeast region of Louisiana right now and again you know we focus on socially disadvantaged underrepresented groups and veterans are the primary focus of who we target. But we but we specifically focus on horticulture and specialty crops and so getting folks involved and active in growing fruits and vegetables. Just our program goals in an education program where we look at technical business and hands-on training and also mentoring for doing beginning farmers. And so the outcome of what we're trying to do here is one, increase fruit and vegetable production in producers in the state, increase agriculture diversity in Louisiana with the types and the amount of different crops that are grown here in this state, increase the availability of local produce that's found in communities, but also increase consumption in local communities. As we all know, you know, Louisiana typically ranks towards the bottom when we when we look at various health metrics. And so by increasing the amount of local produce and increasing access to healthful foods, we hope to be able to play our role in combating that and combating that in communities. Just a little quick background about how we structure our program and the focus of our program. When we're looking at the notion of food access, to me and from an economic perspective, food access means how well the agri-food system meets the needs of consumers. And so when we're training our producers, we focus on primarily two aspects of the food system. The function of growing food, but also the function of selling food. And we do that in a way where where, you know, we start off with direct marketing, whether you're selling at farmers markets and you have an established CSA program. We start there and then provide folks the tools necessary if you want to scale up to again be able to sell to say grocery stores and other distribution networks. But our primary focus is working right now with market farmers, market gardeners and folks that are interested in selling direct to consumer via a number of different channels. One of the most exciting things about this program is we have a real focus on farmer networking information sharing. And so we've developed here in the southeast corner of the state, this collaborative regional alliance for farmer training. And so this is organized and led by farmers here here in the region. They facilitate on farm training opportunities. We have a number of interns and apprentices that actually work on farms right now in the area, networking and mentoring. And so this is centered around experience based learning. And so this is supplemental to classroom instruction that we do in our program. But we really focus on, you know, getting people out on farms, getting that real that real experience on the farms. And it's exciting for us. So why are new and beginning farmers important in getting getting you engaged in agriculture? We have to be able to develop the next generation of farmers. You know, we have an aging farmer network. And so we have to be able to really replace those farmers in building community based food systems. And so so communities can have and be able to feed themselves. The other part of that is being able to diversify agriculture in the food system and to do this by connecting folks that are new, no experience beginning with, you know, a small amount of experience. We have to be able to connect those folks with experienced farmers to gain the necessary experience. And so we want to bring back the notion of growing family farms and diversity in the type of crops that we grow that we grow all go into this. And it's interesting to me because if we look at agriculture and we look at the food system, we look at the development of new and beginning farmers. All of this goes into this notion of community economic development and agriculture and food system development can be playing an integral part. And economic development for communities. The other part of this is that agriculture and farming and being engaged in these areas is important at the individual level because there's physical health aspects of it. There's mental health aspects of it. But there's also the output of it leads to increased nutritional health within our communities. And so that's why it's important to get folks engaged in farming and in the food system and developing new and beginning farmers. There are many opportunities for new and beginning farmers. At the end of the day, the simple thing would make agriculture, you know, agriculture and farming won't be a dying field because at the end of the day, consumers and folks have to eat. What we do know about consumers is that consumers have very diverse palates. And so the type of foods, the amount of foods, the variety of foods, all of that differs across various consumer segments, which provides opportunities for new and beginning farmers to grow a variety of things and to try new things and to be able to meet that consumer demand. Across the nation, there's a local, there's a growing movement in local and regional foods. And so people are now interested in more so now than ever in knowing where their food is coming from. And so the impact of COVID-19 has led to a lot of opportunities. And that's where people are actually concerned with, one, where their food is coming from. And two, they actually want to know and build relationships with the individuals that are growing their foods. There are plenty of opportunities in alternative horticulture and specialty crop and livestock production systems. And that provides not only diversity in the type of crops that are grown, but it also adds to the diversity of the palates of consumers and being able to grow different types of crops that are grown by virtue of different methods that consumers find interesting. And so that provides another opportunity for new and beginning farmers. There's also growth in demand for organics and other sustainably grown methods. And so when you go, when you're selling at farmers markets or you're selling with CSAs, you get to have those direct conversations with consumers about the growing methods that you're using on your farm. And so you're able to then meet the demand for more organically or sustainably grown produce. There's also opportunities for alternative markets and market availability of locally grown produce. And so we see the rise and the increase of farmers markets in CSAs, the community-supported agriculture models. We have great models and examples of that here in the southeast corner of the state, particularly in New Orleans. There's some very successful farmers markets. We have a very successful farmers market here in Baton Rouge. But also we have some very successful CSA community-supported agriculture models. Farmers like River Queen Green in New Orleans, but also Foodness Organic Farm here in Baton Rouge, where consumers buy into a subscription over, say, 8 or 12 weeks. And each week, based upon a payment at the beginning of the growing season, each week those farmers provide those consumers with a box of produce. And that's something that, you know, around the country that's been very successful and is now coming into the marketplace here in Louisiana. And people are very excited about that. Also, what we see, particularly in urban areas, is the availability of nontraditional agricultural land. And that's by virtue of a lot of need. Most of our beginning farmers don't have access to traditional agricultural lands. And so they're taking existing lands and turning it into agricultural lands. And so this helps not only in community development, but it makes use of vacant land in communities. And it's very exciting for our farmer base that simply don't have access to traditional agricultural lands. There are a number of threats to new and beginning farmers that most folks have to overcome is access to capital resources. You know, you have to deal with limited land access and inflation, whereas, you know, available land, you're competing with, say, real estate development. And so that's a real threat to developing agriculture and food systems around the country. Most folks coming into this don't have traditional agricultural backgrounds or have access to traditional capital and resources to access agriculture. So being able to access credit and financing to purchase land, to access capital and financing to purchase the capital equipment that's needed to develop farm infrastructure is a threat to new and beginning farmers. Knowledge. Most folks that are coming into agriculture and the food system don't have traditional ag backgrounds. And so they are having to go out and find information and being able to find support networks to help them to help them to be successful. Limited market access. And in most cases, we have to be able to confront the historical racial and gender inequities that we've seen traditionally throughout agriculture. And then the last piece is respect. You know, we have farmers that are growing on a fourth of an acre and a half an acre and have very successful profitable business models. And those folks are competing for respect in a marketplace, whereas you look in the northeast corner of the state, we have cotton, corn and soy producers that are growing on hundreds of acres. And so, you know, there's a level of respectability in the marketplace that a lot of our new and beginning farmers are having to overcome. But, you know, this provides opportunities and it's exciting to be able to welcome people into this arena. You know, so how does one get started in this? Doing a lot of research and reading and finding. There are a number of different resources that are available. I provide you a list of some resources that I oftentimes direct farmers and new beginning farmers to use. But doing your research, reading, there are a number of different books out there that we can provide that information as well. But the second piece is writing a business plan. This all starts. You have to seriously sit down and think through the process of what are you trying to create. And so writing that business plan is important. Getting business advice and support, not only from organizations like the LSU Ag Center and the Southern Ag Center, but also talking to existing farmers. And then, you know, taking that advice and seeking out trainings, like our beginning farmer training program here at the LSU Ag Center. And before I wrap up here, I'll talk about two other beginning farmer training programs in the state that provide great information to develop farmers. And then go through the process of setting up your business and identifying financing for your business is important as well. And so those are, you know, and this information here can be found via the USDA, www.newfarmers.usda.gov has a list of resources and steps that new and beginning farmers can go through in order to start that business. Key thing, and I have to make this point clear for new and beginning folks that don't have access to land. The question that I get is, is there a grant available to help me start my farm? And the short, realistic answer to that is no. Nobody is going to give you money to start a farm. And so you're going to have to go through financial planning and saving and go through actual loan processes in many cases to get money for operating expenses. And so there are, you know, cost share programs through the USDA and other entities, but those programs are more capital oriented to get your, get an existing farm to take it to the next level. But generally speaking, there's no free money that's going to be out there to help an individual start a farm. And so you have to go through that planning process yourself. What's happening around you, the LSU Ag Center, you know, we have a number of different resources from production to finances to help folks get started or to be successful in farming. The Louisiana Vegetable Production Guide, Dr. Kiki Fontenot typically spearheads that it's a great document and a great baseline document for production. Also, the work that the folks in Alexandria at Cleta are doing with their beginning farmer training initiatives and their marketing initiatives are very helpful. And I encourage people to make use of those resources. There are a couple organizations down in New Orleans, the Recirculating Farms Coalition and Sprout and NOLA have programming and webinars and publicly available information to help people get started. Another organization that I work with is Groundswell Center. It's out of Ithaca, New York, but they do have training resources and information available to assist new and beginning farmers along their journey. And the last two organizations that I'll reference here, the Carolina Farm Stewardship Association and Georgia Organic are great organizations. And they've done a great job within both North Carolina and Georgia with, you know, helping new and beginning farmers and getting folks situated to be successful in fruit and vegetable production. And so those are resources that I, you know, I encourage people to look into and to take advantage of the public information that's available on those organizational websites. And with that, you know, we have our beginning farmer training program here at LSU AgCenter. We're in the middle of our third and final cohort. And so we won't be doing any more training classes, but we will have a number of different webinars and other workshops that will take place throughout the spring and the summer. And then we will certainly, you know, make the dates and the information based upon those trainings publicly available to anyone that would like that information. And with that, I thank you for this time. And certainly if you have questions about any of the steps, I know it's a lot of information in a short time. Please feel free to reach out to me via email and we can chat a little bit more about it. Thanks, Marcus. We appreciate you. Thank you.
