 This is a spring wheat field in kind of a reduced tillage operation so that's why you see some more fall residue left over. Farmers around here we usually do fall wheat, spring wheat, and a fallow or a pulse rotation which kind of allows for integrated management of both herbicides and to manage our pests more efficiently. Out west in the drier areas we'll see farmers will just do maybe a fall wheat or fall canola to fallow rotation but spring wheat allows farmers around here to to utilize some of the spring spring moisture without the commitment of a fall crop. This is a good example of a little baby wheat plant growing. Typically fall wheat will yield more than spring wheat but the spring wheat just allows us to utilize different herbicides as well as it cleans up a lot of grassy weeds by allowing us to clean them up clean them up before we go out and plant the spring wheat.
