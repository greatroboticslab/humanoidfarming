 SHINY PAINT AND NEW IRON ARE LIKE MAGNETS TO FARMERS, AND FARM SHOWS AND DEALERSHIPS ARE LIKE TOY STORES. IT CAN BE HARD TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION OF THAT NEW CAB SMELL. BUT WHEN YOU REALLY WANT A NEW PIECE OF EQUIPMENT, IT CAN BE SO EASY TO RATIONALIZE THE BENEFITS OF TAKING THAT RIG HOME. COLIN MILLER, A CHARTERED ACCOUNTANT WITH KPMG AND LETHRIDGE, ALWAYS TELLS HIS CLIENTS THEY NEED TO BE REALLY HONEST WITH THEMSELVES WHEN CONSIDERING AN EQUIPMENT PURCHASE. IS IT REALLY GOING TO ADHANCE THE PROFITABILITY OF THE FARM? IF THE ANSWER IS YES, IS BUYING THE UNIT THE RIGHT DECISION WHEN OTHER OPTIONS EXIST? LEASING EQUIPMENT MEANS LOWER PAYMENTS FOR EASIER CASH FLOW. AND OF COURSE LEASE PAYMENTS ARE OFTEN 100% TAX-DEDUCTIBLE. FOR SOME TYPES OF EQUIPMENT THIS IS THE WAY TO GO. WHILE LEASING CAN BE A GOOD OPTION, MILLER SAYS BUYING EQUIPMENT OUTRIGHT SOMETIMES GETS A BAD RAP. IT CAN BE THE RIGHT CALL. DON'T FORGET THAT YOU CAN WRITE OFF THE INTEREST COSTS ON A PURCHASE LOAN AND EVENTUALLY YOU CAN WRITE OFF THE PURCHASE AMOUNT TOO, JUST NOT ON A MONTHLY BASIS LIKE A LEASE. YOU CAN DEDUCT THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER SEVERAL YEARS AS A CAPITAL COST ALLOWANCE. BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALL OF THE CAPITAL COST ALLOWANCE EVERY YEAR. THAT GIVES YOU MORE FLEXIBILITY IN TAX PLANNING. IF THE EQUIPMENT IS GOING TO BE USED VERY INTENSIVELY FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE REPLACEMENT, CONSIDER LEASING. AN EXAMPLE MIGHT BE A SELF-PROPELLED FORAGE HARVESTER USED IN A CUSTOM WORK ENTERPRISE. THERE ARE NO DEFINITIVE RIGHT OR WRONG ANSWERS FOR THE LEASE VERSUS BUY DECISION. IT CAN EVEN CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR. YOUR ACCOUNTANT CAN HELP YOU ASSESS THE OVERALL TAX BURDEN FOR THE CURRENT YEAR, AS THIS CAN HAVE A BEARING ON WHETHER YOU BUY OR LEASE. YOU MAY WANT TO STRUCTURE A DEAL THAT PROVIDES A MAXIMUM TAX BENEFIT. FOR INSTANCE, IT MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE TO LEASE OR RENT A NEW PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THROUGH TO YOUR FISCAL YEAR END AND THEN PURCHASE IT THE NEXT YEAR. HIRING A CUSTOM OPERATOR IS THE THIRD OPTION. TO ASSESS THIS OPTION, YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOUR COST PER ACRE IS FOR BOTH OWNERSHIP AND LEASING THE EQUIPMENT. THIS ALLOWS A FAIR COMPARISON. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SIMPLE ANSWER ON THE BUY, LEASE OR HIRE DEBATE, IT DOESN'T EXIST. THE RIGHT CHOICE CAN BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH FARM AND CAN CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR. SITTING DOWN WITH YOUR ACCOUNTANT AND UNDERSTANDING THE IMPLICATIONS OF EACH CHOICE FOR YOUR FARM IS A GOOD PLACE TO START. THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR YOUR FARM IS A GOOD PLACE TO START. THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR YOUR FARM IS A CLEANIST AND BEEN simY STOLEN SHOT AND modernIST MENSHIP BEEN. MY MENTI MICHIL Image
