Growing and Harvesting of Cotton

Howto & Style
 So here in north central Oklahoma our operation operates on a no-till program and this field was in grain sorghum before and we came in and sprayed to kill any volunteer wheat, rye grass, any winter annuals and came in and planted this cotton in May. So during the summertime we have a lot of insect pressure. You might have to spray two or three different times for insects, leafhoppers. Once the bowl develops you might have some stink bug pressure that you have to spray just to keep that bowl safe before it becomes cotton. So before the bowl opens it's all closed similar to this bowl right here and when this opens there's seed inside this bowl that will be future-ginned after harvesting. But the bowl is the fruit of the plant. Probably about two to three weeks before a freeze we use a product called Effathon that will in turn open the bowl. It's a harvest aid along with a defoliant to knock the leaves off the plant whether you're going to strip it or pick it. The foliant more or less crushes the leaves and you'll see the leaves that more or less knocks the leaves off the plant. This is for the stripper or your picker to not have any leaves in your cotton bale after it is produced in the module. And we strip this cotton here. It does have a lot more material in the bale stripping it but in turn we feel like it gets more of the cotton off the plant. Although with stripping you don't have to have water as a picker requires water to keep the spindles. So after it's harvested they, we use a stripper baler is what it's called and it puts it in an 8x8 round bale which weighs anywhere from 4,000 to 5,000 pounds. And then from here we haul them 100 miles northwest to Anthony, Kansas to a gin up there where it will be further processed. After the cotton is ginned, your cotton is graded on a scale to see strength, durability, and anything that, you know, color, what colors you can dye the cotton to. But then the seed is ginned out to make cattle feed, oils, so many different products go into cotton. We hope you enjoyed this video. It's part of our Oklahoma Gardening YouTube channel.
