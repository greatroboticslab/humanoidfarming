When Buds Get Jarred Too Fast - Curing Errors

Howto & Style
 Hello everybody, welcome to Lex's World. Hope you're all doing well. And look at what we have here. Just a bunch of very, very lovely buds. And yes, this is in fact the slurricane from the other video. And why do I have it all laid out like this? Well, it's actually because I'm trying to fix a little bit of a curing and drying oopsie daisy. So as you guys know, the slurricane grow wasn't actually mine. It belonged to somebody else. And what's interesting is this person had to chop down, hang to dry, and then suddenly leave town very, very quickly and relatively unexpectedly. And as a result, these buds ended up getting cured and placed into their burping jars a little bit too quickly. And when I discovered these, they basically had humidity levels inside the jars, these jars right here, of about 90% between burps. That is a dangerously high humidity level. That's the kind of thing that could lead to mold. And these were so moist that all of these buds were kind of like clumped together into one giant bud. That all had to be separated. And so I'm laying them out like this. And what should happen is they will drop down to a sub-70% humidity. And once they do that and they're a little bit drier, I can put them right back in their burping jars and resume the daily burping. So yeah, if you do feel like you've put your cannabis into their burping jars too early, just do that. Don't wait until you're smelling ammonia inside the jar because it's quite easy to do this and not to overdo it, not to over dry them when they're out like this. Just make sure that the humidity doesn't get too, too low. And I know you guys are all going to ask me about these teeny tiny little hydrometers slash thermometers. They're pretty cool, actually. They operate on just a couple little batteries. Pretty neat. And they're so tiny that they can easily fit inside a curing jar. So I'll try to link to these down in the description. But in the meantime, I'm going to keep at this. Hopefully these buds will be okay.
