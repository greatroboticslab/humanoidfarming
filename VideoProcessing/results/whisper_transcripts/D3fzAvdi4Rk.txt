 music I'm going to talk about three invasive pests that have come into our area I'm going to start off with the first one which is probably going to be the most important and then the next one is it's going to be somewhat important and then finally the third one is only important if you grow a certain crop and we'll discuss that when I get to that third one all these have come in in the last two or three years this one right here, the spider-winged drosophila how many have heard of the spider-winged drosophila? oh, okay, not many of you how many people have any kind of fruit? okay, any blackberries, raspberries, anything like that strawberries? how many strawberry growers? okay this particular pest is going to be a problem in all your small fruit and somewhat in your strawberries but we're not quite sure with the strawberries but I'll discuss that as we go along here okay the spider-winged drosophila is a vinegar fly I normally would call these a fruit fly and I think most other people would call them a fruit fly they look like fruit fly but technically they're called vinegar flies so guess what kind of smell they're attracted to? oh, very good, excellent they're called vinegar flies because they like things that are starting to rot starting to break down and that's sort of what we term fruit flies because fruit flies are usually around things that are rotting starting to break down and that's where they lay their eggs and once they lay their eggs, eggs hatch and they start to feed on that rotting material but this is a different species drosophila suzuki it's closely related to drosophila melanogoster and that's the one that we probably see around our fruit all the time if you've got bananas that have been sitting a little bit too long and you have a little fly flying around it it's probably this drosophila right here and we're going to see what makes this drosophila so much different and where it come from alright this is what the fly looks like up close this is the male right here the female, I'll show you here in a second does not have any spots on its wing so you see where it gets its name spotted wing enemologists are nothing more than clever if nothing else so they like to give real common names to things like spotted wing or blue bellied something or something like that so this has two large spots on its wing there's nothing else magical about these males this is about the only thing the males are not the problem the females are one problem you might run into if you start catching these and you're interested in monitoring for these this year on your farm I did not bring it in with me today but I have it out in my truck traps so anybody's interested in a trap I can give you two or three traps if you want you only have to supply the bait which is real inexpensive so you might want to think about that as I go through this but there are other flies drosophila flies that you can see have spots on their wings and a lot of times what you'll see in these traps that's why I'm getting to the traps is a mess of drosophila vinegar flies in these traps and so what you're going to need to do is pick out the ones that are spotted wing and the ones that aren't because the ones that are not spotted wing aren't going to give you any problem only the ones that are spotted wing only this one species is going to give you some problems and it just takes a little bit of practice you'll get used to it you can see one right here and you see the spots on its wings and so you'll be able to pick that out fairly easily if you look here's another one with the spots on its wing here's another one what I found is on the western shore of Maryland all through the west, western part of the state, central part of the state and the southern part of the state we found this fly and we just found it this year and every farm that we looked for it we did find it and every farm that we did find it every time the grower said I do not have a problem with this particular pest and in every farm we found it so that tells you it's well disguised and that the damage it does is well disguised and a lot of times you're not going to recognize it you're just going to pass it off as some other kind of damage when in fact the fly is increasing in numbers there's other species of Drosophila that sort of look like spotted wing and this is another species and this is another but you see the spots on this one is probably the closest to spotted wing but you can see it's a little bit further up on the wings while these are a little bit further back and a little larger if you do have a trap and you are trapping and you have any questions about whether or not you have spotted wing you can always bring it to your county educator channel and be glad to identify it for you or you can send it to me, either one again, once you start looking at these and somebody points them out to you a couple of times you'll be able to recognize them fairly easily okay, this is the real problem we have right here this is the female spotted wing Drosophila you can see she has no spots on her wings so you cannot tell a female spotted wing from a non-spotted wing female okay, so they all look the same the secret with the spotted wing is right down here and this is her ovipositor and her ovipositor is much more sclerotized and that just means it's much more heavily armored it's much thicker than the other vinegar flies and she's able to cut her way into fruit that is not damaged at all or is not rotting and so this is the other vinegar fly that's closely related to Drosophila suzuki and you see that the ovipositors look very similar but this one is much heavier than this one and you see the female right here she's taking her ovipositor and she's actually making a saw mark into the fruit and so this fruit is not ripened yet this fly and all the rest of the Drosophila flies cannot penetrate hard fruit it cannot penetrate fruit unless it's already started to rot and most of the time they just lay their eggs right on top of the rotted fruit because the egg will wiggle its way into that area a little bit it will hatch and it will begin to feed on that rotted fruit and that's because the fruit is so rotted it really doesn't put up much of a barrier for the eggs to penetrate into it so this is why she is such a pest she's able to cut into fruit that's just starting to ripen so if you have something like blackberries she'd start to lay her eggs when the blackberries just started to turn red just started to get some color to them but well before they had any kind of ripeness to them this is what a Drosophila egg looks like and all Drosophila eggs look very similar to this you have these two hairs that are hanging out the back and I'll talk more about that in a little bit and this is where a regular Drosophila would lay her eggs it's right on the surface this is where a spotted wing Drosophila lays her eggs it's inside the fruit and so that egg is going to be much more protected than the other eggs that are laid on top this egg inside this is the two tubes I was talking about two hair-like tubes and these tubes are actually breathing tubes and a lot of times the reason they have breathing tubes is because the eggs are oviposited or laid in rotting fruit and if you've ever been in rotting fruit you know it doesn't have any oxygen in it or it doesn't have very much oxygen is all taken up because of the rotting organisms are using that to decay the fruit very rapidly so there's no oxygen left and so in order for these eggs to get oxygen they had to put out these little periscopes if you will snorkels and put it up above the fruit and get their oxygen that way okay so you probably won't see any of these eggs when you're looking they're very small and Drosophila itself is very small but in case you ever see anything and you see these two hairs that look like they're sticking out from the fruit that's what it is all right this is the larvae this is the immatures the eggs hatch and this is what they hatch into they basically hatch into maggots and you can see that this one maggot and the one angle of the shot you see this little tube right here and that's the same sort of thing these maggots can move around inside the rotting fruit and they'll run out of oxygen eventually and so they'll take that little tube and they'll shove it above the surface of the fruit and they'll bring in oxygen and then they'll go back into the fruit so this way they don't the rest of their body does not have to be above the fruit they can just send that little periscope up and get some oxygen okay all right now we'll look at the life cycle spotted wing Drosophila as most Drosophila over winter as adult usually adult females they prefer moderate cool or wet climates and we're going to find that these wet climates are real important as to whether or not they're going to be a pest in your particular fruit okay adults live for about one to two months so there's a very fast turnover of these there could be 10-12 generations a year in our area and does anybody know what happens or what is more likely to happen when you have a lot of generations in one year what is that pest able to be able to do as far as pesticides are concerned anybody adapt okay good they're able to become resistant to pesticides and so that's what we're fearing about this spotted wing Drosophila is that there's only there's four or five pesticides that only one of which is organic and so we're afraid that these pesticides are going to be overused and these flies are going to become quickly resistant to most of the pesticides and when that happens we're going to be in real trouble they're already real difficult to control even with pesticides okay so the adults live for a very short period of time females can lay two to six hundred eggs in a fruit and she starts to do that as soon as it starts to turn color but she prefers that there be a larger sugar content in that fruit so as the fruit shows more color and begins to ripen up more and more she will lay more and more of her eggs and her eggs and her larvae are better able to compete inside that fruit than the other Drosophila species so they get an earlier start by putting their eggs in the fruit just as it starts to color up and then even when they start at the same time their larvae are more able to survive than other Drosophila larvae okay eggs hatch in one to three days larvae feed in the fruit for about five to seven days then they pupate for anywhere to four to fifteen days four days is probably what happens in August so it's a very quick turnaround period okay they tend to overwinter along the in woods and woods edge and so this is the areas they're going to come out of if you saw the earlier presentation by Cerruti Hooks on brown marmorate stink bug you see that this is the same place that brown marmorate stink bug overwinter is in the woods and so this fly overwinter is in the same spot and so they're going to come out of these woods during the early part of the season and start to infest your crop so what's ever closest to the woods is more likely going to be infested alright these are some trap catches I started trap catching in August we didn't know we have the pest on any of our farms in western Maryland and this is western Maryland somewhere around Frederick a little bit east of that on a lot of farms that produce fruit it's a you pick a lot of you pick operations in that particular area of the state so I went out there and started putting the traps out in these different areas I put them out in woods I put them out in areas near the woods but not up not in the woods then non-crop areas these are places like parking lots and the stand itself that sells the fruit and things like that just see where the flies are going and these are blackberries, cherry trees, raspberries, apples, strawberries, blueberries, and pumpkins and you see in August we have very high numbers on these couple particular farms in the blackberries and the raspberries and these are their two favorite fruit blackberries and raspberries if you don't have blackberries and raspberries they'll take something else and use it but if you have blackberries and raspberries that's what they're going to go to in really high numbers also they were found in blueberries not in real high numbers but in moderate numbers this is September you see the numbers still if you look over here the side this is how many we found per trap per week and so you see the numbers still high even in September and it's still high in blackberries and raspberries even though in September most of the raspberries are done we still have some blackberries being picked but not many most of the growers that I dealt with that had these kind of populations abandoned their fields it's not so much that the damage was really bad it's because when you start to harvest these berries and put them in a little container and then take them up to the fruit stand often times what will happen the maggots will start to come out and so you have maggots crawling around on your fruit when somebody wants to go buy it it usually is not a real good temptation for them to go buy it the other thing is a lot of times these people and this is why they abandoned the field they sold these containers of the fruit they took them home they ate some they put them in the refrigerator and that cold in the refrigerator just drove the maggots out of the fruit by the hundreds and so they go back in there the next morning to look at their berries and they have maggots all over the fruit again not very happy customers and so this is a big problem this is why they abandoned the field they could not tell what some of the berries were infested and which berries were not until they had to open them and that's the trouble with the damage the damage sometimes often times you cannot recognize it and so you have people out there picking the berries and putting them in a container and then bringing them up to the store and these are people who have a lot of experience and these are you pick operations so a lot of the people who don't have as much experience as these other people are just picking berries and not realizing there may be one that's not quite right or not quite right and they end up with a lot of berries that are infested so this is one of the big problems with them is that they infest berries and it's difficult to see if they infested this berry until it's too late and somebody's munching on it you see in September they start to move towards the woods so the area near the woods around the woods are starting to become higher and higher in their population then in October areas around the woods start to become higher in population the area in the woods become higher in population but I'm still picking them up in blackberries and raspberries but now all of a sudden I'm picking them up in apples and apple trees why do you think I'm picking them up in apple trees in late October? anybody want to guess? you didn't know you'd have to participate this afternoon did you? rotted fruit on the ground very good excellent rotted fruit on the ground this is what they're going after in these orchards and you pick places have a tendency to have more rotted fruit than maybe a place that doesn't that is not you pick so the more rotted fruit on the ground the more these flies are going to come in they still act just like regular drosophila flies fruit flies they still want to go for rotting fruit and so that's what makes them so difficult they're able to survive quite nicely on rotted fruit okay but they're also able to switch over to fruit that's not rotted so they can go back and forth okay also you see that their numbers have really come up in pumpkins and again this is late more late towards late October anybody want to guess what's happening in pumpkins late October? he already said it once but rotted pumpkins that's right if you go out to these rotted pumpkin fields and you see some of these rotting pumpkins and you take a sweet net right near the rotting pumpkins you'll come about a third of all the vinegar flies are spotted wing on these farms that have spotted wing on their farm so these spotted wing can spread out and go to a lot of different places and start to reproduce in large numbers and most of the time no one's going to care that they're on rotted fruit and so their numbers are able to continue to climb and increase even though their main things that they feed on like blackberries and raspberries are done for the season but their population continues to increase that's what makes them difficult in November now we're starting to pick them up more in raspberries, apples, blackberries and now in woods their numbers have really gone up in the woods and near woods still high in pumpkins still somewhat in cherries and again it's because the cherries are rotting out in the field okay in December I'm still picking up adults in my traps these traps are only collect adults only adults that can fly and I'm still picking them up in blackberries and raspberries it's not a real good sign okay so if we look at all these you can see how the numbers started off around 140, 120 kept there all through September, October then they were cut in half and then they were cut in half again in December so the numbers are going down but the amazing thing is they're still pretty high even in December so I was real curious to see what was going to happen in January and February so their numbers are really reduced in January but they're still there and they're still in blackberries and raspberries I'm still catching them in blackberries and raspberries so that tells you they're not going to the woods to overwinter they're staying in the blackberry and raspberry fields and soon as these fields start to have fruit that starts to turn color they're going to start to reinfest it in large numbers okay alright February the numbers are starting to go back up and again raspberries and blackberries so they're active they were active all through this winter and this of course this is a winter that we never had so we're curious as to what their numbers are going to be now this past year we saw their numbers really high in August and they probably weren't that high in June but we don't know when they got here we don't know how they overwintered we don't know a lot of different things about them so we know they overwintered pretty well in our area this year and we know they overwintered in the crop that they infested and so they're going to be ready to go next year so that's what has us kind of worried especially out in something like strawberries because these flies will start to come out and be active in April so they're going to they come out real early a little bit earlier than other vinegar flies and they start to lay eggs okay this is the type of damage they can do this is on blackberries and you see you don't see any wiggly things crawling out of these and you're not going to you have to really break these open you have to look pretty hard for them because they're oftentimes they are clear or white and they'll look just like the juice that you're squeezing and so you won't be able to see any but it just looks like some of the berries are maybe rotting a little bit early for some reason a lot of people attributed that to the heat we had and the heat was a problem this year for the berries rotting a little bit too quickly and on raspberries it's even a little more subtle just sort of a few collapsed droplets on the fruit and if you tear open these the fruit you see that they've been feeding on the center of the fruit and so you often see a damage to the center of it and here you see one that's perfectly healthy and here are two vinegar flies on it right there that sort of gives you a size of how big these vinegar flies are they're very tiny and they're hard to see the spotted wings unless you have some kind of 10x hand legs okay this is the damage on cherry and you see a lot more over positioning damage on cherries you see one right here, here, here, and you see a bunch right here and so that again that's the female turning around using her saw-like ovipositor drilling a hole into the cherry and then laying her eggs inside that cherry but the good thing about this is at least you know that the fly's been here and it's infested to fruit if we look back here you don't see any of that you don't see any of that damage on any of the blackberries or raspberries okay this is on strawberry and it's right here and it just looks like a little bruise it's something you might not pay much attention to if you saw it but if you open up the fruit then you get the maggots okay and they're gonna start to rot this fruit maybe a week, two weeks earlier than it normally would have rotted so they do go into strawberries we just don't know how bad yet this is in blueberries again you see a little bit more damage to the blueberries so things like blueberries and cherries you have a tendency to see more damage to the skin than you do some of the other fruit the softer fruit that seems that the ovipositor will go in and then that fruit will close up around that ovipositor scar and you don't see it but you see some of the oviposition spot right here and then all around right here and these are actually right here these are pupae the larvae have pupae inside the fruit so you can see this fruit is still fairly well intact or at least it looks intact so somebody could easily buy that and then get pupae for their breakfast too just to let you know when I was out in these fields I knew were heavily infested in these raspberry fields and I was looking for the flies and doing stuff I ate raspberries I knew they were infested with maggots it doesn't matter you don't taste them and you get a little extra protein you can tell your customers that but it's not going to hurt you but it is creepy if you start seeing them crawling out while you're feeding on them or eating them okay, hoax now these are fields that we found heavy infestations or at least heavy infestations have been found in the past and that's in raspberries, blackberries, cherry, blueberries, strawberry, boysenberry, nectarines, and Japanese plum we also I shouldn't say we but field infestations are also found in grape even apple, pears, plum, and peach now these down here the reason I separated them is because these aren't great hosts and so we don't think they're going to go to them to any great extent but we're just not sure so that's one of the things that we need to watch so if you have any of these fruit on your farm you'll need to watch for spotted wing drosophila this year okay okay, overwinters, adults in the woods we talked about that it's active throughout the season it prefers high humidity and moderate temperatures in the mid-seventies so it doesn't like it real hot it doesn't like it real cold but it still remains active that's what I want you to understand overposition overposition that means laying eggs stops below 50 degrees and above 90 degrees so when we get real hot during the summer they're not going to overposit anymore okay and overwinters even in harsh conditions and I'll show you where it originated from and some of the places where it originated from have extremely hard winters oh, here we are okay what this map shows is the potential for this particular fly to do well in a particular area so the more red or orange an area is the better this fly is going to do and this is where it originated from is Southeast Asia okay, China and you see up here in Korea and Japan all the blue dots means it has been found in these areas in fairly good numbers so they're predicting it's going to do well in Malaysia and it's extremely hot down there and yet they're still predicting it will do well they haven't found it quite yet down there but they expect it to spread down in that area but you can see most of the area it's concentrated in is what? is a more temperate zone area and that's exactly like what we have okay so these are the areas where it's doing well and it's doing well in South Korea and South Korea has bitter winters much worse winters than we have their winters are more like up in Minnesota so their winters are bad and the fly is doing quite well up there alright, this is the United States the same sort of thing as a predictive map about where it's going to do well it first hit the west coast of the United States all along California, Oregon, and Washington and then it turned up over here in Michigan first in Florida and then North Carolina then Virginia and then Michigan then Pennsylvania and now it's in Maryland and it's in Delaware so they haven't updated this map but where's the area in this country where it's predicting not to do well? yes, right here it's right here okay and why do you think it's not predicted to do well in that part of the country? what is different about this part of the country than this part of the country? very good, it's dry this is a very dry area and so the fly does not do well in very dry areas it does very well in very wet, humid areas which is exactly what we have so we think it's going to do pretty well and it's in these states right now and it's just going to spread to all these other states these are different traps that you can use and the trap that I would give you today looks very much like this but without the yellow card in it the one I use is this one over here you can purchase it from a company the reason I like it is it's very small it's easy to handle I get consistent results with it it does a very good job of capturing the flies it doesn't capture as many as this one or this one but proportionally for its size it captures just as many okay the most important thing down here is the bait you use and the bait you want to use is apple cider vinegar okay it has to be apple cider vinegar it can't be regular vinegar it has to be apple cider vinegar because you need that little bit of the apple pieces to rot a little bit in that vinegar and that gives off a aroma of fruit and that's what the fly picks up on okay so the apple cider vinegar it's really cheap you can get a half gallon of it for like four or five bucks and that will probably last you all season you don't need to store it in a refrigerator you can just put it in any old place it's not going to hurt if it gets too hot too warm or too cold I've had it in the back of my truck all summer and all winter and it does a fine job so we're lucky in a sense that these traps do work well and this bait does work well in attracting the flies with brown marmorate stink bug if Sir already talked about this there is no way that we can monitor for it because we do not have a good trap that will bring the bug into a field so we know whether or not it's present but with these this is about the only way you can tell if you have the fly is once you capture them and you check it about every four or five days or every week to make it how many flies you've got and you see if you see any spotted wings that's the easiest way look for the spotted wings if you don't see any spotted wings there might be a lot of females I've noticed during the season there's more females than males some parts of the season there's more males than females so it goes back and forth but you're almost always going to have some males in these traps so you're always going to have some with spotted wings which are fairly easy to distinguish from other flies okay the other thing they're attracted to the flies are a red color so that's another reason I like this trap because it has red color these don't these don't okay you want to put the traps inside where the fruit is you don't want to put it out away from the fruit put it in where the fruit is excuse me and put it with as much foliage around it as possible so that you actually can't see it very well and the flies like to go to places that are cool and a little damp so they'll prefer to go into the traps that are inside the foliage rather than anything outside they're not going to go into okay now these are some things you can do organically to control it sanitation this is probably one of the biggest thing is remove mature fruit or overripe fruit now that's going to be a pain but if you do have this fly and the traps will tell you whether or not you have the fly then you need to remove as much mature and overripe fruit as possible and you need to destroy it okay sanitation eliminate alternate habitats and that's going to be difficult any but any called fruit or rotting fruit in any other field they're going to go over there as we saw with the pumpkins and the apples and the cherries that are laying on the ground and they're going to reproduce on those and then come back to your other fruit okay so you need to so the whole thing is trying to clean up your area as much as possible the other thing is monitoring trapping to quickly detect infestations as I said earlier in the talk every farm we visited had the fly and every farm we visited the growers said they didn't have the fly okay and so it is one of those things I'm not sure if it's wishful thinking if I wish I don't I didn't have the fly I won't have the fly but it's one of those things that they weren't used to looking for this damage and suddenly the damage did appear and once it started pointing it out to them they started to notice the damage in other places in other fields and then we started to see how many flies they were having on their farm you know anywhere from 50 to 150 per week that's a tremendous number of flies okay so monitoring is real important and you guys have a good chance now that the rest of the state knows it's infested that here on the eastern shore the fly has not moved in to any great extent but it will because you guys are going to be nice and moist all through the season so it's going to do a better job of surviving out here than it does on the western shore okay you can use insecticidal sprays to suppress the fly and the one that will reduce damage is Entrust it's about the only organic pesticide that's going to work to reduce the damage so you're going to have to try to do as much sanitation as possible if you do have the fly what this is going to do what Entrust is going to do it's not going to kill the flies to any great extent and that's something my trapping has shown over the August and September the growers I was working with were spraying like crazy and these were synthetic growers and so they were spraying malathion and pyrethroids and things like that and the fly counts just went like this they never really went down you can't get rid of the fly okay it's not possible and I stress this growers sort of laugh at me and then they just keep going and then they find out they can't get rid of the fly so you can't get rid of the fly once it's on your farm in large numbers and that's because it reproduces on so many different things so that's why as soon as you see it there you need to try to control it as quickly as possible and knock its numbers down as best you can if you don't try to knock down its numbers then you're not going to knock down its numbers the numbers are going to just stay up the rest of the year so what Entrust does more than anything else it's not so much kill the flies but it keeps the adult female from ovipositing on anything that's been treated with Entrust okay and so your damage levels are going to go down and as your damage levels go down there's going to be fewer maggots that make it to adulthood so you're going to have fewer adults the next generation and then fewer adults the next generation and that's what you're looking to have is reduced adults each generation and because they have so many 10 to 12 a season you're going to be able to knock that population down over time but it is expensive Entrust is not cheap so you want to try to do the sanitation stuff first and if that's not working then use Entrust okay okay any questions about spider-wing Drusophora? I must have done an outstanding job of going over everything yes so where did they come from? where did they come from? they came from Southeast Asia they came from China North South Korea and Japan but you said it's still spreading there now? it's still spreading there, yes okay it's spreading out there it's going a little bit north it's going south and a little bit east why hadn't it reached its bounds? why hadn't it reached its bounds? why hadn't it reached its bounds? is it? probably because it's a new species it is a new species it's a new species it's a new species for them it's a new species for us okay that's what I was talking about when I got to the United States to tell you the truth we heard that it was on the west coast and then we heard that it was down in Florida but we figured it would be you know three or four years at least before it got up here into Maryland and here it was the next year it's in Maryland and it's in Maryland very heavy so it's one of these things you need to be concerned about if you have any kind of fruit and you need to monitor for it that's the biggest thing I can tell you if anybody's interested in having a trap I can go out to my truck after this talk and get you a couple traps you just have to supply the apple cider vinegar yourself okay alright what time is it we'll go on some phylans how many people know what's some phy... oh question I was wondering if traps control them at all just monitor no just monitor people find them out you know 10, 20, 30 traps around in there it captures a lot but they just keep coming so it just isn't enough to knock them down okay some phylans and vegetable production areas this is one of the how many people have high tunnels? okay you that have high tunnels you're gonna have to pay a little more attention to this than other people okay so so some of you this is a real bad day for you I'm talking about all kinds of problems okay high tunnels have been really great over the last couple years to extend the season both at the one end of the early and late and they've done a great job uh... doing that people have made a lot of good money off of them uh... uh... soils often times in high tunnels are much better shaped than the ones out in the field because we can baby the ones in the high tunnels so we have a tendency to put in a lot of organic matter into these high tunnels maybe a little more manure uh... and so the soils usually are in real good shape uh... in these high tunnels and that's actually really good it's good for your vegetables they'll grow a lot better but it's also real good for a new pest or not a new pest a pest that's always been there but now it's starting to come on so it's not a new invasive pest it's a new invasive pest uh... for some of our uh... high tunnels and where it wasn't a pest before that's sort of what I mean by invasive pest but it didn't come from anywhere else uh... this is the native pest so different high tunnels uh... what happens over the last couple years especially out in western Maryland and also in uh... Pennsylvania they started to see all kinds of well not all kinds but different types of problems that they couldn't figure out what was going on uh... plants that once they the plants got fairly large they could water it all they tried and they could not keep it from wilting during the heat of the day and they could not figure out why uh... fruit that didn't quite ripen up like it should like it had a nutrient deficiency and yet when they tested the plant the plant tested fine as far as having most of its nutrients the soil tested fine but I should soil testifying but the plant tested a little bit low in some nutrients and this this nutrient happens to be potassium that's low in so potassium isn't being taken up by these plants as much and nobody could figure out why there's other squirrely things happening to some of the uh... leaf material and again we were sort of at a loss of what was happening plants were small and irregular didn't grow as well as other plants and it could be just one plant and then everything else around it was fine you know or it could be ten or fifteen plants in a particular area but all the plants around that are fine so it seems to be very hit and miss what's going on in the high tunnel and what was what we found was that it was a garden semphyla and garden semphyla and gardens semphyla are closely related to insects they're not insects they have a lot more legs than insects and you can see the antenna it's like taking little white balls and sticking them on top of each other and so these are the antenna right here this is the head and this is the body the head antenna and the body they're probably these are millimeters right here so you can see there's about they're about six seven millimeters long as an adult so they're not very large little critters here's some more pictures of them again the antenna and this is antenna up close okay these are also called garden centipedes slender white closely related to insects 10 to 12 pro legs distinct antenna they're very fast moving which is one reason they get the name centipedes centipedes are fast moving so are these they move up and down in the soil profile so they move up and down during the season they move up and down during a 24 hour period up and down this is what makes them so difficult to control and they respond excuse me I'm going through the change they respond to soil moisture so as that soil moisture increases in the top layers of the soil they'll start to move up they want to move up towards the roots that's sort of where they want to be as the moisture level goes down the top three or four inches of the soil they start to move down and so they'll move up during the day when it's moist and they'll move down at night or vice versa depending on when it's the most moist so as the soil dries they move deeper into the soil profile and that's what another reason makes it difficult you can treat that top six inches of soil a foot of soil with a pesticide and yet most of them or a lot of them are down another foot to two feet and so they're down below where you can get that pesticide and so they just come right back up after that pesticide is cleared and they start to reinfest okay they don't like white and they don't like dry soil and we know that they occur mainly in soil with high organic matter and especially in an organic farm that fertilize with manures so if you do a lot of fertilizing with manures or any kind of organic matter you're more likely to have this pest the better shape your soil is in the more likely you are to have this pest you know it's sort of counterintuitive and the reason they like really nice soil because those soils have a lot of air passages and water passages and so the simphylans move in these air passages and these water passages up and down if they don't have these passages they can't move up and down so they're stuck at whatever level they're at and this is one of the things we talk about as a possible control measure is tilling the soil up in the top foot and that'll keep them from moving up any more than a foot they won't move within a foot of the top of the surface because that area has been tilled and there's no little highways for them to follow they cannot make their own paths they're not like earthworms they have to follow something that's already been made for them alright so good soil which has fissures, micro cavities, earthworm galleries are favorable to its movement and the movement up and down is what makes it so deadly as a seasonal and daily vertical migration between the surface can be as great as three to four feet so they can move the surface all the way down to three feet and that makes them difficult to control okay, spring population made up of adults only some filings feed on algae, fungi, mosses this is what they feed on most of the time but when their populations start to get higher than what they should they start to look around for something else to feed on and that's when they go to roots and so they're attracted to seeds, very young roots that's the first thing they're attracted to and when they feed on the more mature roots they tend to eat the absorbent hairs so the hairs that we don't want to be bothered the ones that do all the absorbing of the nutrients and water those are the ones they tend to feed on and that's why some of those plants that we saw earlier even though there's lots of water in the soil the absorbent hairs were gone and so they could not take up the water they couldn't take up the nutrients that they needed even though if you were to look at the roots you probably wouldn't see much nibbling on the roots unless you looked very carefully at the hairs okay, we already went through the adults long antennae, juveniles look very much like the adults they're just a little shorter the eggs are kind of funky looking and I'll show you that here in a bit egg laying appears possible only at a temperature above 50 degrees so if it's real cool they're not going to lay a lot of eggs developed from egg adults is kind of slow it's about 2 months at 84 degrees and 6 months at 40 degrees so it's not a real quick process they only have 1 or 2 generations a year at the most unlike the flies we just talked about they had 10 to 12 generations a year so this has only very few generations but this is what the eggs look like are some phylans very distinctive the problem is you're probably never going to see these they're going to be too far in the ground they're going to be a foot or more underground you might sometimes run into them but they're going to be hard to see because they're going to be covered in dirt these have all been washed off and so it's very clear to see but you see they're kind of spiky so they're kind of neat looking I'm not sure how painful that was to get to actually lay for a little some phyland but it had to be a little painful I would think okay here's some damage out in the field this is what it would look like in the field just areas just spots where some phylands are in real high numbers and they just wipe out all the plants in that area this is a corn field they go to all kinds of plants they don't they don't mind too much there's only one or two plants you can grow that they don't seem to like a lot and we'll talk about that this is damaged here you can see this area right here is yellowing and that's because some phylands are taking off the feeder roots and these plants are not getting enough nutrients here okay these are the most commonly damaged plants broccoli, spinach, beets, onion, squash, cabbage, crucifers less damaged plants are tomatoes and peppers but all the damaged plants I saw out in western Maryland from some phylands were tomatoes okay so just because these are less damaged plants doesn't mean they're going to be less damaged it's just that these plants these plants are more picked on because it's earlier in the season I think we grow a lot of these and so the some phylands do a little bit better so as it starts to get warmed up in these high tunnels the some phyland population is going to go down they're just going to retreat to lower parts of the soil profile where it's cooler and then come back up and it starts to cool off during the season okay this is the damage they do and you really don't see much do you? do you? do you see these plants being picked on by the symphalic plants? on the roots if you look carefully you won't see any real fine hairs all the fine hairs are gone on the spinach okay and this is a little bit more damage and you see they've done enough damage to these roots they're actually starting to stunt the roots the roots aren't doing well they're not growing out these are all in real young plants so if you use seeds most of you probably don't if you use seeds then you can expect to see these young plants that are being picked on by the symphalic plants if most of you use transplants the older the transplant is the better off it's going to be and it's more able to overcome any feeding damage okay again you see all the roots but you don't see any real fine root hairs on any of these plants that's because they've all been picked off okay this I did not draw this picture up here alright a friend sent me this picture and I can't get it off alright so I just have to live with it alright this is from his high tunnel and this is a damaged two or three plants right there and he could not figure out what it was and he finally dug up that area and it was some filings okay damage usually concentrate in really small areas and recurs every season so the infestation spread very slowly you'll see a couple plants one year couple more plants the next year maybe a bigger area the next year and then it won't grow at all the next year and then a bigger area so it's very gradual and you don't really notice it that much okay in recent years some filings have become a serious pest of young transplant tomatoes in areas of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and the Midwest it just seems to be moving into not moving into our state but the damage that we're seeing seems to be moving more into our state the sin filings tend to like cooler areas so we might be in good straights because of that because we're a lot hotter you guys out here on the eastern shore you might run into a little bit more because you're not quite as hot as we are with your with the ocean and the waters that you have around you but it tends in Pennsylvania it's become a major pest in their high tunnels less so in Ohio and somewhat in other Midwest states but it's real bad in Pennsylvania right now okay now you can monitor some volumes with a bait some kind of bait trapper you can use carrots or potatoes they like either one of these two you cut the bait in half longitudinally scratch the surface just before placing it on soil and sure the surface is moist so what you want to do is moisten the soil of your high tunnel put out these bait potatoes or carrots in your high tunnel and then go back and check after about three or four days just pick it up and see if you guys some filings feeding on it okay so you want to put it in a depth where the soil is moist I suggest that you go ahead and water your area so you can bring some filings up if they're present okay okay this is what it would look like you want to cut it longitudinally lay it on you can cut it just like this it'll last longer if you leave the skin on the top of it and you put it into the soil okay you need at least a dozen baits in the field most of our fields I would not tell you to bother with most of our fields are not in that great of shape compared to our high tunnel soils so it seems this seems to be much more of a pest in our high tunnels and we really baby our vegetables in the high tunnels we fertilize them and water them really well so the some filings do that much better in there okay so examine the cut surface of that two to five days detect it consider treatment if large numbers are detected more than 20 per bait station consider pre-plant fumigation and we'll talk a little bit about that some fumigation you can use organically some people like to use it's a shovel method and I'll go through it and look for them the way I discovered it people sent me soil samples from out west in Garrett County and Washington County and I got the samples and I started going through the soil and I started seeing some filings which are not a it's not a real big deal you usually see some filings in every soil but where I normally see two or three some filings per shovel full I've seen fifteen to twenty per shovel full and then some spots fifty per shovel full and that is just way too many so once you get above two or three up to about five in a shovel full you've got way too many okay so five is sort of the cutoff point okay you want to reduce the amount of undecomposed plant material manure that's applied to the soil so this is something you're doing organically in your high tunnel it's a real good thing to do for your soil it's not a good thing for some filings so that's why you need to know if you have some filings or not if you don't have them continue doing this if you start to see them all right we continue doing this but maybe back off into manure a little bit okay tillage physically kills some filings and dries out the top one to three inches of soil so tillage always seems to help reduce their numbers in the top of the soil keeps them away from the root crop rotation can help the two crops that seem to ironically seem to work are the potato crop and the spring oats cover crop so you could plant a spring oats cover crop in your high tunnel and that would help lower the numbers if you have a lot of them in your high tunnel size of the plants so the bigger the plant the more able it is to fend off a tack you can increase plant density if a fest soil can be treated with an insecticide I know nobody here is going to use an insecticide so we'll go oh okay I'm going to talk about here the invasive nematode problems okay any questions about some filings yes if they're not able to meet their own paths in the soil how do they get into the small hairs? how do they get into the hairs? yes they're going to follow some pathway whether it's an earthworm pathway whether it's a pathway that microorganisms have made or some other pathway real good tilth soil has all these pathways in it it's on a microscopic it's very small scale but these pathways exist all the time and once they reach the root then they just start to go down the side of the root and follow the hairs yes where do they get into like the soil food web mix like do they have any predators or what balances them? oh yeah yeah yeah they have a couple predators it's just like anything else if the environment favors their reproduction favors their survival predators can't knock them back and that's a newly introduced pest has that it doesn't have as many predators the environment is just perfect for it and so it explodes in numbers and so that's what's happening with the simphilants the type of environment we have in the high tunnel makes it very successful and so the predators just can't keep up with it does it have anything to do with the fact that it's not in the normal climate? or not? yeah it probably does they are able to come up into it a little bit sooner and it's also because of things I talked about before that we tend to have really nice soil tilth in our high tunnels by adding organic matter and a lot of manure and if you add a lot of manure out in your field you still have to contend with all that other stuff but if you add a lot of manure in this small area it starts to have a real effect on the soil profile yes? how does it go with winter? no, winter is deeper in the soil so it'll go down 3 or 4 feet over winter is down there it just stays quiescent you can't till it out no you can't till it out one layer of sand which is really intensive they did want to move the high tunnel so they dug out all the soil in the top 3 feet they put in a sand layer of about 6 inches and then put all the soil back in and so that sand layer kept the some filings from moving up again there's no little every time there's a little fissure in the sand layer the sand just closed in on it again so it was able to keep the some filings out for a while eventually roots are going to get down there and start to open that up and then they'll follow the roots up ok? alright, I'm going to go through this kind of quickly how many people have garlic? probably not many of you ok, a few of you boy you've been hit with all these I noticed today ok garlic bulb nematodes it's called a garlic bloat nematode first appeared during the wet year of 2009 in the confirmed cases in New York and Vermont it's now in New Hampshire, Maine, Pennsylvania we're pretty sure it's already here in Maryland and Delaware ok, this is an old pest but we've gotten rid of it over the years and has not been much of a pest you know, I'm not going to read all this but it basically came in from Canada we think on seed that should not have been used in garden but it was and it was in the seed and the seed was planted they started to make more garlic from it it started to give away garlic and then it just started to spread like that ok, this is what the nematode looks like it's microscopic this is what the nematode looks like on a root and it's been dyed red so you can see it more easily and you see that there's literally hundreds of them on the root and this is what will do the damage so they'll use their mouth parts and stick it into the root and start to draw out nutrients ok, leaves severely infected plants turn yellow dry prematurely plants may be stunted roots may be missing especially on one side of the bulb I'll show you some pictures of that the basal plate appears to have a dry rot similar to fusarium basal plate rot and so this is what a lot of people think they have is a disease and they probably do but it's because of the nematode that it's so much worse ok, Lee ok, balls may be cracked with dark green the festive tissue predisposed to the plant to other problems like fusarium or white rot so what happens is you look at your bulbs and you see a lot of white rot a lot more than you would expect and it's because of the nematode not because especially of the disease ok garlic bloat nematodes can overwinter in soil crop the brain can move into the inflorescence into the seeds and remain in the seeds for long periods of time in some plant species ok, this is some of the damage it'll do it'll start to rot some of the bulbs this is what normal garlic should look like this is what the damage from the bloat nematode will look like sometimes it can be a much more subtle than this and you can see how half the plate on this the roots are missing the other half is fine and it can be something just that subtle as opposed to some more damage that looks like this ok, so you see a lot of my pictures came from Ontario and that's because they have a real problem with it ok, they see plants that can and the nematodes can transfer from garlic include beans, clover, alfalfa which act as a major source of the nematodes dispersal so the nematodes can move to these other plants and then they move into the seed and then we plant the seed and we start the whole bloat nematode problem again migration to above ground plant parts usually occurs with rain or sprinkler irrigation so the nematodes are located in the ball when it starts to rain they start to come up with that rain because it's moisture and they're not going to dry out so then they come up to the inflorescence and they start to infest the seed nematodes enter tissues through stomata by direct penetration fourth stage is the survival stage which can go with cryptobiosis, hidden life on or in the plant tissue and survive three to five years so this fourth stage can stay around for a long period of time in this fourth stage it can stay in dry plant material people think they dry out their garlic or they have real dry seeds this is going to cut back on the numbers it does not reduce the numbers of the nematodes by drying it out alright, this is some more damage to the bulb don't confuse this with onion maggot damage onion maggots, you can see the maggots nematodes, you can't see the nematodes nematodes live for a fairly long time when they're sexually mature about 75 days now that fourth instar is not sexually mature so it can live a much longer period of time but once it becomes mature and it's a female then she'll start to lay eggs and she doesn't live as long so a female can produce two to five hundred eggs I'm going to skip over some of this nematodes can survive in soil for as long as two years without principal host so they can be in the soil for a long period of time that's why you have to think about a long rotation if you have this four stage juveniles enter young tissues especially in seedlings when below the soil surface okay, this is the nematode feeding right here you can see this is the root tip this is its mouth part and this is its stylet little stabby thing that's going to go into the root okay if you've purchased or bought any new planting material the last few years because we've gone back and we found out this the material was infested three or four years ago and it came from Ontario or New York you may have this pest okay if you have not made any new introductions why you are you're probably safe if you have not made any new introductions in the last three or four years and especially if you're not made it from garlic that's come from Ontario or New York you're probably safe alright you'll mostly want to find out if you have this if you have this you're going to have to rotate from any allium crops like garlic, onions and leeks for about and control the nightshades because it will get up in the nightshades for about four years okay keep fields of garlic grown moist I'm going to let you read this anything I want to pick out we're going to talk about a little bit about biofumigate mustard produces isothiocyanate and natural gas released from all brassica plant tissue over the last probably 10-20 years we've sort of bred the high levels of this material of this chemical isothiocyanate in order to get the release of the chemical into the soil you need to chop up the plants as much as possible okay you can't just simply plow it under it won't release the chemical to any great extent it has to be chopped up as much as possible mustard plants must be chopped as finely as possible before immediately incorporating the soil simply plowing doesn't help this is other things you should consider okay we'll go they do a lot of this in Europe and England where they use the the the mustards as a biofumigate so they grow the mustards then they chop them up and this is what this does it chops them up very finely and then it plows up under the surface about four to six inches deep and they want that they want them to stay right in that four to six inch layer because that's where the gas is going to be given off and they want this to be a little bit moist so that it seals the gas inside as the plant releases it okay this is what sort of happens this is an unbroken cell this is the enzyme that's in the cell this is a glucosinolate and when you break that cell apart these two come in contact and when it comes in contact with water it creates this isothiocyanate isothiocyanate and this is a biofumigate this is the same thing that vapam gives off same chemical alright if you have 7,000 pounds of dry matter of rash you would produce an equivalent of 160 nanomoles of this isothiocyanate per gram of soil the amount of isothiocyanate released by a standard application of metham sodium would be greater than 2,000 so you can see there's quite a difference between here you're releasing much smaller amounts of this and that's why you only want it in the top 4 to 6 inches you don't want to put it through the whole soil profile because you just will not be able to release enough chemical from that plant alright so this has actually worked pretty well to reduce nematode and disease problems that are not real severe and so you want to discover if you have a disease or nematode problems as early on as possible and then use this as a cover crop chop it up real finely and then plow it under only about 4 to 6 inches deep and then let it sit for about 2 to 3 weeks and then you'll be ready to go yes because the you کہ FIDEO wherever other types of music
