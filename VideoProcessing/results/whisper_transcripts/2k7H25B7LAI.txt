 Where I live in Arizona, the summers are hot. Here are five things I always do to help my garden survive the heat. The most important is to make sure that I have at least 12 to 18 inches of good quality soil. I use a planting guide so I'm planting the right crops at the right time. I add shade to the areas of my garden that need it. I water in the morning so my plants are hydrated and ready for the day. And finally, I add a nice thick layer of mulch to everything.
