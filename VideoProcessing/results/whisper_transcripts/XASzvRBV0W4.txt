 hey guys welcome to today's video today we are going to discuss intercropping and crop rotation and the potters of doing that so behind me as you can see is fresh big huge kundes and my daughter one boy who loves videos as much as her mother so we are going to discuss that please stay tuned hey what's up what's up it's fomo on fire again and i'm here to tell you how to add value to yourself without going back to your pocket to buy fertilizer or manure or anything like that as you know uh tomatoes are very good uh but we are pluting them because it's time to everything dies everything is born the cycle of life so we are pluting this one but then we won't put tomatoes immediately after you know how far was that you know you can eat cabbage then you end up depleting yourself so today we are discussing crop rotation and intercropping and the benefits and why as a farmer it's okay to also take a break like i took up three weeks to plant this kunde beans uh in this idea when they work to enrich the soil it adds nitrogen back to the side just drinks all the nutrients from your soil so it's a very high high intensive crop in terms of soil and we don't want to deplete ourselves and start having less and less harvest you know how people used to get 10 10 bags of of maize in an acre and now they're only getting five yeah guys we need to intercropping we need to do crop rotation so that you can put a different type of crop so he kunde to panda leaves we don't panda it for the pods or for the beans it's for the leaves so it means that it needs different nutrients from the soil and it's also adding nitrogen back to the soil so you see with the damage that tomato had done to the soil the kunde is coming and adding something naturally and then we still sell them as you can see they're very nice and soft here are some danias as well and we're using this for pest control meona nyanya zango ze likwa zimaanza kuatakiwa natuta absoluta but we are saying no the dadia makes sure that that pungent smell of spices and herbs they cannot stay there anymore and since tuta absoluta likes eating the fruits and these are leafy things leafy crops that we've planted in the greenhouse too in between the seasons in our initial the tutor will just stab and die so that we also have a we don't have to start with spraying with the new crop so after these three weeks we are going to put our new seeds for our tomatoes awaiting for the market season for tomatoes guys you know tomatoes are going to make us millions again next year so as we wait for that winter crop using different um crops as illustrated here yeah and you can see i've also put strawberries in between there because i don't want to water because i've started selling some of the kunda and some of the dinears nasi takima ji ipotele chini you guys know i like conserving everything i have so strawberries even as every other thing is growing that will be okay so this is my client i'm a kujia kunde they are very nice and soft because this is easy the new ones you can use outdoors you see they are nice and long because they're from for the greenhouse they've only taken three weeks and we get our money and you sell even the roots i mean this business is just so good so guys remember to always intercrop don't plant crop after crop after crop of the same nature try to put a different type of crop because it benefits your soil it makes sure you don't use as much fertilizer and it guarantees that you always have high yields high yields all the time and my favorite intercropping crop nikune kwa sababu you're adding nitrogen back to the soil and then the other thing that i would like to talk about in terms of crop rotation is you don't have to plant one thing all the time you can try and see what else is in the market i know the culture is usually let's do the same thing over and over again but also try and rack your brain and think what is my neighbor not farming that i can farm um that the market needs so that we don't end up all planting cabbages in the whole neighborhood yes so that is it for now um thank you for watching i really appreciate your love and hit the bell icon for such videos
