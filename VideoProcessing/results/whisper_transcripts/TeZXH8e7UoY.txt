Science & Technology
 Whenever farmers in Thailand cultivate paddy, they also release small fish in it. And they make a big pond inside the paddy field and make water drains all around it. So, the small fish that are released eat the insects and grow bigger. Then when the crop is ready, the water dries up. All the fish from the field come to the pond through these drains. After this, the farmers take them out and sell them in the market.
