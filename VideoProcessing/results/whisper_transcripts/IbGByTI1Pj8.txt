 Crop rotation is a great way to keep your soil healthy and boost your yields. Planting the same crop in the same field year after year can deplete the soil of key nutrients, leaving it less fertile and hurting your harvests. Rotating crops each season helps restore those nutrients. For example, after growing corn, which uses up a lot of nitrogen, plant beans, or peas. These crops put nitrogen back into the soil, keeping it fertile without the need for extra fertilizers. Switching crops also helps control pests and diseases. Pests that target one crop won't be as much of a problem when you plant something different, which means you can cut down on the use of pesticides. Crop rotation is a straightforward and effective way to keep farms productive and sustainable.
