 Today we're showing you our Yanmar Mini Round Baler. So this is a round baler that you can run with any small compact tractor. We have this one on a 24 horse Yanmar right now. It requires no hydraulics, everything is self-contained. It just needs a 3-point hitch, a PTO, and 12 volts of electricity. We've already formed our windrow with our tetterrake back there. All we do is run the baler over it. We've got our bale size indicator right here showing us how full our bale is getting. And simply, we're going to reach the end of the windrow and an alarm is going to go off. It'll tie. There it is, our alarm is going off. Wrapping it with swine right now. Then we'll hit the bale eject button. And out comes the Mini Round Bale. It probably weighs about 40 pounds. We're on the medium density setting. It's the largest bale setting that the baler has. But they'll, they're big enough, but they'll stand up on end. And super easy to feed. Just a matter of removing the twine. And if you only, if you're used to feeding square bales by the flake, you can, you can do that by just pulling off a piece about the size of a flake of hay. Overall, this is going to be a great option for anyone that has a few head of livestock, but either doesn't want to own their own baling equipment or doesn't want to own any equipment that's old and needs a lot of repair. Fantastic option by Yanmar America. Again, any 24 horse or so size tracker will run it. And there's also a complimentary disc mower that we use to, uh, to mow our head. Thanks for watching.
