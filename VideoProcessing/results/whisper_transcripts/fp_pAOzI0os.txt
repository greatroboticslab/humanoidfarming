Howto & Style
 Hey YouTube this is Doug Greencabby and today we're going to be redoing our aquaponics and we're going to be installing a radio flow filter to get out particulates and a heavy matter of fish way so that there are not huge particulates that fill up the grow media in the bed. We're going to go ahead and go through how it's set up and show you exactly what we got going here. As you see here we have a large chlorine bucket I think it's like a six or seven gallon bucket and what we got coming in here is we've got an inlet pipe that's coming in and then it flows down and then up to a 45 degree angle and then it comes out at a one inch and what happens is we take this guy here and we basically put it over so that all of the particulates that are coming up settle to the bottom and then all the clean water flows out here so it goes in flows up hits the walls and then goes down so that the particulates are down there and then we have a pipe right there that has a spigot on it that allows you to take out the solids for liquid fertilizer and so it collects all of the fish waste that's on the bottom so you can use that so the aquaponics is still getting the wonderful amounts you know ultra low particles on the fish waste but the grow media doesn't get clogged up with big chunks of fish poo. What we have here is we got the pipe we went ahead and drilled a hole in the pipe and then two holes on the top to be able to connect a heavy-duty zip tie so that it's zip tied all the way to the top it's got a little bit of airflow here where the hole is as well as some airflow along the bottom that allows you know some water to get out so it's not pressurized but most of the water is going to come out the bottom as the particulates flow down. Today is the first day that we're going to go ahead and drain our sediment filter. It's been sitting and working for two days. We're going to go ahead and fill it up in this container right here. Got our handle right there. Got all our particulates coming in the bottom. It's a nice liquid fertilizer that would otherwise be clogging up our grow beds and we can use this on any of our raised garden beds here in the garden. We've got our two filters set up. The first filter works with these two beds here. The second filter is flowing to this bed right here but this is actually also going to be two beds like this so we will have four IBC beds.
