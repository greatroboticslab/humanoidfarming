 What I wish I knew before planting veggies, legumes aren't just food, they're natural soil boosters. Forget expensive fertilizers, your next harvest could start with a handful of beans. Here's the scoop. Legumes like beans, peas and clover have a superpower called nitrogen fixation. Think of them as tiny factories underground. Their roots make friends with special bacteria. These little guys grab nitrogen from the air and turn it into plant food. That means legumes feed themselves and leave extra nutrients in the soil for everything else you plant later. It's nature's way of refilling the fridge for your garden. So if you want healthier soil and bigger harvests, add some legumes to your next planting. Your veggies and your wallet will thank you.
