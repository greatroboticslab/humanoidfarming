Howto & Style
 Zucchini and squash in the garden. It's a summer staple, but they're both known for two really annoying things. Sprawling all over the place, taking up tons of space in your garden and succumbing to inevitable disease. So in this video, we're going to show you our new favorite method for growing zucchini, which is growing it up vertically, which is the cheapest and easiest way to avoid those two problems. And if you already have a squash garden going, don't worry, we will show you exactly how to convert that over to vertical squash. The beauty of this method is you do not need much to get it done. You can find most of it lying around your house. This is electrical conduit, which I'm using as my steak, but you could go with bamboo or anything else you find. I have some twine and a mallet to hammer it in and you really only need about three feet of height, but give it a good hammer in because if you do your job right, you're going to have a ton of zucchini supported by this steak. So variety wise, you want to go with like a bushing squash, one that wouldn't vine on its own. So I'm choosing Emerald Delight here. Roots look good. I'm going to give them a bit of a loosening here. And I just want to get it as close as I can to the conduit line. So I'm going to dig it out and just get this in here and I'll plant it right up to the seed leaf. So I'll plant it just a touch deeper than it is currently. Really seal it in there. And because I'm growing this up, I'll just mulch around the bottom here, keep some of that moisture in. And I will check in with you in a second. I do mean a second because this will grow super fast. Well, it's been a little bit and the squash has ramped like crazy. One thing I wanted to call out really quickly, we get a lot of questions about the texture of the leaf. This is just variety dependent because of course squash can suffer from powdery mildew and you see this sort of silvery texture on the leaf and you get a little bit freaked out. Some varieties just have that look. So you don't have to worry about that. When you're seeing a powdery mildew issue, you typically would look at the underside of the leaves and start to see little puffs of white. And that's where you know you've got a problem. I actually have a different problem. I've got a little caterpillar on here, but the squash is starting to fruit. I didn't have to do any manual pollinating. Squash, sometimes you do want to take the male flower and kind of jam it into the female flower. But in my garden, I plant enough pollinators and have enough other flowers around that the bees, et cetera, are coming in and pollinating. So my only job right now is just to make sure that it's going to grow vertically. Now it takes a little bit like right at the start, it kind of doesn't even seem like it needs to be tied up, but nevertheless I'm still going to do it. So I'm going to come around and be really careful not to mess with any of the existing squash fruit that are on the plant. I'm just going to tie this directly to this conduit, which we've just jammed into the soil. So at the start, when you're growing squash vertically, it takes a while to just get to the point where it even needs to be trellised. But right about now when we have six to eight inches of vertical growth, some nice fruit, a lot of big leaves, we're going to start to see this growth point right here, which is where all that new growth is emanating from, really start to ramp. And that's when we're really going to see the benefits of tying it up vertically. It's been a few more weeks and the zucchini is blowing up. You can start to see some of the obvious benefits of growing it vertically, but there's a few things to do at this point in time. What I do is I take off a lot of the lower leaves as they grow. That's why the bottom of the stem here has this kind of barren look. So this is what's helping me control that disease. And as it comes up, you need to bust your twine out and tie it up a little bit more. I would say every four inches or so you start to see this leaning action going. I just come around and give it a quick cinch. So I'm going to take a few more leaves off of this plant, but I've been harvesting like crazy off of this zucchini, mostly because of how much access to sun it has, less disease, but I have some squash in the front yard that aren't doing so well. So I'm going to show you how you can take an existing squash plant that's maybe a little overgrown and turn it into a vertical squash. So I'm here in my front yard at my non-epic squash bed. You can see the disease. It's kind of sprawling all over the place. The production isn't as good. So this is what you have to do to convert an existing bed. Whip out your knife or your snips and start cutting off every single leaf close to the stem that has any sign of disease. So you can already see how much space is freed up. This is space that of course I can use to plant out new stuff, maybe for my fall garden, but I just remove leaves that were going to die anyways. So what I want to do now is grab my conduit. This is in a raised bed. So it's a little bit easier to kind of push straight through. Squash plants are surprisingly flexible, so they will sprawl out, but you can move them without damaging them much at all. So I come right next to the plant, shove this down. Maybe I hit a couple of roots, not a big deal. And grab my twine. And when I'm converting a squash, I actually tie the top first and then I support it. So they look a little weird right now, I will admit, but they'll get used to their upright life very soon and kind of reorient their way towards the sun. The only thing left to do is a bit of cleanup. Some leaves I see a little bit of disease on, or I see disease shortly coming. But what you've done now is you've unlocked a lot of extra space. There's way more airflow. It's easier to see pests, easier to see disease. There's so much that you could plant now with your squash. So if you want to understand kind of the science behind the magic of companion planting, check this video out right here. Good luck in the garden and keep on growing.
