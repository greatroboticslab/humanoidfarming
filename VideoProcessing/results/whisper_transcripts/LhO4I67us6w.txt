 These are the worst pets in grow a garden. Starting off with the dog. It has the same ability as the golden lab, but it digs seeds at a lower rate. Next up is the deer. It has a 5% chance to keep a berry after harvest. Cool idea, but there's only two berry plants in the whole game and they're both trash. This pet is useless. At number 3, we have the caterpillar. It hatches from a bug egg just to make the leafy plant grow faster. The problem is, I don't even know what counts as a leafy plant. Do you? No, I thought so. Coming in hot at number 2 is the hedgehog. It's the new night egg pet and it buffs one plant, the cactus. Just one, that's it. And the absolute worst pet of all time is the echo frog. It just gives general growth, which sounds decent until you realize we have watering cans and gardens grow offline.
