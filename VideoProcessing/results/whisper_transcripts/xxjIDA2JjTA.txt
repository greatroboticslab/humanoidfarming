 new here i'm the classic farmer and this week the machinery issues have got a tiny bit worse i'm off to pick up some of the latest purchases at one of the auctions and we're starting to get things ready for the herd number inspection all in all it's been another busy week in the farm anyone who's been following along knows that the case here needs a new set of boots and i haven't had any luck finding a half decent front set to wear out the backs so we're going to bite the bullets and i'm putting a full new set of tires all around i've narrowed it down to a choice and i don't care if you think neither of these brands are any good and you think a different one these are the two brands that i'm choosing between so it's either going to be galaxy earth pros or a set of seats i think farmer special so i galaxy earth pros or seats if you had to choose between galaxy tires and seat tires for mixed juice road and plowing what would be your choice and why and no no i'm not putting bkts on just everybody's using bkts they're not all they're racked up to be i'm going to give one of these two brands a go and see which one so if you're running either or if you've had anything with either on let's talk and see which way you can swing me so this rotavator that stopped working on me last year not sure why no idea just lost drive i have a very small hope that the problem lies in behind this gearbox cover and it's just the chain off or something simple like that but there's a big doubt in me just the way the failure happened it didn't sound like a chain problem i think there's something wrong either in that gearbox or with this shaft but we'll get a part get a look and see how we go well this isn't supposed to do this i can guarantee you that so i need to get into this side of the gearbox because there must be something wrong with the crown wheel in here so as far as i know to get that out you knock this shaft forward and burning all comes out here and then you can look into the crown wheel that's what i hope now i mightn't be right but we're gonna give that a go and if we break something more well should we break something more so yeah not lucky enough that knocking that pin out will let me in to see the the crown pinion the whole gearbox has to come off to get in there to have a look at what's wrong so let's get that done and there you go there is the problem that i'd really hoped or didn't expect was it sheared this main shaft and it's obviously been broke before and someone's welded it in fairness it lasted a long time but there you go that's part of getting deals and bargains at auctions don't always work this one done a little bit but when i bought this an auction i bought it for the the teeth there's a full new set of teeth on it and they cost more than the price i paid for it so i'm out nothing but i need to figure out now how we get this fixed if i can find a shaft for it i don't really fancy welding it again i don't think that'll hold up so we'll uh we'll figure something i do have another old rotavator sitting down the yard i think the shaft's different on it we'll go and have a look and see well now that i know that this is the problem with that i need to sort a rotavator out has anybody got a 70 inch hard that is centre mounted not offset floating about that's in a hedge that i could get a shaft out of or maybe buy the whole thing or am i going to have to go scour in the auctions to try and get something to get me away again let me know if you've something floating about the hedge that'll pull me out now some eagle-eyed viewers in the last video did notice this yes i have bought a cab for the combine but no i don't know if i'm going to fit it or not i'm still in two minds i enjoy the freedom and unobstructed view that not having a cab brings and the fact that the combine sits a little bit lower so i don't know i'm in two minds whether or not to put this cab on but i'll show you it anyway so here's the cab it's in pretty good shape but unfortunately it took a batter in the storm all the windows got broke even the front one screen got smashed on it so they'll have to be replaced if it's going on but apart from that you know it's in good it's in a good state it's not rotten or anything it's pretty good harry cat here is out to say hello today as well he is the resident rat catcher and environmentally friendly rodent the disposal system but uh back to the cab it's off uh 15 30 so it doesn't need a massive pile of changing to fit a one two two but it's just i'm still i'm not sure whether to to fit it or not i think it's just a bit obstructed might just be me i'll probably lift it up with a map bro and sort of dry fit it to see and if it goes on and i like it then i'll i'll go ahead and finish the fitting and if not i'll just leave the combine with no cap but anyway that's a future project that's sitting there right then i need to get this crush into some sort of a shape where it'll pass a a department inspection that's not too bad but to get the herd number i need a few wee things done to it i need a bit of gate back on that bottom entrance and leave this one closing right to get a pen and then these old bars are as you can see they're a bit less here they need they need a few hoops welded on to hold them i think the first thing we'll do we get hoops welded on there and then we'll start addressing the other little bits and pieces we need to get this crush squared up a few people were asking how the boys here doing they didn't make an appearance in the past couple of videos boys are doing good they're on a let me grab a bit they're on the this sort of mixed ration now this is what we bailed out of uh one of the fields of oats that failed last year the birds got to so it had been under so on so this is a nice new leafy soft sweet grass mixed in with some oat straw the guys are as you can see munching away in it here and quite enjoying themselves and yeah it's uh it's keeping them going i've got oh many round bales i had nine round bales of that so through two i've got seven more bales of this to get through and that will hopefully carry them out so they're going out to the fields now they're probably off the haylage and onto this mixed ration type pole crop type thing i don't know what you call it straw and new grass mixed together and uh yeah they're enjoying it i think it's quite tasty some of you might recognize this thing as well from some of my previous videos it was back in for a quick little visit just needed a small wiring issue sorted so fix that and let's back out the door again too so what was wrong with the 3065 this time well there was a break in the wiring loom for the one of the positive wires going from the behind the dash here up to the the top bit where the fans are and flashing light and all that stuff so we fixed that simple problem simple fix 3065s back out in the road again and it'll keep its owner happy for a while longer we're off to balaminahe to pick up the spoils at the last auction now we didn't spend an awful lot of money at it to be honest but we picked up a few things that we sort of either needed or that were hard to get our hands on so what'd we go for well i bought a little calf crush that's a little bit bigger than a dehorning crush so we'll sort of do them from dehorning up to you know the first vaccinations and stuff like that handy little thing with a headlock gate on it backing bar nice little it's almost made it up but it wasn't there and it's a nice little job we got a set of dividers for the header in the new holland combine as well those are pretty hard to find normally what happens is someone heads into a field takes them off leaves them behind the ditch forgets about them and that's them lost for eternity so we've got a nice set of those that are in pretty good shape uh we just picked up smaller little small bits and pieces then a couple of little like barricade gate type things for cab bends and just useful bits and pieces so no big spains no fancy machinery but little bits and pieces of stuff that are going to make life a lot easier i hope we'll see we'll get there get them loaded up and we'll get home right we're loaded up let's get the doors closed get home and i'll give you a better look at this whenever i get back to the house let's take a look at what we got in the auction this is a little cattle crush that i got pretty pleased with it as you can see it's got the little thing for holding the head when you're dehorning that you can swing out of the way it's got an actual headlock gate which a lot of them don't have it has backing bar on it here and the gate for the back so it can be used as a transport crate it's got kramer brackets on them not that that's much use to me and as well it has something here for putting a little strap underneath them to hold them up and stop them uh belly flopping when you're doing the dehorning quite pleased with that i think that'll work well and then i got these dividers for the combine very pleased with these these don't come up that often they're usually always missing uh these two seem in quite good shape so yeah pretty pleased with that and then that's the gates we'll use them to make some more calf pens this year nice little auction haul for not an awful lot of money
