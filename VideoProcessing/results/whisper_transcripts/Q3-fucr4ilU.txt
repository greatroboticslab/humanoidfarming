You don't know me. We don't come from the same place. What you need to be worried about is these white police officers who shooting us down in the street. You don't know my pain. Look me in my eyes. You don't know what I been through. Seeing partners dead right in front of me. Childhood friends. Dead right in front of me. I went to college. But you know what they told me? I ain't have enough money. So I decided to go get a job. You know what else they tell me? Oh, we don't hire ex-cons. So how am I supposed to feed my family, huh? Where's somebody gonna give me a chance, huh? What sickens me? I'm not a bad guy. I'm a bad guy. I'm a bad guy. What sickens me is unarmed black men, citizens, children, beaten, and shot to death. Yeah, what also sickens me is the black on black crime statistics. Look them up. You're just out here killing yourselves. Just like it's hunting season. Them got the audacity to get a cell phone and record somebody getting shot instead of using that same phone to prevent a death. Man, I don't want her to die, man. to get the lights. Everyone got the Oakland to I bailed you out. But since you bailed out, I got a place on Jenkins and Jones. You go there, and I see you in the morning. No, bro. That's dangerous territory. I can't. No. That's dangerous territory around me, bro. You trying to get me killed? No, I'm trying to save you. We're losing a generation. To heartless and meaningless murders. The love of many is waxing oh so cold. No one seems to care about the brother or their sister, Lord. God, we ask you to forgive the preachers and the leaders, Lord, for they haven't done all that they can do. Lord, forgive us. Lord, for hiding behind all those walls and all of those deaths. God, God, forgive us. Lord, show us your will. Lord, that we might do it better. Lord, that we might even do it more. Jesus, we come before you looking for you to provide the answer to all of these killings. Lord, to stop the heartless killings, Lord. God, we look at you because you are the answer, the truth and the life. Lord, show me your will that I may do it. In Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. As of this day, this street is claim territory. It belongs to me. Every drug dealer, gangbanger, when they come on this street right here, you on my side of town. Man, you tripping, man. You know this is our block, man. You know that. And we ready to defend it right now. So what y'all boys want to do? I don't know who lied to you. Just out. We ready. Man, y'all boys chill out, man. Chill out, man. Man, what you doing? You trying to get us killed or something? These n****s ain't playing with you, Alex. No, you woke me up. You made me question myself. What have I been doing? So I decided to do something. What, you trying to get yourself killed? No. I decided to show this generation the answers. Man, please, man. You know this is our block. I ain't trying to hear that, man. No other choice there. Hey, no, bro. Come back on. Come back on. Come back on. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. So that's what y'all are all about? Aren't you tired of this deadly cycle of killing? Each other for no reason? You're killing each other over property that don't even belong to you. Killing each other over colors? Come on. Doesn't make any sense. Where are you really going about your business? Because this don't concern you straight up. Why you still came? Rebecca Fox? What's up, man? What's up, man? Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. From here on out, you and this city is my business. This territory is being taken over by me right here and now. For I know you. And I know exactly where you stay at. As of tomorrow, I want you all at my church. Your church? And if you do not come, I will have warrants for all of you. And you all will be arrested. Do I make myself clear? So what you trying to get everybody together? Get along? Never. Never. Never. Never. Oh, yes, it will. And if it will not happen, all of you is going to jail. Then do what you need to do then, cuz. What you doing? What you trying to get us killed or something? I'm thinking about saving a generation. Saving someone's future. Saving a generation by showing them the way. The answer. The answer? So what you trying to have, a family reunion? Against us at your church? I'm trying to show them Jesus. And a game player. In order for us to move forward, we first have to deal with your pain. This bag represents that person that hurt you. I want all of you to come up here and tell how you feel. And forgive that person. Do I have any volunteers? Forgiveness? I hate you! I hate you! What type of man rapes his own son? Huh? How can't you do that to your own son? I hate you! Get out of my mind. Now, now. Hang in there. Oh. Oh. Is there anyone else? Man, I'll go. My daddy wasn't nothing but a monster anyway. Talk about forgive this man. Man, this man killed my mother. Molested his own sister and tried to touch me like I was a paid hoe. Man, you're a monster. Get your hands off me. You find something funny? You know pain? What about if your mother sold your body to your own family members? You don't know pain like I know pain. You don't know what you're talking about. All right, knock it off. Sit down. How could you do that to me? You put me up for adoption. And you ain't even come and check on me. How can another man take care of somebody else's kid, huh? And not take care of your own child. Y'all left me, man. Y'all hate me. How can you do that to your own blood? Man, I'm done with this, man. I'm tired of killing people who look just like me, man. Over colors that don't even mean nothing, dawg. Things that don't even belong to us. So today, I denounced gang affiliation, bruh. So what you saying? You turning your back on us for some book? A book that ain't there nothing for you or for us? I read the other day about a man who loves us, man. He showed me the way, the truth, and the life. He showed me the answer, man. This can cause you your life. I'm sorry, Pastor, but I ain't buying to none of this, man. You know why you're not buying it? Because you're hurt. And you're lost just like all the rest of them. You go around here glorifying these streets like it's a badge of honor. And the only thing that's waiting on you is a hell. Don't you dare turn your back on God now. Man, where was he when my family died? When my brother and my sister was killed right in front of my face? Man, don't give me no feel-good story. Don't tell me about something you don't know about. Man, this ain't for me. Man, y'all in here punching bags and stuff, man. I'm good. The only way that you guys can heal is if you learn how to forgive. Man, I never forgive, man. You can't forgive because you don't have the power to forgive. Jesus can help you all to forgive and give you a better life. How many of you would allow him to come into your life and bring about a change? Yeah. Now that's what I'm talking about. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. The only way we're going to change our community is if we change ourselves. Listen, we got to put the guns down and we got to put our heads together. Amazon, Apple, Disney, Harley Davidson, man, they all started out of garage. So if they can do it, I know we can. We all ex-cons. Ain't nobody going to give us no jobs. So we have to create them for ourselves because we still got to provide for our families. So I was thinking, it's a list of jobs. I need you guys to partner up so that we can run these businesses together. The first thing that I believe that we should do is build a bank in our community so that we can create a steady flow of currency. Now I'm good at math, finances, things of that nature. I'm just looking for a business partner. I appreciate it, man, but I'd rather somebody from the horseman. We need a daycare, and we need a beauty shop. We also need a barber shop, clothing stores, clothing stores, and restaurants. This is a start, but it's only the beginning, guys. Now what we're going to have to do is spend time with each other so that we're able to trust one another. Man, I ain't spending no time with no horsemen. Dude, you know what you're saying, man? Us spending time together, that could get us killed. We can't build a community if we don't trust each other, dawg. But what if we get shot and killed, spending time together? I don't want anybody to get shot, and I don't want anybody to get killed. But we dying anyway. We dying over property that ain't even ours. That's stupid. We dying over somebody looking at me too long. That don't make no sense. So the least we could do is die trying to make a change. Now who with me? I'm with you, bruh. I'm willing to do whatever it takes. I can't have my kids out here thinking that they got to rob a man, a killer man for money. I need to be the type of man that my kids understand and they respect as a businessman. I need to prepare a future for my kids. So if that means I have to partner up with a horseman, so be it, I'm with it. I'm ready for them to be my partner so we can have one of the best restaurants in the town. That's a great attitude to have, man. For real. That's an attitude we all need to have. I love you. I love you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I told you I was done. Hey, bro. Hey, man. Man, what type of bull you just tried to pull in that car? Bro, I had to make sure you were for real, man. You weren't trying to kill me, man. For real? Man, how you supposed to be my partner, and I can't even trust you, dawg? Trust? Man, you know trust gotta be earned, man. Well, it's a lot easier when you ain't got a gun in your face, ain't it? Huh? Look, man. What I gotta do to you to prove, bro, I'm gonna hunt it with you, man. Man, you can't do nothing, dawg. You already showed me how you rocking in the crib. Look, I don't want nothing to do with you, bro. Real talk. I don't want nothing to do with you, bro. Get rocks then, playboy. Well, well, well. Seems like Christmas to me. Man, y'all boys get in the car, man. The man with me, bro. What you doing? We were order to kill this dude. I don't care what orders you got from Tico. And I told y'all boys, the man with me, man, he ain't banging no more, man. Oh. You flipping. You got the little South program with the little preacher and all that. He look good boy now, Spank. What? You seem like a traitor to me. Put the gun down, bro. That's what I'm saying no more, man. Put the gun down, man. If I blow your head off. He ain't banging no more. You flipping with the hook? Bro, move with him. Bro, put the guns down, man. Y'all boys get in the car and ride out, man. Get in the car and ride out, bro. Dang, it's like that. Whatever you want to call it, cuz. I told y'all the man ain't banging no more. He with me. It's my partner. Ride out. All right. Listen. Both of y'all dead when I come. You dead when I come. Both of y'all. Dead when I come. Dead when I come. Dead when I come. Dead when I come. Did you bring my clothes? Yeah. They're in the closet. You're not giving her a good chance to live. Yeah, I know. You tore my baby up so bad. Beat her like she was an animal. No. How dare you befriend a man that's responsible for the near death of my daughter? Don't you dare come near me. Don't you know the kind of man he is? The groups of people he hang out with and you want to help him? Why is he locked up for this? Baby, try to hear me. Try to hear me from your heart. He's not the same man he used to be. See, he's distanced himself from all this gang violence. In fact, he's put together a plan. A plan to bring these two gangs together as one. I don't want to hear that nonsense. You're wasting your time. With murderers and thieves. Baby, I can't agree with you on that. Wait, now you've gone a little too far with this now. You've made your decision. I don't want to be married to a man that befriended a man that's responsible for this. Baby, please. Please, don't do this to me. You did it to yourself. Go! No go. Go! Let me go. Hold up, hold up, hold up. Let me go, man. Man, what you doing, man? I ain't doing nothing, man. Let me go, man. Alex? Man, how you gonna portray me like that, man? Calm down. I thought we was partners, man. Mama, you ain't gonna say nothing, huh? Man, come on, let's go. Detective. Yeah? Why you got me out here on my day off? Well, I wanted to discuss with you about what you're doing. I'm not going to tell you about what you're doing. I'm not going to tell you about what you're doing. I'm not going to tell you about what you're doing. About bonding out social. Bonding out social. After we done cleaned the department of all the dirty cops, you gonna come to me today to tell me that you want to bond social out? See, I know it might sound strange, but he's not the same kid, Chief. We've been after him for over a year to lock him up. You were instrumental in that, and you wanted to lock him up. Now you got him. And you come to me today to tell me that you want to bond social out. You got me concerned. Wait, wait a minute. Wait, wait a minute. Are you kidding? You really think that I had a part to do with those bad cops? Come on, Chief. I put in 15 years with that department. And everything I've done, I've done it with an open heart. How dare you think of me like that, Chief? Mm-hmm. Okay, Detective. You go ahead and bond social out. But in the morning, I want your badge and your gun on my desk. I found the bag. You robbed the store. That's why I arrested you. Man, you phoned. All this, I want to help the hood, boo. Man, that was just a setup to get me locked up. Thought I could trust you, a man of God.

Dwayne and Blade got killed last night, man. I don't know what's going on with me, but... It's like I got a heart for people now. You're starting to feel his burdens. You're starting to feel this pain for humanity. I want to be his tool. But it's like I'm part of the problem, man. Went to the precinct the other day and they told me you took a leave of absence. And it finally hit. If you wasn't there when they arrested me, the folks would have killed me, man. I lied. I need you, Alex. We need you. The hood needs you, man. We need you to show us the love of Jesus. So forgive me. No, forgive me. Forgive the pastors and the leaders for not doing all that they're supposed to do. Let's bring the hood together, man. Let's do it together. All the money from each business will go back to the neighborhood's bank. Generating a level of wealth that will raise the economic level to a level that we could all be proud of. If I'm not mistaken, aren't you currently out on bond? Yes, ma'am. Let me get this straight. So you want this city to invest in an ex-con who's currently out on bond for an armed robbery charge? I know it sounds a bit crazy, but just listen. It doesn't sound a bit crazy. It is crazy. You want this city to invest in a bunch of thugs who terrorized this city, caused mass murders, gang violence, who polluted these streets with drugs and prostitution. Who do you think we are? The welfare office? Mayor, councilwoman, with all due respect, I've been working with these men and women for going on two months now. And I can attest that they have a strong desire to see a change. And I honestly truly believe that if they're given a chance with your support, they have the potential with their gifts to change this community. Pastor, I admire your desire to see change. I do. That's what we all want. But to invest in a scheme or to play with criminals, that's something we will not do. Sozo. What, man? This is going to be alright. This is going to be alright. This is going to be alright. Bruh, stop saying that, bruh. Do you know what your name means? Your name means to protect, to save, to heal. Man, whoever named you knew that you was going to live with a sense of purpose. Knew that no matter what you faced in life, someday, somehow, you were going to protect. You were going to save. Man, it's time for you to start speaking things into existence. Standing on the word of God. Speaking it. And allowing it to work. Man, listen. I don't believe God brought you this far to turn me loose. And you know what? I ain't came this far in your life to let you go. So don't you give up on yourself. We got a whole lot of work to do, bruh. We got a whole lot of work to do bruh. We got a whole lot of work to do, bruh. What you working on, bruh? Yeah, there was something came to me to sleep the other night. We got money right you up. I don't see. Just like they just called me to return our let this, son, your dating step. Most siblings will only do that. Like this. So next, Dr. Morrison, you're now going to work on some�� Blair. That being winter left. I am allergic to candles. And estoy thinking, well. Well we're going to go first. That being winter is for the partner right, bro. We working so hard, I be dreaming about pins. Man, check this out, though. I was reading the Bible, bro, and it said that God made garments out of animal skin and put garments on Adam and Eve. Yeah, yeah. That's how I know we on the right track. We should have named my new store, God's Design. God's Design, huh? I like that. That means we can have the biggest clothing store in the nation, huh? The biggest clothing store in the world. I read the Bible, it said all things are possible through Jesus Christ. And I believe that. You know, I believe that, too. What you looking at, Bilal, I thought, though? Just wanted to tell you, man. Thank you, man, you know. I apologize for what we did to you back then. I just want to tell you, thank you for forgiving me, man. And thank you for giving me a chance to prove that I'm really trying to change out here in these streets. You know? I appreciate that. Yeah. That's all right. Yeah. You know, if there's anything you need, just give me a call and let me know. I got you. Yeah, get some furniture in your house, man. See, you got jokes. And I just moved in here, man. You know, I had to get out the hood if I was really trying to change. Besides, them boys would have killed us if they knew we was in here working together, you know? Yeah, that's real, though. Yeah. Come in. I heard you moved over here to your new place. They say you're trying to make change. I think that's wonderful, son. Son? What'd your dad call me, your son? What you did from your mouth or fix your lips to say the words, son? I... I... I know what it did to you, your mother, and your sister. You have no idea what you did to my sister. Any of us. You were supposed to pick me up. Take me to the park. Teach me how to play basketball. Buy me ice cream. Teach me how to fight. You didn't do any of that. You were supposed to give me my name. My identity. You just beat my mom. Molesting my sister. You... You... You're right. You're right. Every day I ask God why I haven't died yet. Every day I ask the Lord why I'm still on this earth after all the pain I caused you, your mother, and your sister. And he said, because he loves me. I don't love you. And I don't know why he loves me. I don't know why he's forgiven me when I haven't learned to forgive myself. But I asked him if he'll give me a second chance. Another chance. I'll make it right. With my kids. And that's why I'm here. After 20 years of being in prison, I just want to be with my son. I don't need you. I know you don't need me. But I need you. I need you to know that I've been washed in the blood of the Lamb. I'm not the same God. I've been redeemed. Oh, so you ready to meet God? Because you about to. Hold on, bro. I forgive you. Now you got to forgive your dad, man. That's not the same thing. Same thing, man. It's the same thing. Come on, man. Put the gun out. It's the same thing. Come on, man. Put the gun out, man. I'm going to forgive you. Because I don't want hate on my heart. Okay, sir. And because I'm trying to change. I can't work with this. That's the only reason. Okay, sir. We'll work with that. I'm fascinated with all that he's done. He's brought crime down 90%. Boosting the community's economics. What is it that you need from us, Alex? What I want to do is bring revival to the streets. I want us to take over these streets in the name of the Lord the same way that these gangs are taking over their territories. See, I believe that the gangs are not going to come to the church. So we must bring the church to the gangs. Bishop? Bishop? I'm proud of you, Alex. I'm proud of the four thinking and sacrifices you made for this generation. Every pastor and bishop in this organization is going to back you 110%. Our goal is to bring the gospel to the nations. You have our support. And by the way, I've heard about the businesses that you and Sozo have brought to the communities. I'm keeping my eye on you all. And just so you'll know, we've already determined to send them back to school to get their GEDs and degrees as needed. We're here for this community. But we're also here for you. Thank you, Alex. Hold on a little bit longer. Stand up a little bit taller. You are right where you need to be. Keep on, you can do anything. If you would just believe you're right where you need to be. And you can lean on me. You can lean on me. Oh, oh, oh, oh. You can lean on me. Hey, you are stronger than you think. Oh, I could see your fire right in front of me. Hold on a little bit longer. Stand up a little bit taller. You are right where you need to be You can do anything If you would just believe You're right where you need to be You can lean on me You can lean on me You can lean on me Hold on a little bit longer Hold on a little bit longer Please don't do anything If you would just believe You're right where you need to be You can lean on me You can lean on me Oh, oh, oh You can lean on me Hold on a little bit longer Hold on a little bit longer You need to get our license and permission in order to stay in operation. Gentlemen, I thought I made it very clear that you weren't allowed to operate like this. Man, no, you ain't saying nothing like that. The only thing that you said is that we weren't going to be able to operate with y'all help. This operation is illegal and to me and my men it could very well be a drug cover-up. Man, why would you say something like that, huh? Because you all are gangsters. You got it wrong, bruh. We were gangsters, man. Let me get this straight. You kill and take from one another for years and one day the preacher shows up and reads a few verses and all of a sudden you're some business-savvy specialist? Please, you should be ashamed of yourself. You could have been the next chief of police. You know it's funny you choose to come in here now. Why weren't you here when things were going bad? Stop this operation or I'll have you all arrested. Man, see that's what I'm talking about. That's what I'm talking about, man. We can't get nothing done with him, man. Hey, hey, listen. Speak those things that are not as though they were. Come on. Don't you start losing faith now. Come on. Ever since these businesses have come to town, the crime rate here has went down tremendously. Yes. These gang members have been working together hand in hand. Yes. If it stops now, it's going to get dangerous. Yes, it's going to get dangerous. She's ready. She's ready. Every business that has been in operation needs to stop at once until proof of permits and certification. That won't be necessary. Excuse me, but who are you? My name is Macy Timmons, and I'm the owner of 25 successful restaurants across America. Now, I heard the story of Sozo and Alex. Yes. That's why I scurried over here real quick just to check on the progress. But what I want every one of you in here to know is that I'm going to stand along with them and by their side to help them earn their restaurant certification. Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I live in this community, too, as well. And I'm also a proud owner of three different barbershops, and I would like to also offer my help with their certifications. Yes. Yes. Yes. In all my years of being mayor, I've never seen a city come together like this. This is what I'll do. Once you have your permits, I'll purposely propose to the city that you all get 10 acres of land in the heart of the city to start your businesses. I didn't know you all were making such an impact. Forgive me for fighting with you all. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. you for your work, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Beautiful. It's a good point. some time alone with her. No. No. You're gonna live. And not die. You're gonna live. Bruh, we just made a hundred thousand in four weeks, bruh. It's good, man. It's good. Pretty soon we gonna be able to take over the whole city. The whole city. Who would have ever thought two notorious gangsters would come together and instead of destroying the city, we building the city. Man, I'm leaving, man. Oh, well, let me just get my stuff together and we... No, no, no, no. Not... Not that kind of leave, man. I'm leaving the group. What you mean you leaving? Why you leaving, man? Man, I don't know how to say this, man. It was me. I was the one that had Ray April, man. What you mean, cuz? I know, bruh. I know, man. Trust me, man. I know you probably won't forgive me, man. And I suspect it. By us being so close and getting close, man. Man, I grew to love you, bruh. Look, man. I love you, man. I ain't never in my life told another man that, man. Man, get out of here with that, man. Tell much you love me. Man, get out of my face, bruh. Man, I'm gonna turn to myself in the next couple of days, man. I'm sorry, man. He's not the same guy that used to terrorize the community. I've seen this young man pour his heart out to bring these gangs together. I love your dedication to the community and your hard work that you've done to ensure that this city is safe and sound. With that said, we've worked together for many years now. And you know there's nothing I love more than to bring a criminal to justice. It's the reason why I live. God created me. I'm sorry, man. The reason why I live. God created me to execute justice. Look, no matter what good this man has done, he's committed a crime that needs to be punished. And it's my full authority to ensure that justice is served. I want my community safe. And I'm sure they feel the same way as well. I'm not sure you are aware of how crime has went down tremendously. It's down 90%. All because of Sozo himself. I don't buy it. Everybody goes religious when they're about to go to jail or they're in jail. I'm sorry, Alex. I am just not convinced that he's sincere. Thank you. I need a moment before I issue judgment. Judge Beckham. Sorry, but what is this? These are the petitions from the community. They're asking mercy on Sozo. How many are there? There's quite a few of them. I need to get some more? No, no, please. Give me a moment. Judge. I see. Judge. I see what helpsnisse..... Judge. I see. Judge. Judge, I say, I'm a changed man. But I'm not that man anymore. Alex, he took me and he showed me the love of God. What's up, man? You alright? I'm good, man. You still? I ain't gonna lie, bro. I'm scared, bro. Man, fret not, for God is forever will be. Man, what happened to me? I'm scared, bro. Man, fret not, for God is forever will be. Man, whatever happened out there today, don't let it get you down. Cause man, you did a great job. Man, you went out and did some things that people thought about doing. But you, you had the nerve to just go out and do it. And man, no matter what, it's gonna be well. I just wanna thank you for everything, man. I mean, for real, I mean... You showed me so much. You gave me so much. You showed me the way, the truth, and the life, Alex. You showed me the true love of God. And for that... I'm forever grateful, man, for real. Like I said, I just came in here to check on you, man. To see how you was doing. And I'ma leave it to yourself. That you have a few moments. Alright, brother. Stay up. You too, man. Hey, Sozo. What's up, man? One thing I forgot to tell you, man. I forgive you. And I also want you to know, man. I love you. There's love over here too, man. For real. Keep your head up. For sure. All rise. Please all be seated. I understand we are here today to render justice for Sozo Mathis. For the death of... Along with... I didn't kill him. You were with the man that did. He's dead now. So they're charging you with it. You're facing 40 years up to life in prison. Is there anything that you would like to say? Before we render justice? Yes, there is something that I would like to say. Judge. Community. I've done some terrible things in my life. Things that... The word sorry just doesn't fit the sincerity that I have. It doesn't express the true regret... that I have for some of these things that I've done. To be truthful, Your Honor, I'm still in the game. What? Excuse me? Not the game that goes around robbing hard-working men, hard-working women. Not the game that kills innocent mothers, fathers, daughters, sons. No, not that game. But I'm in the game that's been ordained by Jesus Christ to preach the gospel. All right. All right. To preach the word of his kingdom. I'm here to show the world the answer to all these crimes. And what's that answer? The answer is the unconditional love of Jesus Christ. Only then we can forgive the ones who hurt us. Only then we can forgive the ones who've done us wrong. And only then we will be able to treat others better than we treat ourselves. And to everyone that I've hurt, robbed, held at gunpoint, I just ask, from the depths of you all's heart, can you forgive me? Thank you. Above all, Judge, I'm here to show the world the unconditional love of Christ so that they may receive him. There was a man who had every right to ignore me, to give up on me. Every right to ignore me. But the love of Jesus Christ brought him to me. He showed me the way, the truth, and the light. And for that, I'm determined to give the rest of my God-given life and show the world the answer. The unconditional love of Jesus Christ. Order, order. This is a courtroom, not an acceptance speech. Will the defendant please rise? That was a good speech, Mr. Mathis, but a little bit late. I found you guilty on all charges. Hold on, hold on. In all my years of doing this, I've never met a man that not only turned his life around, but also turned a whole city around. The old Mathis, he's guilty. The new Mathis, created in Christ. God told me, you're not guilty. Uncuff him and let him go. Uncuff him and let him do a more.... And so, I'm July. Man, how the business going, man? Boy, the business taking off, bud. That's what's up. For real? That's what's up. I already knew it would, man. It ain't the same without you, though, bruh. Bruh, I know you'll do well, man. They got a bright young man leading them, man. You already know that. Man, I been meaning to tell you, bruh, that's a brave thing that you're doing, too, bruh. Man, I can't take back what I did, man. Man, just turning myself in, just feel like it's the right thing to do, you know, man? For real, man, just got to do it, man. Yeah. But, though, man, I ain't even going front. I'm going to keep it 100 with you. Ain't no need for me to sugarcoat nothing. You know how we always been. Yeah, for sure. Up until this point. Bruh, I'm kind of nervous, man. What? I'm scared, man. I'm early years, man. Man, bruh. Fear not, bruh. I know exactly what you're going through, bruh. But God going to be with you every step of the way. Man, I pray so, man. It was for a fact he'd been with you, man. Folks are talking about 40 years, man. 40 years, right? Mercy it was, boy. I'm talking about... Can I ask you something, man? What's up? Man, you think you pray for me, man? That's too easy, man. God... God... We just want to thank you for bringing two brothers together... With two totally different backgrounds. Hey, get the back down! Back down! We at Spain's house, man. Look, they're shooting at us, man. We need that you get here, bruh. I just want you to know, bruh. No matter what happen, I forgive you, bruh. Shoot. Man. You ready to die today? Yeah. Man, do what you gotta do. Drop the weapon! Not today, preacher. You took over my hood, my city, my drugs, everything. Come on, Tico. Drop the weapon. It don't have to end like this. I've been waiting a long time for this, preacher. God can save your soul, too. Huh. Nah. So your boy about to die today. I love you, man. I love you, man. I don't know how to say what I want to say. And the words won't do justice anyway. How I can't close my eyes and not think of you. That never changes. No matter what I do. Singing high... I still trust you. I still trust you. She's breathing. She's breathing. She's breathing. No matter where I do, I know. And of all of the things in this life that I adore. I wish I told you I need you and love you so much more. I want to lay there beside you, I'll hold you in. Babies...
