Education
 Hey guys, Jason, Longbottom Farm, part-time farmer. Today we are buying used equipment. Just going to show you some of the equipment we're getting, why we're getting it, and some tips and strategies that might help you if you're bootstrapping, you're looking for used stuff. I think this video will give you some value. All right, let's get into it. Real quick, we have a newsletter, The Sunday Solopreneur. This comes out every Sunday about 10 a.m. I talk about how to market your products on your farm, how to use social media and websites to grow your farm. I also talk about farming, raising cattle, chickens, pigs. We go through it all, and it's about building your farm business. Sign up now, and you'll also get a free PDF on how to use ChatGPT to write your social media, to write your newsletters, and to help write product descriptions for your products. This is free download for signing up for the newsletter. One newsletter every one to two weeks. No spam, I promise. Check it out. I think you'll get a lot of value in learning to grow your farm or homestead, and it's free. All right, back to the video. All right, so you can see behind me here, I've got this cattle feeder. It's basically, it's four panels put together with some skids on it. We have been unrolling hay, and a lot of it has been just being wasted. It's been so wet. It gets nasty on the ground, and we're just wasting a lot. So I'm looking for another way to improve how much hay we're utilizing and minimizing waste, and I think these guys are going to be great. We've got four of these guys coming. They're all a little different, but in essential, it's four creep feeders on skids. I've been telling you guys I was thinking about doing some fence line feeders. Well, I'm going to be able to use these to do that, and we're going to have a couple feeders for our horses. These are on skids, so I can move them around for the cattle, and I'm still going to unroll hay at times, but I just find, especially when it's really wet, getting your tractor, getting your gator out on the pasture really just makes a mess, and so for that reason, I'm looking for a simpler way that I can actually feed hay without going into the pasture, and that's where these guys come in. They'll be on the other side of the fence, and I may even have a gate that opens right into it that then from outside in the parking lot where I'm at now, I can put my hay bales into this that sticks out into the pasture, and I can probably get two, easily three hay bales into this, so now I'm not tearing up the pasture. Being more efficient because I can put three bales out now, which means I may not have to do anything for two days, where right now I'm having to put out a bale, sometimes two bales every day. That's where we're at. We have got these two, four of these guys coming, and then I was also able to get two running gears. These I've really needed because we have a ton of hay down on the river, and I need the hay up here, and it's a 55-acre property, so it's not huge, but still hauling two hay bales at a time from one side of the property to the other takes forever, so we needed a way to be more efficient and get those hay bales up here. I'm going to show you the running gears here. I'm getting ready to go pick these up. I've got to pick up three more of these guys, then we'll bring the two running gears back. It's about four or five miles down the road, so it's not a huge trip to bring the stuff back, and that brings me into getting to know your community. You can easily find deals on Facebook, Craigslist, eBay. There's lots of things you can look for, but it's nothing better than getting to know people in your community. One, because you don't have to travel far. I have traveled three, even six hours at times, sometimes for equipment, for things I really needed, and getting to know people around you makes that a whole lot easier if you don't have to do that. I have been looking for a long time for these panels, and I've been looking for running gear, and I found some, but they're like three hours away, and just hauling a running gear back, I have to go kind of slow. Yes, I've got a trailer here, but it's just, it's a lot of work, and if I can find literally five miles down the road someone doing it, it saves time, saves gas, it saves money. So just being in with your community is a great way to just find other farmers that support what you're doing, other homesteaders that support what you're doing, and can be a great opportunity to find equipment. So just using your community. Try to get in with community. Some ways you can do that are one, community functions. There's things like Chamber of Commerce. Some people will go to that. A lot of events through the extension offices, and those events are a good place to meet farmers, especially if it's like working cattle, or whatever you're doing. Your local county extension is going to have some kind of program for that, and that's another good way to meet people near you, or they're doing what you're doing as well. Facebook groups, again, not a huge fan of Facebook, but the groups are a nice function. You can find local groups, usually based on county or city, and get to know people through there. Your local church. Church is a great place to find community, to find people that want to support you, to find people you can actually help support. Works both ways. Those are some ways of getting involved in your community, in turn, opening up opportunities to you that you may not have had otherwise. All right, we got that guy in place. I'm trying to just get them all out of the way now, and I've got three more of these and two hay wagons. So let's get on the road. Let's get that other one, and we'll talk about the pros and cons of bootstrapping versus buying new. All right. All right, it's day two. I've got my microphone, so hopefully this is going to sound a little better. It's also really windy, so if that comes through, I apologize. But we were going to talk about, we got the other two picked up. I went and picked these up yesterday, but then it was just losing light, and it wasn't a good time to shoot the video. So we've got two more on here, one big feeder, and then another square feeder back here. And we were going to talk about what are the pros and cons of buying new versus buying used. So first, let's talk about the pros of buying used. One is just lower cost. Obviously, buying used, you're going to get things much cheaper than you do if you're buying new. This is helpful if you're trying to stretch a budget, if you have a tight budget, or if you've got a lot of things to buy, and you just got to do the best you can. Two is the potential for great deals. Again, sometimes you'll find people that really need to get rid of it because they need the money. They need to get rid of it because they have something else they want to buy. So they're willing to let it go for a lot cheaper and a lot better deal than what you would find even with other used things or definitely with new. So getting a great deal is another reason to look for things used, to make offers on things used. Again, sometimes you can come across some really good deals. The depreciation advantage. That's another huge one. When you buy something brand new and you take that off the lot, that's your biggest jump in depreciation. It's like a new car. Thousands of dollars typically in value just got lost just by taking it off the lot. By buying something new, that cost of the new item, that depreciation is already factored in. So when you're getting it used, typically it's going to hold its value, meaning you're going to buy it for a certain price. And when you go to sell it, it's not going to depreciate much more. Because that's already happened. That's not always the case. But for most farm equipment, I have found that used equipment tends to get to a point and that's where it stays. Again, prices may actually rise over time, times like these, inflation, different things. But for the most part, these things are going to hold their value and you're not going to lose a big chunk of money in depreciation. Availability is another big reason to buy used. A lot of these you find on Facebook, Craigslist, wherever you're looking. And they're available right now. Someone's trying to sell it. All you got to do is go get it. Many times for new equipment, especially if it's specialized equipment or you want some specific features, that's something that then has to be ordered, has to be shipped in, and you have to wait on that. And then also sometimes they're going to deliver it to your house. So you have to wait on that as well. Buying used, you can get it right away. You can get it that same day. So availability, another big reason to check into used stuff. And the last point I want to make about used, and this could go both ways, but customizations. A lot of times farmers have bought something, like for instance, these feeders I have here, these are technically just rails. They are flat panels, almost like fence panels. But these have been put together in a square. They've been welded together. They have wooden skids on the bottom, you can see here. And these are modifications that the previous farmer made that is a big help to me because now I don't have to do any of that. I can move them around. It's exactly what I wanted, was a portable feeder that I could move around. Again, when you buy stuff new, you're going to do all this labor. You're going to buy all this work. And so buying used, again, a lot of the modifications that you may want have already been done. Now, that can't be a double-edged sword in that maybe things were done you don't want done, and you just want the panels, so you've got to take it apart. Sometimes modifications too are not done very well, and they're not going to last, and they could actually cause damage to the product, but then it's not serving the function you need it to. So that just goes both ways, but something to consider if you do find, like for instance, we found these feeders, perfect modifications that I wanted, and it's going to save me a lot of time, and I saved a lot of money from buying them new. So just modifications, something to think about when you're looking for stuff used, and I found historically have been a big benefit with used equipment. Now let's talk about a few of the cons with buying new stuff. One is just hidden problems. Things you don't see, obviously these things have been used. Weldings may not be in good shape. Wood may be rotting, and there's just a lot of hidden things that can come along with this. So something to consider. Again, it's one of the cons to buying used stuff is that you really need to look it over good, and it helps if you don't know a lot to take someone with you that does. Your tip top? No. This is my wife Lexi, so she's going to move the horses so that I can then put one of these feeders in the horse pasture. All right, back to cons of buying used stuff. Another one would be a warranty. Again, a lot of new stuff that you buy comes with a warranty within a certain period. Therefore, if something goes wrong, you kind of have an insurance policy that it will get fixed for free. Again, buying used stuff, you're not going to get that. So it's something to think about, especially if you're not mechanically inclined and you're buying a used tractor. It may not be the best choice. Again, if you want to learn to work on it, fine. But if you're in the middle of the season and you just need the equipment to work so you can get done what you need to get done, then it may not be the best idea. So just something to think about is there's not going to be any warranty with this stuff. If that's important to you, you might want to consider buying new. Advanced features. Again, this applies more to mechanical equipment, tractors, hay balers. A lot of the newer stuff is going to have newer technology that's supposed to make things life easier. I guess one could argue that it also means you can't work on it and you have to take it in to get it fixed, which is going to cost you more. Right to repair laws, that's a whole other topic. But used equipment is typically not going to be as up to date. Now, that said, if you're buying hay rakes, if you're buying plows and discs and feeders like this, there's not really a lot of technology to go with that. That's not a big issue. But if you are buying mechanical equipment, one of the cons could be that the technology has improved vastly since the equipment has been created. So just something you may want to consider. Again, sometimes that can be a double-edged sword where those chips and all that stuff really just makes it more expensive to work on. You can't work on it and it's just going to cost you a lot more in the long run. But if you like bells and whistles, that might be something to think about. Spare parts. Again, this is another one that goes to certain equipment that you're buying. Tractors, rare things. You may not be able to get the parts to fix it. Or it may be one of those deals where if it does break down, you are going to need to wait a while to get parts. I have a John Deere tractor. And it's not because I'm a huge John Deere fan. It's because there are three John Deeres within 20 minutes of me that I can get to if I need it to get fixed and I need parts. So I know that if it needs to be fixed, I can get it fixed quick. Typically, one of them will have the parts on hand and I'm not without it for a while. I have no brand loyalty really to any of them. It's just that the John Deere has a lot of stores and it's convenient as far as getting parts. And I know if something goes down, I can get it fixed. It's not to say other ones don't. I just don't. The nearest Mahindra, Ford, New Holland, all of those are about an hour away from me. And so for that reason, that's why I don't use those. I'm not saying it's right or wrong. And some people love one tractor over another. For me, that was the decision to buy a John Deere was because parts were available and they were close to me in case I needed service if I had issues. But when you're buying, especially older equipment, sometimes parts can be really difficult. So just something to take into consideration when you're buying used equipment is if this breaks, try to think about if parts of it were to break, can you get replacement parts for it? And then the last one, this isn't really a con, but if you're buying anything new, just make sure you take the time to inspect it. If you're not familiar with equipment, try to read about it, learn about it so that that way, when you do go to look at it, you have an idea of its value. You have an idea of its condition and that'll help you make a better decision. The last thing you want to do is see something you think that's what you want and then you buy it and get it home. And then you realize it's not because something's completely broke. Something's completely wrong. So just try to know what it is you're buying. Do a little research. Again, you can't know everything. If it's something like, hey, bailers, and you've got some good friends that do, hey, maybe take them with you and they can look it over and tell you things. I am very mechanically uninclined, meaning I don't know much about mechanical stuff. I'm not good at it. It's something I've wanted to learn. I have actually bought old equipment to use and learn on, but I just found that it was days of not being productive. And then I ended up taking it to the dealer anyways. It's just something to think about. For me, mechanical equipment is a big hindrance. And when I look for equipment, I'm typically buying things that come with a warranty or new when it comes to an engine or something mechanical. So the time and effort to inspect stuff, just something to think about when you're buying something new is just to make sure you know what you're looking at or somebody with you does. That'll help you make a much better decision. Now, a couple other things, buying new versus buying used. With buying new, sometimes you have financing options. You won't have that with buying used. Again, we talked about the modern technology. That can be updated. You can get better performance, obviously. If something's new, it tends to be new and it should run a lot better, especially if it's something engine related than something used. Not always the case, but I would expect a new engine to perform flawlessly. Versus I may have to do some maintenance, do some things to get an older engine to work. Longevity is another thing. Obviously, if you're buying new, it doesn't already have the wear and tear. So sometimes when you're buying older stuff, there is already a lot of wear and tear, bearings, belts, chains, different things, parts of an engine. Just metal itself can be rusted, which can cause problems. Buying new again, typically I associate that with longer longevity. Again, not always the case, but something to think about. And then a couple of cons with buying new is one, the high cost. Again, buying new, you're going to pay higher costs. Buying used, a lot of times you can find better deals. And if you're stretching a budget, again, that's important. We talked about depreciation and longer wait times. Again, that's going to come with new stuff. And to me, those are downsides, obviously, to buying new. Overkill is something a lot of people don't think about, but a lot of times, especially if you're buying a tractor, it's easy to, you're financing it. So they're going to give you as much money as you want and you got to pay it back. And you're like, oh, I can make that monthly payment. And you think of it more in monthly terms rather than longer, how much you're actually paying. But the bells and whistles, you may not need. A lot of times with used equipment, you're getting just what you need. And it doesn't have the bells and whistles, which may sometimes not be the best, but you're getting what you need. Where sometimes buying new, they're easily going to, you know, a cup holder or air conditioning, different things, radio, they may throw different things in there that technically you don't need, but you're going to end up paying more for. So another thing to think about is just overkill when you're buying new equipment. Again, some of the new tractors today are almost luxury when you're inside. So it's just something to consider when purchasing new versus old, if that's important to you or not. And to be aware that you might not need all the bells and whistles and the things that are on new. The goal is to get the job done. And sometimes used will do that just perfectly. All right. That was a lot on new and used. We are going to drive the trailer over. We're going to get these things unloaded and into the pasture. And then the final thing I'm going to talk about is for my farm, what I did buy new and what I did buy used and why. But before we do that, actually, we're going to go take one of the brand new, well, used creep feeders that we got. We're going to pull it into the pasture. We're going to put a couple of hay bales in it and get it ready for the cattle to use for the first time. So here we go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. in this paddock and that way this is horse area horses can eat from both sides we still give them some good hay as far as bales and stuff but we like to have some round bales out some of my best round bales uh they're not still great but great for cows horses are picky won't get into that but that way we can have hay in here more for them we're right now just tearing hay off of bales and bringing it in and it's just the labor is killing us that said we could put hay bales in here but then they just they tend to spread it all out and just waste so much of it so i digress i'm gonna get to that project after this but i wanted to talk about what i have bought new and used what i would recommend buying new and used just based on my experience and hopefully it'll help you if you're thinking about getting any farm equipment for your farm so the first one and i'm going to kind of lump two of these things together is tractor atv i bought these new why because i am very mechanically uninclined i do not know much about mechanics i've changed oil i've fuel filters different things like that but it's still a process of having to watch a video it takes me probably 10 times as long as it would take a professional to do it and it's just one of those things that i have acknowledged i am not great at because i don't have the time to put into it so for that reason i bought my tractor and my gator new and if you're not very much into mechanical stuff i recommend you do the same based on my experience because that way you'll have something you shouldn't depend on the worst thing is to spend money and then have the thing you spent money on not do the job you needed to do tractor and atv are probably the most two important things i have around here you can see behind me we move this but we move hay bales like full skids chicken houses we move things it's just we need both of them all right why the abrupt change of scenery well while i was shooting that part i was just talking about the phone died so i am on my phone i was using my wife's phone because last video my phone fell over and it broke the little adapter for my microphone so now this isn't even functioning it's just here so this may not sound as good audio quality but i'm using my phone now because i needed to finish this and sometimes you get it as a farmer things break gotta do what you gotta do so let's get back to it tractor atv bought new recommend you buying new if you don't have mechanical experience obviously if you have mechanical experience get you a good deal get used used is great these things will run forever but with use you do have to have some technical experience you need to know what to anticipate and some expertise in that hay balers i bought my hay baler used with no knowledge how to use a hay baler that said older hay balers or i don't i'm not saying they're simple at all but you can find videos and they all function pretty similarly i know where all the points are what i did was i bought mine old and i got a deal that's why i did this again buying used to get a deal i got a baler a rake a tedder all of that which was a great deal and i thought about just selling it flipping it but i wanted to make hay i've showed y'all some videos we did have something break there's a donkey right there making noise we did have a hay baler break i did a video you can check that out up here we were able to get it fixed i learned what i needed to learn with that and so far so good and that's something could go either way obviously a new baler you get things like new computers and you can get net wrapped there's many different features and i won't even say bells and whistles because i would prefer to have a net wrap i think it's better for the hay i think it protects it more i have string wrap and if you know you leave that out which we do because i don't have a hay barn you do lose some of that haying is one of those things that go either way we bought ours used i would like to buy new new hay balers are very expensive if it's net wrap versus string net wrap is typically thousands more so that's something you have to decide for yourself i bought used i got a great deal and i decided to go through the learning curve of learning what i needed to needed to do and it's worked out great so far pumps and irrigation systems i recommend having new pumps if you can just because that pump fails you don't have water going and then that's just an expense you're going to have to pull that pump if you're using a well putting another one down so if you're just putting in an ag well something like that obviously just get new that's sort of a no-brainer there as far as the ball waterers and stuff if you can find those used great they have very few mechanical parts on the inside and they're all pretty similar so they're pretty cheap to replace if they need replacing so if you can find ball waterers and ground things sure get those used livestock handling equipment could go either way on that squeeze chutes fencing all of that i tend to buy it by used if i can find post someone's used as long as they're in decent condition i'll buy them if i can find fence wire that's been rolled up and it looks like in good shape i'll buy it squeeze chute as long as it's in good shape not too rusty i would consider it we bought our squeeze chute new just because at the time it was about four years ago they were running a sale we knew we wanted one and just went ahead and pulled the trigger and got it that said we built all the lanes and stuff that was kind of diy i've got a video to that too you can see that down below on our diy cattle working pin so that's a decision again you have to make for yourself i find that squeeze chutes fencing a lot of that stuff depreciates a little bit but tends to just hold its value i didn't really see a lot of squeeze chutes and stuff that i could get for a lot cheaper than i could get new so that was another reason we went with new if you find someone that's selling one used and it's in good condition usually it's going to hold its value pretty well and it's going to be close to new anyways now the only difference in that is if you come across like we got a tractor supply one and it's great but it doesn't have all of the features that some of the higher end ones like your arrow quip your preverts have so it works great for us what i like to upgrade at some point yes things like tagging ears and stuff they have things that hold the chin hold the head more still again you don't have to have it but when i'm working with cattle i like to be as safe as possible and i think some of those features of the higher end squeeze chutes will give you that benefit so that's another thing to consider and again it's just a personal decision if you go and use just check it out make sure take somebody with you if you don't know that does know how they work they can inspect all the parts make sure everything's in good working order new you know it'll be new usually comes with a warranty again personal preference on that one pretty much anything small engine i try to buy new just because again i'm not very mechanically inclined and that is just in my context if you have mechanical skills if you know someone that has mechanical skills then used may very well be a better decision to do again for me anything pretty much it has an engine i'm buying new but for you take your situation into context if you have the skills get it used if not go new where do you already talked about fencing materials i tend to buy used waters troughs any kind of feeding stuff like the ones i just showed you in this video i try to find used i find that they still hold up well provided they're not too rusted out it's one of those things that you just get a much better deal again the ones we got were already custom welded into what i needed it to be so it just worked out perfect that stuff though tends to hold up very well and waters feeders troughs different things like that that don't have mechanical parts i tend to look for used and then things like hand tools rakes shovels fence clippers bolt cutters you know all that stuff i tend to look for used as well sometimes you just you need it on the spot and you need to go buy it new but i find free markets estate sales a lot of that stuff you can find a ton of that stuff for a really good price it's one of those things try to think of beforehand if you're doing fencing you know you're going to need cutters you know you're going to need pliers and different things go ahead and think about that if an auction comes up check it out those are things i would preemptively get because if you're doing fencing you're going to need them if you're working on small engines you're going to need tools and it's just you can save a lot of money and get really good deals by looking for these things online there's lots of other equipment i could go on and on but the main important thing is that context matters if you have mechanical skills then used mechanical stuff is going to be good for you you're going to get a good deal and you're going to know if this is easy to repair not easy to repair and if it needs stuff done you're going to be able to do it if you're not mechanically inclined then yes you can get some great deals but you're likely going to lose any money you saved and paying someone to fix the problems that arise just my experience with that you have to take it into your context though everybody's context is different you can watch all these videos there's a ton of videos i have a ton of videos there's a lot of farmers that put out videos but we all have different contexts meaning we have different knowledge levels we have different skill sets and those things dictate what we buy new what we buy used what we need what we don't need i'm just explaining my context and what i have found farming for the last eight years and i'm sharing it with you just to hope that it helps again not necessarily because i'm doing it but i'm trying to present both sides of it just to just to give you things to think about when you're doing this so hopefully you don't make mistakes you don't jump into something quick or you buy something that you need that doesn't work or something that you don't need that does work and it's just not serving a purpose if you want to see a video of the day in the life of us using a lot of this equipment that i've talked about in this video check out this video here and we'll catch you in the next one
