Howto & Style
 You gotta stop storing your berries in these containers. Here's how to make them last for up to two weeks. Fresh cold water. Open this up, pop it on in, give it a good shakeruski. Essentially what's happening is all of that dirt is sinking to the bottom of the bowl. Take any container that you have, and we're gonna line it with paper towel. Grab the berries, lift them out, so all that dirt sinks to the bottom. Look at that, gross. And that is the magic of using a bowl of water to clean your produce. You're gonna take another paper towel, fold it, place it right on top, seal these, and store them upside down in your refrigerator. All that water is going to drip to the bottom, and you're going to have berries that stay fresh for up to two weeks.
