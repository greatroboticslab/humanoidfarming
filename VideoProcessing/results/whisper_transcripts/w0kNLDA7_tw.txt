 I'm Brownfield Commodity Market Reporter John Perkins at the Opening Market Minute for Tuesday, July 1. Soybeans and corn are lower to start Tuesday's session. With the USDA's quarterly grain stocks and planted area numbers out of the way, the trade is back to focusing on the weather. And the weather in most key U.S. growing areas does look non-threatening over the near term. Development is right along schedule for both corn and soybeans. The corn crop condition rating did see an improvement over the past week, while soybeans held steady. USDA's next round of supply, demand and production numbers is out on the 11th. Wheat is modestly higher in Chicago and Kansas City. The USDA's winter wheat crop condition rating dipped a little bit over the past week, and the winter wheat harvest pace continues to be slower than the five-year average due to rainfall in parts of the Midwest and Plains. Live and feeder cattle are down on profit-taking, waiting for direct cash cattle business to get underway. It's a pretty typical Tuesday so far, with no bids or asking prices as of yet. Widespread trade is probably going to wait until at least Wednesday. Boxed beef did close mixed on Monday afternoon. And hogs are lower on follow-through selling and Monday's lower close in the pork carcass cutout value. Still a lot of questions about demand ahead of a big grilling weekend. With the Opening Market Minute for Tuesday, July 1st, I'm Brownfield Commodity Market reporter John Perkins. Stay tuned for this afternoon's update.
