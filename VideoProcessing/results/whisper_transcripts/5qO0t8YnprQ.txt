 When is the best time to plant onions? For optimal results, the goal is to sow onion seeds between early to mid-September. If you plant them later, the seedlings may not grow enough to survive the winter. By early November, you can start transplanting the seedlings. Be sure to water them after planting. In winter, you usually don't need to as they can rely on moisture in the soil. By May of the following year, you should be ready to harvest your onions. If you want large, robust onions, you need to focus on keeping their nutrients concentrated in the roots. When the onion stems reach a certain thickness, you should position them to prevent excessive nutrient transfer to the leaves which can hinder root swelling. It's important to perform this task in the afternoon or at noon. If you try in the morning, the onions will still be full of juice and moisture, making them more prone to splitting. Follow me daily.
