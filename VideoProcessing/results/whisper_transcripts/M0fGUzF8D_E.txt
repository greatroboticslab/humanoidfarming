So thankful God made me a farmhand.

 So God made a farmer who planting time and harvest season will finish his 40-hour week by Tuesday noon and then painting from tractor back put in another 72 hours. So God made a farmer. God had to have somebody willing to ride the ruts at double speed to get the hay in ahead of the rain clouds and yet stop in midfield and race to help when he sees the first smoke from a neighbor's place. It had to be somebody who'd plow deep and straight and not cut corners, somebody to seed, weed, feed, breed, and break, and disc, and plow, and plant, and tie the fleece, and strain the milk, and replenish the self-feeder, and finish a hard week's work with a five-mile drive to church. Somebody who'd bale a family together with the soft, strong bonds of sharing, who would laugh, and then sigh, and then reply with smiling eyes. When his son says that he wants to spend his life doing what dad does. So God made a farmer.
