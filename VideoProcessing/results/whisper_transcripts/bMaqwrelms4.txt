Howto & Style
 There are as many ways to plant vegetables as there are gardeners to plant them. And it's not that a lot of people are doing it wrong, it's just that there's a lot of options on how you can plant them. Sometimes it's a specific technique for a particular situation, but most of the time it's just because we've all learned different ways. And over the years, we've adapted to what works best for us in our gardens. I'm Kyle from Urban Farmstead, and in this video I'm going to show you some of my favorite summer vegetables and how I plant them. All right, let's start with tomatoes, because I don't even think you can have a summer vegetable garden without growing tomatoes. I mean, maybe you can, but I definitely can't. And technically speaking, they're botanically a fruit, but we call them vegetables and we won't get into that. For now, let's go over how I plant my tomatoes. I usually plant my tomatoes about 18 inches apart, and yes, I do actually measure it. Sometimes, but it's not necessary. And as long as you plant your tomatoes anywhere from 12 inches to 24 inches apart, they'll be just fine. Then I'll dig a hole about twice as deep as the container that it's growing in. And I'll pinch off the lower branches, because I don't want those branches or any leaves coming in contact with the soil. See all these little hairs along the stem? These will actually turn into roots if they come in contact with the soil. So that's why we plant tomatoes deep, unlike most other plants. Anytime you transplant something, you have to loosen up the root ball because as these little seedlings grow, their roots reach the edge of the pot. They start circling around the plant, and that's not what you want them to do. You want the roots to reach out. So loosen them up. You'll break a few off. It's fine. They'll grow back. Just loosen them up as much as possible. Then I like to add a handful of organic starter fertilizer to the soil. Now you don't need to add fertilizer at this point. But I've found that adding a little bit of starter fertilizer not only helps to get the plants off to a nice little head start, but it also prevents transplant shock. Especially if you just brought them home from a nursery where they were in a coddled environment under some shade cloth, getting watered every day, in well-drained potting soil, and now all of a sudden they're in this new environment in your garden which may or may not be as comfortable. And then sometimes I'll remove the flowers so that the plant can focus its energy on root production, which is its main priority at this time. And the last thing I do is water the plants in. But I don't just water them in with regular water. I like to water them in with either liquid kelp or a liquid kelp and fish emulsion blend like this organic blend from EB Stone. And the reason I use this is the same reason I use the starter fertilizer. It helps them get off to a great start and it reduces transplant shock. If you've been following along on Instagram you might recognize this little tomato sprout. I planted this plant about a week and a half ago and when I did I accidentally snapped the stem. Not all the way through but about 90% of the way through. So there was just a little piece of skin holding the top section onto the root system. So what I did was I planted it extra deep. I buried the soil all the way up the stem. That way I'm holding it together and encouraging it to regrow and reconnect together. And it's a good thing that tomato plants sprout new roots from their stems because that's the only thing keeping this alive right now. I also removed some of its leaves so it wouldn't have as much vegetative growth to support as it was trying to heal itself. And like I said it's been about a week and a half and it's still alive so I think there's hope. There's no shortage of options for ways that you can support your tomato plants. And if you grow indeterminate tomatoes in an area where tomatoes grow well you know that those flimsy little tomato cages just won't do. So stay tuned for an upcoming video on how I'm trellising our tomatoes. Next up tomatillos. Now tomatillos are a less popular close relative of tomatoes and sometimes they're even called husk tomatoes because they're sort of like a green tomato inside a husk. And they're one of my favorite things to grow because they thrive through our summer heat and continue to put on fruit even when a lot of the tomato varieties can't. So they're going to be planted pretty much the same way as I plant our tomatoes. Again I normally plant them about 18 inches apart but anywhere from 12 to 24 inches will do and I don't usually measure. Then I'll dig a deep hole as I did with the tomato plant then add some organic starter fertilizer. Then I'll break up the root ball and I'm adding this mycorrhizal fungi which I didn't talk about with the tomato video but this stuff is so rad that I'm going to make an entire video on it. For now just know that it really helps establish that root system and if you're not familiar with this stuff and using it already in your garden do yourself a favor do some googling this stuff is awesome. The most important tip I can give you if you're new to growing tomatillos is that you need to plant at least two plants in order to get good pollination. Now it took me a couple seasons to learn this. I planted one plant I got great flowers great plant no fruit at all and then found out I needed to plant two ever since then had great harvests. When it comes to peppers there's no shortage of options everything from burn your face off spicy like the Trinidad scorpion and Carolina reaper to completely mild like a carmen pepper or a gypsy pepper and everything in between. We plant a little bit of each we plant the really spicy ones I like to make hot sauce with them. We have some milder ones with some heat and some that are completely mild that we use fresh or canned or pickled all sorts of ways. So let me show you how I plant our peppers. Most seed packs and seedling tags will recommend a planting distance for everything but remember that that's a recommendation. I've found that for me planting most pepper varieties about 12 inches apart works great but for some of the larger varieties 18 inches gives them a better yield so just try different things in your garden and see what works best for you. Peppers are actually in the same family as the tomatoes and the tomatillos they're in the nightshade family and they are actually pretty similar but I don't plant them exactly the same. The difference is that I don't plant them deeply I don't plant them up the stem because while they will actually produce some roots along their stem they don't do it as consistently as tomatoes and tomatillos and sometimes they'll damper off or rot if you plant them too deep. So I just plant them at the same level as they were in their container but I do often choose to remove the flowers when I plant them in order to redirect their energy to establishing a healthy root system and sometimes I'll even snip off the entire top of the plant. And I know this probably seems really extreme for people who aren't familiar with this process but what it does is it redirects the energy from that upward vegetative growth to more lateral fruiting growth and you'll get a branch from each of those leaf nodes so it'll create a more bushy plant that has more flowers and more fruit and even more leaves to protect your peppers from sun scolding. Now top pruning your peppers is not a requirement it's absolutely an optional step but I highly recommend trying it out at least with a few of your peppers I think you're really going to like the results. When it comes to squash there are really two main varieties there are winter squash and summer squash. Summer squash are like your zucchini, your crookneck squash, your zephyr squash, all those bushy plants with the soft skin that we normally eat fresh. And then winter squash are larger vining plants that either trail out or climb up a trellis and they have hard skin and are great for preserving. And we cook them differently and they grow differently but I plant them the same. So let me show you how I plant our squash. I usually plant squash about 24 inches apart and it's not because their root systems necessarily need that much space. It's because the plants themselves get pretty large and will sprawl out. Now if I'm growing a winter squash up a trellis or something like that I might choose to plant them closer together but for this bed they're all going to be on the ground together so this way they'll share the space without crowding each other out. I chose this specific zucchini seedling from the nursery because I noticed that it had two plants growing in one pot and I want to show you how I deal with that because it's not good to plant them together. If you pull these apart gently you'll have two perfectly viable plants. They can be planted separately rather than together like this and this way they'll get a much better crop and they won't overcrowd each other. This can be done with any overcrowded seedling. I do it with peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, eggplant, all sorts of things and you will end up breaking off some of the roots but as long as you're not removing too many of the roots from the plant they'll grow back quickly and the plant will be just fine. So here's a summer squash and it's somewhat compact growing habit and here's a winter squash that was planted on the exact same day and you can see how it's already vining out and will be a much larger plant. I plant cucumbers the exact same way as I plant our squash and they'll have a very similar growing habit to winter squash. They have that vining habit so you can allow them to grow along the ground and take up that lateral space if you have it but I always choose to trellis my cucumbers. Not only does it help to save space but it's also better for the plants because it helps to increase airflow which reduces diseases and powdery mildew and things like that. It keeps the fruit off the ground so it doesn't rot as easily and it gets the flowers up there to the pollinators so I use different types of trellis systems throughout the garden wherever I can. Beans are one crop that I always direct sow and if you're not familiar with that term it just means planting a seed directly into the garden rather than starting it in a container and then transplanting it out. I'll usually soak the beans in a jar of water overnight before planting which isn't a requirement but I've found that it usually results in more consistent sprouting. These are Romano bush beans so they're self-supporting and won't require any type of trellising but I also grow pole beans which absolutely require trellising but other than that they're pretty much the same. Corn is another crop that I always direct sow and I don't grow it very often but I have found that it does much better if you plant it in blocks rather than in rows. All of my taller vining plants are planted in these single rows and soon I'll be adding a trellis down the center of each one so that the crop can be accessed from either side. I plant lower bushing plants in these wider beds in multiple rows so they can support each other as they grow. These beds are in a north to south orientation which provides optimal sunlight for each plant. And the last section here is our herb garden and it's kind of a hodgepodge of a lot of different stuff and I won't go over every single plant here but I do want to show you something with this basil. So basil can be top pruned just like your peppers so I'll just pinch it off on the top and this is how I harvest it anytime I use it and you can already see where those new branches will emerge from those leaf nodes. That will just create a more bushy basil plant that won't flower as soon and it'll be more tolerant to the heat. And the only other thing I'll mention about this herb garden is that I chose this specific location because it's close to our kitchen which is great because we use fresh herbs anytime we cook. I planted most of these vegetables a few weeks ago and they're starting to get pretty big so it's time for me to put up these trellises but that's going to be in a separate video so if you want to see that or any of the other upcoming videos on how I'm creating our new urban farmstead hit subscribe.
