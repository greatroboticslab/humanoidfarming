 Welcome to my channel, Sustainable Living for the Family, Health and Home. I'm a keeper of my home, homesteader, homeschooling mom and pediatrician. On this channel, we're going to discuss sustainable living practices to help you keep healthy, strong. We'll also be going through gardening tips, health and nutrition, natural remedies to keep you healthy and not break the bank, and so much more as I take you along on our journey on our homestead and within our home. Welcome to my channel and I hope to see you soon. Thank you.
