Science & Technology
 Thanks, Victoria, and thank you, Mark and the organizers. This has been fascinating. I'm not a microbiologist. I'm a plant biologist, so I'm definitely a bit of a fish out of water, but I've been learning so much here. And I think you'll see that a lot of the work that we're doing with crop production in space really has a lot of interactions with the microbiology, especially with what Karen was just talking about, maybe unfortunately. So I have a wonderful team that I work with at Kennedy Space Center. I also have team members here from Johnson Space Center. And it takes a village to get these projects done. So when we think about crop production in space, we are currently looking at fresh crops that we can pick and eat directly, these salad crops over here, maybe some herbs in the future, things that don't require a lot of processing. Farther downstream, if we have some cooking capability on space station, we might get to some of these, you know, minimal preparation processing crops like sweet potato and white potato, where we can start to augment the diet with more calories. But right now, we don't have any way to even cook on space station. So we're looking at fresh crops. crops like wheat, rice, soybeans. They require a lot more processing equipment. It would also require more crew time or more robotics and automation to prepare those foods. So that's farther out. You know, we can certainly grow them. But right now, we're supplementing the packaged food system. As we stay longer on planetary surfaces, perhaps we'll have a lot larger crop production capabilities. So right now on space station, we have a very small plant chamber called the Veggie. Veggie is a very low mass, low power piece of hardware. It's actually kind of a collapsible piece of hardware, so it doesn't take up a lot of launch volume. And the only powered components with Veggie are these LED lights at the top and some fans. Everything else is passive. So it only uses about 70 watts of power, which is pretty impressive. And it's 0.13 meters squared for growth volume. And you can see it's surrounded by a relatively kind of, you know, synthetic environment. When we first sent Veggie in 2014, we did some crop selection to figure out what would be the best candidate crop species for initial validation testing of this hardware. And we selected this Outregis red romaine lettuce and the perfusion zinnias. Both crops had reliable germination, rapid growth, and they're both pretty attractive. The lettuce additionally was selected as an edible crop because it has pretty low microbial levels on the leaves when grown in a controlled environment. So we thought it would be safe to eat without washing, and washing is a challenge in space. It's also fairly palatable and acceptable. Most people don't hate lettuce. It may not be your favorite crop, but, you know, it's not too disgusting. And because it's a red vegetable, it actually has higher levels of antioxidants than its green counterparts. We sent the zinnia because we wanted to test, you know, a flowering crop as well and have something that they wouldn't want to eat. So we sent two sets of the lettuce and one set of the zinnia for Veggie 1. And our very first test, Veggie 1A, was the red romaine lettuce. This was started right after the hardware was installed. And we were able to demonstrate plant growth in veggies. You know, new hardware. We needed to show it actually worked. We identified a lot of watering challenges. And that's really the name of the game when it comes to plant growth in space. But we were getting, we were able to get some samples back to do food safety analysis and to work with Mark and Grace Douglas and get approval by the flight surgeons and a lot of other groups at Kennedy or at Johnson to have the crew grow and eat a second set of crop. So here's Steve Swanson harvesting the very first set of lettuce that we grew. We only got three plants out of six to grow well. But you know, the three plants that grew actually looked pretty good. Steve was pretty proud of them. This was a big deal on space station too. All of the other astronauts and even the cosmonauts gathered around, stopped what they were doing, and came to watch the harvest. They wrapped up these samples, sent them back frozen at minus 80. We said, you know, don't eat any of it. They said afterwards, yeah, we tried a little bit. But that was when the cameras were off. So we got those samples back. We showed that the microbial levels were pretty low. We got approval to grow the second set and for the crew to eat them with a prophylactic sanitizing wipe. We have citric acid-based food safe wipes up there. So for the second growth, we got better mitigation of some of the water issues. We had the crew, you know, be very responsive for the watering. And we tested the sanitation of the produce with the sanitizing wipes and had produce consumed by the crew. But it was only half. We said we can have a leaf for you and a leaf for science because we still need to get the data on how the system is working and how it changes over time. So we got samples returned. And here you can see Chell Lindgren harvesting the second set of lettuce. It's a much more vigorous crop. We had all but one plant grow and the plant that didn't grow in this set was actually a hardware failure, not a biology failure. So that was pretty, pretty pleasing. So Chell had only been up there a short time and at this point he kind of didn't remember that you couldn't quite put things down where you thought they would stay, you know. So he was still getting used to the space environment. And you'll see that the leaves just don't stay where you put them. But after harvesting some of this produce he put it in between layers of the sanitizing wipes. They did what we call a press where we have these layers of wipes in a ziploc bag and they press it for 30 seconds and get contact of the leaves with the sanitizing wipes. They pull them out and then they were able to eat them. And so here's Scott Kelly, Kimia Yue and Chell doing their lettuce toast which looked a lot like the one Serena showed us. And you know they enjoyed it. They got to do this live on NASA TV which was pretty exciting. And they actually made some speeches which was really pretty neat. Like they'd obviously thought about this. So Scott talked about the logistical complexity of living and working in space and the long supply chain that's needed and how we have to become more self-sufficient with our food supply and sort of an engineering mindset. And Chell who's a physician was talking about the benefits of eating fresh food, the contribution of the plants to the ecosystem of the ISS and the psychological benefits of seeing green growing things in and he did say the sterile environment of the ISS which is something that Serena had also said. And as we all know it's not remotely sterile but it is very synthetic non-organic environment. And that's one of the benefits that Veggie has over previous plant chambers is this transparent wall. You can really see the plants growing. So that was pretty awesome and they were very excited and they wanted to grow another set of crops so we had the zinnias up there and we were able to have them grow these. And these were like the roller coaster of crops. We had really low lows and really high highs with these crops. But we were able to test flowering and seed formation. We really wanted to test a longer duration crops because we knew we'd need flowers to do fruit production for things like tomatoes and peppers in the future. And we identified some interesting airflow challenges and issues with the hardware which led to a buildup of excess water in the hardware and it gets exactly to what Karen was just talking about. And so we actually had the astronauts test fungal mitigation techniques and demonstrated crew gardening. So here's some of these water issues. You can see early on we didn't really know what was happening but we saw this buildup of excess water on the leaves. These are called gotation droplets where they come out of the very pores on the edges of the leaves called hydathodes. And we see this leaf curling. This is an epinastic response of plants to stress. And we thought well maybe we're just telling them to add too much water. You know. And we were basing things off of photos. We would get the photos you know three or four days after they were taken and we would have to give water predictions for three or four days in the future. So there was a major disconnect there. And then we get a call at four in the morning on December 22nd. I vividly remember that. That said you know Scott sees mold growing on the plants. And we're like uh oh. So there was this fungus that appeared on these massively abnormally growing plants. These don't look like any zinnias you would see in your garden. Some of the ones in the back you can't really see were completely stunted. And you can see these water patches. And so he was able to do some mitigation of this. He tried to remove the damaged tissue. Tried to sanitize. It wasn't until he reset the fans to increase the air flow. Because we thought well we just need to go from low fan speed to high fan speed. And we realized wow there really must not have been any air flow. And we later found out that this is a feature I guess you could call it of our hardware that when power is cut to it and it was cut at the third day of this experiment the rack had to be shut down for an unrelated reason. And the hardware comes back it looks like it all comes back on normally. The lights come back on. The indicators say that the fans are on. But the fans are actually not on. So we had no air flow with this experiment. And with no air flow in space you are diffusion limited. You know you have no natural convection. So without this forced convection the water was building up in here and causing as you can see a lot of problems. Scott once he took over and he said you know I should really be the one telling how much water to give to these plants because I'm here and I can see them. And we said yes that's exactly what we want. We want the astronauts involved and invested in this. He took over and Scott was able to grow some flowers. And when he did it was just a complete game changer. We went from this devastation of fungus to oh my god we have beautiful flowers. And here you see him and Mischa Koryenko with their 300 day in space memorial photos. And you know he's holding the zinnia. They had zinnias floating in the cupola and they had zinnias on the Russian dining table for dinner. Flowers at dinner at night. So that was really cool. He just wanted to take them everywhere. And you know these are called perfusion zinnias for a reason. We only had two plants left at this point. But when they flowered they really flowered. Oops. I'm not clicking right. Sorry. I don't mean to shoot you in the back with a laser pointer back there. We produced a ton of flowers with these. So we ended up with 28 flowers from two plants. And they were just beautiful when they weren't dead. So Scott asked if he could harvest on Valentine's Day. And we said yes of course. And then he asked if he could make a bouquet. And so he made a bouquet. He did the first ever on orbit flower arrangement. For Valentine's Day we got those flowers back from space. We actually let them air dry supposedly in a bag. And as you can imagine they don't air dry very well without convection. But we wanted to get viable seeds. So the flowers came back. They were totally covered with fungus. We tried to grow some of the seeds. Nothing grew. We put them in a desiccator in the fridge for a year. One of our interns this summer said hey can I try to grow some more of those? And we're like yeah sure but nothing's going to grow. And lo and behold we grew a ton of second generation plants. Once we dried the fungus out enough to keep it down. And here's a picture of his bouquet. We also were able to help enable art in space which is pretty awesome. So then this led to some additional tests. So we were going through the alphabet with the Veg03 series. We go to ABC. We had no Veg02. That's another long story. With Veg03 we looked at could we repetitively harvest from the same plant and not take up additional mass but increase the amount of food produced. That's called cut and come again harvesting. We also tried a new variety. This Tokyo Bacana Chinese cabbage which interestingly had a negative effect to the high CO2. It's the first plant variety that we've identified that does not respond well to high CO2. But first we did some more lettuce which Veg03a. Here's Shane Kimbrough doing some of the repetitive harvesting with lettuce. And then Peggy Whitson grew the Chinese cabbage. And she did it first for 28 days and then for 56 days with the repetitive harvesting. And here you see her with her cabin. And she was really happy. But you also see some sort of yellow and brown lesions on these leaves. And we have a collaboration with Purdue University as part of a grant. And the graduate student there identified that this was specifically a negative CO2 response. It took a lot of troubleshooting to really figure out what was going on here. So now we routinely test all our crops at the elevated CO2 level, 3,000 parts per million on average of space station. Very few plants do this. But of course the one variety that we picked was one that was sensitive to it. And the crew were able to eat these. They made some really innovative lobster salad lettuce wraps and cabbage wraps. And they enjoyed it and they tweeted about it. And so, you know, we got a lot of interesting dietary supplementation with this relatively small amount of produce. This led to Veg03D, E, and F where we first tried mixed cropping for the first time. And we have a second veggie unit installed on space station. So we did three mixed crops growing initially just in one unit. And then in both units simultaneously where we staggered the growth slightly so that we could do a relatively continuous harvesting when we were doing the cut and come again. Try to get more food over a longer duration. So here you can see the two veggies. And here's Scott Tingle with his garden growing. And so we've got green lettuce, red lettuce, and mizuna mustard in these. And he was able to harvest every three days or so for about a month. And for Veg03GHI, which are the series that's currently underway, we have some new crops on orbit. So we've sent red Russian kale. This is a kale that is very nutritious like all kales but actually tastes good like most kales don't. Dragoon lettuce, which Serena talked about. This was a small butterhead lettuce. Wasabi mustard. This is a brassica that's got that real strong wasabi flavor. It's quite strong but quite tasty if you like that flavor. Extra dwarf bok choy. This is a small bok choy, bok choy type variety that has really fleshy mid ribs and it's juicy and crispy. And then some more outrageous lettuce thrown in the mix because it's a good one. And so we're growing these three sets in three different combinations. And really interestingly, these dragoon lettuce and the extra dwarf bok choy are student selected crops. We have a program where we have middle schools and high schools growing crops in their classrooms and helping to identify which are good candidates. And if you have students in Colorado and students in Puerto Rico growing the same plants and a plant does well in both environments and you have students over watering and under watering and lots of air conditioning in some classrooms and none in others, those might be good candidates for space. So we're feeding into our crop testing with this collaboration with Fairchild Gardens in Miami. So we did VegO3G last fall and here you can see the kale kale and then that dragoon lettuce and only one of the dragoons did well. The kale did really well but then it wilted a little bit and so we got some brown leaves off to the side. So that was they recovered from wilted but it wasn't a perfect recovery. So again water is our issue and it seems like the dragoon lettuce and the kale had different water requirements and so there were some variation there. The crew still enjoyed them and as you saw in Serena's video she enjoyed it and they also really commented on enjoying the smell of growing plants which is pretty awesome. VegO3H was grown this spring and that's David Saint-Jacques who just came back initiating and there were the extra dwarf bok choy and again we only had one bok choy that did okay, two others did not do well here but then the wasabi mustard in the back those are huge right and they did really well and at harvest you can see again we had some similar wilting issues with the wasabi where they recovered but there were some brown parts on the leaves we tell the crew don't eat those bits and when they did eat them they enjoyed quite a lot. We heard the wasabi was especially good with the shrimp cocktail on orbit you can see Christina's face in the back here she probably had just had a bite of that wasabi because it is pretty strong but they they quite like the spicy flavor of that one. No they have shrimp cocktail they don't have sushi but you know you can talk to Grace about getting some sushi up there I'm not sure that would fly. Right now we have VegO4 on Space Station so this is our first grant test in Veggie and it's a collaboration between Kennedy Space Center, Johnson Space Center, my co-eyes Pete Roma and Grace Douglas are here in the room, Purdue University and Orbitec, Sierra Nevada Orbitec and we're testing differences in red to blue light and how the red to blue to green light ratios, I spelled that wrong apologies, impacted the crop growth for the mizuna mustard right now and then later for dwarf tomatoes but we're also looking at human research so we went through a full IRB for this and we're doing the crew organoleptic appeal so the astronauts are going to be doing taste tests and evaluations of the produce on orbit. We are looking obviously at microbial food safety and then we are doing assessments of crew behavioral health, how do growing plants make you feel, taking care of plants, how does that impact behavioral health, if your plant dies how does that make you feel. So all of these things I think are going to be really important data to collect for the future and so now since this is a microbiology meeting I just want to tease with a few microbiology slides. So we've been doing food safety analysis on all the returned produce and we are using the data here from table two which are the the non-thermal stabilized food standards as our closest approximate standards. Okay these are not for fresh produce these are for non-thermal stabilized food in the diet but we don't have standards for fresh produce and that's one of the things that our team along with Grace and Mark are kind of working to try to identify what what those standards would be. If you look here this is the the Russian LADA hardware in the bottom left that is a plant growth chamber that was on space station before veggie and they grew several crops including mizuna barley and radish and then we have our veggie crops also listed here from Veggio 1A and B and you see these numbers in red indicate that those values of food safety actually have exceeded those non-thermal stabilized standards and a lot of our flight you know plants. So we didn't in Veggio 1A but then we did in some samples returned from Veggio 1B. Now this is before the prophylactic produce sanitizing wipes are used and I don't think they used any wipes on on the LADA produce but you see the numbers are pretty high for aerobic plate count and for you know total fungi but we've never identified any specific pathogens that we're screening for on any plant tissue. Here's how we do the sampling from Veggie so we get both frozen plant samples wrapped in foil here back at minus 80 and then we get these plant pillows also back at minus 80 and we sample from from the the wicks of the plant pillows which are kind of like little grow bags from the substrate inside which is a baked ceramic with a controlled release fertilizer. We do heterotrophic bacterial and fungal plate counts for for all the different materials and then we do specific screens for things like E. coli, salmonella, etc. And we identify anything that grows. And we're we're compiling a large data set to try to really get a grip on what are the hazards and to do a HACCP plan hazard analysis critical controls points plan for the crop production in space. Okay and this is something that's used in the food industry to identify where contamination and hazards can occur. So we're comparing things like grocery store produce which are these market produce here. These are produce from three different grocery stores after over two different time points or three different time points and we compare those samples to what we grow in our chambers at Kennedy Space Center. Those are the next couple of columns that are called chamber grown produce and then to the the produce grown on orbit. So these are the the graphs for the outrageous lettuce that red romaine lettuce and we have data here from vego 3a cut and come again vego 3d mixed crop as well as the the grocery store and the chamber and we have it for aerobic plate counts on the left and use and molds on the right and again I'm not a microbiologist but you can see here the market produce tends to be higher than most of the things that we're growing in space and it's similar to what we get when we do get some high levels like we got with the vego 3d here for aerobic plate counts and also for for yeast and molds. That's the unwashed stuff from your grocery store and you know your wash stuff from the grocery store doesn't change it too much. We're doing a typical water wash on on for our market produce we compare it with the prosan the prosan does knock it down a little more. If we look at the the data for mizuna we compared with a curly mustard which is kind of our closest approximate grocery store variety and again the market levels tend to be a lot higher than what we see on orbit in most cases but not always so our produce is as dirty as grocery store produce or less dirty than grocery store produce in general. Do we eat what comes from the grocery store? Yes. Do we get sick from it? No not usually. So what do these aerobic plate counts and yeast and mold counts mean in terms of human health? That's one of the things that we're trying to identify and work working with folks here at JSC to really develop a risk analysis for that. Okay we're also doing community sequencing and this is just the last couple slides and you guys know this stuff way better than I do but we're doing 16S and ITS sequencing of the returned samples and we get community analyses that look a little bit like this. So on the left we have the plant tissue on the right we have the root tissue and these were from veg 01A and veg 01B the outrageous lettuce so the first column is flight plant from A and then the ground plants from A from our ground control then flight plants from B and ground plants from B and then the same things for the roots over here. And so you'll see you know some interesting patterns here you know the flight and the ground in terms of the shoot tissue actually differ you know more the roots look remarkably similar but it's actually not remarkably similar when we realize that all of these plants and seeds were planted at the exact same time at Kennedy Space Center and so really the only difference between flight and ground roots is the water that's being used and it's not that different. So we would expect the root communities to be more similar the shoot communities differ a little more but you know they're actually surprisingly similar as well especially if you look if you look between the ones flight and B and ground and B. So we're starting to get a picture for this but it's still a very you know preliminary story we're interested in seeing how this community changes over time and with different crops as the hardware ages as new things are introduced into space station we expect to to really be able to tell the story. We're also going to be monitoring the hardware and and Tanner over here is leading up that effort to to look at you know the hardware and how the hardware changes over time. So you know we're we're real excited to see how this goes and to see you know how we can learn lessons that will apply to food production systems in the future. So just lots of thanks to the astronauts as well as our our our teams and NASA space biology program for funding this research along with the human research program and the ISS program. So thank you very much. Thank you.
