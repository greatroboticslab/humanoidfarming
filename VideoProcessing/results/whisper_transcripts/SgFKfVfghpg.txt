 We traveled to Ecuador, the world's largest exporter of bananas. Here, banana plantations stretch as far as the eye can see. It takes nine months for the bananas to fully grow. To protect them from insects, they're covered in plastic bags the entire time. You do not want any of those bugs or insects arriving into the United States. Anthony Serafino is vice president of banana importer EXP Group. I'm looking for a banana. It's about eight inches in length. It's long. It can easily be ripened. Workers cut the bananas down. And then haul the bundle with padded carriers to protect them from bruising. The bundle is then attached to this cable system. These bananas right now, they're heading right to the packaging facility. The facility is right in the middle of the farm. That's where the bananas would be inspected. They look great. They're going to be chopped. The bananas are washed and then put into a production line. It's here where the stickers are applied. Take a look. Those are our very own inside edition bananas. Our bananas are loaded into a truck and then sent to this port in the city of Guayaquil, the largest port of Ecuador. That's where our bananas embark from Ecuador, through the Panama Canal, past Haiti and Cuba and up the East Coast, finally arriving in New York City. That's 3,500 miles. After two weeks at sea, our bananas have finally arrived from the tropics to this snowy port in Red Hook, Brooklyn, where you can see tons of cargo being unloaded from the ship. But the journey isn't over. The container with our bananas is loaded onto a truck and arrives here at EXP Group's headquarters in New Jersey. Remember how green our bananas were back in Ecuador when they were harvested? All these weeks later, they're still green. They need to be ripened. Ripening could take anywhere from 72 to 96 hours. They're loaded into this room, aptly called a ripening room, where they pump in humid air and a harmless ripening gas called ethylene. Ethylene infuses the fruit to allow the ripening process to hasten. We set our bananas aside in the ripening room and recorded the process with time-lapse cameras. Over the course of 96 hours, our bananas become perfectly ripe. There you have the two boxes of the Inside Edition bananas. So these are ready to go. I can do a taste test here? Yeah, taste test. Let me know. Here, you have one too. Delicious. Oh yeah. What do you think? They're good. Sweet. Finally, our bananas are delivered to the grocery store shelf. Mmm. Good, right? Very sweet. Mmm, tastes good. What do you think? Yum. Yum. Inside Edition bananas. Get them while they last. Behind mercado patients A Disney içers Like wow
