 I've got a lot of things here that I'm going to have to do. And one of them is my son. Through this whole thing, it's like he's noticed that I've been gone a lot. And that's, it broke my heart the other night to go pick him up, and he told me go back to work. And I've kind of been debating on how much time it's going to require out of me to be in a relationship. As far as the amount of time that I have, I'm not ready to move you in necessarily to my house or move you to Mina. For those reasons, it's, that's what makes this extremely difficult for me is, you know, having to let go of such a great girl. I mean, he should go first. And I don't think it's a bad thing. But since you aren't ready, it does make me feel better, though, knowing that, like, you didn't just say that to me and then go pick her. It's a, here's the thing. She doesn't want anything for a couple of years. I feel like she's kind of in that same boat as me. That kind of eases the rush of things. There's something about her that I just, I can't stop thinking about. I would like to try to explore some options with her. Mm-hmm. If she's open to that. I wish she'd have messed up luck with that. gonna wrap her up. That's it can help her.
