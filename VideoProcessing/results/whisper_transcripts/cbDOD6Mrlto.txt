Science & Technology
 I remember when we dug potatoes and put them up on top of the ground, people picked them up. And now we're digging 12 rows and loading a truck in a few minutes. So GPS really was a game-changer too. It's helped the farming industry tremendously. It just frees up so much of your time. I guess I'm to the age that sometimes that technology scares me. I think you've got to be all adapt. You don't want to be like everybody's dad that don't know how to work the remote control. It's easy to collect data. It's hard to collect meaningful data. We're starting to use Granular to help us dive into some more data and make us a better farm. It's the cutting edge of technology. Farming's changed. We're not pitchforks and overalls anymore. We are having to make decisions that we've never had to make before. It'll be interesting to see where it goes. But all in all, we're still doing the same thing our dads and grandfathers did. To go from walking behind a mule to being on modern farm equipment, I think it has a bright, bright future. So 32acements in time today. So 32 We're still doing things that are important in theka's college. Now, it's very difficult for watching. By the way, we're still doing that in a row in the setting. Through the same color in the Midwest, we're still doing things that are constantlypools. In grade teams have. We usually also started off потр fields. We're still doing bits with a number of dal pieces of wood. So 99 de just increase the use to our Предlo purposes, we've restricted things to the viewing buildings and build bikes, we've reduced our buildings to that doación.
