 Tomorrow, when we come to dinner, what will we find on our plates? The planet is being suffocated by the industrial production methods that govern our food. Alternative paths are emerging between the renewal of ancestral knowledge and advanced techniques. But will they be enough to feed 9 billion mouths in 2050? The End The End The End The End This story begins in the late 1960s, when the race for high yields gave birth to intensive farming. 30 years on, genetically modified organisms are spreading throughout the world. Today, this appraisal makes bitter reading. Agriculture consumes 70% of the available water on earth, and 90% of the varieties grown by small-scale farmers have disappeared from our fields. The End We used to eat more than 10,000 species of plants. Today we are trading in about 10, which have become the global commodities. These are then produced through uniformity, so we get new problems, we get new allergies, we get gluten allergies. wheat does not give gluten allergy, but in the industrial system it does. Cultures that never ate white rice when they are fed white rice are going to get diabetes. The central vice of this model is the vice of productivity. The vice of productivity is the vice of productivity. We think about the people who are more productive, the land is more productive. But productivity has a price. when we think about what we get the price is when to buy the upmarket. The price is on the top of that item. We think about not changing all the things that people need to support physical保健ic sectors. If we think about what we buy at the supermarket, it's a certain idea of the price. If we put the price on health, the price increases. The productivity gains are not necessarily for consumers, but for more prices for consumers. Where is the gain? I think we have to ask ourselves these questions. India has paid a high price in this race for agricultural performance. In the 80s, the country opened up its agricultural market in return for aid from the International Monetary Fund. Farmers were seduced by the GMO sirens, which guaranteed exceptional yields and plantations free from insects and parasites. Saddled with the need to feed 1.25 billion inhabitants daily, the country became a GMO experiment. The miracle was short-lived. The plants succumbed to local diseases, consumed twice as much water and eroded the soil at top speed. Poor harvests followed, forcing farmers already extremely poor to go into debt to buy seed for next year. A solution was needed to break out of this infernal spiral. The Indian ecologist and feminist is showing her country's farmers the superiority of organic farming and polyculture. This is wheat. This is wheat. This is mustard. This is oat. This is barley. This is linseed. In these fields, plants, animals and microorganisms self-regulate among themselves. Ecosystems take priority. No more pesticides or chemical fertilizers. The priority of this organic farming is to optimize the use of water, to promote the respect and preservation of biodiversity. It aims to produce healthy food while preserving the smallholder's place in society. The link between the table and the field is important because it is what allows us to remember that at the end of the day the food is coming from the soil, it's coming from seed, it's coming from farmers' work and contribution. And there is a continuum between the health of the soil and our health. The same systems that destroy the soil are destroying biodiversity, are causing cruelty to animals, are uprooting our small farmers who are the most productive systems. Farmers come from far and wide to learn how to select seeds, how to mix crops in the same field and how to take advantage of predatory insects. Miracle in China Not so long ago, India boasted 200,000 varieties of rice. Intensive farming has reduced that number to just three. Today, the Navdanya farm has become a model seed bank, which has enabled more than 10,000 farmers in India, Pakistan, Tibet, Nepal and Bangladesh to rediscover organic farming, its benefits and its limits. La petite agriculture pratiquée à une échelle humaine, à l'échelle de la parcelle, une diversité de plantes qui sont cultivées, parfois en combinaison avec des arbres et des animaux, cette agriculture-là peut être extrêmement productive à l'hectare. C'est une utilisation très efficiente des ressources qui est faite dans ces petites exploitations familiales, et toutes les études montrent qu'elles sont extrêmement productives. Le problème, c'est qu'elles ne sont pas compétitives ou concurrentielles sur les marchés. Pourquoi ? Parce qu'elles sont relativement plus intensives en main d'œuvre, parce qu'elles ne sont pas en mesure de faire des grandes économies d'échelle, elles ne sont pas en mesure de se mécaniser de manière très considérable pour réduire les coûts de production. C'est impossible pour les produits organiques de compétition des produits de la farming intensive. Ils appellent à des consommateurs qui sont désappointés par le aspect de la supermercée et qui sont prêts à manger des produits qui sont en season. À la supermercée, les fruits, les asparagues, les tomates et les grapes sont disponibles au cours de l'année, nous nous nous l'oublions que parfois ils ont passé thousands de kilomètres avant de finir sur nos plats. Les fruits importés par l'air-freight sont des fruits de 10 à 20 fois plus d'eau que les fruits producés local et des produits en season. Par exemple, un kilo de winter strawberries nécessite l'équivalent de 5 litres de diesel pour rejoindre nos chelves. Pour éliminer l'impact environnemental de leur production et de leur transport à nous, nous sommes prêts à débrouiller nos grapes de chelves ou nos fruits exotiques au cours de l'année ? On a beaucoup misé sur le développement des chaînes mondiales d'approvisionnement. On a sous-investi par contre dans les marchés locaux et régionaux qui pourtant sont de nature à relier les producteurs aux consommateurs de manière beaucoup plus directe, avec un nombre plus restreint d'intermédiaires et sont de nature à permettre à chacun de s'alimenter à partir de produits frais, produits localement, ce sur quoi l'on a beaucoup trop peu misé par le passé. . Mais quand plus de la plupart du monde vivent dans les villes, comment pouvons-nous revenir à la production locale ? Nous devons prendre le pays de l'économie à la ville. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Obviously having the time and the resources to be able to grow food in a way that's not productive, it could fail, you know, is maybe something of privilege. But on the other hand, I think it is one of the sort of bottom-up research trajectories that is really important. These are little laboratories for lots of people to get involved with and to experiment with and learn about. But agroecological methods in micro farms are not up to the task of feeding a growing urban population. How can we move up to mass production yet still keep these principles? Numerous experiments are underway. One such being Loufer farms, which have invaded the rooftops of buildings in Quebec since 2011. Vast 2,800 square meter greenhouse vegetable gardens in Montreal. Here around 40 varieties of vegetables are produced, all grown without pesticides, reusing rainwater. 700 kilos per day of organic fruits and vegetables, which feed 6,500 people. L'idée avec Loufer, c'était d'essayer de nous apporter à un modèle alimentaire qui ressemble plutôt à la façon que nos grands-parents mangeaient. C'était une agriculture qui avait de l'allure, c'était durable, il n'y avait pas de produits chimiques, il n'y avait pas de pesticides, c'était rentable et la bouffe était incroyable. Le modèle d'Affaire Loufer, c'est de produire localement mais aussi de distribuer directement. On est capable, par exemple, d'avoir zéro perte. Alors dans une serre comme ici, on est capable de cueillir seulement ce que les consommateurs ont commandé. Customers choose their vegetables on the internet or by telephone before midnight. Picking is done overnight. The baskets are prepared until noon and delivered to 300 drop points spread all over Montreal. An efficient system that still only affects a small number of citizens. Même si aujourd'hui cette forme de distribution ne représente pas nécessairement un grand pourcentage de la façon que les habitants en mange, pour moi, ça va devenir de plus en plus important, surtout pour la production de tout ce qui est légumes frais. Les salades, les tomates, les concombres, les poivrons, tout ce qui ne se transporte pas nécessairement très très bien. Je trouve que ça va plusieurs années avant qu'on voit des patates et du maïs qui poussent sur un toit, mais pour les tomates, pour les salades, pour moi, le timing est parfait. Comme. Priez-vous dans le hamburger, le domaine à l'Amérique a précité, lesВ ne doivent aller vite, mais la production deей alimentaires est grand. Les volum近ous experiência pour les production dumpres et du corners ne statt qu' legend wonont. Mais commentaire ? Le coût nord-en-en-arlo Tischorgneau wr ogóle est très picket, il se dépasse frais et l'arché d'autor , Le burden économique est dangere par le citoyen aux filles concernant de l' Gosling, concerned with animals suffering. It's impossible to imagine these small cattle farms with ethical methods in the heart of the city. Another solution is emerging. What if we were to eat other animals whose production wasn't harmful to the environment? What if we were to eat insects? What if we were to eat? What if we were to eat? Since the dawn of time, 1,400 species have been consumed in Latin America, Asia, and especially in Africa. Insects are rich in proteins, calcium and iron, and poor in lipids and cholesterol. Yet in many regions of Africa, the consumption of insects has fallen away under the influence of Western diets. Aspire Food, a company founded by five graduates of McGill University in Montreal, is working on the palm weevil larva in Ghana. Their aim is to enable local people to rediscover this source of proteins and experiment with production techniques. Ghana is a country where iron deficiency anemia is still a problem, especially amongst pregnant women and children. Many insects have a substantial amount of iron, which is really great for anemia. We found that there was a great demand in Southern and Central Ghana for the palm weevil larva, which is the larval stage of the beetle that infests the palm tree. There wasn't any farming at all really of this particular insect. There was only currently harvesting of it. People going out into fields, trying to pick them up one by one. That increases the labour, which then in turn increases the cost. If we keep going with this practice, we're not really sure pesticides, what insecticides are those fields laced with, and so then there can also be a lot of safety issues. So when we're thinking about food security in many of these communities, we have to think about empowering people to be responsible for their own food production, and be able to feed themselves. This adult is currently in this bucket, and at that stage they can grow as big as this. So it takes about three weeks for them to be an adult. In two years, four Ghanaian communities have learned to produce lava autonomously. Farming currently yields 150 kilos per month, and the aim is to reach five tons. The farming of edible insects on a very small scale with small-holed farmers is very attractive, because we're able to have people with very simple technologies learn how to create a form of protein that they already liked, that they already desired, with very little labour and minimal inputs. The production of insects is very advantageous. Reduced ecological footprint, rearing is easy, and takes up little space. A miracle solution to the problem of malnutrition, which affects more than one billion individuals, as some insects at equivalent weight contain 30% more protein than meat. But do they really represent a viable alternative to meat production? There is certainly a concern, that I feel, that insects could become viewed as a kind of second-class protein. It's the good one for the poor people, right? Or it's a good one for the masses. But that beef and pork and lamb are still going to remain the important meats for the people who can afford them. Are insects going to become a second-class protein form? Maybe, maybe not. Depends how they're treated. If we take them and grind them up and turn them into powder and say this is protein, and then reform it into a patty and call it an insect burger, that's a pretty low class of meat. How to convince consumers that eating insects is better for them, and better all round? The UN and the EU are encouraging the development of farms on a grand scale. The problem in the West is that the insect is culturally problematic. It's often associated with the dirty, dangerous and so on. There would be a lot of work to do to change the mentality before it's possible consumption for many of the West. Yet just a few years ago, the consumption of sushi and raw fish seemed inconceivable in the Western diet. Today, the whole world consumes these foods and appreciates them. Following this idea, after Ghana, the Aspire food team is setting up a pilot project to breed locusts for the American market in Austin, Texas, and lay the foundations for a market that could be very lucrative. There are a number of groups that really are finding this a good opportunity to add diversity to their diet where none existed before. You have athletes, people who are into the paleo lifestyle, and there's nothing more paleolithic than eating insects, so it aligns very well. You have people with various gastrointestinal issues, allergies, autoimmune, problems, and different populations have found that insects are a great replacement for types of protein that caused them distress before. What are you serving here? I've got a nice, delicious kimchi coleslaw that goes with these cricket tacos. Hey, man, I'm Adventurers. Well, I sent me up a combo. It looks like crawfish. You're gonna love this. Hey, ingredients with crickets! Thank you! Oh, yeah! Cricket Tacos! Cricket Tacos! Welcome to the future of food, my friend. I'm not ready when I eat these crickets. And everybody's favorites. 68% protein with blueberry strawberry banana smoothie. I'm not even moving. Damn. Mmm. I'm not thinking bad at all. We can't just say, insects are the future, eat it. So if insects are gonna be successful, they just need to taste good. And that's not hard to do. That means developing new recipes, new ways of processing them. So we can't just focus on the farming of insects and how it takes to economically scale up those farms. We need to really focus on the restaurants and the home cooks and how to make that something that's delicious, that people opt into, rather than something that they feel bad about because it's gross. In France, the consumption of insects is tolerated, but still not 100% authorized. The ANSES, the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety, points up the risk of toxic substances, parasites, viruses or bacteria stored in the insect's body. Until the last fears and the last taboos are laid to rest, another idea is gaining ground. Why not feed our livestock with insects? After all, in nature, insects are already part of the food chain for poultry and fish. Currently, 70% of agricultural land is taken up by the production of fodder for livestock. The world's livestock alone consumes the equivalent in calorific needs as 8.7 billion human beings, more than the total current population. So why not replace the conventional meal by easy and cheap to produce insects? The use of insects to produce animals, which is also intended to feed other animals, is a much less problematic solution since the final consumer has no relationship with insects. Now, we need to see what type of meat we are going to do, what are its nutritional capabilities, but also, what are the health problems that it can cause for animals. In France, a company called Insect, based in Dole in the Jura, produces insects to feed pet animals. It also makes bone meal for aquaculture from the larvae of a small beetle, the mealworm. The company claims that fish and chicken fed on mealworms grow more rapidly. European authorities have green-lighted its marketing. At European level, the feed market for fish, poultry and pork is colossal, with production estimated at more than 3 million tonnes per year. The products that use insects as ingredients, like a smokey or a peat, will be labeled as nourished by insects. This will be a good thing, because the consumer will perceive this as an element of food in the food. It will be a way to facilitate the entry of these insects into the consumption chain to the human food in the future. In Europe, the regulations authorize the breeding of eight species of insect, provided they are fed on plants derived from remnants of the wheat, pea and corn processing industry. Feeding them waste or meat is however forbidden. There is a third solution, even more avant-garde than agroecology and the consumption of insects. It comes from the 16th century Aztec civilization, another source of proteins that is well known in Africa, algae. Some algae contain twice as much protein as soya, and three times as much as meat or fish. These plants, unicellular organisms, grow very rapidly in lakes and ponds. A bright young start-up in Paris is looking to take advantage of its nutritional qualities by including algae in the human diet instead of traditional animal proteins. I think they could be interesting for algae. Yes, I found them here. It would be nice to see. Okay, and the 6th century. Okay. The Museum of Natural History is taking part in this project by providing access to its algae bank, one of the largest in the world. The micro-algues represent an interesting alternative in the sense that they are rich in proteins, vitamins and oligo elements. It is a microorganism that is still very much used to exploit, and with the good way to formulate and the good way to formulate, it can have a potential, so it is not limited. On the level of the texture, it is not bad. It is very, very, very, very, very, and the color is still natural. Yes. We tested it. We found that there were little things that were really realised, beyond the food supply. Yes. It's not very important. We started on research and development, and we are at the stage where we have scientific knowledge, we have technology, and the market who demand, who demand, who needs these solutions. We have an excellent flavor. It is a little bit more, too, but it is a bit more, too, too. It is a bit more, too. It's a bit more, too. It's a bit more, too, too. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's a bit more, too. It's a bit more, too. It's a bit more, too. We have a sauce without an egg, already, without an egg, which is not the case with all the mayonnaise, especially European. When a mayonnaise comes to 70% of mass gras, or more, we have a more than 30%, directly. This one is very interesting, I think. It has a beautiful color in the assiette. I think that here, we have a product that is good, that has a beautiful color, and that it gives us a desire. Micro-algae offer an alternative to the industrial production of eggs, universally criticized. First, for its environmental impact, it takes over 2,000 liters of water to produce a dozen eggs. Second, intensive livestock farming promotes epidemics, in particular, avian flu. Finally, a protest movement is pointing up the conditions of animal abuse. I think it would be really stupid to not consider the potential of the animal potential. The biomass that it represents, like the biomass of the oceans in general, is fundamental for our food future. I don't have any doubts about it. But there still, we need to get used to the idea of what they eat. At the beginning, it was the algues. And find ways of preparing, ways of integrating these foods into our food habits. What makes me nervous about these ingredients, is the centralization of how they're produced. And that, to me, is not resisting the globalization and homogenization of food. What you might see with algae, is you just grow big blocks of it, and then you can ship it around the world, like corn and soy, to wherever it needs to be deployed. But what is the point of producing microalgae on an industrial scale, if it leads to the same environmental impacts as livestock farming, or soya and corn production? An artisanal production model, such as already exists in France, seems more coherent. It remains to be seen if it can be affordable in these conditions. The microalgae avenue requires a lot of research and development, before it can reach our plates in another form than simple food supplements. But the idea is part of a global movement that is challenging our current food production. By privileging local products and defending biodiversity, consumers send signals to the major agri-food players. Some are already warning against the natural tendency of the industry. We should avoid the risk of pushing one solution as a magic bullet, as another monoculture, which is the tragedy of big agencies. You know, suddenly the big agencies wake up to insects are edible, and then they'll pump all the funding into that. No, we need diversity of species, plants, insects. We need diversity of cultures of food. We need diversity in our diet. We need diversity in our economies. We need diversity in our decision-making. And for me, democracy is diversity that different levels participate in shaping the food system. C'est au fond une transformation de notre régime alimentaire à laquelle j'appelle et que j'espère voir se faire progressivement, mais qui s'inscrit dans une transformation plus large de nos modes de vie, qui passe par le fait de remettre l'alimentation au centre de nos existences, d'y sont consacrés l'attention et le temps voulu, et sans doute parfois le budget voulu. Il faut par conséquent que des politiques sociales beaucoup plus robustes soient mises sur pied pour que même les ménages pauvres puissent s'alimenter de manière adéquate. Et ceci, malheureusement, n'est pas encore vu comme une priorité par beaucoup de gouvernements. Je pense que l'alternative système est en place. Je pense que le plus rapide de growth dans le monde aujourd'hui n'est pas en GMO. GMO est en fait décliné. Il n'est pas en chimiques. Il est en biologique et organique. Ce qui est missing est le soutien de politique pour cela. Parce que chaque groupe qui dit, je vais croire la nourriture et je vais avoir des consommateurs à acheter des produits et des normes. Si la politique arrête de soutien de la agriculture et de l'industrie, si la moitié du budget de l'Ap ne s'est pas soutenir les farms et les fertilisers, agroécologie serait juste ploumé tout le monde. Je pense que une agriculture post-industrie qui est réussissante va faire un couple de choses. Je pense que l'un des choses qu'elle va faire, c'est que les humains devraient l'équation. Les gens ont besoin de travail. Les gens ont besoin de faire des choses dans une économie post-industrie qui ne peuvent pas être faits par robots et automations. Je pense que la nourriture est un bon endroit pour ça, qu'il soit le nourriture de la nourriture ou le processage. La nourriture est un bon endroit pour la nourriture. La nourriture est un bon endroit pour la nourriture. Sous-titrage Société Radio-Canada et supporté par les autorités publics. La nourriture est un bon endroit pour la nourriture.

Pour lesquels sont en train de rencontrer, certains pays, comme les États-Unis, sont en train de s'attendre à biotechnologie pour créer des proteins de la nourriture en Silicon Valley. Others, comme les États-Unis, sont en train de modifie des animaux et en embarque sur industrial cloning. Enfin, India et ses farmers sont en train de se montrer que un changement large-scale possible. 5 de la 25 États-Unis ont changé de la nourriture. La nourriture est un acte de conscience, de la conscience, de la conscience, que pour chaque bite que vous prenez, une thirde de la nourriture qui vient de les butterflies, les bees, les pollinateurs. Le processus de photosynthèse a transformé la lumière et la carbon dioxide et la lumière et la carbon dioxide dans les plantes qui nous donnent la nourriture. Le billons de organismes qui travaillent à la doule, les fungi, les mécorais, les foussins, qui sont les produits de la nourriture. Le travail de la carete et la nourriture et les plantes sont agro-écolégiques. Et je sais que si nous continuons notre commitment à servir la terre, la terre, la terre et la nature, les plantes, les plantes et les santé, les gens de la santé que les politiques que se sont margénales 20 ans, sont en train de se passer à la main.
