 The term agribusiness covers any commercial operation across the complete value chain in agriculture. From the sale of raw materials and resources necessary to create biological products, to distributors and retailers that give those products to the end consumers. Examples of agribusiness include fertilizer and nutritional companies such as Nutrient and Portifal AgriScience, marketing cooperatives such as the Dairy Farmers of America, or even vertically integrated multinationals such as Nestle and ADM. Although agricultural producers are central to agribusiness, each link in the ecosystem enhances and adds value to the end consumer, whether it ends up as food, fiber, or other biological products. We can categorize the agribusiness value chain into four links. Input providers, producers, processors, and other service providers. Input providers focus on the necessities of producing raw agricultural products and to enhance production efficiency. They supply a variety of basic materials such as feeds and seeds to more advanced supplements and equipment. In some sectors and regions, labor remains a core input as there may be no alternatives. Producers are farmers and ranchers. They range from small family land holdings to large and intensive commercial operations that take place on both raw and cultivated land or even within buildings like greenhouses. You're likely familiar with crop and animal production systems, but aquatic and forestry production also plays an important role in some regions. Processors refine raw agricultural materials into useful commodities and end products. We can divide processing into two steps. Primary processing involves minor transformations to the raw material, such as pasteurizing milk or packing meat into marketable commodities. Secondary processing takes these commodities and transforms them into something consumable. For example, cheese making or biofuel conversion. Finally, other service providers also play an integral role between these links and the end consumer. They range from marketers and distributors to retail locations, including your local farmer's market. Agribusiness is a vibrant and significant part of any economy.
