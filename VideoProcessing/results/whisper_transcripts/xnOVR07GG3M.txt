Howto & Style
 Hey guys, how's it going? We're in the greenhouse and we are going to be planting up a green stock vertical garden Possibly even two depending on how it goes today This is what it is or one of the styles that green stock has This feels like an absolute blast from the past because we have planted these up on video a couple of different times But it's been a few years and they have some additions that I think are really super helpful First of all, this is the original green stock vertical garden. This is the five tier right here. It has 30 planting pockets That's pretty intense and I feel like this is such a good option for people Especially who have limited space where you need to think a little bit more vertically to fit in more things So if you're gardening on a patio or if you simply want to have it closer to your kitchen door because it makes it Way more convenient to have if you're growing edibles, you can grow flowers in these if you want, which I have done as well I love the color that they offer now So I and maybe they did in years past and I just didn't realize it But I think they all they had a few years ago was tan and terracotta Which we did tan I think at that time. I think they call it beige or beige. Yeah, is that the same thing? Kind of okay, same family, right? This one is called evergreen and I really like the color because you know, we love plants and green and I think it just really it blends in really nicely which I really love also this I think this is the biggest improvement in in my eyes This is a way to automatically water so you can set it up on a timer to your hose and it will automatically fill the water reservoir I'll explain how the whole thing waters how it all works, but You can set it up now to where you can kind of I mean you need to check on it and hopefully you are and harvesting whatever you have in there But it's a little bit more hands-off which in our garden. That is huge. We have a lot of projects going on We live in a dry hot climate a lot of you guys do as well Maybe you just don't want the maintenance of having to think about it, you know, so today I've got a bunch of beautiful things a mixture of all edibles So we've got herbs. We've got some greens. I've got some violas which are edible flowers. We've got garlic even I mean you can really do a whole lot of different things in this type of garden I actually asked Aaron if he wanted to plant one of them up to like a little bit of a challenge But I think it might be fun to start plants in one and start seeds in the other That's the thing like it doesn't have to be a huge investment in plants in the You know initial stage of planting it you can start with seeds as well In fact, I think they sent a packet of seeds there somewhere around here came with it. Hang on got them a couple of different types of greens We've got the salad bowl blend lettuce and bloomsdale spinach and you guys we are able to give one of these away So this whole setup right here So this is the original five tier with the automatic watering system like this whole setup to enter You just comment below this video on YouTube and we will pick a winner and Maybe like a week a week. Yeah, I'll show it a week also there is a coupon code It's garden answer and that will get you 25% off anything on their website from April 13th through the 17th Except for the automatic watering system right here because this is already on a special pricing thing because it's only on pre-sale at this point So that ends on the 17th after that the code will get you 10 bucks off an order over $75 So anyway, thanks green stock for sending these out and for working with us on that giveaway Okay, if you haven't seen one of our original videos, which you know, it's been a few years So i'm guessing maybe you have it I wanted to run through how this works like how they water so you can see that each level looks the same This is what the inside looks and this is food grade plastic So you're good to go planting your edibles in it and all that you can see at the bottom There's a whole bunch of drain holes, which is really nice There's this central kind of cone that comes up and then this is the watering tray right here I don't know the technical name, but it's where like water collects and is dispersed So this is what each level looks like we've got the you know The planting reservoir and then you can see that gray tray right there on every single one of those levels So what you do is you come along you fill up this great big water reservoir at the top and there's a hole in the center that hole Puts water down through the entire green stock system and it disperses evenly through each one of the levels and then once the water is in here You know, you've got it on a level surface i'm hoping so The water should be leaking through these little holes or draining through these little holes to each one of your planting reservoirs So the watering internal watering system even if you have it set up on the automatic watering system It works the same because how the water the automatic watering system works if you add this on also if you have one of these already You can get one of these separate and just add it to your current system So how it works is you just you can see the tube ends here. They sell like I think four tubes come with it You can bring your hose over to it or take the tubes over to your hose But it just clips to the sides here and then fills up your water reservoir and still waters the same internally It's just that you've got it set up on a hose now that's on a timer and this is like the hose that's filling up your reservoir Does that make sense? Yeah Sometimes I feel like I muddy the waters a little bit with my explanations But it's basically the same either you fill it up with a hose or you let the automatic system Right And you can hook four of these green stocks up together On off of one hose so we do have four and we I think we're gonna put it to the test and see how it does Especially once it hits you know high heat and what they recommend is that especially for smaller crops like your greens You run your drip for just one or two minutes. It's all it takes and See how it works and then during the peak of the season you want to set your timer to go off twice a day for one or two minutes That's not that much water. I don't know how much will flow out of a system in one to two minutes, but well, it's not dripping It's not like a drip system. No, it'll fill up like a regular hose. Yeah, that's not very much no for one minute Anyway, I feel like it's a pretty slick system. There's a whole bunch of different parts you can get to I mean the lid is separate You can get that which I think is nice. It kind of caps the whole system. It keeps junk from getting into the water reservoir Also, I mean this one is on a spinny You know rotating base, which is quite nice if you don't have it set up on the automatic water You're free to move it all the way around if you have you know a balcony situation where only one sides getting light You know every day you can go give it a quarter turn so that every side is getting equal amounts of light Also, it catches the water and I think they've got this in one in five foot lengths, right? So the water catches here It drains through these holes goes through the tube and you can shoot it off into a flower bed or something like that So if you've got it on a deck and you want to protect your surface You can make it drain away, which I think is super super handy the catch with the automatic watering system If you've got it set up on one you can't really they don't recommend that you rotate it, you know Because you've got a solid line here I feel like if you've got one hooked up to an automatic water system and your hose you bring over a hose to it And if you give it a little bit of flex, you could at least go 180 don't you think? Yeah, just kind of like this not all the way around because you couldn't In theory We haven't tested that But if you've got multiple set up together I think you've got to kind of just leave them sit So we're actually going to plant this up here in the greenhouse because one it gets light morning through evening And we still have a couple of cold below freezing nights on the forecast that I wasn't expecting And I've got tender things that have been in the greenhouse So the fact that they come apart in levels means that we can either leave it in here Or we could take off one level at a time and go move it somewhere outside where we would like it And leave it for the season So right here you can see this is the bluetooth hose timer So you, you know, put this on your faucet Your hose goes off of this and then goes to the automatic water tube down here And then this is The automatic watering system right here minus the tubes Which are Chilling right there on the box I mean a little bit scattered this morning And then you can also get a wheel kit right here if you want to be able to wheel it around on your deck There's all kinds of different things There's like plant supports and there's also Cloth Covers Which I think that They weren't Did they offer those? I don't know But it is a good idea Yeah It's just like a big old giant pillowcase You can put over the whole thing Fits really nicely So Anyway, I think what I'd like to do is just start planting this up And I'm just going to do a mix of stuff Yeah I've got strawberries, greens, violas, broccoli Garlic A bunch of goodies Which one am I planting? This one? Yeah Okay You sure you don't want to do a challenge here? No, I'm good behind the camera Are you? Yeah Are you sure? I think everybody likes to see a good challenge, Erin Got our potting soil right here And I forgot how many it actually takes to fill these I want to say I'm going to use a whole bag at least on this Per level This is a one cubic foot bag There, it says fill soil to top On every single one of these I'm just going to take just a little bit more of one bag Okay I'm just going to kind of lightly press it in I don't want any air pockets in there Uh oh The whole bunch just come out the front? No, you're good That's pretty close to top I've got some root balls to deal with here Yeah, maybe that's if you're doing seeds Maybe I don't know I can remove some Okay So we're going to plant now Let's start With the strawberry And these are the seascape variety Which is my Right? That's the one I picked up, right? My favorite Favorite strawberry I have ever, ever grown In fact, I ordered three more flats to plant out in our big garden this year Big, beautiful berries all season I might leave Well, maybe on a different one So you can do, I mean, all kinds of different things I was thinking about all of the different types of miniature tomatoes that are available Now you could do like little cherry tomatoes that come out the side You could do peppers You could do beans From seed You could do all kinds of fun stuff Okay, let's do a Dotwell's French thyme This one grows six to twelve inches tall and wide Which is a great size for this You know, the only things I'm trying to think that you probably wouldn't want to plant in here Are kind of like I would think kind of obvious Like pumpkins and corn Corn Corn and indeterminate tomatoes that get massive You could do flowers in here But nothing that gets too huge We've got a cilantro here I'm going to plant this one closer to me So I can put some color in between Gotta have a little color Some edible flowers Nasturtiums would be really pretty in a planter like this This is a sorbet pink wing viola That needs a drink I haven't watered in here yet today Do you have enough plants for all the Oh, Erin Pockets? You have a little faith We're good Also I think we're good Okay, let's do Giant flower chives That doesn't mean the plant gets giant They just have giant flowers Ten to twelve inches tall Is all on that one They smell so good All the different textures are pretty Okay, now I'm going to go in on this side Always thinking a little bit about color as well These are lettuce starts So I'm not going to plant probably just two Oops, two of these little cells This is Roseanne lettuce See, these will stretch, Erin I'm not going to plant the whole four pack in here These plants will get big enough on their own That'll provide a little bit of different color Over on this side It's going to be such a slow, gentle water That I'm not worried about leaving any kind of a lip For watering You know how when you plant other containers You want to leave a good lip So that you can get a good amount of water in there This is going to be such a gentle, gentle stream It'll have time to soak in Okay, that level's done And make sure that this is somewhat cleaned out And we're going to just Oh boy Okay, leave a little space for this Well, it says soil to top on the sides there Maybe it means you need to taper it toward the middle Maybe I need to have a taper warning Okay The holes that are in here I don't think it'll probably matter But I like to line a hole up with a reservoir It just makes me feel better But again, I think it's such a slow, gentle stream That the roots are going to get water No matter which direction they're pointing That looks great Okay This goes on the bottom Nice Okay I think at this point We'll set up a camera And just kind of speed up the planting process But I'll give you a tour In the end of each of the other levels I think I'm going to change my method here It was a little bit difficult to get that second layer on Because they get a little bit heavy You know, when they're full of soil And you're trying really hard not to damage any of the plants right below So what I'm going to do is put this one empty on top And just plant it in place I think the only concern And maybe it's not a concern But it does not get any soil down through here So it doesn't get into a water reservoir So I'll just put a little piece of paper over the top And fill it with soil plant And then remove the paper I think that would work just as good I got them both finished So I got them both finished So this one's full of plants So you can kind of see a little bit of a Not an after per se But this one's full of seeds And it will quickly look like this Right here Especially in this greenhouse Where, you know, when it gets sunny out It gets warm in here and things just explode Let's do a little tour of the rest of the things that I put in here I basically just did a bunch of repeat plants So in the second level I've got broccoli Red lettuce A Burgarten sage Garlic There's a strawberry right there And a viola Next level is Strawberry Viola Garlic Red lettuce Broccoli And a trailing rosemary Did I start with strawberry? Next level Garlic Broccoli There's a dotwell's thyme Then we've got another strawberry Violas Red lettuce Top layer I ran out of violas So it's just a repeat of everything Except for the viola I think it looks really pretty I'm really excited about it And then on this one I did one level For each type of plant That I put in So top level is salad bowl lettuce The Bloomsdale spinach is this one Then we've got Nantes carrots Which This is really nice Because the original green stalks Have 10 inch root reservoirs There are leaf models They're called leaf And they're only 7 inches Which will allow you to stack them A lot higher I think what? 7 tiers Instead of 5 But when you have a 10 inch one You can do some root crops Like carrots Nantes don't get tremendously huge So I think that'll be perfect And then we've got cherry bell radishes In this one And then we've got the baby pixie cabbage So just tiny little cabbage heads That will form in these Hopefully In this bottom layer So what I'm going to do Is I want to show you How to set up the water system And I'm only going to set one up today Because I kind of want to do Well first off I want to do a side by side comparison Just to see how long it takes The reservoir to fill up Like how much time I spend on this one Versus on that one But I think it's important When we're starting seeds Especially when some of these Are surface sown Like the lettuce To water them from overhead I don't know if the water will wick All the way over On the top layer of soil Good enough to get that Well enough Good enough to get that soil saturated Keep those seeds wet enough to germinate So I'm going to leave this one Just as is I will probably water through the reservoir But I'll also make sure That the tops stay well watered I mean we're starting tons of stuff In here right now I'm in here every single day You know tending to seedlings and such So that's going to be no problem whatsoever But we'll set this other one up On the automatic waterer Rustle down Okay So these are the clips For each one of the levels This is the T If you're wanting to put More than one of them together Rustle And then this is what Let's see Maybe I should do some reading here Erin set this one up So I didn't I was not involved in that So this is a first for me So we're going to do the clips here So it looks like you just put Clips on like that Not super difficult You want to kind of line them up here Whoops There we go Step one Check I think I said that they come with four tubes They actually come with two tubes We just have two green stalks here So we have four tubes collectively So two tubes per garden Okay These work a lot like drip tape You make sure that that's all the way up to the valve Rustle My goodness We're going to push this on Okay Okay And then you just To clamp it Screw that piece onto the tube Yeah that's not going to go anywhere Okay So this next part Is the part that will go into the reservoir The water will come out This area Done And then we're putting on This half inch to three quarter inch Hose thread Connector Adapter Is that it? Yeah Okay There are two extra clips in the system Because if you happen to have the leaf system That has seven tiers You have the proper amount of clips And then of course You know this is the T I think I already mentioned That you know once you come down Well I'll explain in a second I'm so visual Let me set it up Okay And then like I said The other two parts that are in here This is a T connector If you're connecting multiples And then there's an elbow as well If you're connecting a third one So you've got everything you need there Okay let's get a hose over here I think Erin was working on setting this up So this is already hooked up to the hose We've got a T splitter Because this is my regular greenhouse hose I still want to be able to use that every day And then this one goes to our wireless timer Okay You know I'll do this There I'll probably go get a rake And scoot the gravel out Since we're going to have this set up For the summer I'll get a rake And scoot the gravel And bury the hose So we don't have to worry about Stepping over it All the time But it's really nice To see that that one is all set up But let's try the rotation real quick With the hose So if you've got You know Kind of a loose hose I think you've got a little play So if you have to face it A little bit more toward the light You can do that But then you know If you've got multiples connected together You're not going to have That kind of flexibility I don't think Erin is going to turn on the system From his phone Do I need to download the app? Yeah there is an app It's called Dig BTT Okay Can you see that? Yep BT controller Yeah Okay so it says it's off Connected And then do I press that? I don't Maybe you can't start it Just make it go You might have to do an actual program Oh manual run Oh Let's do Try one minute One minute yeah Press Oh Whoa Oh my goodness You've got to have the lid on Oh for crying out loud Oh we got to neck that pressure down a bit Yeah Well that garlic is well watered Yeah it's not shooting out anymore That's better Yeah Oh that's handy So they do have the little valve You guys The pressure on our hose Was just Too great And it was shooting Straight out the front They're having a little flood going on Yeah Yeah that works That's better Yeah Cool Yeah the air in the line It still hasn't gotten completely clear We just turned our water on Yesterday Yesterday Yesterday So yeah there's still some air in the line So it probably doesn't make sense to buy a lid because these are separate if you're going to be watering it manually because you'd have to take it off every day and once your plants get some size it gets increasingly difficult to put it on when the leaves you know flop over the edge and in here I don't think we have a chance of stuff really getting into it and like plugging it up at all It's probably not 100% level we'll see real fast So when we've got seed right here at the surface level I just feel like it's safer for me to do one of these Sure Until the seed germinates at least Easy enough Yep Looks great So that's it you guys We've got two of them set up We've got two more yet to set up but I'm going to wait until next month when Tomatoes and peppers you know I can get my hands on some of those miniature varieties I think that'll be really fun I want to toss some basil into one of them But it'll just be fun to see the progression And like I said they may or may not end up staying in here I do feel like it's a good spot for them because there's no wind You know they're protected from We get some pretty fierce winds through the summer months And they do get a lot of light and plenty of heat in here So they should be really happy And I'm just very excited about this automatic water system I feel like that's such an amazing addition to something like this Because you know it's really I think beneficial in so many ways But having that automation really kind of takes it over the top for me Because that's so important to us in our own garden So I'll most likely end up putting them both Actually all four of them on the water system Once you know these grow up and have some roots to Soak up deeper water in each one of those wells So anyway again don't forget to enter the giveaway to do that You leave a comment just any nice comment below this video on YouTube And we will pick a winner in about a week Thanks again Greenstock for sending these out for us to try Super excited You know we've had a relationship with Greenstock since I don't know Like 2015 Yeah they've been a part of like our community For a long time They've been following what we do And we've been really excited to see the new development So anyway hope you guys enjoyed this video We'll show you progression through the season And we'll probably show you when we set up the next two And plant those as well So anyway thanks for watching See you guys in the next one Bye
