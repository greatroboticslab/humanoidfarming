 Use this one tip to get your best potato harvest yet this season. First, we need to understand how potatoes grow. We start with a seed potato, which has an eye on it, and it's from these eyes that the new stem grows. And then above the surface, tons of foliage develops. But how do we get more potatoes? See, new potatoes only grow off the portion of the stem that's buried beneath the surface. Therefore, the more stem that's buried, the more potatoes will end up harvesting. And there are two ways to get more of the main stem buried. First, at the point of planting, dig down at least eight inches and plant your potato at this depth. This ensures the stem will pass through eight inches of soil before breaking the ground. And secondly, once it breaks through the ground, hill it up. Simply grab a wheelbarrow of compost and shovel it over top of the plant, completely burying it. Now, with 12 inches of the plant buried, you'll have pounds and pounds of potatoes developing beneath the surface to be harvested this summer.
