Education
 I'm Dr. Katie Martin Rainey in the agronomy department at Purdue and we are at the Agronomy Center for Research and Education known as the Acre Farm in West Lafayette, Indiana and I'm standing in one of my soybean breeding research fields and I leverage my entire soybean breeding pipeline to do phenomics as well. So in these experiments around me we have a couple of phenomics related studies going on. One of them is looking at using 3D modeling to measure the canopy height and volume and from that to hopefully get biomass, derived biomass, soybean biomass. We also have another study looking at replacing visual scoring of herbicide damage with more quantitative and high throughput measurements from drone imagery. We also have an experiment looking at phenotyping soybean maturity with various image based metrics. Here we have a height reflector stapled onto a leaf. We have these scattered throughout this experiment and we know the heights of these specific points in space and we're trying to use those to calibrate our RGB 3D modeling based estimation of the canopy height.
