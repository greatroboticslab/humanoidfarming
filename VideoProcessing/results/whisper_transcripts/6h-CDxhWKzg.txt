 Okay, so let's start with what a child should do. Because children are the most likely to be victims of dog bites, unfortunately, we want to make sure that we keep them safe. So if a child is walking along with their parent or guardian and they see a dog, the first step is for them to ask that adult that they're with if they can ask about it. If mom says yes, step two is they stop at least leash distance away from the dog and the person and they ask the person. If they say yes, then the next thing the child can do is walk a little closer to the dog and put their hand out. If it's a larger dog you don't want to crouch down because the last thing you want to do is put your face right in a dog's face because facial bites are particularly nasty. You don't want to have one of those. So if a small dog is in someone's arms they don't often really have the choice to say no because they're trapped. So normally I wouldn't approach a dog who's being held in someone's arms. I would actually ask a person to put the dog down on the ground so the dog has more choice. But some dogs are actually fine being petty in their owner's arms so it's okay to ask. Ask the person first and then watch the dog's body language. If the dog seems relaxed you can pet under the chin but be extra careful. Now if the dog doesn't approach you whether you're a child or an adult that is the dog's polite way of saying I don't want to meet you right now. Oh look at your puppy! You're such a sweet dog. Yeah you're so nice. What a great... Bad etiquette. Yeah. First thing is not asking the person and not asking the dog. That's already just not polite. Just like it would be with a human being. You always ask first. It's also bad when we bend over the dog. A lot of dogs find that a little overwhelming. If you think about it if you were only 12 inches tall and someone who was six feet tall leaned over you and then put their hand right on top of your head it would be a little scary. And the best way to avoid being bitten is to listen to the dog when the dog is being polite. Instead of then chasing the dog down and forcing the dog into a position where the dog has to say hey I said I don't want to say hello. So the key is for us to look for that body language.
