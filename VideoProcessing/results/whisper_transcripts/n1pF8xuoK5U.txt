 hey you too firmall 51 here i know i ain't got my hat on you can see all my hair but um got a interesting item come in the mail and uh sit you here on the uh number one platform carrier that were stored here um my 300 i was missing a emblem it actually the back end broke off of it and a good friend at uh jeff foreman up at uh that emblem guy if you need any metal emblems restored or reconditioned uh fixed repaired or new emblems be sure to call that emblem guy at uh jeff foreman um i'm not getting paid or anything i don't do that kind of thing uh what you see if i buy something it's because i bought it because i like that person or like the company and uh the cool thing is it's got some tape on it but it was wrapped up but it was wrapped up in this bag well i couldn't see the ih and all that it was on this side here all this side here was showing and i thought it was like a old uh i think this is the later style uh yeah that's the uh later style ih on there parts bag i opened it up sure enough it was an original ih parts bag which i thought was pretty cool but let's see here now i got my emblem i'm not i'm pretty sure that's probably brand new i'm not sure if that's been reconditioned or not but you can get in contact with him there there's a number you can get in contact with him like he said he buys sales repairs custom work he's actually done some custom emblems for people there's some of the work that he's done some of the items he sells as well i bought some 140 decals from him before had some repair for the 300 utility over there yeah i called just my just my guy from my i need emblem which i've needed a couple here but um like i said most of the tractors i got a decal tractor but jeff's a great guy i highly recommend him um he has got some signs he's some other items that he's working on in his company here and i'll um but you can see here uh the emblem guy outdoor he does outdoor signs and these are like the made like the originals and they're illuminated on the inside i believe he may have some that are not as well but but you can see there some just regular ih some with the tractor symbol um they can do like the truck tractor and a road tractor as well but you can see there what he does uh i may have to may have to save up might get me one of these here one day put out next to the shop or may put it in the house i don't know i'm not sure my wife would uh like that too well but i do like this one here i've been thinking about getting one of these um and you can have them where they mount it um mount up next to the building on the front of the building or so like say there's some of the information on that let's see there's some of the other signs that he's done or he does i really like this one here um i thought about getting this one there's a case i h for the early case i h logo and um there's some other signs as well soccer signs but yeah there's uh there's his information and all and get up with him um follow him on facebook at that emblem guy like i say he's uh uh does a great job and um i highly recommend him there it is my brand new 300 and uh these these pins on the back were notorious for breaking off or uh and in my case one was one had been soldered re-soldered and it broke off and there's really not an easy way to do it uh yourself he has a way that he can do it and uh pop them back on or like i say he can recondition if you're sent i've got a tractor that's sentimental value and you would like to keep the emblems or you have a decent set it just needs to be refreshed um he can clean these up repolish them straighten them back out i think he has a jig or something he lays them on and he can get all that straightened out repaints um some of the early 140 oval decals he can repaint the oval put the right correct color in it and all that for you and um like i say it really sets your restoration off when you've got a decent set of emblems if you got the metal emblems on there yeah he got me he got me my 300 emblems that they were missing these this 300 is the farmall 300 emblem and the ones that go on the utility are different as you can see i did not know this i bought a set at red power one year and got home and realized that they were not they were completely different but you can see the size in the how much difference there is in those uh those ahead were fine and i got some torque amplifier decals from our emblems from them as well so but yeah make sure you know i did not know that the the international and the farmall ones are different and uh what i'm gonna do right quick i'm gonna go ahead and uh we'll put them on let you see that see how that goes here's the newest edition the equipment shed you'll see a little bit on that one later picked up some fenders for my dump truck and you can see here got these emblems here i'm gonna go ahead and put these on like i said i do a apologize for the for the lighting oh ain't that looking good now like a brand new brand new tractor almost but anyway uh i got them on there use the little keepers uh like a little keeper that goes or a little piece that goes around the post there um you put that push those in the sheet metal already then you slide the the emblem in there and that'll hold it but then they've got these little flat keepers um here's one of the old ones a little flat keeper but it's a little little keeper like that it just slides on the back and holds it in and that that uh assures it that uh it's not going anywhere so like i say if you're looking for any uh metal emblems for your farmall or international harvester tractor um be sure to check out that emblem guy jeff foreman uh like i say a good friend of mine uh i will see him out in uh ran tool here in a few weeks i won't be too far off and um like i say you can reach him right here and i'll uh i'll put that on the screen there for you be sure to uh check him out and uh tell him farmall 51 sent you and uh he's got a special board emblem board that he's put together um i'm gonna see if i can do a little bit of a video highlight that a little bit while we're out there at ran tool now some people say well matt what are you putting brand new emblems on the old tractor like that for i sleep better at night knowing that my stuff has all the correct decals everything on it uh i like i like my stuff to look like it's supposed to look i don't like the half-ray rig something or whatever if you don't have the money that's fine but sure looks nice when you show up at a show and you've got all the correct emblems uh correct paint and things like that on there and that's why i always say go with the best stuff and do it right the first time you'll spend way less money might cost you more than the initial run but like i say it'll be a lot cheaper and that's why i say you know if you want decent emblems want stuff to look right straight emblems correct correctly colored styled emblems make sure you go to that
