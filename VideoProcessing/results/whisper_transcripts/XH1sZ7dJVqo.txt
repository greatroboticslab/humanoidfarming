 I know I'm not the only one with goals to live more sustainably, but didn't know where to start. We started homesteading several years ago, and I can honestly say this is the best place to start. You can start with a garden, raising chickens, raising bees, whatever you're most interested in, start there. Along the journey, you'll learn how to reuse and repurpose things, you'll get connected with nature, and you'll learn lifelong skills that honestly are invaluable. There's a free Homestead Summit happening at the end of this month that will help you get started on some of these skills. The link to the registration is in the comments.
