Howto & Style
 We wanted to put in one acre of soybeans, so we decided to plow the field first. Took a few passes to get the plow dialed in, but as you can see, once we got it dialed in, the Kubota L3901 40 horsepower tractor with a hydrostatic transmission had no problem pulling the plow. We walked across the field with no problem, two rows at a time. You can see the orange clay here, and that caused the tractor to have to work a little bit. But for a hydrostatic compact tractor, it really had no problem going across this whole field. And there's nothing quite like plowing a field. It instantly transforms the field, and as you can see here at the end, we are left with one acre of freshly plowed field that was ready to be dissed and planted.
