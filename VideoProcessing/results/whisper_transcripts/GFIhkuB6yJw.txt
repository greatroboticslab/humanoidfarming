 Hi friends, welcome back to our TR Studios. Before enjoying this video I request you to subscribe, press bell icon. Welcome to TR Studios. What's something people don't know about the secret life of merle fish breeding? Today, we're diving into the fascinating reproductive biology and breeding strategies of the merle fish, scientifically known as Chana CPP, a prominent member of the Chana Day family. Merle's are dioecious, meaning they possess distinct male and female individuals. Males are generally more slender, while females develop a noticeably bulging abdomen as their ovaries mature during the breeding season. The genital pore is also more prominent and reddish in females, whereas males have a smaller genital papilla. The reproductive organs, or gonads, are paired in both sexes. Males have paired, tubular testes, while females possess paired, sac-like ovaries that become especially enlarged as the breeding season approaches. The oviducts in females extend posteriorly and open through agonopore. Sexual maturity in morels is typically attained within the first or second year of life, enabling them to participate in the complex courtship and mating behaviors critical for successful reproduction in their lentic and lotic freshwater habitats. The breeding season is typically initiated by rising water temperatures, generally within the range of 26 to 30 degrees Celsius. The peak breeding period for murals usually occurs from April to July, although the preparatory phase, when females develop enlarged ovaries, can begin as early as February or March. During this period, males and females engage in elaborate courtship rituals, including synchronized swimming and tactile interactions to ensure mate compatibility. Males become highly territorial, aggressively defending optimal spawning sites, often shallow vegetated zones, by displaying threat postures and chasing away conspecific rivals. Sexual dimorphism is further evident as males intensify their coloration and display pronounced fins to attract females and signal reproductive fitness. These visual and behavioral displays function as honest signals of genetic quality, thereby increasing the probability of successful mate selection. Once a pair bond is established, the male and female cooperate closely throughout the spawning process, exhibiting coordinated behaviors. The pair selects a secluded spawning site, typically among dense aquatic macrophytes, which provide both physical protection and optimal microhabitat conditions for egg development. The female deposits between several hundred to several thousand eggs, with fecundity varying by species. For example, Chana striatus may produce between 4,422 to 20,070 ova, and a 1 kg female can release around 10,000 to 15,000 eggs. These eggs are pelagic, spherical, non-adhesive, and bright yellow. Fertilized eggs are transparent, while unfertilized eggs appear opaque. The male externally fertilizes the eggs, which then float freely in the water column, or may adhere lightly to submerged vegetation or substrate. Both parents exhibit pronounced biparental care, a relatively rare trait among teleost fishes, by remaining near the nest and actively monitoring the eggs. In some cases, males are especially vigilant in guarding the eggs and young. Parental behaviors include fanning the eggs with pectoral fins to enhance oxygenation, removing detritus, and aggressively repelling potential egg predators or conspecific intruders. Fertilization rates in murrals can range from 70 to 98%. Hatching occurs rapidly, typically within 24 to 30 hours after fertilization, depending on water temperature. The eggs hatch into free-swimming larvae, commonly referred to as fry. Parental care persists post-hatching, with adults, most notably the male, herding and protecting the fry, maintaining group cohesion, and guiding them away from threats until they achieve independent feeding and locomotion. This extended parental investment markedly enhances juvenile survival rates, exemplifying advanced reproductive and parental strategies within the chanidae. In captivity, successful breeding of murrals requires simulation of natural conditions, including stable water temperatures, 26-30 degrees Celsius, dense aquatic vegetation, and minimal disturbance to facilitate courtship and parental care. Induced spawning can also be achieved using hormones such as human chorionic gonadotropin, or HCG, to stimulate ovulation and spawning. Observing these behaviors in a controlled aquarium environment provides valuable opportunities to study the species' reproductive ecology, ontogeny, and parental investment strategies.
