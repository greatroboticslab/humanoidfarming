 All right guys, well we got another nice little one for us today. Broken off an ear off a front end loader. This is the picture they sent me. It's kind of funny when I get these calls. I don't normally get the calls to do these small bucket shanks anymore. Or any of the little repairs on those types of buckets. But they normally just call me for the bigger stuff, which is kind of funny. But you know, it's cool. At least I get known for something. But anyway, we're out here in the middle of nowhere. And actually, the road, one of the main roads that come out here is, we're so far out in the woods, the road was named Koon Neck. Can you imagine that? So we're way out here. But anyway, so this is our project. What it looks like, obviously this goes onto a front end loader way in the distance. Let me see if I can zoom in. No, I can't zoom in. But this was broken a very long time. This shows here. This shows here. That hadn't been cracked for a while. The only thing really holding it on was this bottom piece right down here. So, as you can tell right there. So it held till it didn't. And so our goal is to just put it all back together. And so what I'm going to do is I'm going to cut a bevel here, here, here, and here. And same thing with this here. And get it all glued back together. Now this hole is a little bit sloppy already from a lot of use. So there's, you know, there's some forgiveness on my end, which is great. Because, you know, there's always a little bit of warping or movement that can happen. So we'll just have to be cautious to make sure that we get the right spacing. And just as long as the pin slides into that in and out, right, we're good. Because it's already wore out. So one of the first things I want to do is go ahead and start beveling this and this piece. And so let's, let's do that with this guy right here. All right. So we installed the pin here a little bit. Just kind of get an idea. So you got a little bit of play. So it fits together pretty good. So this threaded part obviously got wallered out. But what we're going to try and do is in this section right here, we're going to try and see if we can bevel that point right there. And then possibly this point right there and that point right there. And so we'll follow that line all the way across the top here. Same thing here. We'll look around this side. This side is pretty, pretty simple. And then you put a bevel. Something like that. Now you don't want to get too crazy beveling because then you'll be sitting here welding for hours unnecessarily when you can get to the root of it easy enough. So this at least gives me a little bit of a game plan as to how much to start cutting out. Some of these here on the bottom are going to be a little tricky. So the majority of the bevel may actually come from this piece on the top instead of this piece here because we had to get around this nub where this here is. Now what we're going to do is we're going to use a nut. We're going to inset it in here. So we're going to most likely gouge around here to inset that nut and it will just weld around the perimeter because those threads are hosed. And that'll help us in the sense that we can weld underneath it a little bit better. You'll see as I progress. But this gives us an idea of how much we can start trimming. This side I'm not going to trim hardly anything at all. It's just mostly going to be this right here. So let's start separating that up and beveling. The thing that I'm missing is I profitability about five images right here. So if I can just run into VIP Take a try and see it. It is a great sport situation. Just while I'm out taking that grip while I riding together I'm doing a lot of things. You've got a lot of things in everything this is understood. Like Carising газת by a cloud. Most of these are guys. This is difficult to divert it during this segment. By the way we're pushing batteries on the colour app on the Simply стрok providing Trimble We can accommodate follow the T m史上 è stato 15 godบ hard, and it went a little bit ancora high, but not into a Protagonal cleaning version Oh, here's the tricky part. oh So if you look here, you can see where I kind of got the center pointer here, but it looks like I may have to go a little deeper towards this backside. And same thing over here. I didn't quite get the angle that I was looking for. So I have to run it again, but that's okay. It's better to creep up on it than to pass it up. Okay. Let me cut that a little more. nice, so I'm salt salt noise Okay. Okay. This guy. Okay, come on a sec. So we can see here, that's the angle I need to cut all the way across that way and hopefully I get to tying the both together. Even now we just keep trimming a little bit here and there. I'll grab my wrong glasses. Look at the bottom right here and let's cut from the top. It prettysey right here too! Runner. 2 more minutes locker. First preparer bringsます. Be Spanish and bzwp p%$ professor of�만 Paty steve to equip for convenient description. I'll be able to point it down just a little more. I'll turn it back around. I think this guy needs to seal. It's hot. Okay. Yeah, of course. Okay, let's go ahead and move over to this side here and get this beveled a little bit. Let's look on this side and see how much I need. Okay, about there. So somewhere in that range. Want to go about right? Yep. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let's go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I can point it down some more. Okay. Okay. Let's take a photo off again Larry Kpoch. inside the whole pot down in the middle and down Very close Let me try and clean this up. This is not going to be fun right here. This is going to be really challenging. The specs of the cast that broke. Something like that. Close. Okay, let's try that. To be continued. So So Now this side is a little more jacked because I was purposely moving the torch side to side But it should be okay. Let's look over here. I can't tell how much Okay So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So Cool So So So So So So I can I can afford to cut a little more Right here So So I will cut from that way this way actually And it'll be kind of a double bevel But Things are looking alright This side here needs Needs a little bit like And I'm pointing you guys in the wrong direction This needs a little bit of fixing right here Right in that area I might be able to bevel this a little bit more This way I don't quite know yet This is really jagged but we'll clean all that with the grinder So this shouldn't be too bad Looks like we have enough Enough bevel here I'm also gonna be back gouging Since I'm gonna install that nut in this area I can't cut that with a torch You know it'll just be a bevel So I'll just gouge in there Around in here to where that nut will sit in there And it will just weld around the perimeter of the nut And it should be fine And here we'll get Close to 100% as possible That's the side that we really didn't cut At all A lot of build up in that area Of course we'll clean out all the The grainy Graininess out of it But it looks really good So let's keep going Uh oh, the bus is coming There he is Alright let's go To make the burner To make sure You can see the lead Everything is not constructed It's a longomming You can use theagnose You know theут hmm and looks like I may need to go with that a little more because I don't like it but let's let's see what it does first before I cut too much too much off of it which is the one I need to modify this one okay okay so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so burning plastic or something I cut way too much on here okay well that stinks okay well that stinks okay we're pretty close all right well I think that's looking good yeah looking pretty good we got a where is it at I can't see got a gap in there for 100% penetration I definitely got a gap over here cut way too much but that's all right and all right so I'm gonna go ahead and tack these corners here tack these corners here and flex this up and down just a little bit so that that pin sits free and then we'll put a piece of flat bar from here to here to keep it from moving in the other direction oh actually sorry we need to grind that first all that that edging of the cast first but that's what we're gonna do next and that way we can start welding on it I'll do a little bit of weld here I'll turn this thing over weld the other side it's just gonna be a back and forth kind of thing but it's the only way to do it either that or maybe I'll set it up on his back and do both vertical welds as it's standing up maybe I'll grab it from the crane over there and I don't know we'll see I saw there's no rules to it so we'll just do it as we do it and again as I mentioned before this is a how I'm doing it not how to do it so let's get her done you like it? seems pretty alright cool so all right so we got most of that cleaned up it'll work out fine fine ground up the bevels a little bit and clean them a little mill scale off of it and stuff or the slag so we're gonna go ahead and go and put it on there still warm kind of in that general area so we'll have to watch it as we tech it but it looks like we are in good shape we've got the piece here it's gonna go right in there so let's get to decking it so so Turn it up about three. Okay, so here's the first pass. This pass came out pretty good. Nice and smooth, which is nice. I will be back gouging the inside. You can see some spots there that it came through, which is good. I think I'm going to run one more pass, and then we'll flip this guy over and start gouging the inside. Actually, we'll gouge some clearance for that first, then we'll flip it over. But this is looking good. All right. So somewhere around there. I'll gouge all that out. I put that second pass, so it looked pretty good. I'll gouge all that out. I'll gouge all that out. I'll gouge all that out. I'll gouge all that out. I'll gouge all that out. I'll gouge all that out. I'll gouge all that out. I'll gouge all that out. Okay, so that looks pretty good. Cut out a little much, but hey, it doesn't hurt anything. So that'll be good there. A little bit of gouging there, just on the end. Okay, now we're going to turn this guy over and gouge under there, and then start putting probably a little more passes, maybe about three passes under there on the bottom side. Then I'll come back and fill this top up just to kind of not create too much tension in either direction. So let's get that flipped over. Okay, we got this elevated, and you can see some of the root pass right there, not so much there. Some of that in this area is where the bolt goes through, so I'm not going to concern myself with gouging too deeply in there, so I don't want to get to where the bolt doesn't pass through that. So that may stay a little shallow, but further down here I do need to open it up right in this area right here. That way I can reach in there, there and on the top right here. Right in that area, just a little bit. So as I mentioned, I kind of gouged it there, it kind of goofed up, but it'll be fine. Alright, let's see about opening that up. полез about it in Aaron. Ok, the that in this industry, ohisiall, ohisiall, haisse. You can fly that like a long time left here, but if there's a 15 pace I don't get that good. Alright, so I got to the base of the crack there. There's no more visible crack. It's just weld from the opposite side. There's the area where I told you I was going to avoid and then I was able to get way down there and I'll be able to weld it from this side here. Still not pretty, but I'll be able to fill it in from there. So I'll probably start here, put a pass up that way and then put a pass here this way and slowly figure out how to cover that hole. That was a lot of digging that I did. But either way, it'll work out. Just need to keep at it. It's something you hear now. And then the fivefizer actually opened. And now it sounds like the different types ofsu avecERSFAT in an hour from the bay, and now the scout had like... Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Okay. Okay. Just lay down. Yeah. I guess I almost forgot to listen. Here, here, we are available options. See this next week? As quickly as I Брошо Мы в 검ке Streурника посğim vraag up the week. And ya!<|es|> Okay, let's get started. oh Okay, got a little bit of weld down now already. Welded that nut in there. Little bit more build up. I don't know if you caught it the last of the fast forwarding, the pin still fits in there. So that's good. I'm going to let it cool just for a moment. I'm going to let it cool just the hair because it just feels getting a little too hot. And then we'll go from there. Keep at it. We're slowly getting there. I already did all I'm going to do there. I need to run a couple of laps, about one, two, three, maybe four passes there. And then go around that nut. And then we'll flip it back over and finish out the inside. Looking good. Alright, still looking good. Okay, flip it over and almost done. Going feature experiments. How did you get I idea what this will happen to you and I have to do some mistakes. Cool. Like helping out cutting out refused for me to be serious about what I'm wanting and what I did. Thank you very much for following me. It's hard if I cut three feet. Here's how it just moves. Good feel. What happens? A little build up. I had to build up around that pocket where the bolt goes from the other side. Now I need to build this up here. Alright, well that's about as close as I'm going to get it. I went ahead and filled up those gouged areas and I shouldn't have done that. I've created more problems than anything. But that was about as good as I'm going to get. Let me flip it over so I can show you the other side. Alright guys, so although a lot of that was fast forwarded, you kind of get the gist. Here's what it looks like. I'm about as good as I can get it. That side was a little tougher. But either way, and I did have to buff some spots. You can kind of see where it's still touching. But the pin still goes in there. And I'm going to let the mechanic take that off. And you know if he needs to buff it out a little bit more as well, that works. So, this came out pretty slick. Not as slick as I can get it at least. So, hope you guys dig it. And you know, we're going to go drop it off over there. Somewhere right there. And head on home because it's hot. Alright, thanks for watching. And we'll catch you guys on the next one.
