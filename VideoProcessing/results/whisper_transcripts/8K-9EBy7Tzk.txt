 Welcome back. In this video, we are discussing on different question answers that has appeared in the past papers in Mumbai University exams for first year BALB students semester 1. We are going through a series of questions and answers in these videos, rather long videos. These questions have appeared in the past papers, so I am taking it up. The request is that ignore all the background sounds, the cars honking, the birds chirping, whatever, my cats meowing and all of that. Ignore all of that and just focus on the questions and answers because that is what is ultimately going to count in a few days. I can't help it. It's nature and nature will take course, its own course and I have no control over it. Thank you very much. So let's start now. Discuss the factors responsible for the growth of population in India. So we are going to talk about why the population is increasing in India. What are the reasons or what are the factors for the growth of population in India? The growth of population in India is influenced by a combination of social, economic, cultural and health related factors. I have covered this growth of population in India, not in India specifically, but not generalised to India, but overall in my earlier videos also. But it was not specifically a detailed focus on all the factors. So we are going to go through this one at a time. Now the influence or what influences the population in India, the growth of population in India is three or four factors, main important, basically combinations of these. One is social factor, that is society, economic factor, whether you have money, whether you are rich, poor, what category you fall into, culture, what is your culture say, and your health related factors also, young population, old population and so on. So let us understand the key reasons behind the population growth in India. All right. Need to keep saying all right again and again. Okay. The key reasons behind this population growth in India will, if you understand these key reasons, then this will help in drafting policies and strategies for managing this demographic change. So if you want to control the population or strategise something about the population, then we have to understand the key reasons for this growth. Now what are the main factors responsible for this growth? First is the high birth rate, common sense and decreasing mortality, mortality rate. Mortality rate means death rate. So death rate is going down. People are not dying that much as they used to earlier. I am not saying that they should die. But the death rate is reducing and birth rate is going up. So of course the population will grow. More children are being born, less people are dying. So population will grow of course. Now in the high birth rate, we have further four points. Preferences, cultural preferences for large families. Many people or married couples or their families also, they prefer, they like to have large families. They don't like to have just one child or one boy or one girl. They want some sibling for them also. And they have also grown in larger families. So they therefore prefer more children. So many parts of India, there is a cultural, that is in the culture only it is there. And social preferences are also there because of societal pressure and everything. To have large families. This is especially observed in villages or rural areas. Of course, when it comes from culture or societal preferences, it is basically rooted in the tradition itself. That the couple should have more children. To ensure better support for parents in old age. So that is the mentality. That who will support us in our old age. So our children will do that. So more children will be much better. And to maintain the family's prestige as well. So these are all notional ideas of the traditional concepts of the large family. And that has been going on even today. Early marriage is again one of the reasons which is happening even today. At the age of 18 or 19 or even earlier also in the villages, 16 years. I personally know of people, especially from villages, who get their children or their girls married at a very early age. Because of societal pressure. Which is very true. There is a lot of cultural and societal pressures on parents to get the children married off early. Early marriage, which is quite common in certain regions, in the rural areas as I spoke about. There the girls are often married before the age of 18. Very true it is. Early marriages, they contribute to its longer reproductive years for women. Now the reproductive years is approximately, I suppose, 45 or so. Approximately on an average I am saying. Which leads to higher birth rates. Because now you have duration from 18 till, or maybe 16 till 45. So, this leads to more birth rates. More children taking birth. Because of the higher or longer reproductive years for women. It is not that they keep producing but, or they keep giving birth to many children. But even 5, 6, 7, we all have come across children in one, for one couple. High fertility rate. Now, despite improvement in education and awareness, the fertility rate in India remains higher than in many other countries. Fertility rate means, how many women can give birth in 1000. So, that is very high. Fertility rate means, how many children are born to women of reproductive age. That is basically between 15 to 49 years. My estimation was correct, 45 years. Now, the fertility rate, that is how many children are born to a woman in their reproductive age group. Is very high compared to other countries. The average number of children per woman. This is decreasing, but it is still higher than the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman. That is on an average for women in India. Each woman, they are having 2 children, 2.1 children. Of course, we can consider 1, but because it is an average. So, I am saying 2.1 children per woman. There is a lack of awareness and family planning. A wide, lack of widespread awareness. Although, government is taking many efforts in spreading awareness about family planning methods. And it has been going on since independence also. This is, specially we see lot of this awareness being spread in urban areas also, but more so in rural areas. Even then, in spite of that, there is higher birth rate. Family planning programs are being promoted. But there is still limited access to contraceptive methods in certain areas. So, the contraceptive methods, few of them are like birth control pills or contraceptive implants. Injections are there. Then we have condoms and other things for doing family planning methods. Let's move on to the decreasing mortality rate. Improvement in healthcare. Of course, medical technology and advancement in the healthcare. This has led to significant decrease in the death rates. There has been improvement in the number of hospitals that are being built by government and by private individuals. The medical staff and the healthcare facilities is improving. And this has led to higher life expectancy and lower mortality rate. Nutrition and sanitation. That has also helped in lowering death rates. Improved living standards. Better nutrition. Availability of clean drinking water, which is very important to avoid the spread of diseases. And sanitation facilities. Like building toilets and everything. In the households, in the villages especially. This has greatly reduced the death rates among infants and children. Nutrition is very important. Vaccinations and controlling diseases. Widespread vaccination programs and the control of diseases like polio, malaria, tuberculosis. These have also contributed sharp decline in death rates of, especially among infants and children. They are more prone to polio, malaria, tuberculosis like diseases. And because of the vaccination by the government, vaccination programs being run by the government, that has contributed greatly into decrease of death rates, especially among the children. Next, let's look at the advances in public health and medicine. India has implemented large-scale immunization program, that is vaccination programs, or building up immunity of the children. Then this has reduced child mortality rates, death rates, by preventing infectious diseases like polio, malaria, and tuberculosis. Better medical facility treatments are available. Improved healthcare infrastructure is there. And that has increased the life expectancy and reduced the impact of both communicable and non-communicable diseases. That is that which can be spread by contact even by through air also. So, because of these advancements in medical, medicines and pharmaceutical industries, the life expectancy has increased. People have access to healthcare facilities, especially the government's efforts that has provided a lot of affordable healthcare initiatives like National Health Mission, National Health Mission, Jan Ashuddhi Kendras, have improved the health of the population, thereby reducing the death rates. We see a lot of municipalities also taking up these healthcare initiatives, where poor people can go and get free of charge or free of any fees, treatment through these healthcare facilities. So, economic factors. Of course, there is improvement in living standards because of economic development. So, because of higher income, better housing, and better living conditions, having clean water, sanitation. This has also contributed to decline in mortality rates. So, it is not just about higher population growth rates, what are the factors. But it is also about the death rate is going down, the mortality rate is going down because of all these factors of improved standard of living. It is not that it should not happen. People should not improve their standard of living. But, of course, at that same time, the population is growing because of this. Earlier, before 1940s, 30s, or even 1900s, the average age was around 35-40 years, 45 years of death. So, by the age of 45-50 people used to die because of lack of medicine, clean water, clean drinking water, and sanitation and all of that. The malaria, there was no vaccination programs at that time. But now, because of all of these features, because of all of these facilities, this technological upgradation, modernization, higher incomes, people are enjoying good health care, and because of that their life expectancy is going up. Nothing wrong in that. Economic growth has also led to greater urbanization. That is, people are moving from villages to cities and higher population densities in the cities also. Many people are moving. Many people are moving. Many people are moving, like in hordes are moving from villages to cities in search of job. Because there is lack of job, money, facilities in the villages, so they move towards the cities. And the population density in the cities are increasing. The availability of employment opportunities in urban areas that also attracts people from rural areas, which contributes to urbanization and population growth in cities. Now, with better housing, transportation, roads are being developed. Communication infrastructure is being there. Mobile facilities there for everyone. Even the poorest of poor can afford a phone now. Urbanization has led to population growth in cities. People are moving from villages to cities. And this has created a cycle where economic development attracts more people. So wherever there is economic development, people will go for work, to find work, to earn money, to earn livelihood, for better future, for better prospect, which in turn supports further economic growth. So this is a cycle which will further lead to more economic growth. And for better facilities and then higher life expectancy. Social and cultural factors. Religious beliefs. In many parts of India and many other countries also, there are a lot of religious beliefs which encourage large families. Some communities value the idea of having multiple children for religious or cultural reasons. Pardon me for my slip of tongue. Gender bias. I am not even sure how many people will reach this. So it doesn't matter, I suppose. Gender bias. A preference for male children over female children. Right. Here, this is one of the gender biases, one of the important points. Especially in certain regions, has led to the practice of having more children to ensure, especially more male children, to ensure the birth of male offspring. So many people prefer male children over female children. So they will continue having children until they get a male offspring. Although this has started to change with increasing awareness, the preference for male children still persist in some areas. So this is still true. Traditional beliefs... Religious beliefs also matter. Lack of just an English perspective. Lack of women's empowerment. In certain parts of the country, limited access to education and economic opportunities for women leads to early marriages. Since they are not educated and they don't have any source of livelihood, to marry at a very early age and have larger families. The empowerment of women, when women are educated and they have opportunity for participating in economic activities, that would help reduce the birth rates over time. Migration. Why does the population of a region increase? Because of either internal migration or international migration. So when people migrate from a rural, that is from village to cities for better opportunities, for job opportunities, for education or for living standards, then the population of that particular region will increase. That is population of cities will increase. And this has contributed significantly to the growth of metropolitan areas where the population is above certain lakhs of people in per square feet area or certain area. International migration. Here what is happening is people are migrating from India or people are migrating to India from countries like Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka. And lot of people from India also migrating to countries like US, UK, Europe. There the population is increasing. And here people are coming from Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka into India. Due to the political instability in those places or economic, better economic opportunities in India, so people are immigrating to India. This also contributes to growth of the population. In the same policies and programs, family planning programs. Government has made efforts to control population growth by introducing family planning programs. But its implementation still remains a challenge, especially in rural areas. Now, despite all these efforts, cultural norms, again the same thing, cultural norms, societal norms, societal pressure, religious beliefs, they are not using contraceptive use. And the resistance to contraceptive use limits the success of such programs. People are still not using contraceptive use to, for having less children. So they will still use, they are still avoiding that. Public awareness campaigns. The government and non-governmental organizations have launched awareness campaigns promoting family program, maternal health, that is mother's health and child welfare. But awareness and access remains inconsistent across the regions. Now, second step 3 in the world. First slide. Technological Advancements. Technological Advancements in Agriculture has increased food production, leading to reduced starvation and malnutrition. Although this is good thing, has also helped in reducing starvation death and malnutrition deaths. This has supported population growth by improving the overall health and nutritional status of the population. So the overall health because of higher food production, less starvation or reduced starvation and malnutrition and higher protein intakes has helped the health of the population, overall health of the population as well as the nutritional status of the population. Improvement in medical technologies. This has also helped medicines have come in, diagnostics has come in and treatments have contributed to longer life spans. There are a lot of Molla clinics and facilities, healthcare facilities in villages where people can go for their medical emergencies, their medical needs. And this has contributed to population growth, especially among older adults. Urbanization. Once again, people are migrating to cities in search for better education, employment and healthcare. And this has resulted in increased population concentration in urban areas. This has led to higher population growth rate in cities. Urban centers provide better healthcare because we know that in cities we have good hospitals, doctors. And a lot of people come from villages to cities for their healthcare related needs. So urban centers provide better healthcare, education also and economic opportunities so that they can earn more money, leading to a higher standard of living and reduced mortality rates. The urban growth attracts more people creating a cycle of population growth. Globalization. Now, the whole world has become almost one. People can travel very easily from one place to another place. The increased integration of India into the global economy has led to improvements in various sectors such as trade, industry and service. This has contributed to urbanization and migration of people to urban centers resulting in population growth. So, let's move on to the next one. Next question. National Agricultural Policy of 2000. We have to do analysis of that. The National Agricultural Policy of 2000 which was introduced by Government of India. What was its aim? It was to address the challenges faced by agricultural sector. That is why the National Agricultural Policy was drafted and implemented. It came into effect. Improving the productivity of the agriculture. First, address the challenges faced by agricultural sector. Then improve the productivity of the agriculture. And ensure food security for the growing population. So, these are the three main aims of the NAP National Agricultural Policy of 2000. That is address the challenges faced by agricultural sector. Improve the productivity of agriculture. And ensure food security for the growing population. Three things. The policy was designed to provide a comprehensive framework for sustainable agricultural development. And to address issues like low productivity. Why productivity in agriculture is low. That also needs to be addressed. And for that NAP was, NAP came into effect. Inadequate infrastructure. Infrastructure would include irrigation, seeds, high quality seeds and so on. And changing demands of the economy. Let us learn about the objectives of why the NAP was there. Its aim we already saw. Now we are looking at its objectives. The National Agricultural Policy of 2000 laid down several key objectives that aimed at improving the agricultural sector. What was the main reason for getting NAP? So what are their objectives? Main reasons. One was food security. Very important for a country. Ensuring adequate supply of food grains for the entire population. By improving domestic food production. This is one of the most important reasons. Food security. Otherwise, India has to go to other countries for their food needs. Sustainability. Promoting sustainable agricultural practices that protect and conserve the natural resource base. That is, the soil health. Government has worked a lot on the soil health, crop rotation and all of that. Enhancing the farmers about the improvements in technologies, use of seeds, irrigation facilities and all of that. Sprinkler system and all of that. Higher productivity. Enhancing productivity in agriculture to meet the growing demand for food due to population growth. Population is growing. The demand for food is growing. And that can be only met when there is higher productivity through agricultural activities. Economic viability. Increasing the income of farmers is very important. Because then, only then they will be motivated to continue doing the farming. And improve their standard of living as well as. Because we see a lot of farmers as their standard of living is also very poor. Even today also. Increasing the income of farmers and improving their standard of living is one of the objectives of NAP. Equitable growth. Ensuring that the benefits of agricultural growth reaches all sections of the society. Particularly small and marginal farmers. Very important. Export competitiveness. Encouraging agricultural exports to tap into the global market. And increase the foreign exchange earnings from agriculture. So there are six main objectives. One was the food security which is very important for the country. And the growing population. Food security is very important. Sustainability. The agricultural practices should be sustainable. Higher productivity would include meet the growing demands for food due to population growth. Increasing the income of the farmers. That is economic viability. The growth should be equitable. That is all sections of the farmers. Small as well as marginal farmers should be able to get benefit of agricultural growth. Which would include your loan facilities, funding, technology, equipments and so on. And export competitiveness. That is more foreign exchange should be coming from agriculture sector. Key features of NAP. Sustainable agriculture. This is one of the features. This is same as objectives. The policy emphasizes the sustainability of agriculture by promoting methods that conserve soil, water and biodiversity. All three. It encourages the use of organic farming, rainwater harvesting and eco-friendly pest management to reduce dependence on chemical inputs. Fertilizers and chemicals are being used in the farming. That NAP's main feature which is very important is organic farming, rainwater harvesting. That is utilizing the rainwater during the off seasons. When harvesting it. That is conserving it. When there is rains. During the rains you conserve the water. Then you re-utilize it throughout the period when there are no rains. That is off season. Eco-friendly pest management to reduce dependency on chemical inputs. Increase in agricultural productivity. This is one of the features. Policy recognizes that productivity in Indian agriculture needs to be enhanced to meet the growing demand for food. It encourages the use of modern technology, improved seeds, better irrigation techniques and fertilizers to improve crop yield. A major thrust was given to the development of high yielding varieties and enhancing productivity of non-food crops such as oil seeds, pulses and commercial crops. Institutional Support NAP emphasizes the strengthening of institutions involved in agricultural development such as research and extension services, rural credit and input supply systems. It also calls for rural infrastructure development in terms of storage, transportation and marketing facilities to reduce post harvest losses. It is also very important that the production, the produce of the farmers is not lost or due to damages or due to non-storages. Promotion of export oriented agriculture. A significant focus on the policy of the policies to enhance the export potential of Indian agriculture. The policy suggests reducing restrictions on agricultural exports and promoting agro processing industries. This is aimed at increasing foreign exchange earnings and creating more market opportunities for Indian farmers. Farmer Welfare The policy includes measures to improve the welfare of farmers, particularly the small and the marginal farmers. This includes access to credits, credit at affordable rates, price support systems to ensure fair prices for farmers produce, minimum support price that is, insurance schemes to protect farmers from natural calamities and crop failures. There is a lack of implementation. That is a problem. Otherwise, all these schemes introduced by the government are very good. But on the ground level, how much of it is being actually implemented? That is what matters. Ultimately, water and irrigation management. Since water is critical input in agriculture, the policy recognizes the need for efficient water management and the development of irrigation infrastructure. It advocates for micro-irrigation techniques like drip irrigation to save on water, sprinkler irrigation to reduce water wastage and improve crop yields. The policy emphasizes the need to rejuvenate traditional water systems such as tanks, ponds, canals to ensure sustainable water use. Focus on rural employment. The policy recognizes that agriculture should not only produce food, but also provide employment in rural areas. It stresses the creation of rural non-farm employment opportunities, which would contribute to poverty reduction and rural development. Now what is non-farm employment means poultry and other basic different types of sheep rearing and all of that. The employment generation program should be linked with agricultural productivity and diversification. Gender and social inclusion. A key feature of NAP is that the policy aims to improve gender equality and social inclusion in agriculture. Women who play a significant role in farming were targeted for training and capacity building in various agricultural practices. Diversification and agro-processing. The policy promotes agricultural diversification to ensure that farmers are not overly dependent on single crop. This includes the promotion of horticulture, floriculture, floriculture, floriculture, and medicinal plants. Agro-processing industries are given a boost to add value to raw agricultural produce, reduce wastage and create employment in rural areas. R&D. The policy highlights the importance of agricultural research and technology in driving agricultural growth. It emphasizes the need for greater investment in agricultural research and the transfer of new technologies to farmers. farmers. It promotes genetic engineering and biotechnology in developing past resistant and high yielding crop varieties. Strengths of NAP. Holistic approach. We will also understand the weakness which is very important. The policy provides a comprehensive and integrated approach to improving agricultural productivity while ensuring environmental sustainability, rural employment, and farmer's welfare. Focus on sustainability. The emphasis on sustainable agricultural practices is a significant strength as it aims to safeguard the natural resource base for future generations. Export competitiveness. By focusing on export-oriented agriculture, the policy seeks to tap into global markets, helping farmers increase their incomes and contributing to nation's foreign exchange reserves. Export competitiveness is also important. This we have already gone through above. Institutional reforms. The recognition of the importance of strengthening agricultural institutions such as research, credit, and marketing, and marketing was a progressive step. This is of core importance. Inclusive growth. Policy aimed to address the concerns of small and marginal farmers and ensured that the benefits of agricultural growth are shared equitably across all sections of the society. Let's move on to the weakness and criticism of NAP. Implementation challenges. While the policy outlined ambitious goals, its implementation faced many challenges. The lack of proper coordination among various government agencies and insufficient monitoring mechanisms led to delays in achieving the intended outcomes. Limited focus on agriculture finance. Although the policy emphasized the need for credit and financial support to farmers, there were gaps in ensuring timely and affordable access to credit, especially for small and marginal farmers. Dependence on monsoon. Despite the focus on irrigation, the Indian agricultural sector remained heavily dependent on monsoon drains, which made it vulnerable to climatic variations and natural disasters like droughts and floods. Inadequate focus on rural infrastructure. While the policy acknowledged the importance of rural infrastructure, the implementation of infrastructure projects such as roads, storage facilities and markets were slow and insufficient. Limited impact on poverty reduction. The policy's focus on enhancing agricultural productivity and export competitiveness did not fully address the poverty and inequality in rural areas, as many small and marginal farmers did not benefit from the growth in the agricultural sector. To conclude, the National Agricultural Policy of 2000 marked an important step toward revitalizing the agricultural sector in India. It provided the framework for achieving food security, increasing agricultural productivity and promoting sustainable farming practices. While the policy had several strengths such as promoting sustainability, increasing export competitiveness and supporting rural employment, its challenges lay in slow and uneven implementation across regions and sectors. For the policy to achieve its objective effectively, strategic reforms in areas such as agricultural finance, infrastructure development and better support for small farmers are essential. There is a need for continued government focus on research and development, climate resistant agriculture and inclusive growth to ensure agricultural sector remains viable and competitive in the long term. Moving on to the next question. What is the structure of Indian money market? Earlier, in the previous video or video before that, we had gone through the capital market. Now we are going through Indian money market. Structure of the Indian money market. Indian money market refers to the segments. Earlier we saw money market is investments for less than one year. So the Indian money market refers to the segment of the financial market where short term borrowing and lending typically with maturities of one year or less takes place. It involves the trading of short term instruments such as treasury bills, commercial papers and repurchase agreements. And it plays a crucial role in ensuring liquidity in the economy. The Indian money market functions under the supervision of RBI which acts as the central authority responsible for regulating and managing the market. The structure of the Indian money market is made up of various institutions, instruments and markets that facilitate the efficient flow of funds. It is divided into organized or formal markets and unorganized or informal markets. Components of the Indian money market. The Indian money market consists of the following main components. Organized money market. The organized or formal money market includes financial institutions and instruments that are regulated by the RBI. This segment includes commercial banks. They are the primary players in the money market. They accept deposits and lend short term loans to individuals, businesses and the government. They also participate in the call money market and repurchase agreements. Repos. Cooperative banks. So first we had commercial banks. Now we have cooperative banks. Similar to commercial banks, cooperative banks also play a role in providing short term loans to individuals and businesses. However, they operate primarily in the rural and semi-urban areas. Nowadays we get cooperative banks even in urban areas. Non-banking financial companies. NBFCs. These are financial institutions that provide short term loans and credit facilities. NBFCs also participate in money market by borrowing and lending short term funds. Non-banking financial companies. Reso Bank of India. The Central Bank of India plays a vital role in regulating the money market. It acts as the lender of the last resort. Manages the country's money supply and ensures the stability of the financial system. The RBI also conducts open market operations and uses other tools to manage liquidity and interest rates. Next, Instruments of the money market. So they can give us a separate category of what are the different instruments of money market or what is the organized money market. So we are covering everything in one question itself. Don't think that it's too long. It is not. The organized money market in India comprises a variety of financial instruments which are used for short term borrowing and lending. The main instruments include Treasury bills. T-Bills. Treasury bills are short term debt instruments issued by the Government of India to meet its short term funding requirement. They have maturities of 91 days, 182 days, 364 days. T-Bills are sold through auctions and are considered a safe investment. CPs. Commercial Papers. Commercial Papers are unsecured short term debt instruments issued by large companies, financial institutions and other corporations. These papers have maturity ranging from 7 days to 1 year and are used by companies to raise working capital. Commercial Papers. Treasury bills are issued by the Government to raise their short term funding requirement. Certificate of Deposit. Certificates of Deposit are time deposits. That is they are deposits for a fixed time issued by commercial banks to individuals, businesses, and financial institutions. These are basically fixed deposits in another way or recurring deposits or different deposits that bank issues to individuals, businesses and financial institutions. These instruments have fixed maturity typically ranging from 7 days to 1 year and offer higher interest rates than regular savings account. Even more than 1 year are also available but then they will not fall under the money market. Repurchase Agreements. Repose. Repurchase Agreements. Repose. A repurchase agreement is a short term borrowing agreement where one party sells securities such as Government Bonds or T-Bills to another party with an agreement to repurchase them at a later date at a higher price. Repos are used by banks and financial institutions to manage short term liquidity needs. Call Money Market. The Call Money Market is a segment of money market where short term borrowings and lending transactions are carried out. Typically for one day. Commercial banks lend to each other in this market at an interest rate known as the Call Money Rate. Reverse Rappos. In a reverse rapport transaction, the RBI borrows money from commercial banks by selling Government Securities and agrees to repurchase them at a later date. This is issued by RBI to absorb excess liquidity in the market. Let's look at the participants in the money market. This question also comes separately. Various entities participate in the Indian money market. Banks and financial institutions. These institutions are the primary players in the money market. They participate in activities such as lending and borrowing short term funds, investing in money market instruments, and participating in Rappos and Reverse Rappos operations. We already discussed what is Rappos and Reverse Rappos. Corporations and Businesses. Companies issue commercial papers and participate in the Call Money Market to manage their short term funding requirements. RBI plays a pivotal role in regulating and controlling liquidity in the money market. It conducts open market operations and uses instruments like Repo Rates, Reverse Rappos rates, and CRR, Cash Reserve Ratio, to influence short term interest rates and money supply. Government. The Indian government also issues Treasury bills to manage short term financing requirements. Okay. Next is Money Market Dealers. Primary Dealers and Brokerage Firms. These are specialized institutions that deal in government securities and are authorized by the RBI. They play a key role in ensuring the smooth functioning of the money market by acting as intermediaries between the government and investors. Brokerage firms are intermediary entities that facilitate transactions in the money market by acting as brokers between buyers and sellers of money market instruments. So, we were covering the components structure of Indian money market. Out of that first one was component of the Indian money market. Second one is unorganized or informal money market. Previously we saw formal money market. Now informal. In addition to the organized money market. The unorganized or informal money market exists which includes a range of non-institutional sources of short term credit. The informal market is often characterized by higher interest rates and lacks regulatory oversights. Let us look at the sources of credit from unregulated or unorganized or informal money market. Money lenders. Traditional money lenders or informal lenders provide short term loans to individuals or businesses especially in rural areas where access to formal banking services may be limited. Cheat funds. Cheat funds are a form of savings and borrowing mechanism in which a group of individuals contribute a fixed amount every month. One member of the group can avail a loan against their share and the amount is decided through bidding or a lottery system. Informal loan agreements. People often resort to informal loan agreements with family members, friends or community members for short term funding needs. Let us look at the challenges of the informal market. Very high interest rate. Lack of transparency. Credit risk. The unorganized money market typically has higher interest rates compared to formal markets due to the lack of regulatory control. The transaction in the informal money market are often not recorded or regulated leading to a lack of transparency. This in turn creates a high credit risk. The absence of any formal contract or regulation increases credit risk in the informal money market. Third is the role of RBI in the money market. The Reserve Bank of India plays a central role in functioning of the money market by regulating the money market, conducting open market operations, setting policy rates and monitoring systemic risk. RBI sets policy and frameworks for functioning of the money market, ensuring stability and liquidity in the system. Open market operations are key tools used by RBI to manage liquidity in the system by buying or selling government securities. If RBI feels or government feels that there is very high inflation, then it may suck out money from the market or from the economy. Second, setting policy rates. RBI uses instruments such as repo rates, reverse repo rates and cash reserve ratio to influence money market liquidity and interest rates. Monitoring systemic risk. risk RBI monitors the risks in the money market and implements measures to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial system. Just to recap the conclusion, the Indian money market plays a crucial role in maintaining financial stability and ensuring liquidity in the economy. The market is structured with a combination of formal institutions such as banks, financial institutions and the RBI as well as informal sources of credit in rural areas. The formal money market includes a wide range of short term instruments such as treasury bills, commercial papers and certificate of deposits and plays a central role in regulating liquidity and controlling interest rates in the economy. The informal money market while providing easy access to credit in undeserved areas remains unregulated and often involves higher risks. The effective functioning of the Indian money market requires constant monitoring by the RBI, reforms to enhance access to financial services and measures to address the challenges in the informal market. Next let's look at the drawbacks of wealth definition of economics defined by Adam Smith. Adam Smith's definition of economics often referred to as the wealth definition, views economics primarily as the study of how nations can create wealth. Smith's definition is rooted in his seminal work, The Wealth of Nations, where he defined economics as the science of wealth production, science of wealth production and the mechanisms that contribute to it. According to Smith, the wealth of a nation is created through the accumulation of goods and services and economics should focus on how to maximize wealth of a country. However, this definition has been subject to criticism over time and several drawbacks have been identified. Narrow focus on material wealth. Smith's definition limits economics to the production accumulation of material wealth, production and accumulation of material wealth often overlooking non-material aspects of human welfare. In his time, the goal of economic activity was largely associated with increasing physical goods and services. It ignored other important facets of economic life such as quality of life, happiness, health and education. These factors which are now considered crucial to the well-being of individuals and societies were not part of his economic framework. Ignores the distribution of wealth. Smith's focus on wealth as the goal of economics fails to address the distribution of wealth among individuals and groups within a society. Wealth creation may not necessarily result in equitable outcomes or improve the standard of living for all members of society. This oversight ignores the issue of inequality, where a society may accumulate wealth but it may be concentrated in the hands of a few, leaving a large section of the population in poverty. Over-emphasis on materialism. Smith's view tends to over-emphasize materialism as the central goal of human activity. By focusing solely on wealth, the definition overlooks the importance of spiritual, ethical or psychological aspects of economic life. The next is over-emphasis on materialism. Smith's view tends to over-emphasize materialism as the central goal of human activity. By focusing solely on wealth, the definition overlooks the importance of spiritual, ethical or psychological aspects of economic life. In modern times, it has become clear that societies cannot be understood merely by the goods and services they produce. Aspects like sustainability, social welfare and cultural well-being play vital roles in shaping the true prosperity of nations. Inability to address market failures and externalities. Smith's framework does not account for occurrence of market failures such as externalities which means unintended side effects like pollution, monopolies or income disparities that arise during wealth creation. This means that in Smith's model, market outcomes are always assumed to be beneficial or efficient, which is not the case in real world markets. Modern economics recognizes the need for government intervention to address these failures and ensure the overall well-being of society. No consideration for environmental sustainability. The wealth definition of economics does not factor in the importance of the environmental sustainability. Smith's framework assumes that wealth can be created without considering the long-term impact on natural resources or environment. In the modern world, it is understood that over-exploitation of resources can lead to ecological degradation, climate change and depletion of natural capital. The focus on wealth alone is incompatible with concerns about sustainable development. The lack of attention to human welfare. Adam Smith's definition centers on wealth without much regard for the welfare of individuals. He considers economic growth as a means to improve the conditions of nations. But this definition did not account for aspects like poverty, reduction, health care and human development. A nation could have an increase in wealth without improving the actual well-being of its citizens. Modern economics emphasizes human development as an important aspect of economic progress, focusing not just on the creation of wealth but also on quality of life. The lack of consideration for services and knowledge. The wealth definition is heavily focused on tangible goods and fails to take into account the growing importance of services and intellectual property in the modern economy. Smith's time was more focused on agriculture and manufacturing. But today's economies are much more service-oriented with technology, education and healthcare being key contributors to wealth. This omission leads to an incomplete understanding of the modern economy where sectors like technology, finance and education are central to wealth generation. Static view of wealth creation. Smith's concept of wealth creation is static in nature, focusing on increasing wealth without necessarily focusing on how it is created or how its growth can change in response to innovation, globalization and technological progress. This narrow view doesn't account for the dynamic evolving nature of modern economies. It lacks an understanding of how factors like innovation, entrepreneurship and global trade significantly influence wealth generation today. Next, let's move on. Arguments against economics. That is, economics is science. The debate on whether economics is a science has been ongoing for years. While many regard economics as a science because it uses systematic method of inquiry, statistical techniques, and models to analyze economic phenomena, and models to analyze economic phenomena. Others argue that it does not meet the strict criteria of a science in the traditional sense. Below are some of the key arguments against considering economics as a science. The lack of universality is a science. Lack of universality. Unlike natural sciences such as physics or chemistry, economics does not have universal laws that apply across all contexts and situations. The laws of physics for example are universally applicable, regardless of the location or time. In contrast, economic principles may change depending on the social, cultural and historical context. Economic behavior in a developed country might differ significantly from that in a developing country. Similarly, the impact of certain policies can vary based on regional characteristics or times of economic crisis. The lack of universal law challenges the classification of economics as a science, as natural sciences are based on universally applicable laws and theories. Human behavior is unpredictable. We will do only four points in this. One of the key principles of scientific study is the ability to predict outcomes with a high degree of certainty, based on controlled experiments or mathematical models. However, economics deals with human behavior, which is inherently unpredictable and influenced by a vast range of factors such as emotions, politics, social pressures and cultural differences. Lack of controlled experiments. Unlike natural sciences, economics cannot conduct controlled experiments in the same way. In scientific fields like chemistry or biology, experiments can be controlled and variables can be isolated and tested. In economics, it is impossible to create a perfect laboratory setting to test economic theories without real-world variables interfering. For example, policies such as tax cuts, interest rate changes or welfare programs cannot be tested in isolated, controlled condition, making it difficult to understand the true impact of a policy. The influence of normative elements. The influence of economic theory is not purely positive, that is descriptive, but also contains significant normative, that is prescriptive elements. Positive economics seeks to understand what is, while normative economics involves judgments about what ought to be. Many economic theories are influenced by subjective opinions on how society should function, leading to value-laden conclusions. For example, debates about income redistribution, taxation or minimum wage laws often involve moral or ethical considerations, which go beyond purely objective analysis. We will do only four of them. We will skip the rest of them. What is social cost? Social cost refers to the total cost to society of an economic activity, including both private costs and external costs, or negative externalities, that are not born by the individuals or firms involved in the activity, but by society as a whole. It reflects the total impact of an economic decision on both the individuals directly involved and the wider community. Components of social cost Private cost These are the costs incurred by individual or firm directly involved in the activity. For example, the cost of producing a good or service, including expenses like labour, raw material and equipment, and external costs. These are the costs imposed on society or third parties who are not directly involved in the economic activity. These costs arise from negative externalities such as pollution, noise, congestion or depletion of natural resources. External costs are often not reflected in market prices. For example, a factory producing goods might incur costs in terms of wages, raw materials and machinery. These are private costs. But it may also generate air pollution that affects the health of nearby residents. Or it may contribute to climate change external costs. Residents or society bear these external costs, not the factory owners. Social cost is equal to private cost plus external cost divided by social cost. Whereas private cost is the cost incurred by producer or consumer, external cost is the cost imposed on others. Others were not part of the transaction or activity. Example of social cost Consider a scenario where a factory is producing goods and in the process it emits pollution into the air. The factory incurs private costs for raw materials, labour and machinery of around 1 lakh dollars. However, the pollution created by the factory imposes costs on nearby residents in the form of health problems, environmental damages and reduced property values. These external costs might total 30,000 dollars. The social cost of the factory production is 1 lakh 30,000 dollars. That is the private cost and the external cost. Importance of social costs in economics. Market failure. Social cost is important because if markets do not account for external costs, they may lead to market failure. Where the true cost of production or consumption is not reflected in market price. This can result in overproduction or overconsumption of goods that generate negative externalities, leading to inefficiency in the economy. Policy implications. Understanding social costs can help policy makers design taxes, subsidies or regulations such as carbon taxes or pollution caps to internalize these externalities. By doing so, they encourage producers or consumers to account for the broader costs of these activities. Cost benefit analysis. The concept of social cost is crucial in performing cost benefit analysis when evaluating public policies or projects. By considering both private and external costs, policy makers can make more informed decisions about which activities are desirable for society. In conclusion, social costs provide a comprehensive understanding of the true economic cost of an activity. Considering not just the private costs incurred by the individuals or firms, but also the external costs imposed on society. When externalities are not accounted for in decision making, it can lead to inefficient outcomes. And social costs become an important tool for correcting such market failures and ensuring the overall welfare of the society. Next, let us check what is density of population or population density. Population density is a measure of the number of people living per unit of area, typically expressed as the number of individuals per square kilometer or square mile. It is an important demographic indicator that helps to understand how crowded or sparsely populated a given area is. The formula for calculating population density is population density equals to total population divided by total area. But total population is the number of people living in the area. And total area is the size of the area in square kilometers or square miles. What is density of population? Population density is a measure of the number of people living per unit of area, typically expressed as the number of individuals per square kilometer or kilometer square or square kilometer. It means that how many people live in a square kilometer is a number of people living per unit of area. It is an important demographic indicator that helps to understand how crowded or sparsely populated a given area is. So, we know that how many people living in a square kilometer are. We know that how many people living in a square kilometer are. Or how many people living in a square kilometer are. The formula for population density is the total population divided by total area. Suppose, 1 square kilometer is 10 lakhs. So, this population density is the total population density. Per square kilometer, 10 lakh people. Okay. Example of density calculation. Suppose, the city has a population of 5 lakh people and cover an area of 250 kilometer square. So, population density density will be 2,000 people per kilometer square. And in the upper example, per kilometer square, 10 lakh people. And here, 2,000 people are staying per kilometer square. Meaning, 1 kilometer is the total population of 1 kilometer. Alright. What is the significance of this? What is the significance of population density? So, one can do urban planning for government. This is local municipality. So, urban planning and resource management. Population density provides important insights for urban planning. Including infrastructure development, transportation system, healthcare and education. We see that in cities, the population is more planning. The bridges, road transport, healthcare facilities, education institutions. So, population density is more planning. So, government will focus more on an area which is highly dense or highly populated. High population density may indicate a need for better public services and housing. Automatically, what happens? If there is a place where population is growing, people start to demand demand. And the municipalities have services to provide. Economic development. Areas with high population density are often associated with urbanization. So, where population is growing, we call cities or urban areas. And may provide opportunities for business and employment. And there, business opportunities or employment opportunities are growing. So, there is a place where high density is growing. However, over population can lead to congestion, resource depletion and increased competition for jobs and housing. So, this is a side effect. If there is a place where population is growing in some area, then there is congestion. Like traffic congestion, water problem, housing problem. If people don't have a house or living in any area. Then, there is resource depletion. There is resource depletion. Especially water. Water. And other resources like food and jobs. So there is competition a lot. So, there is a significance of population density. One is urban planning and economic development. Three is environmental impact. impact high population density can lead to environmental degradation if resources are over exploited. If it is a very small area of the land, then it also affects the environment. But low population density may result in under utilization of land and resources. This is the case of the fact that when population is less, land and resources are under utilization and where there is a lot of use, then over utilization and over exploited. Fourth significance is social services. Population density helps determine the demand for social services such as healthcare, education, sanitation and housing. Areas with high density may face challenges in providing these services efficiently. Next, types of population density. First is arithmetic density. Second is psychological density. Third is agricultural density. Arithmetic density, this is the simplest form of population density and is calculated as per shown above by dividing total population by total land area. The second is nutritional complex density. That is arithmetical density. If we use high density which isäng Thai quality, so if we use high density density toっと 20% more than one object house that is most adjacent to the extent of population, we use native Canulation in what area means inveceаменth bitte plottingっていう particular population into our portion. Pay per a Haynes and charter both the amount of the population and overacting area Candidate also supports the amount of air mans usage 사� of arrive . amount of arable land arable land what land is suitable for agriculture it provides a better understanding of how much of the land is capable of sustaining the population's food needs psychological density is aerable area measure agriculture land is sustainable suppose a square kilometer say 25% of one square kilometer is arable so we see that the density of the land is 100% of the food can give us agricultural density this refers to the ratio of number of farmers to the amount of arable land this is how we measure this density of land in the area of the land which is a very variable means farmable which is how many farmers are in the area so suppose there are 2,000,000 farmers in the area so average is how much of the land is divided so finally we understand that population density is critical why we need to understand population density is because it is a critical indicator used in geography economics and social sciences to analyze how many people live in a specific area a specific area mein kitne loog rette aur uska

issues like urbanization kya karna hai city ka planning kya karna hai development kya karna hai resource ko kya manage karna hai water ka water is a resource usko kya manage karengi public ke policies kya rahengi agar agar agar agar the population density now let's move on to the next one causes of low per capita income in india per capita income is a measure per capita hoota kya hai income is the measure of the average income earned by each individual in a specific region the specific region each particular region particular jage pe a ek aadmi each aadmi each aadmi on an average on an average kya income generate karra hai eek saal mein ek person kitna kama ra hai on an average thik hai usko bolte hai per capita income we will revise again per capita income is a measure of the average income earned by each individual in a specific region typically on an annual basis measured in an annual basis in case of india despite being one of the fastest growing major economies in the world its per capita income remains relatively low compared to developed nations he is a common sense india ka population itna zhaada hai ki per capita ek aadmi kitna kama ta hai on an average woh bhot kam ho jata hai that is because of the population this low per capita income in india is influenced by a range of factors iske bhot saare karen hai ki india ka per individual ka aek specific region mein kitna low average income hai woh bhuske karen kya hai to first is high population growth india has a large and rapidly growing population hum loog khali 4 dekhenge 4 karen dekhenge isme karen bhot saare hai but we will take the first four india has a large and rapidly growing population even though the country's total national income might be increasing national income kya hoata hai GDP gross domestic product woh bhale bharata ho phir bhi india ka per capita income woh bhot kam hai because of large and rapidly growing population the per capita income remains low because it is divided among a large number of people ye karen hai ki jo total income hai bhot saare loogon mein divide ho raha hai on an average yaya high population growth rate means that the increase in total income is spread over more people reducing the average income per person yaya ko common sense hai mathematics hai additionally a large population puts immense pressure on resources leading to unemployment and underemployment to unemployment or underemployment ka dhusara karen ye bhi hai ki because of large population to iske jay se sabko naukari nahi mil paata hai to amlog we are studying causes of low per capita income in india to isi ke saath-saath amlog we can also use this point into other questions like for example high population growth ka karen kya hai to ye sare amlog bol saakta hai uski effects kya hai side effects kya hai to amlog automatically uska bol saakta ki high population growth ki wajze se low per capita income hoota hai aur unemployment hoota hai underemployment hoota hai underemployment hoota hai aur per resource pe natural resources hai uske oopar kaafi pressure aata hai ye sab hum bol saakta hai dhusri questions mein low levels of human capital human capital refers to the skills knowledge and experience possessed by individuals in india there are significant disparities in education and skill development across regions to here we can see that education that education level is not up to the level of education there are very good institutions and there are very mediocre institutions je bueno education provide practical experience enough theorinivable knowledge be popular and교 BC people need know how high population hight or school quality education and vocational training limits productivity and potential for higher paying jobs. When you don't get quality education and training, you don't get the higher paying jobs in the future. That's why unemployment is showing up. Many people are employed in low wage sectors like agriculture which contributes less to the national income per person. What is this cause of low per capita income? Because of low level of human capital. Human capital is not skills, knowledge, experience, so you don't get much money. Because you don't get higher paying jobs. Because for higher paying jobs you need quality education, good vocational training. And therefore many people are employed in the agriculture sector. They also in agriculture, it is said as per the survey almost 40% of India's population is in agriculture. 40% whereas agriculture contributes only 14% to the GDP which is very very less considering the GDP which is very low. How many people are working in agriculture and its allied sectors? Third, dependence on agriculture. Low per capita is also because of this because I just told you that 40% of the population is employed in agriculture sector for their livelihood. A significant portion of India's workforce is employed in agriculture. A sector that generally has low productivity. Agriculture is a low productivity sector and wages also are very low compared to other sectors like manufacturing or services. The aggregate economy means agricultural economy leads to low income for large part of the population. This is also because of low per capita income. Especially since farming is often subsistence based. Subsistence based means that government is given subsidy and highly dependent on weather conditions and government support. So for pesticides, for high quality seeds, farmers are dependent on governmental support. Even for minimum support price, farmer has made produce, wheat, wajra, wheat, wajra, which was used to be used to transport and storage. So these are all things that are very high. So automatically per capita income, per capita income automatically gets reduced because large population is dependent on agriculture. Next inequality and poverty. Of course poverty is low. Per capita income is low. And many major part of the population or major portion of the population in India comes below the poverty line. There is a lot of inequality also. Inequality in the sense rich people are owning high percentage of India's wealth. When the top 10% of the population is the top 10% of the population, they are owning more than 50% of the wealth. Whereas 50% of the population, they have nothing but they have very low. Let's look at the explanation. There are large disparities, inequalities in income distribution in India. Income is a wide scope. Income is a wide scope. In a month, they earn crores or lakhs of rupees. And some people earn 12,000-15,000. They earn 20,000. There is a lot of disparity between the income earned in the population. While the country has seen significant economic growth, We have seen India in economic growth, high economic growth. Benefits have not been equally distributed. This is the reason. If you have only growth in India, but its benefits equally distributed. The wealth gap between rich and poor remains wide. So that is the reason. Ameer is a very weak and a very weak. High levels of inequality mean that a small percentage of population controls small percentage, 10% or 5% population, they have very wealth. But large section of the population, the poverty in poverty, they have very low. So we have seen 4 points. Causes of low per capita is why is low. As a result, Rich is gone through. Response and the population of people that스를 mic�� into more flexibility. So it is loss of low focused$3クennation andень and poverty is spending only 4 points on the size. So, dollar taxes stay. But bigger Monday does not require public profits. We will take two points and then we will take two points. Low industrialization. India's industrial sector is still relatively underdeveloped compared to the developed nations. In the developed nations, the industrial sector is still underdeveloped. The country has a smaller proportion of its workforce engaged in high productivity industries. India's very low population is employed in high productivity industries. What is the impact of this? Industrial sector generally generates higher income level due to technological advancement, higher productivity and economies of scale. India's reliance on agriculture and small industrial base limits overall productivity which impacts per capita income. This is why it impacts per capita income because the low population is employed in high productivity industries. And the sixth, we will go for the sixth one. Limited infrastructure development. Although India has made progress in infrastructure development, many regions still face challenges in terms of basic infrastructure like road, electricity, healthcare and sanitation. So, poor infrastructure empers productivity of business. This is the cause of poor infrastructure. The importance of poor infrastructure is not going to be for roads, hospitals, electricity, electricity, then what will happen? The importance of productivity is not going to be for businesses. And the way due to those in the cause ofتي I would want to be for farmers. That is why it should not be for businesses companies able to save the orchid to taki well as create the 225s. That is why it should increase infrastructure that the inflation is implemented in high productivity in low domestic and have been given the 201. That is why it So, we would like to pull up that 3% of those in high-dқ vat at a bay. So, we have 6 points. Rest we will not do. We will cover only 6 points. There are many many points. 12 points but we will skip all of them. Let's look at the difference between small scale industry and cottage industry. Both small scale industries and cottage industries are important sectors of an economy. Especially in developing countries like India. They contribute significantly to employment and production. Small small industries and cottage industries employ a lot of people. They employ a major population of people. But they differ in several aspects. What is the difference between small scale industry and cottage industry? This is a separate question. Small scale industry is a different question. Write a note on small scale industry. Or write a note on cottage industry also. So, we will get two questions. First, let's look at the definition of small scale industry. SSI. A small scale industry refers to any industrial unit that is characterized by a relatively small investment in terms of capital and production capacity. It typically involves the production of goods and services on a small scale with moderate technology and processes. First, let's look at the definition of small scale industry. First, let's look at small scale industry. They have very little capital in the business and their production capacity is also very small. So that is why it is defined as a small scale industry because capital is very less and their production capacity is also very less. It typically involves production of goods and services on a small scale with moderate technology and processes. Cottage industry is the definition. A cottage industry refers to a home based. So, when we say cottage, it means that the businesses operate from home or family operated businesses are also very small. Where production is carried out using simple tools and techniques. Simple technology. Home based or family operated businesses are known as cottage industries. The work is typically done in the household or small workshops with minimal reliance on large scale machinery. So, cottage industries, we can talk about mechanic shops or for example there is some stall, tea stalls and all of that. These are small stalls. But they are family operated or they are home based like Tiffin service and all of that. Investments and capital. Small scale industries generally require a higher investment in machinery, raw material and infrastructure compared to cottage industries. Of course, because here we need a kind of land to employ people. So, it is a small scale industry. It is a small scale industry. So, it is a small scale industry. So, it is a small scale industry. Here, small scale industry may be need machinery to produce goods and services, raw materials and infrastructure. The capital investment for these industries usually fall under specified limit. For example, in India, small scale industries are defined as those having investment below 10 crore in plant and machinery. Maximum, maximum investments in plant machinery is 10 crores for it to be determined as a small scale industry. I think it starts from 1 crore to 10 crores. Minimum, maximum 1 crore, maximum 10 crores. So, if it is small scale industry, it comes in small scale industry. And if it is about 1 to 10 crores, which should be invested in plant and machinery to be in the plant machinery to be categorized as a small scale industry. Because in cottage industries, it does not require very high capital investments and are typically run by family or from home and in a very limited scale or a very small scale. These industries often rely on basic tools and local raw materials with minimal machinery or use of less advanced technologies. Production Prolocation Small-scale industries usually operate in industrial areas or small factories. Though they may still be located in smaller towns or rural areas. They may require a dedicated space or premises for their operation. But cottage industries are not required in the industry. This is a home-based industry. It is run from home. Production occurs within the household or in small workshop attached to the home. The industry involves individuals and families. In this area, families work, and families work. Producing goods from their homes. The property is made by a house. The property is made by a house. The property is made by a house. The property is made by a house. The property is made by a house. Using basic tools. Employment and workforce. Small-scale industry typically employs larger workforce than the cottage industries. In the small-scale industries, people work in the home. But in small-scale industries, it still requires manpower, labor, to work on machinery, to produce goods. They often hire workers for various tasks like production, marketing, and administration. But the workforce is generally smaller than large-scale industries. Of course. There is no requirement that people should work as well. Minimum or maximum it is not the limit. The limit is the limit. The limit is the capital investment in machinery and plant and machinery. It should be below 10 crore. Because labor force is not required for labor. Cottage industries, of course, I said, typically involves family members and local artisans. We will do two more. We will look at the capital and financial requirements. This is important. Small-scale industries often require external financing through loans, grants, or investments to meet their capital need for machinery, expansion, raw materials. This is why they require external financing. Because cottage industries work with minimal capital and they rely on the family savings. And small loans. They are usually self-financed and depend on very limited external funding. Let's look at the market. What is the market? Small-scale industries usually serve a larger market which could include national, national, or international buyers. They can distribute goods through wholesalers, retailers, or direct sales. Cottage industries being a family owned business, it only caters to or targets local or niche market. They can sell products through direct selling markets or small retailers. The target audience is often specific to those interested in handicraft or unique items. So here, our question is complete. This is the summary. You can pause the video and look at the summary. Okay, next question is, difference between direct tax and indirect tax. In the earlier videos, we had looked at direct taxes like income tax, wealth tax, property tax, gift tax. We had studied in the earlier video. Now we are doing the comparison between direct tax and indirect tax. So taxes are the primary source of revenue for governments. This is the primary source of government. It is the primary source of government. It is the first source of tax for the government. Both direct and indirect taxes. And are classified into two broad categories. Direct tax and indirect taxes. Both serve to generate income for the government. But they differ in terms of who bears the tax burden. The main difference is that which tax burden is the same. The main difference is that which burden is the same. The same is the same. The same is the same. The same is the same. In both cases, direct tax and indirect taxes, ultimately the individual is only going to pay. But how it is paid differs. That is who pays it to the government. So direct tax is the same. Direct individual, businesses or firms to the government. Whereas indirect tax is collected from the taxpayer and paid by the producer or the seller to the government. So what is the main difference? Is who bears the tax burden, how they are collected and their impact on the economy. Let's look at the definition of direct tax and indirect tax. A direct tax is a tax that is levied, that is imposed on, directly on the income. Wealth or property. Now it is not in wealth. Because it is abolished in 2015. So we can still say on the income, wealth or property of an individual. Okay. So direct tax is a tax that is levied directly on the income or the property of individuals or organizations. The burden of this tax cannot be shifted to others. The person or entity on whom the tax is imposed is responsible for paying it. Whereas in the indirect tax, tax is levied on goods and services rather than on income or wealth. The burden of indirect tax can be shifted from the producer or seller to the consumer as it is included in the price of goods or services. But the tax is although collected from the consumer but is paid by the producer. So direct tax will be converted to the government. Direct tax will be converted to the income or profits. This tax will not be shifted to the other. The tax will not be shifted to the other. So NOW YOU WILL stems from agent laws not onlylay but the price should not their benefits. The burden of direct tax falls directly on the taxpayer and it cannot be transferred to anyone else. We have already read it. The burden of an indirect tax can be shifted from the producer or seller to the consumer. For example, the seller may increase the price of a product to include the tax amount, passing the burden to the buyer. What will we do? We will collect the tax amount in the price. For example, the tax amount will be transferred to the buyer. The seller or the producer will collect the tax from the consumer and pay it to the government as a kind of indirect tax. Important is the third example of direct tax. One is income tax, wealth tax, corporate tax and property tax. Corporate tax will be to companies. Income tax will be to individuals and businesses. Property tax will be to the owner of property tax. These are direct tax. These are three or four examples. Indirect tax example is GST. WET is now available on alcohol products. On liquor. On liquor. This is now I believe that WET is still applicable on liquor. Goods and service tax is applicable on the sale of all kinds of goods and services. value added tax is added at each stage of production or distribution. This is the first time. This is the first time GST is replaced WET. What is the tax on the production or manufacture of goods? When goods is manufactured or produced, the tax is manufactured on the sale of goods and goods. The tax is called excise duty. Customs duty is called the tax on imports and exports. The country is called goods and services. That is customs duty. Now we see collections. What is the collection? Direct tax are collected directly from the taxpayer to the government. Directly paid by the taxpayer to the government. This could be through withholding tax. Tax is kept on keeping. Advanced tax payments. Advanced tax payments. Advanced tax payments. Advanced tax payments. Annual tax return. That is your income tax return. Indirect tax is collected from the consumers when they purchase goods or services. These producers or sellers or service providers collect the tax and pass it to the government in the form of GST or tax deducted at source. We will look at impact on prices also. Direct taxes do not directly affect the prices of goods. Of course, because it is not added in the goods and services of the producer. Indirect tax affects the price level of goods and services because the tax is already added in the price. So the consumer is bearing the burden of the higher price. Progressiveness. This is also important. This is separately. Progressive tax. Regressive tax is also a progressive tax. Direct tax is considered as progressive in nature. Why is it called progressive? Because the tax payer is increased by the income. So if you are in a lower income tax bracket, then your income tax liability decreases. But as your income increases, your tax liability also increases. That is why it is said progressive. The people who are less than earning, the people who earn less than earn, the people earn less than earn. They earn more than earn. The wealthier individuals, the high net worth individuals or businesses, they pay a higher percentage of their income or assets in taxes. Indirect tax is considered as regressive. Why? Because even the rich people and the poorest of poor, if you buy a parlay ji biscuit, then a poor person who earn a crore and a poor person who earn a few hundred or thousands, both will pay the same amount of tax regardless of their income level. So that is why it is said as it is a regressive tax. Meaning, Indirect taxes are generally regressive or regressive meaning they take a large percentage of income from lower income individuals because they pay the same tax rate regardless of income. Indirect taxes disproportionately affect people with lower income. So I have both clear progressiveness. Important point is that it is separate too. It also comes to separate. Administration is not doing tax payers. This is also already covered. Direct tax is paid by individuals or entities or businesses. Indirect taxes is paid by consumers or end users. Already we have covered. Electricity will not cover. Okay. Flexibility. Direct taxes are generally more flexible and is adjusted according to the income level. Income level. Direct tax is less than or less than. Business profit is less than. If you have more tax, then you will have more tax. You will have less tax. You will have less tax. So it is, that is why it says it is flexible. Okay. And indirect taxes is not flexible at all because government has already fixed percentage. That 18% tax will be on electronic goods. For example, 5% necessary goods like milk, like for daily needs. All those things. So that is already fixed. So that is why they say it is not flexible. Okay. So we have completed direct and indirect tax comparison. We have compared, we have completed the difference between direct tax and indirect tax. All right. I'll just leave the screen here for a few minutes. You can go through this. The main summary points. Okay. I'll move on next. Short term market versus long term market. This is very important question. Next, we are starting on short term market versus long term market. First, we have done another market in the previous video. Next we are starting on short term market vs long term market. So before we started on a second market, capital market and money market in previous videos. That is also very interesting. I recommend you watching that video also in the previous. I think it's a third or the fourth video. But that also is very interesting to learn. So here in this part, in this question we are going to learn about short term market vs long term market. Of course by immediate inference we can see short term means it will be less than one year and long term market means more than one year. That is what it would mean at the first look. So let's understand this. Markets can be categorized based on the time frame over which they operate. The two primary types are the short term market and the long term market. These markets differ in terms of their time horizon for economic decisions, the factors influencing supply and demand and how prices adjust and response to changes. Now when I talked about money market and capital market, that was related with the money, the capital part. Here we are talking about the actual goods and services, supply and demand in this type of markets. What is the actual market? What is the actual market? So let us look at the definition of a short term and a long term market. Again, what happens in this case? We can also use this learning that we are doing in this particular question. For example, they can tell us write a short note on short term market or define short term market. So in this case, we can easily get 2 mark easily. Long term market and short term market. Even if we know, even if we just understand what is short term market and long term market, that can also help us to write something about it and score marks. Let's start with the definition of what is a short term market. First of all, let us understand what is a short term market. What is a short term market? A short term market refers to a period, time that is where the supply and demand for goods, services or financial assets adjust quickly. Typically within a short period ranging from a few days to a few months, the capacity to change production or supply is limited in short run due to constraints such as existing resources or contracts. So, let us understand that short term market is in short term markets. The supply and demand will adjust quickly to the supply and demand will adjust quickly to the supply. So, that is a short term market. Generally, it is a few days or a few months. The supply and demand will occur over a much longer time horizon. Typically several years. We will understand what exactly what are they talking about. In the long run, producers and consumers have more time to adjust. Now, there is no time to adjust in short term. Because it is a small change. For example, if we take a example of tomatoes. Tomatoes has increased. Immediately, it has an impact in terms of demand. So, if it has increased tomatoes, then the demand will reduce. So, this can happen over a few days to immediately few weeks also. But for example, if you take a luxury purse or luxury goods or non-necessity item, then what happens? Even if the price changes, it will be very different. Over the long term, it will be different. But it will be more clear by looking at more examples. Okay. So, a long term market refers to a period where changes in supply and demand occur over a much longer time horizon. Typically several years. In long run, producers and consumers have more time to adjust. Because there are very slowly changes in supply and demand. So, this is why consumers and producers both can adjust. And the factors of production can be varied. Okay. Time period is generally for short term few days to few months. And long term is several years or even decades. 10 years of market. All right. Flexibility. Short term market factors of production. We know that there are more time to adjust. So, these are more time to adjust. So, consumers and producers both can adjust. And the factors of production can be varied. Okay. Time period is generally for short term few days to few months. And long term is several years or even decades. 10 years of market. All right. Flexibility. Short term market factors of production. We know that there are four factors of production. Four factors. Land, labor, capital and resources. There are three of them. But there are four of them. Land, labor, capital and resources. They are somewhat fixed in the short term. Businesses may not be able to adjust, but also, if you have to adjust the market. So, what you should do, does it do? Do you have to adjust the number of the market? What do you want to adjust? Yes, please. You need to adjust the market. It's a very small cut. So, that's what you should do. It's a very small cut. So, this is a small cut. So, a small cut. You should have to adjust the market. of them land labor capital and resources they are somewhat fixed in the short term businesses may not be able to adjust their capacity quickly due to the limitation in plant size existing labor contracts or availability of capital so short run may jota short term market may factors of production are not flexible because it's constantly changing kar sakte land up immediately bach nisakte labor suddenly nilik a sakte capital bhi raise nisakte ho in short term it is less flexible whereas in long term market all factors of production are variable kyunki bhaort time hai to land bhaht sakta hai, cum ho sakta hai labor bhi ghaht sakta hai, bhaht sakta hai and capital also can be raised firms have the ability to adjust their production capacity invest in new technologies hire or lay off labors and acquire new resources or capital joh abhi may explain kiya. Okay supply ka dekht hai, supply ka ka ka kaise, either kya ho ta hai supply mein short term market mein the supply curve is inelastic means supply does not move much in short term market or it is relatively rigid because firms cannot quickly increase or decrease production in short term market. So this means first point humne padha tha, we will have to recap this. In short term market, the period where the supply and demand for goods, services or financial assets, they adjust quickly. Achha demand, demand quickly adjust ho ta hai, but supply quickly adjust nahi ho ta hai. Okay, so the first point was more towards the demand. Whether supply and demand for goods, services or financial assets adjust quickly, typically within a short range. Or either supply ka jo adjustment hai ho kya bol rahi hai, it is inelastic means it does not move much or it is relatively rigid fixed hai. Because firms cannot make quick increase or decrease in production. Any increase in demand may result in higher prices rather than immediate increase in quantity supply. For example, yahaan phe kya bolna chaathe ki agar suppose demand increase hoa, to supplier immediately us ko supply, means that jada saaman ya maal saaman bheech ke us ko, wo demand ko cover up nahi kar sakta hai short run may ya short term market may. To us ke badle kya ho ta hai automatically kya ho ta hai prices bhahta hai us ke ba jaisi. For example, one second I'll repeat, agar demand bha ra hai short term market may to supply nahi bhaega immediate o basis pe. Us ke badle kya ho ga because there is a shortage of supply and the demand is increasing therefore the price will increase. Okay but long term market may kya ho ta hai. The supply curve is more elastic in the long run. Flexible hai. As firms can adjust their production and capacity in the long term changes in demand, agar demand may kya changes aya hai, will lead to an increase in supply also. As the new firms enter the market or existing firms expand. To yahaan phe price bhaega nahi. As the new firms enter the market, the price is stable or price is stable or there is a fluctuation in the market. Okay price adjustments I think is important. We'll cover this also. In short term market prices are influenced by demand, demand side factor. Okay because we saw the first point was demand and the fourth point was supply flexibility. To demand say short term market may price influence ho ta hai. Seasonal fluctuations ho ga ya temporary shortage ho ga to price may fluctuation ho ga short term market may. Ya consumer preferences change ho ga ga to consumer preferences change ho ga to bhi short term market may price bhaer ga ya kam ho ga. Why does the price increase because the supply side cannot adjust quickly. So, what is important is important. So, what is important in long term market may be a market. Both supply and demand, they adjust each other, they cover up each other. If demand is growing, supply is growing in long term. So, price may not be much influence on price. So, price is more elastic. Firms can adjust their production techniques and introduce new products or services leading to price changes over a longer period. We are not covering these parts. Examples are important to understand short term market. The holiday season demand for products like toys or electronics where supplies cannot easily adjust to the sudden surge in demand. So, short term market will be long term market. For example, short term market may, when Covid came to the moment, all of a sudden shortage ho ga ta. Because lockdown ho ga ta. So, that was a short term market. Suddenly, there was a supply side constraint. Supply hini ho ra ta. Long term market may kya ho ta hai? Jise real estate market hai, capital market hai, where investments and production adjustments are made over several years. And long term trends such as population growth or technological advancement have more influence. So, yaha pe kya ho ta hai long term mein? Because you have lot of time, years, demand and supply will adjust to each other. They will come into equilibrium. That is the correct word. Equilibrium. So, this ends our, this part of the question answer about short term market versus long term market. This is the synopsis of the summary table of the short term versus long term market. Okay, I will close the video here. We will meet back in the next video. Thank you very much for listening. Take care. Bye-bye.
