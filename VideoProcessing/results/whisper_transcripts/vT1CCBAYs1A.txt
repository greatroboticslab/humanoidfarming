Education
 Here are some reasons why I study in Agri-programme. First, I really like Wicke Campus. It is very green, it has good studying spaces and it has vibrant social life. Secondly, I really like our academic culture. The teachers are very easy to approach, helpful and fair. Lastly, our programme prepares you very well for the working life. It gives you good contacts and skills for it.
