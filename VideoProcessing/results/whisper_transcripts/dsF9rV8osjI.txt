 These are blueberries and they're extremely easy to grow at home. And quite frankly, I had no idea that they were this prolific. I actually harvested all these just today. They ripen slowly over time, which makes them the perfect little garden snack. And some of them are truly massive. Really big. And even my dogs love them. They want to grow in containers because they like acidic soil. And most people don't have acidic soil. The beauty of containers is that you can use something like the soil acidifier to stop your berries from growing basic. Even when they're only in five-gallon containers, they produce pretty well. But for big production, you need at least 15 gallons. If you live somewhere warm like me, make sure you get a southern highbush type blueberry. They are more heat tolerant, allowing them to fruit even in warm climates. Blueberries are thirsty, so mulch deeply. And make sure that they always have plenty of water. If you want this many berries, you got to make sure you fertilize in the spring when the flowers first appear and in the fall when the leaves drop.
