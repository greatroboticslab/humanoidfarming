 Ranch from 67. Come to think of it, I've never really thought about what's in ranch. Perhaps out of fear. Start with a half cup of buttermilk and a half cup of sour cream. Time for lactose! You know, I once watched a friend of mine eat a whole bottle of ranch with his pizza. Yeah, he's in prison now. Next up, a half cup of mayonnaise. Mmm! A half teaspoon of garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper. Three, two, one! Two tablespoons of dried parsley! Forsaken by parsley? Never saw that coming. Nya! Just a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of dried dill weed. What did you call me? Oh, fr- Boop! Mix! To the fridge! You want a sneak peek of my cookbook? Nyaaah! That's it! Now that it's rested, we can serve. Suppose it was too tired before. Ha, that's good! No jell- that's great! One sec. I-I think you'd like this. Ranch, baby!
