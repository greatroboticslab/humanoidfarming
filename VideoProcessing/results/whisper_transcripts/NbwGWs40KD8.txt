 The other talking point that proponents of edible bugs use is that bugs require less physical space than traditional livestock. In fact, most insect farming operations practice what's known as vertical farming, which maximizes the space that they have available. However, like with everything else, the devil is in the details. Here's a graphic published by the UN itself showing that most of the land that's attributed to livestock farming is actually comprised of land that it takes to grow the feed for those animals. And as we mentioned earlier, insects, when farmed at an industrial level, well, they consume similar amounts of feed to chickens. And so switching to bugs will not necessarily save us too much space in terms of the land usage. It looks like it does because of the vertical farming. But again, when you look at the entirety of the farming operation, it might not. And if you thought that was interesting, well, hit that subscribe button and get more videos just like this.
