 Hi, my name is Ang Chi Shen and I'll be presenting governance and certifications in agriculture, challenges and opportunities for sustainable development. My target audience is small farmer and businesses at community level. Agriculture is the cornerstone of food security, biodiversity and community resilience. To achieve sustainable agriculture, robust governance and effective certification system are crucial. This presentation explores the importance of these practices in sustainable development, emphasizing their relevance for small farmers and community-based businesses. It aims to convince stakeholders of the benefits and offer strategies to overcome the challenges of implementing this system. So, what are the importance of governance and certification? Strong governance and certification safeguard the environment, unlock premium markets and improve farm practices. Certifications like Organic and Rainforest Alliance enforce practices that minimize environmental damage. For example, organic farming reduces pesticide residues in water by five times compared to conventional methods. Similarly, Rainforest Alliance certification promotes sustainable land use and biodiversity, improving water quality on Colombian, Colombian coffee farms. These systems also empower small farmers economically. Certifications can open doors to new markets with premium prices for products. For instance, organic products often sell for 20-30% more than conventional ones and the U.S. organic food market. organic food market reached $133 billion in 2021. Fair trade certification ensures fair prices and community investments. In 2018, fair trade sales generated $166 million for community development projects like schools and healthcare facilities. Furthermore, certifications can promote fairer working conditions for farm laborers contributing to social sustainability. Despite such importance, there are challenges for small-scale producers as well as businesses. So, small farmers often face hurdles in adopting governance and certification system because of high costs. Certification processes involve multiple expenses including application fees, inspection costs, and ongoing compliance fees. For small-scale farmers, this cost can be prohibited. For example, the cost of obtaining organic certification can range from $600 to $1,000 per year for small farms, which is a significant burden for farmers with limited financial resources. The table shows the cost of obtaining an organic certification and prices do not include HST. Next, the certification process is often complex and requires substantial documentation and adherence to strict standards. Small-scale farmers may struggle with their administrative workload and the need for extensive record-keeping. For instance, meeting the requirements for fair trade certification involves complying with social, economic, and environmental criteria, which can be daunting without adequate support and resources. However, these challenges shouldn't deter small farmers. And here's why. Governance and certifications provide various opportunities for small farmers and business at community level. First opportunity is market differentiation and access. Certifications help farmers and businesses stand out, allowing them to compete effectively. Research shows that consumers are willing to pay more for certified products. Justified previously that organic products can sell for 20% to 30% more than their conventional counterparts. Driven by consumer demand for health and environmental benefits. Thus, Ethiopian coffee farmers with organic and fair trade certification saw a significant income and market access increase. The significant financial gain, jumping by 84% in 2011. This significant financial gain underscores the potential for certification to enhance market access and profitability for small-scale producers. Next is improved practices and yields. Certification processes often include training programs that educate farmers on sustainable agricultural practices. These trainings can lead to improved farming techniques, higher yields, and reduce environmental impact. For example, the system of rice intensification is a methodology that improves the productivity of irrigated rice by changing the management of plants, soil, water, and nutrients. As seen from the graph, Indian farmers adopting the system of rice intensification methods increase rice yields by 30% to 50% while using 40% less water. The SRI technique illustrates how training and improved practices associated with certification can lead to substantial agricultural and environmental benefits. So, what are the strategies for success? Firstly, is cost-sharing and grant programs. Financial assistance can bridge the gap for small farmers. Governments or non-governmental organizations often offer programs to subsidize certification fees. The USDA's Environmental Quality Incentives Program is a prime example. This voluntary program provides cost-share payments to help U.S. farmers and ranchers adopt sustainable practices sustainable practices like cover cropping, no-till farming, and integrated pest management, which can qualify for certain certifications. Next, building cooperative networks. Joining forces with other small farmers through cooperative strengthens the bargaining power and facilitates knowledge exchange, easing certification processes. The Kuwapa Koku cooperative in Ghana, with thousands of Kokuwa farmers, obtain fair trade certification, securing fair prices and community investments. Additionally, participatory guarantee systems in India enable collective organic product certification, reducing cost and complexity. These systems foster trust and cooperation, empowering small farmers to navigate certification requirements while strengthening community ties. While governance and certification systems offer significant benefits, it is important to acknowledge potential drawbacks. The initial investment and ongoing costs can be a burden for small farmers. Additionally, the complexity and administrative requirements of certification can be overwhelming. However, these challenges can be mitigated through financial assistance programs, cooperative efforts, and continuous support and training for farmers. By addressing these drawbacks head-on, we can develop more inclusive and effective certification systems. In conclusion, strong governance and certifications are game changers for sustainable agriculture, particularly for small farmers. They safeguard the environment, unlock premium markets, improve farm practices, and potentially promote fairer working conditions. By embracing education programs, cooperative networks, and knowledge sharing platforms, small farmers can harness these benefits, ensuring a thriving future for themselves, their communities, and our planet.
