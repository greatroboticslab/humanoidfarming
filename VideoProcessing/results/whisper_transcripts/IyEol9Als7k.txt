 Music I graduated from Iowa State in 1970 and came back to farm at that time. So I farm now for over 40 years. I've probably dealt with Kunal since I started farming which would have been in the 70's. So now we're serviced by two stores and we are centrally located between both stores, which is great for us. They carry a full line of equipment, I mean a lot of short line stuff which applies to a livestock farmer's needs. My family has always been in the cattle business. It would go back to my great uncle who showed at the International Livestock Exposition for years and won the car lot division several times. So over time we've expanded our operation too. Automation has helped a lot. I see pictures of my grandfather feeding with a bushel basket on his shoulder and now we just push a few buttons and run an automatic feed wagon that has scales on it. So we're feeding a totally mixed ration, what we call a TMR. Today we farm with about 2500 acres with a large combine, 12 row head. Everything's pretty much automated so it's taken the physical work out of farming. But I'd say the hours are probably longer now. Kunal's, they've always been fair with us and we continue to have a good working relationship. Just have been real satisfied with the service we've gotten from them. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
