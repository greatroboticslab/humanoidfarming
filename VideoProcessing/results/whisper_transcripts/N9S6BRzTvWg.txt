As the Industrial Revolution grew and grew across the northeastern part of the United States during the antebellum period, which by the way, the antebellum period is the time period between the War of 1812 and the Civil War in America. But in the south, their economy became more and more dependent on agriculture and the forced labor of enslaved people. The geographic position of the United States southeast region meant that it rarely had temperatures below freezing, at least not for very long, and had long hot summers, which offered the ability to grow and harvest crops year-round. Unlike the north, where there were freezing temperatures along with shorter summers and growing crops year-round just simply was not possible. During this time period in the 1800s, a majority of Americans made their living through agriculture. However, the number slowly declined as industrialization took hold across the northeast. In 1800, it is estimated that 83% of Americans farmed, and by 1860, though, the number had dropped to 53% were involved in agriculture. There were two types of farming practice. Subsistence farming, in which a person simply grew enough food for their family to survive and maybe a little to trade, and then commercial farming, which grew cash crops to be sold and make profits. In the south, just about every profession was tied to agriculture in one way or another, from merchants who bought and traded crops, mill workers who processed crops, people that repaired tools and farm equipment, dock workers that loaded and unloaded crops. Just about everyone was tied to agriculture in some shape or form. Of course, some of the earliest crops to be grown started near Jamestown, Virginia with tobacco, but then branched out into the growing of rice, sugar, and indigo. But as time went on, cotton became the dominant crop, especially after the invention of the cotton gin in the late 1700s, which made growing cotton an almost guaranteed profit. American-grown cotton fueled the Industrial Revolution in both Europe and the northeastern part of the United States, as cotton was the primary raw material needed for the growing textile industry, which was expanding rapidly after the invention of the power loom. The term cotton is king became the motto, as by the time of the Civil War in 1861, cotton accounted for two-thirds of the value of all United States exports. Massive plantations or large farms, many over 1,000 acres with hundreds of enslaved people, grew throughout the south, clustered near the coast or along waterways so that they could easily get their crops to market. These plantations were virtual towns with their own stores and crafts people, and these plantation owners became extremely, extremely wealthy. One stretch of land between New Orleans, Louisiana to Baton Rouge along the Mississippi River had the highest concentration of millionaires in the entire United States. One could argue this area was basically the Beverly Hills of the 1800s. Now, even though there were many large plantations across the south, a large percentage of agriculture was done by small farmers who did not own any enslaved people. But these small farmers aspired to build large plantations and accumulate large amounts of wealth. Of course, the unfortunate fact of all this wealth was that it was being accumulated based on the labor of enslaved people being forced to work on these massive plantations. massive plantations. Throughout the Annabellum period, the number of enslaved people in America grew to approximately 4 million. That means by the time of the Civil War, approximately one in every seven Americans was owned by another American. Furthermore, as these massive plantation owners accumulated wealth, they also acquired political power and influence, which helped them to defend the institution of slavery and make sure it was maintained in order to maintain their profits. And just to give you an idea, the idea of how committed these slave owners were to the institution in 1860, the value of all Southern land was approximately $2.4 billion. But at the same time, in 1860, slaveholders and invested approximately $3 billion into the ownership of other human beings and forcing them to do labor. So Southerners were investing more money into slavery than they were into their land that they were farming. And they were not investing hardly anything into industry. And in the South. By the time of the Civil War, 90% of the United States manufacturing and industry was located in the North. The South's virtual one dimensional economy built upon agriculture and the labor of enslaved people would eventually lead to war and heavily influence the outcome of the Civil War. So with that, hopefully you learned something and thanks for watching. Thanks for watching.
