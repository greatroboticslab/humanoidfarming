 Hey folks, Machinery Pete here. Just want to touch on some really nice equipment, some tractors for sale this Thursday on Sullivan Auctioneers, the first day of their big two-day no reserve dealer farmer auction. These tractors are from our good friends at Wade Incorporated, a fantastic John Deere dealer down in the state of Mississippi. And these tractors are located at their Tunica store in the northwest part of the state. They've got a pair of 8320Rs, a one 18 model, only 510 hours on it. An 8370R, an 8335R, a 5125R with just over a thousand hours, and a Mahindra 4025, 2012 with only 200 hours. Hey folks, pleased to be joined by Matt Housel, the remarketing manager with Wade Incorporated, a great John Deere dealer from down in Mississippi. Matt, how are you doing today? I'm doing fine, Greg. How are you doing? I'm doing well. Now, Matt, I forget Wade Incorporated. How many locations do you guys have throughout Mississippi? Yeah, we're a 13-store John Deere dealer in northern Mississippi. Okay, 13 stores. And you guys have the coolest dealership signs in the whole world. Those four-post Wade signs. That goes way back, doesn't it? Yes, sir. It goes way back. Those signs are... Every location has those signs. Well, anytime I'm down south, I love seeing those Wade signs. Now, Matt, you've got some really nice tractors on Sullivan's two-day auction here, August 27th and 8th. I was just looking at the list. Let's start with that pair of 8320Rs. You got an 18 model and a 16. Yes, sir. The 2018 model, Greg, is a really, really nice tractor. It's an IVT tractor with ILS. It's got five remotes. We have a premium cab, active seat. Got an auto track activation and also comes with a receiver on it. Okay. How many hours were on that one again, Matt? Just over five? About 510, 509 hours. And that tractor is a one-owner tractor from one of our local customers at our Grenada location. Grenada. Very clean machine. Okay. Now, all the tractors on the on the auction, the Sullivan online auction are currently located. Are they located out of your Tunica location? Yes, sir. We decided, Greg, for people that might want to come look, to put them all in one location. And we try to get them as close to Memphis as we could, because we figured that they would have to fly into Memphis to come down and look. And, you know, Tunica is probably our closest large ag location. We got Hernando as well too, there too. But, you know, Tunica being right there, we decided to put them all right there in Tunica for everybody to come look. And Tunica, and you tell me if I'm wrong, Matt, I'm a Minnesota boy. So, I love my visits to Mississippi. I'm learning my geography. But Tunica, extreme northwest Mississippi? That's correct. That's correct. You guys aren't really that, not that far from like southern Illinois even, are you? It's not that far from southern Illinois. We're probably, what, five or six hours from southern Illinois. Okay. That's like driving across the state of Minnesota north to south. No big deal. Okay, back to the tractors now. Matt, how about that 16 model 8320R on the sale? That 16 model 8320R, Greg, it is a one-owner machine. It's a power shift transmission, 1500 front end. Got a front deal. No, it does not have front deals, excuse me. It's about 3788 hours and it's got four remotes on it. That is a one-owner machine that a guy upgraded his fleet this past year. Okay. So, it is a nice machine as well. All right. Is that a 8320R as customers you've been working with for a while, Matt? Yes, sir. They're both are, both come from good customers and good farms. Okay. I sure do. How about the, you have a 2011 8335R. How many hours on that one, Matt? No, that tractor has, you know, showing 3670 hours. Okay. That is a pre-def tractor, which that is, you know, what a lot of people want. Right. As well as an IVT-less tractor. Got active command steering, front and rear deals, five remotes, leather, HID lighting package. That is a really nice tractor. Like you say, uh, pre-def. Yeah. That, uh, that gets people excited, doesn't it? For sure. Yes, sir. It really does. Now, if we hop down a lower horsepower, boy, you've got a couple, uh, lower hour, nice rigs here. You've got a 17 model, 5125R. Uh, how many hours on that one, Matt? About a little over a thousand, thousand, 10 hours. Okay. Greg, that is a really nice tractor. Really, really high spec. Tractor comes with an air seat. Got triple rear and triple mid remotes and is loader ready. Wow. So that's kind of a nice feature for a person, you know, want to add a loader or needing a loader for their operation. They can actually add a grapple to that tractor very easily. Um, it's a 16-speed command auto transmission in it. That is a really clean, nice tractor. Also has three-speed PTO, you know, for a guy that needs to run a grain auger to, um, you know, put the grain to the top of the bin. Be a nice tractor to sit there and do that for them. It comes at 540, 540E and a thousand. Okay. Yeah. That will make somebody a heck of a nice tractor. Um, and again, like, like everything on the sale sells absolute on the auction. So a great opportunity there folks. And I did notice one other tractor, Matt, you guys have a Mahindra, gosh, hardly any hours on it. Like a 2012 model. Was it a 4025? 4025. Yes, that's correct. It's got about 200 hours. It's a clean little tractor. It's a, uh, four-wheel drive tractor. It's got a canopy. It does not have a loader on it, but I mean, it could possibly have a loader added to it. It is a nice little clean tractor. Okay. Well, you've got some great rigs there, Matt. Going to be some happy buyers there on the sale, uh, 27th and 8th. Um, now folks want more information leading up to sale day or any of your other equipment. You guys have tons of high quality, good used equipment there, Matt. Your website is at wadeinc.com or wadeincorporated.com? That's correct. Well, Greg, that is wadeinc.com or wadeincorporated.com. Okay. And how about if folks prefer to reach out on the phone on any of these tractors or anything you guys have? What's a good number to contact you guys, Matt? Uh, you can give me a call at 662-312-3239. That is my cell phone number and you will talk directly to me. Um, I plan on, you know, next week being very, very close to the tractors at Tunica. So if you definitely call me, I should be able to walk right after to it and tell you anything about it. Take pictures, send them right to you, do a FaceTime call, whatever I need to do to help you out. Okay. Well, that sounds good, Matt. And folks, if you aren't, if you're up here in the upper Midwest, you're not familiar with Wade Incorporated, I tell you what, these are great folks. I hung out with them a few days, did some filming for US Farm Report. Uh, just had a fantastic time. So, Matt, thanks for how you guys roll.
