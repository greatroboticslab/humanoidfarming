Howto & Style
 There sure is a lot of bad things going on in the world today, such as wars, sickness, inflation, supply shortages, natural disasters, and more. In other words, nothing much has changed since I was a boy, or even in the last 2,000 years, ever since Jesus played fullback for Jerusalem. Nevertheless, I do understand why people want to become more self-sufficient, particularly as a buffer for bad times. G'day, I'm Mike from Self-Sufficient Me, and in this video, I'm going to give you five top tips for beginner food gardeners to grow their own veggies at home. Let's get into it. Tip number one, understand what good soil is. Good, successful food gardening is like standing. To do it well, you need a good base. And in food gardening, the base is the soil, or the medium, if you're talking potting mixes for containers, etc. If you're going to grow veggies straight into your backyard soil, first dig down and find out what type of soil it is. Is your soil heavy and sticky when wet, like clay? If so, you will need to improve it first by adding lots of organic matter, like compost, and perhaps adding something that will help unbind sticky clay soil, like gypsum. If you plant directly into clay soil, the veggies will slowly die of suffocation because plants, especially veggies, need oxygen around the roots to survive. Yes, even under the ground. It's the opposite if you have sandy soil. Instead of being too heavy, it's too light. And this makes moisture holding difficult, which means you need to water more. And if you don't, the plants suffer heat stress. To improve sandy soils, you again add lots of organic matter, like compost. And you can also add good garden soil acquired from somewhere else or purchased from a landscape supplies business. Keep in mind, some sandy soils can be saline, high in salt, salty. Like me, when I found out mortgage lifter, really is a variety of tomato. Why didn't I think of that? So if that's the case, what I would do is build up. Instead of trying to improve or plant in sandy soil, build up and make your own soil from scratch or ship it in. The best soil is what I call Goldilocks soil. Not too heavy and not too light. Just right. And there's a simple test that you can use and I call it the fist test. Get some wet soil in your hand and make a firm fist. If the soil is sticky and won't easily fall apart, it's too heavy. If the soil easily disintegrates when you open your hand and touch it, it's too light. And if the soil holds together and just breaks apart when you touch it like that, well then it's Goldilocks. Now there are exceptions of course, and this test isn't completely perfect. And as you can see over there, the soil wasn't too bad. I gave it a uppity downy. I can improve that. It's really just disintegrated because it had a hard growing season. But at the end of the day, you can also tell a little bit when it's dry. Clay will be really hard like rock to dig into. This soil will still be pretty good. And you'll be able to see the structure. Often be a bit darker as well if you've got a really good garden bed soil. And like that one over there, when it's dry, you'll see how it just flows like sand through the fingers. Honestly, you don't need perfect soil to grow good crops. And don't worry about pH levels at this stage either. Because it's unlikely that your backyard soil will be out of the pH growing range for most veggies. And only if you can't get a thing to grow, then perhaps do a soil test. Or do one if you really want to. The soil tests are inexpensive. You can get them from the local nursery. They're easy to do. But I wouldn't be spending good money to test soil at a lab. That's probably overdoing it in most circumstances. Tip number two, grow what you like to eat. Tell you what, I'm getting sick of pumpkins. Beginner food gardeners often get confused with grow what you like to eat. And what grows best in your area. Or what are the easiest veggies to grow. People naturally want success. So beginner food gardeners search for what are the easiest veggies to grow. Or what is their area renowned for growing commercially. The problem with that is sugar cane might not be the best choice for your food garden. Okay, that's an extreme example. But say your area grows a lot of corn. Well, you might be able to buy corn rather cheap from the markets. Or you might not like eating corn. So growing it just because it's easy isn't necessarily the best use of your garden. If all those ducks line up and you find a vegetable that grows naturally well in your area, like potatoes in Idaho, and you love eating it, then of course exploit that. Now I'm also not saying if you like eating garlic and you live in a hot climate that makes growing garlic challenging, that you grow garlic. I'm saying that as a beginner food gardener, that would be an advanced crop to grow in that climate. So I would start with something else that you like to eat that is easier to grow. The good news is there are plenty of normal everyday vegetables that you'll see at the supermarket that can be grown just about everywhere and most of them are easy to grow. Tip number three, grow at the right time. Whilst most places around the world can grow veggies, you just can't grow them whenever you want. Obviously in a cold climate you can't grow much through a snowy winter, but timing gets more subtle than that. Even in spring, some crops in a cold climate can't be grown right away because the temperature is still too cool for them. For example, tomatoes, which are a sun loving crop. Whereas other crops like cabbages or kale or garlic are fine to plant early whilst it's still cool. In warmer climates, you can grow veggies all year round. But there are still windows when certain veggies grow best. And if you grow them outside of these windows, they don't grow well. They get targeted by pests and often suffer disease because the plants are under stress. For example, zucchini here in our subtropical climate tend to grow best during what I call the Goldilocks growing time. What? Not too hot and not too cold. Which is typically into autumn and then again into spring. So there are actually two growing periods in the year here for this particular crop. Understanding when the best time is for each crop will help you get great harvest. And the way you do this initially is by using local grow charts that advise what veggies to sow, plant and grow at what time of year. Search online or buy a book with your growing zones and start with this information. As you get more experience, you can then start to refine your growing times according to your own microclimate. Because every property in every zone and every veggie garden has a different orientation to the sun. It has a slightly different geography. You might be maybe in a valley or something on the end of a street. It'll be a bit different to your next door neighbours even. There could be physical barriers like hedges for example. And there are other things that affect your microclimate and thus might change slightly when you plant or sow your veggies. Tip number four, don't over fertilise. Too much of a good thing is bad. Even exercise. Well at least that's what I tell myself. Some beginner gardeners think that more fertiliser will grow bigger and better veggies. But too much fertiliser can in a worst case kill the plants. You might hear a lot of noise coming through the mic at the moment. Every neighbour and his dog is out mowing their lawn. You can't blame them. There's a bit of a break in the weather and there was some sun out. So of course they're going to be trying to get some yard maintained. Anyway, often over fertilising will lead to growth and development problems. And at the end of the day you're just wasting valuable resources by using more fertiliser than is needed. There are three times I fertilise. Firstly, when I refurbish a bed in preparation for a new crop and I know it has had some heavy growing in it previously. Secondly, if I see signs that the plants are lacking nutrients such as pale foliage colour than usual and lacklustre growth. And thirdly, when I know the crop has been in ground for a lengthy period growing well and I want to give it a boost during an important development time like fruiting such as tomatoes or capsicum or extra leafy growth like lettuce and brassicas etc. Even then if I see that the plants are growing gangbusters I'll hold off on the extra boost which means sometimes I'll only fertilise right at the beginning of the growing season. An easier way not to over fertilise is to use organic fertilisers instead of synthetically manufactured products because natural organic fertilisers break down slower and are absorbed slower by the plants and in a more natural way in my view. Always use the products as directed as well especially when you first start until you get a feel of it and then you might be able to add a little bit extra or a bit less here and there. Tip number five speaking of organics is grow organically. Many years ago and I'm saying many years ago when we grew our first veggies or I grew them I grew them in heavy soil at the wrong time of year using too much fertiliser and a crop that we didn't particularly want to eat. It was easy to grow though and then I ended up having to use pesticide to keep all the pests down because they just got smashed. I soon found out that using pesticides on an already sick plant only delays its demise. Not only that but it also destroyed good bugs in the garden upsetting the natural ecosystem and was potentially introducing dangerous chemicals into our diet. Now this is a good spot because you can see how eaten these eggplant leaves are but there are also lots of healthy eggplant leaves. I don't panic when I see crop damage like this because I've got plenty of fruit growing on these plants and I don't really need to do anything about it. Natural predators come in and clean up the grubs that were doing this damage and it's working its own thing. These days I rarely ever spray anything except for water in our garden and if I do it's an organic often homemade remedy to rid a specific problem like a freak aphid explosion maybe that won't fix itself. The bugs, the birds, other animals that live in the garden and under the ground tend to evolve and adapt to your organic veggie patch until literally one day you see them all working together to keep your garden balanced. There are organic sprays that are sold commercially and if you feel the need to use them do so sparingly and targeted preferably in the late afternoon and when pollinating insects like bees aren't around. I still think the best protection for crops are barriers like netting rather than poison. I have one or two or several failures every year and there's always something I can learn from them and no one becomes an accomplished backyard food gardener overnight but having said that it's not rocket surgery either and you will become I'm confident a really excellent food gardener and grow a ton in no time at all. Well I hope you enjoyed this video if you did make sure you give it a beginner's thumbs up and to do that you just crush those fingers like I was showing earlier with the soil like that and then raise that thumb up there like that whack whack it on that video there and let's see if we can get this video up to say what 10,000 thumbs up that'd be really amazing. Also subscribe if you haven't already and share this video around because that's what really helps my channel out. Thanks a lot for watching bye for now cheers. Cheers.
