 The pandemic has been tough on rural Virginia, so I worked across the aisle to get emergency relief to farmers. But for years, politicians have ignored rural communities. That's why I pushed to be on the Agriculture Committee, worked with Republicans and Democrats to pass the President's trade deal, and led legislation to expand reliable internet to farms in small towns. I'm Abigail Spanberger. I approve this message because we shouldn't leave any part of Central Virginia behind. Thank you.
