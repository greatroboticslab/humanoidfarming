 ah here we are again another spring cleaning time yeah we have to get ready for 2023 garden planting vegetable whatever you call it but first things first we have to prepare our polytunnel so guys let's start cleaning yeah guys it's spring of 2023 and i'm back to my garden clothes and yeah ito na naman tayo maglilinis na naman tayo ng polytunnel para to get para maka ready tayo sa planting natin ng vegetables ah di ko alam kung anong ano pero ah i think i'm planning to experiment on one of the vegetables or plants anyway ah galing sa pilipinas and um hopefully it will go tina natin pero we'll still plant our ampalaya our tomatoes and stuff like that okay so you can see how bad ah the polytunnel is again again so here i'll show you there that used to be tomatoes and if you can see there's a few holes ah a few rats were in here they made a home yeah i was able to get rid of one um but i think there's a new one again coming in i don't know um hopefully if i clean this place ah he'll go away so so kita yung strawberries namin um deadox patay sila lahat that i magkawa ganun talaga um yeah maybe this year i might um do a little bit of um changing or fixing um try to experiment on something again this winter ah we'll see so when that time comes i'll make another video on that and we'll see what happens so we'll see if it works now it's not that cold here in uh where we live in ireland pero malamig pa rin so in the past few nights i think we were doing like zero degrees at night to to actually it snowed a few nights ago i think no the other night snowed the other night actually pero hindi siya ganun tumatagal dito sa amin eh so anyway ah here ayan look yan yung ampalaya i really should get myself ah into the habit of cleaning my polytunnel before winter comes or during the winter para dapat ngayon okay na see so ayan so we need to clean that um it's not that bad actually it's it's even better than last year tanglad ko namamatay din i don't know why ayan oh ayan see um i put it out here it was in the house actually pero uh unfortunately i don't know uh inside even inside the house namamatay siya for some reason so i hope it's still alive from the roots and it will spring back to life but for now uh let's concentrate on cleaning the place okay i actually have to be careful because pakamay daga or biglang tumalun dito yeah so hopefully work naman anyway um yeah cleaning time first things first start in one place then go down okay here we go there's a big hole here for a rat so i don't want to take my chances my jump up so just make sure hopefully not so okay we have one raised bed done well slightly cleared anyway unfortunately uh there was no rat or walang daga na tumalun sa akin i don't know if uh nandito pa yung daga pero kasi there was a new hole there a few nights ago so i'm thinking it might still be here the rat or mouse or whatever is still here but um fortunately nothing has jumped on me yet and i hope it doesn't happen today or whenever because it happened to me last year yeah because they love this place during the winter because it's warm and dry especially when it's raining so we have the raised bed um so it's drier than the floor they sneak in from the side the problem is they can't sneak out once they get big so uh i tried to take away all the food here and they die so i just bring them out uh bury them outside so anyway one raised bed done we'll go to the next one okay actually you know what i think i'll clear the middle one first take this old tomato plant out so we'll have more light and more space inside right so here we go ah yeah i cleared out our middle isle there the potted tomatoes before so you can see there's a bit more light in here so that's gone and i think four pots at the back are gone as well so we'll continue on with this side over here okay so some of that going and i hope no rat will pop up so yeah we'll clear that out and then hope that no rat will come out and bite us or even just give us a fright no frightening okay so here we go again here we go goo goo goo okay just checking nope that's fine that's okay it looks okay and there's a bit of hollow space here looks like it was once uh home for the rats or a rat or a few rats i don't know they're gone anyway so right well i hope they're gone we'll find out so yeah let's start clearing this place okay we'll start clearing out some of the uh dead ampalaya so so now you can see the one on the left side has been uh cleared uh except for a few strands let's say but uh that's okay we have more light coming in which is very good i'll be uh sorting out the or fixing the beds probably tomorrow i need to buy a few stuff to prepare them and maybe even tomorrow we could start planting a few seeds so we'll start with the one on the right okay bye let's go so that's it for springtime cleaning 2023 and yeah well uh most of it anyway uh still have to do a few more stuff tomorrow uh clear out a few more stuff um now uh i did not actually touch the other raised bed because i see a few more tomatoes tomato plants baby plants um growing there so you know what i said i just might put them in the pots and start planting them tomorrow and you know get a good uh have a good head start in my tomatoes uh because like they're really good and i don't want to waste the sweetness of that variety or whatever i have actually right uh yeah we did a bit of cleaning yesterday and uh i think we're gonna fix the beds today uh just to see if we could start planting again for the for this season of 2023 yeah i need to do a few stuff um yung nilalagyan ko ng ampalay ah i need to fix that um it didn't go well last year we got still a few fruits last year but it wasn't that good uh konti lang just a little bit but you know what um we'll see if i could make it better so i'm going to take out some of the soil from that area put compost on it and a bit of fertilizer and hopefully it will be better again this year so you'll see we only live and learn if we don't try we won't know but hopefully it will still yield kahit konti a bit even a few will be okay i'll take it so you can see yeah so see the raised beds there it's cleared out yeah i have to fix that get a few of the tomato seedlings tomato seedlings i think they're the cherry tomatoes put them in a pot probably two or three start them now so you look at that and look at the top there it's been cleaned of the debris the ampalaya debris from last year there'll be a new one this year my strawberries on the hanging baskets have died so we'll work that out in the next few days here's the other bed i have to trim that plant out see in the summer it becomes a nuisance i actually have to take i want to take it out pero ayaw ni mi si si lang we'll started loosening that put a bit of good fertilizer there so i can just get started i have to get those weeds out before we put the pots on this side my pineapple is dying didn't put them inside they never yielded me any fruits anyway so i'll just throw them out and use the pots again for some other stuff so yan yan ang gagawin natin ngayon ah yeah that's what we'll do i got lazy yesterday i just lay down on the couch i didn't do much so today we'll do a bit more again so what i'm doing actually is i'm replanting the tomatoes that we have here on the bed so yeah there's a few tomato plants that grew from seed from the ones that fell down on there so we'll take a few of them so we'll take them out and then we replant them in a few pots just like we did last year and again hopefully it will need a lot of tomatoes just like the previous years so yeah we are going to add again egg and well I just have a couple of eggs there that were not good from what my hands laid there was a bit of a hole so I'm going to use that and banana peels as well or bananas just to start them off so there we have it that's one two three and four so we'll just continue to do our stuff in this garden fix the garden plots again replenish the soil put compost on it and then we'll start planting a few stuff so guys I only probably about one and a half raised beds I'm out of breath but I'm happy with it for today I was able to plant start well start my seeds for that bitter melon or ampalaya and I placed a bit of string beans or seed well let's see hopefully in the next few weeks it starts growing and yeah it's raining here it's a good thing I'm in the poly tunnel so I'm not getting wet but now I'm wrecked with only about approximately one and a half raised beds oh jeez I'm really out of shape so anyway so guys that's it for now and I'll update what's happening in the poly tunnel in the next few days alright thanks for watching and also guys just to remind you whatever we get in YouTube
