 growing indeterminate tomatoes. Let's talk pruning indeterminate tomatoes are the tomatoes that are going to keep growing all season long as long as they're well taken care of. Obviously fertilizer is important sunshine, adequate water, and air flow. That's where pruning comes in. On our farm we like to prune all the lower leaves leaving just one single leader. On a tomato plant the leader is the vine that's putting off the fruit. New leaders grow by putting out something called a sucker. You can find suckers in between a branch and the stem. When I'm pruning tomatoes I start at the lowest leaves and clip them off. If a lower branch has a sucker I make sure to clip the sucker too. Now that all of my lower leaves are trimmed I can come back in and I can get the suckers. You can even wait till your suckers are a little bigger. Clip them, put them in water, and you actually have a whole nother tomato plant. Now we've taken our plants from Bushy. It's a nice and pruned with a lot of airflow to prevent fungus and disease.
