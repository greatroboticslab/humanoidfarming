 Here's how the refrigeration cycle works. First, I want you to take note of the four components. The first component we start at is the compressor. The compressor can only pump vapor, so we start with high temperature vapor coming out of the compressor. It goes down the discharge line to the condenser. The condenser is pulling air over these coils, which cools off the refrigerant. So as this is happening, the refrigerant starts to condense into a liquid. And as it gets to the bottom, it is a complete liquid. It then gets sent through the liquid line to the metering device. The metering device's job is to also create a pressure difference. Low pressure on this side, high pressure on this side. So as the liquid gets to the metering device, it actually creates a little gap so that it can start letting out refrigerant.
