Science & Technology
 For 10,000 years, humanity has been growing food by converting natural habitat into farmland and pasture for livestock. But with human population projected to grow to 9 billion or more, and species declines reaching alarming levels, can we stop this trend and grow more food on less land? Analysts call this peak farmland. At one point, the Green Revolution seemed to have the answer. A combination of modern seeds, fertilizers, irrigation, and mechanization of farming, the Green Revolution ratcheted up yields dramatically in the 20th century. But the Green Revolution has run its course in many parts of the world. Yield increases are diminishing, while demand for food will grow for decades. Is there still a pathway to peak farmland? Enter precision agriculture. Precision agriculture describes a set of techniques and technologies that optimize inputs to maximize yields, using sensors, drones, advanced GPS-guided tractors, and customized application of nutrients to optimize essential inputs like fertilizer and water. The gains from precision agriculture ultimately depend on the application of many technologies, some available today and others not. But implemented correctly, precision agriculture can offer a triple whammy benefit. Reduced input costs, maximized yields, and the near elimination of on-farm chemical pollution. The future of food is an array of possibilities. Agricultural innovation can help us use as little of nature as possible for human well-being.
