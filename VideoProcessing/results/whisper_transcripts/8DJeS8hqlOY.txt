 As the bale grows, belt tightener movement is restrained by a combination of spring and hydraulic cylinder pressure to pack crop material into a dense bale. Friction between crop material and bale chamber walls also increases bale density. When reading the density pressure gauge on the baler, it is important to know what each color means. White is too low, green is the recommended setting, yellow may be too high, and red is too high. The density pressure gauge should have zero pressure after tailgate is cycled and closed. The gauge will show the actual pressure as the bale is forming or when the tailgate opens. To adjust the density on the N-series balers, open the left-hand side shield door for access. Loosen the jam nut, then rotate the density pressure control knob clockwise to increase density, counterclockwise to decrease density. Observe density pressure gauge reading while opening tailgate or forming a bale to verify correct pressure setting. Once the desired density is reached, tighten the jam nut to secure control knob to maintain pressure.
