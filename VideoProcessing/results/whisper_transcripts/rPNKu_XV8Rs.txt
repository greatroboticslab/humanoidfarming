 Plants thrive in healthy soil. But what really makes soil healthy? One key factor is cation exchange capacity, or CEC. And here's where an unsung hero enters the picture, photosynthetic bacteria. Photosynthetic bacteria use sunlight to produce energy, but more importantly, they release organic acids and compounds into the soil. These natural acids break down minerals, helping release essential nutrients like calcium, magnesium, and potassium into available forms, called cations. Soil particles, especially clay and humus, have negative charges. They attract and hold on to these positive cations, like magnets. The more cations a soil can hold, the higher its cation exchange capacity, and the more nutrients your crops can access when they need them. Photosynthetic bacteria boost CEC by increasing organic matter, improving soil structure, and enhancing nutrient retention. They also help retain moisture and reduce nutrient leaching, saving farmers money and improving yield. By teaming up with soil microbes, photosynthetic bacteria create a balanced underground ecosystem, one that feeds both roots and crops. Support your soil with photosynthetic bacteria, and unlock the full power of cation exchange capacity. Healthy soil begins with biology, powered by nature, supported by science.
