Education
 So primarily we will be discussing how agriculture policy has evolved in India right from independence onwards. Second thing that we will be doing is going into the question answers that are important on various subjects within the agriculture sector. So let's go to the agriculture policy evolution. This is a document from our class note. So if any of you don't have it, please ask and I'll share it with you. Here it is. So this basically deals with what is the time period of a particular policy. What are the different decades of what are the things that are focused on. What were the eminent policy issues at that time and what policy response came to that time. So when the country is divided in the 1940s to 50s, there are some basic issues at that time like unorganized agricultural markets, lack of standardized weights and measures. In fact, the agriculture markets were not such a demand like the PMC demand. All of this is coming after that. And because of standardized weights and measures, the first thing they would be just creating a heap of whatever harvest they have. And then that heap is something that we would be checking whether it is working fine or not. It's the green quality. Just look at it and see it and see it. It's like a price. It's like weights and measures. It's not like weights and measures. Then manipulation of accounts by the traders. So farmers didn't get much to learn. So account manipulation of farmers, they don't get the farmers who need to get the cattle. Then lack of storage infrastructure. So like today, FCI and all these other goods, we have a storage infrastructure. This did not exist back in the day. Then the only option was that the day you reach the land, the cattle are getting the cattle. Otherwise, you take the cattle and then take the cattle. That would create trouble. So farmers had to do distressed sales. Then there was food supply shortages being handled through price control and ration. So farmers had to do the same thing as farmers, which was the last famine in 1944-42. And that was also a man-made famine because Britishers introduced a lot of commercial agriculture in the form of commercial crops and that also with plantation agriculture, like indigo, tea, coffee. Now they replaced the food grains and they started to cultivate all this. And that was leading to famines. So now when the country is free, the biggest problem was food security. Although we have made a public law, one-two-three agreement, 480 agreement, in that we have a lot of relief from the wheat supplies we were insuring from the USA. We were not having our own wheat to feed the population of India. So it has a rationing, price control, like the public distribution system. We have tried to work out. It was at a very initial stage that we worked with committees. Now we have institutionalization. So how did the policy response come from? The problem was unorganized agricultural markets. That was established for APMC. That is agricultural product marketing committee acts or QP agriculture state subject. So her state government. And this started somewhere in 1950. Then thereafter, It was in all states. Then came the multi-purpose cooperative societies and National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation. This basically helped me in terms of manipulation of accounts and providing various kinds of facilities like storage infrastructure and all. So farmers are also helping farmers to credit. So as you can see the Nafit today, it is the work of horticultural crops to procure. Then as far as lack of standardized weights and measures were concerned, So Bureau of Indian standards weights and measures, formerly known as the Indian standard institution. This was set up in 1946. And ISI was registered under the Societies Act 1860. So now we have ISI mark a quality certification. As far as the storage infrastructure is concerned, we created the Central Warehousing Corporation in 1957 to provide logistical support to the agriculture sector. Moreover, to deal with the food supply shortages, we in the first five-year plan, it focused immensely on agriculture because it was necessary to focus on agriculture. Further, PL 480 agreement. India and US had made food imports from 1956 to 70. 1971 war, when India and East Pakistan were made, and Bangladesh war were made. So after that, we stopped the wheat imports. In 1965, the Green Revolution came, it created sufficient food security also. Then India's price policy was first introduced in 1947. This is the case of price controls. With the formation of Food-Grain Price Policy Committee. So the Commission on Agriculture Cost and Prizes or Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, these are all the institutions. The first country was the first country. The food crisis was the first to solve the problem. It was recommended a policy of progressive decontrol, reduction of imports and food grains and substantial increase in production of food grains. So slowly, they said that they will control the first to the first to solve the problem. Because the producer is also vulnerable and the consumer is also vulnerable. Essentially, today the MSP system is also used for logical reasoning. That India, I will tell you, both producer and consumer. In food sector are vulnerable. That's why it is important for government to intervene from time to time. To address that vulnerability. Okay. Now, what is our work out in the 1960s and 70s? In the 1960s and 70s, the concern was food sovereignty and diplomatic sovereignty for government. These two topics have been joined. What is the reason for joining? In 1971 war of the time, I will stop the US threatened food supplies, which is being used to be. And we will do the PL-480 agreement with you. That will stop. Throughout even 1965 and before that, there are threats coming. In 1971, it was an ultimate threat. We have responded to the US. We have responded to the US. But before that, in 1962-65, any time we would have war with Pakistan, this would be a major challenge played by USA. I will cut food supplies from India. That was a threat that we had kept on. If you remember, Pakistan is the country which joined NATO through CENTO. So that way, it was always supporting Pakistan's military adventures, any time. So in India, these two issues got connected. Food sovereignty and diplomatic sovereignty. So this was one concern. Second concern was food security for the people because they were vulnerable. Then food pricing. So at what price should the food be accessible in terms of selling as well as buying? Farmer and consumer are both food pricing. Then planning, promoting and financing programs for production, processing, marketing, storage, export, import of agriculture products, foodstuffs, certain other notified commodities through cooperatives and a social forestry movement. So the basic concerns are the most important thing in the 60s and 70s. The policy solution was the first green revolution that started in 1965. So high yielding variety of wheat, rice and coarse cereal. These were the three things. Within coarse cereal, there is Ajwar, Badra and Ravi. These three things were focused on. Now, the Commission on Agriculture Cost Rises was also established in 1965. And the MSP mechanism of India was started in 1965. Because the green revolution would produce more. Now, to handle that higher produce and to motivate people to adopt certain kinds of produce, So you can use wheat or rice to plant a lot of wheat or rice. So MSP system was designed. Then National Cooperative Development Corporation, NCDC. So all these were promoted by promoting, financing, programming, and all these were all. And the National Commission on Agriculture was also established. So these two bodies were all the work out of the planning. In 1976, MS Swaminathan, the National Commission on Agriculture set up. The National Commission on Agriculture set up. The National Commission on Agriculture and the National Commission on Agriculture. Next, 1970s and 80s. So first issue was agricultural finance. And second issue was agricultural exports in the structural form in terms of institutions. What is the issue of agriculture finance? Why did it need to be developed in 1965? In 1965, we started green revolution. efendimunu Party chain. Chinese stand up. derniers theрен New England And theroy revenge. What do we want to do like to do the Syrian government? We started the original rural banks to give capital. We started the money lender trap. And we started the money lender trap. We worked out with Nabad. So it will take a lead role in developing the agricultural finance. As far as the agricultural export institutions are concerned, we created APEDA, Agricultural and Processed Food Product Export Development Authority 1985. So this APEDA controls all the things today. Why are we thinking about this export? Because we had sufficient food in the 80s and we had marketable surplus for the international market also. So that's where we want to be a part of. 1990s to 2000s. So here the functional part of agricultural export was to be explored. The concern is APEDA. But at the ground level, you need to be able to export the small institutions in which we will actually export agricultural exports. This will be investment for that purpose. Maybe private sector does the investment. And APEDA will take policy support. That's why the concept of agricultural export zones was initiated by the government of India in the year 2001, chapter 16 of then Exim policy. That's why we didn't say foreign trade policy, but Exim policy, export and import policy. So this is the issue that we have started here. The issue that was here was liberalization. Now we have to learn about industrial policy in 1991. It was new and it was done by liberalization. But in agriculture, there was no liberalization in agriculture. What is the issue of agriculture? Now the government is regulated in all respects. Whether it is the pricing and everything. You know, procurement. So all this went on till 2000. Now we started thinking about agricultural liberalization. The three farm laws. So that acceptance has not been created. Now there are level two reforms. These are 21st century reforms that are happening from 2000 to 2002. At a general level, we have something called as the national policy for farmers 2007. And therefore, we have to read the broad objectives paper. Because this is also functional. If you have to read the means, you have to answer the answer in the means. So, in that answer, agriculture policy is necessary to write the policy. A number, half number, you have to write the number. If you have to write the number there. Then comes land. So the national land record modernization program was started in 2008. Basically, digitization of land records work out. Today, this is a new version. So you will have to have a card called Adhaar. What is the name of Adhaar? What is the name of Adhaar? Basically, Modi ji launched this particular thing. Bhoomi Adhaar. So, it's the concern that the land records are the titles of the land records. They should be legal titles and conclusive titles. Now, we think that we have something called presumptive titles, not conclusive titles. We have to finish them. So, this is why the land records started here. So, this is the name of Adhaar. So, Bhoomi Adhaar. If you know this technical name, that is ULIPIN. So, unique land parcel identification number. Unique land parcel identification number. Okay. So, this is the work out. Let me show you the Press Information Bureau work out on this. Just give me one moment. That will refresh your memory. This is going to be important this year. Those are the days. The citizen-centric Bhoa Adhaar will revolutionize governance of Sakshat Bharat. National Conference on Bhoomi Samwaj 4 on implementation of unique land parcel identification number. Or Bhoa Adhaar organized with the theme of digitizing and geo-referencing India with Bhoa Adhaar. That's what was started. So, what they want to do in this project is, this is the basic implementation of land records digitization only. The one thing that it will make different is, that it will make legal titles, conclusive titles, presumptive titles. The GDP loss of the country's economy is about 1.3% due to the projects being stalled over litigation involving land disputes. The study says 66% of all civil suits in India are related to land and property disputes and the average pendency is 20 years. So, this is the problem. And what is the reason for this? What is the reason for this? Clear titles. Next. Now, Department of Land Resources, Sri Ajay Trike, he says, the computerization of land registration is 94% complete, which was in 2008, the program started. And 9 crore land parcels now have Bhoa Adhaar. Transliteration of land records will be available in 22 languages in near future, facilitating citizens of the country. The Bhoa Adhaar will be a move towards government's agenda of citizen-centric governance and reaching $5 trillion economy. Land is a basic deal to go through that. Now, what else? 26 states have implemented it in the future. And that by March 2024, that means by next year, department targets achievement of 100% land records under Bhoa Adhaar. So, this UL PIN number, we get all land parcels. We have aerial survey, geo-referencing, geographical information system. We have all the technology used to create Bhoa Adhaar. So, add this to your work out. I'll share this link with you in the WhatsApp group, so that it is easier for you to monitor and add to your notes. Okay? Share it. Now, moving back to our work out. What is the latest? What is the latest? Please update with you. It will be fine. So, you don't have to find out. Model land leasing law, 2016. Now, this is also a associated work out with land reform. So, it is now going. You should consider something like a phase 2 of land reforms. Yes. This is successful. Phase 1 is unsuccessful. Because it is 6% of land on the land. So, what do you want to do in the model land leasing law? We work on the oral lease. Because there is no system of return lease. We avoid many states. Because there are more property related disputes. Only in some conditions, land leasing was allowed in some states. So, Niti Aayu has given the model land leasing law to give the law. That the rest of the states will adapt to their own. Again, because agriculture is a state subject. So, if there is a legal mechanism, then the land that is easy to give the land on the right. And it will not be done without settlements. In the legal mechanism, there will also be settlements in the legal mechanism. Then there is right to fair compensation and transparency in land acquisition, rehabilitation and resettlement. Now, this Act 2013 has been initiated. But its amendment is pending. It has not been made by acceptance. So, these are the three things we did with respect to land reforms in the last about 20-22 years. Then as far as Agri markets are concerned. So, central government level model APMC acts are coming in 2003 and in 2017. So, the 2017 Act is called Livestock Act. So, that is why it is called as APLMC Act. The E-NAM that started in 2016. That is another Agri market reform. We have already studied what it is. And Model Contract Farming Act 2018. So, this was given by Neeti Aayog again. Basic purpose is that the small farmers are they are the private businesses, with big establishments, with food supply chains, with food supply chains. So, what should the contract farming model be? And that can institute all the state in its own. Then with respect to Agri market, three farm laws were there which are now repealed. So, the question came from the beginning of the year. In the beginning of the year, I don't think that we should expect a question on farm laws. But, we have given the question in the future. Then, agriculture pricing policy. So, price deficiency payment system. Eek Neeti Aayogne 2016 me suggestion dya a ta. Usko apne abhi, joh agriculture ki report hamne padhi. Uske and dar apne already study kari liya ki what it is, how it will be actually implemented. Then, what are the parallel developments? So, we are trying to improve forward-backward linkages within the agriculture. And for this, there are various government schemes. Let's say, aap dikhenge ki livestock ke liye alag-lag schemes hain. Mach se sampadai hojana hai. Mega food park ki scheme hai. Ye sari schemes, national or state level pe chalti. Joki, essentially forward-backward linkages, joh apne agriculture me padhi thi. Unko improve karne ke liye helpful. Isne kisi level ka. So, this is the overall policy evolution in agriculture. I think this document will help you create a perspective for answer writing whenever you are to do so. In mains. Now, moving to the next area. That is the question answers. So to speak, jitne humare agri culture ke area mein aate hai. Give me one moment. Here we are. So, growth and development. Monetary. I hope you questions you have read and you have to write answers. Okay. Now, agriculture. Eek cheez jo is bar bhoot zyada news mein hai, wo hai international year of millet. To us wajay se questions banenge. So millet production comes with a lot of health, agriculture and nutritional benefits. Discuss. This is a general question on millet. Agar aayega. So millet is a collective term referring number of small seeded annual grasses. They are cultivated as green crops primarily on marginal lands in dry areas in temperature, temperate subtropical and tropical regions. So, karib karib sab jagahi jahan jahan bhi dry areas si veliability hai, udar millet si cultivation possible hai. Is the word file properly visible to all of you? Yes sir. Okay. Now some of the common millets available in India are ragi, jowar, tama, bajra and variga. So, so many are there. Just remember two or three. Jowar, bajra, ragi they are the famous ones. Now India is the largest producer of millet in the world. It accounts for 20% of novel production and 80% of Asia's production. As you have seen it, So, now we have a lot of scope for producing this. Now it is why it is significant. So nutritionally it is superior. Remember one or two points. Superior to wheat and rice. Why? Because of high protein, fiber, vitamins and minerals like iron content. Why did we take a diet? Because it is a little bit coarse. It is not so soft. It is just in the taste of the chest. So we avoid this. Now, millets are rich in calcium and magnesium. They provide nutritional security and shield against nutritional deficiency. That is what we call silent hunger. So, gluten free and low glycemic index. So, they tackle lifestyle problems and health challenges such as obesity and diabetes because they are gluten free and have a low glycemic index. Basically, a relative ranking of carbohydrate in food according to how they affect the blood glucose levels. Now, the high yielding variety of wheat and rice, they have a very high glycemic index also. Same goes with corn. Corn flakes, corn in any form. Very high glycemic index. So, they raise the blood sugar levels like anything. Remember, these products were created back in 1960s when we needed more hands on deck. Hands on deck means you need labor. Which is the best of working every day and every day. So, if people have a lifestyle like this, they are more likely in the field or industry. Then, these high glycemic index foods are fine. So, there are the foods in 1960s. But if you need labor, they are more likely to take the work from mind. They are less likely to take the work from hands. Then, they need low glycemic index foods. Okay? Because now, all industry services are based based. So, they are taking the work from mind. It's fine. Back in the day, if you consider when there was Rishi Muniwala time, in that time, there was low glycemic index foods. Because it was a work from mind. Okay. It was a little bit of agriculture. But it was not a subsistence form of agriculture. It was not commercialized. Okay? So, now, even if we are going for agriculture, agriculture, but we are in a service sector industry, which is leading the way forward today. So, low GI foods. Then, super crop at growing. So, millets are photo insensitive. That means they do not require too much light or anything for plowing. And they are resilient to climate change. So, they can grow on poor soils with little or no external inputs. And they are less water consuming. And they are capable of growing in drought conditions. And they have low carbon and water footprints. So, for example, rice plants needs at least three times more water in comparison to growing of millets. So, it is good. It is good. It is good. But, we have to do some lifestyle changes. We have to do some work with plants. We have to do some work with plants. We have to do some work with plants. We have to do some work with plants. We have to do some work with plants. We have to chew it a little more. Okay. Now, what are organic fertilizers and how can they benefit Indian agriculture? So, organic fertilizer concern is that organic sources are driven from such as compost, cattle manures, poultry droppings, domestic sewage, so everything. Now, there are many videos coming from here. You can put the kitchen waste into water. Then, they can use it as fertilizer. Like this. Then, further, they can be categorized into two segments. First is biofertilizers and then there are organic manure. So, what are biofertilizers? They are composed of living organisms. So, they don't have like vegetable matter or decomposed matter. They are living organisms. So, as you know, earth forms. So, they can definitely create biofertilization. Yes. Now, apart from that, there are various bacteria such as rhizobium. Then, azitobacter. These are two other things. Blue, green, algae. Easy to remember things. Then, organic manure. So, this is basically partially decomposed organic matter. Like be digested from the bio-based plant or compost or vermicompost. So, they have rich nutrients. Then, potential of organic fertilizer in India. How is the market here? First is utilizing the municipal solid waste. So, we got 150,000 tons of municipal solid waste every year. Okay. So, that way we can definitely use it for organic harvest. Organic manure. Then, consider the collection efficiency of 80%. Organic part of MSW will be 50%. So, what we get is around 65,000 tons per day. Sorry, not per year. Even if half of this is diverted towards the biogas industry, government can leverage this reducing an import of fossil fuels and fertilization. We can just build a system. Then, utilizing biogas affluents. So, there is also a great value of organic fertilizer also known as digestate, which is the biogas plant's affluent. So, biogas after the other stuff is the rest of the biogas. Further, biogas can be utilized for heating, electricity and vehicular purposes. And digested can help in the green evolution or second green evolution. Then, increasing soil fertility. Now, digested can provide organic carbon to continuously depleting soil apart from its standard nutrition value. So, in India at present, biogas production is just over 1,10000 tons. This is a year's production. We can do it more in two days if we can utilize it. We can use it more than 50,000 tons daily availability. Now, there has been significant rise in organic farming sector due to growing awareness about the harmful effect of synthetic fertilizer on the soil. Rising health concerns, expanding urban population base and increased consumer expenditure on food grains. Now, further, they have the potential to eliminate the usage of synthetic fertilizers completely. Over a period of time, like I said, fertilizer industry started with war industry. Coming out of second world war. So, extra things are used. Now, despite being the second largest producer of tea globally, there are challenges faced by the tea industry in India. Highlights some of the initiatives to promoting the growth of the industry. So, India is the second largest producer of tea globally. Northern part of India is the biggest producer at about 83% of the country's annual tea production. And there also Assam and West Bengal. That's the majority of tea gardens there. In South, you got Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka producing the rest of 17%. And today we make 10% of the total exports. So, that's a big market for us. Now, to the challenges. So, tea prices have started declining according to World Bank report. Why? So, no proper steps were taken to improvise the quality of tea being produced in India. Or to raise the price margins as the profits were often used for something else and not for the tea gardens. So, quality of work out is not much done. This is why prices decline. Next, less production. So, it is facing a number of problems such as financial, power, labor, poor labor schemes, inadequate communication system, increased pollution, less subsidy for transport and so on. This kind of situation have put tea industry in Northeast India in a hopeless situation resulting in low production of tea and tea leaves. So, if you can see the prices of tea, in the last two years it has increased. The tea was 400 rupees a kg in Taj Mahal and all. Now, it is selling at 600 rupees a kg. Almost 1.5 times the price has increased. Next is climatic conditions. So, if the climate conditions are unfavorable for tea production going to less or heavy rainfall, geomography. That also poses severe problem affecting the production of tea and lives of the tea industry labor. Then there is pest problem. So, bacterial black spots is a disease which spreads and spoils feelings and Northeast may be a major disease. Now, low wages of labor. Then, low wages of labor. In the most part, the migrant immigrants are working from Bangladesh. They are working. So, they don't get anything special. So, usually the wages paid for tea industry labor are very less. This made some of them starve and leave out the industry. So, quality deterioration. So, as importance is given only to the production increase and not for quality improvement, Indian tea known for its superior taste will lose its market in the international arena that the quality is not taken care of. So, if you today want good quality tea, you also need to have a podability segment there. So, you need both things. Quality plus quantity. We need both. We need both to focus on quantity and quality. Now, what initiatives are the government in this? Promotion of packaged tea of Indian origin. So, there are schemes which provide assistance for promotional campaigns up to 25% cost reimbursement. Display in international departmental stores, product literature, website development, inspection charges reimbursement up to 25% of the charges. So, basically government health career, tea, co, promote carnival. Subsidies for domestic exporters. So, the tea board also provides subsidies to domestic exporters to participate in international fairs and exhibitions. Tea development and promotion scheme. So, November 2021 may launch Vata or this is going to go on for 2021 to 2026. What it wants to do is enhance productivity and quality. That's the focus. So, that's it about the tea industry. If someone wants something good, then they can ask. Tea industry, sugar industry, such as. There are some industries that are relevant to time and have to ask questions. What are the main challenges facing India's agriculture sector? What policies are being implemented to address these challenges? It's a very broad question. The reason for keeping this question is that any issue can be dealt with. So, it's like a potato question. The points you read all the points you read in all areas. India is an agricultural based country where more than half of the population is engaged in farming activities contributing to the country's GDP. If you have figures in your country, I don't have to replicate it here. What are the challenges faced by India's agriculture sector? First is declining soil fertility. So, India's agriculture is heavily dependent upon soil health. And declining soil fertility is a major challenge. Soil health, for example, Jagiva, Sudhev, run across countries trying to promote soil health. Now, water scarcity. So, India is a water stressed country and only 4% of world's fresh water is available to 17% of the world's population. Then fragmented land holdings. The farmers are having marginal land. So, that's less than one hectare. This is why there is a trouble. 84% of farmers today have land less than 2 hectares in India. Then low productivity. So, per hectare yield, which is very low in India. In China, in comparison of the US, in comparison of the US. Then lack of access to technology and markets. So, because the investment in agriculture suffers from agriculture, this is why there is a technological access limited. So, there is a lot of infrastructure in the market. There is a lot of infrastructure coming. Then there is, of course, climate change. So, that is affecting every country's agricultural productivity. So, may it be droughts, floods, cyclones, poor rainfall, erraticness of monsoon. So, all that factors associate with challenges. A policy is implemented to address these challenges. So, at the level of irrigation, government is trying to increase the investment through Pradhan Mantri Krishi Shichai Yojana. Trying to work on the groundwater through Atal Bhujal Yojana. And now we got our Ministry of Jal Shakti also, Uskuru Chai Inlipto. For a more focused approach. So, we add here. Okay. Then promoting crop diversification. So, we got Pradhan Mantri, Faisal Bhima Yojana and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana. They want to promote crop diversification. Both of them. If you want to promote crop diversification. So, if you want to improve 5% premium, you need to diversify 5% of the crop. Improving infrastructure. So, there is Pradhan Mantri, Gram, Shadak Yojana and Enam. One is rural connectivity and the other is market. We are improving two levels. Then providing subsidies in the form of inputs for seeds, fertilizers and irrigation equipment. So, this will reduce the cost of cultivation for the farms. So, that is working on the farm. Introduction of technology based solutions. So, PM Kisaan is there. So, we are basically solar powered water pumps. And similarly, Kisaan credit card is there. So, to that definitely we can increase the technological inputs. All these areas, Lermit is trying one way or the other to help the Indian agriculture sector. So, this is a broad analysis. This is a way of thinking about it. So, what are the main challenges facing production, distribution and marketing of agricultural products in India? And this is basically a forward link in this. So, how can they be addressed to ensure sustainable and inclusive growth in agricultural sector? So, first, I would say, with statistics, 54% of the country's land classified as arable. And the agricultural industry comprising half of the labour market. So, it is 50% low as the agricultural sector. It is one of the most important industries in Indian economy. In terms of employment, it is 151 million people. So, that is indirectly, directly 50% of the population and contributing 18 to 20% of the GDP. So, time to time change, or whatever, they can rest IC segment. However, there are certain challenges in production, distribution and marketing such as production level challenges. First is dependence on monsoon for irrigation. Probably 50% from our monsoon dependent. Okay. Then, inadequate access to credit and technology. So, despite, you know, we have in so many institutions being created, yet there are troubles because the interest rates are high and there is a lack of collateral with the farmers. Supposedly, there is a small and marginal farmer. That is why it is also troublesome. Additionally, access to modern technology such as irrigation system, high yielding feed varieties and modern farm machinery that is lagging in India. Then, there is poor infrastructure. There is transport, market linkage, electricity. All things are poor infrastructure. Now, you can see the irrigation and flood management. So, it is so bad that we are in India. Okay. Now, inefficient use of natural resources. So, India's agriculture is plagued by inefficient use of natural resources such as water and land. So, this leads to water scarcity, soil degradation, reduced agriculture productivity. So, there are real challenges with production. What are the distribution challenges? There are no transport infrastructure. There is a lot of road dependence. But, roads and highways connectivity in rural areas are not so good. Lack of proper storage and refrigeration facilities. In some states, it is very good in Punjab. Because there is a whole FCI network. But, in other states, it is not. In the south, in the east, it is a problem. Moreover, due to high temperatures in many parts of India, perishable products like fruits and vegetables often spawned efficiently. So, you need refrigeration facilities which are very less. Refrigerated transportation which is even less. Then, exploitation of farmer by middlemen. So, due to intermediation, farmer's market price is not fully realizable. What are the challenges of the market? Inefficient marketing channels. So, we have got APMC's which are inefficient. For organised market places has to be resulted in India today. This wage α COMP elleometry has a deep enough infrastructure. Imrastructure has a deep enough Emergency-volveillance. In estadounid an indianing catalog is noteous. Waste of shipping afin dougherty in compra is efficient. In light of delivery, they have recently introduced and terug to the dafür document. I've got a small area of money that vulnerable. There are some continues to know. It's in değil. In hindiologique, we need transportation. nueizes highways to supply time. And, it is in our waste, viennent around the capital stores. Another 우리가 has been lost parts to N沒關係 and monte dollars. And we have un Stra scratching. Cooler price discovery mechanism. Therefore, although ENA is there, Agmi Marks net is there. Yet, be bilioners!!! in the market, it is more than the traders and the inspectors of the money. So, farmers are generally unaware of the prices prevailing in the market and intermediaries use this to their advantage by offering lower prices. Despite E&M, despite whatever, it is a little bit better in the next five years. It can be better in the next five years, but it is still time. Lack of information. So, with respect to market trends, pricing, consumer preferences, so, not only information is lost, but also information is lost. It is clear that farmers will be hungry for fruits and vegetables, but it is difficult to adapt. The other infrastructure also needs to be used. For sale, refrigeration, for all things, for primary processing. So, it is less than that. Steps need to be taken to address the issue. So, we need to improve irrigation infrastructure, transportation and create a more efficient marketing system. So, these are the three basic things that we need to work upon right now. Next, what are the farmer producer organizations? This is 10,000 FPOs. How do they ensure forward-backward linkages in the food processing industry? Food processing industry is the government's favorite task. So, you ask a question. And how do you help us with FPOs? This is an add-on question. So, FPOs is an entity formed by primary producers such as farmers, milk producers, fishermen, weavers, rural artisans, craftsmen. Now, an FPOs can be a producer company, a cooperative society or other legal form which provides for sharing of profits and benefits amongst members. So, yeh core task here. Sharing of profits and benefits. Concept is to bring together producers, particularly small and marginal farmers in order to form an effective tool for improved access to investment. So, essentially, agriculture means that investment is not enough. Similarly, technology cannot buy everyone. So, yeh kar saktein at least, ki sharing can be there. Fertilizer, seeds, markets, sab chizom ki sharing ho se. FPOs can register themselves under the special provisions of the Companies Act 1956. So, unke liye government ne provision kiya hai to register as an FPO. The main aim of an FPO is to ensure better income for the producers through an organization of their own. Kud ki ek organization. So, small producers do not have large marketable surplus individually. Kud ki, but to get the benefit of economies of scale. Kud ki, also in agricultural marketing. Kud ki, there is a long chain of intermediaries who very often work in non-transparently leading to the situation where the producers receive only a small part of the value that the ultimate user or consumer pays. So, this is something called as information asymmetry. This is something that works to the advantage of the intermediaries and not the farmers or the consumers. Aapko khe lagta hai? Aaj agar ap 200 rupiah kilo bhi tomato krivi vare go. To farmer thodi bichara 200 rupiah kilo kama. Not at all. Usko to woe paise mil kre honga joo pehle milega. Toh traders maha raha hai. By controlling di supply hunko mokka mil gaya ki monsoon ayega. Aap baarish me haom bholenke tomato ji abh gawa gaya. Aapko. Aapko news me toh baat phir phehli garti hai. Aapne aap hi sab trader profit margin bhahaana shuru ka da. Farmers me toh woh apni fasil kub ki kaat ke bêch ke free ho gaya ho. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Aapko. Now, FPO can help create value across different post-harvest phases, including harvesting, primary processing, storage, secondary processing, and market linkages. So, to all levels, FPO can't affect that. It ensures that all benefits of the value chain are retained by small farmers, a group of small farmers. So, FPO's have emerged as the most appropriate institutional form around the world which to mobilize farmers and build their capacity to collectively leverage their production and marketing strength. Now, through FPO's, the farmers have made a shift from production-oriented agriculture to market-oriented agriculture, thus, you know, trying to work without intermediaries and become agripreneurs by themselves. In India, agriculture is the only one industry where the producer does not get to decide the price of the product, especially for the 23 commodities which are regulated under APMC. So, most of our time, the price of the product is determined either by the government or by the market demand and supply. Sometimes, there is a crisis of surplus. Now, the matter is, I have seen that the market is talking about the price of the product. There are not even 2-2-2-3 kilos. They are buying them. Same goes with potatoes. When new potato comes, the cold storage people, they throw the older one on the street. So, let's take it, let's eat the food, let's eat the food, let's go to the food. That's the situation. That's the crisis of surplus from time to time. But when there is something like this, when there is a phase, when such like monsoon or some kind of disruption takes place in transportation, or maybe when fuel-based inflation is there, petrol and diesel prices will increase. Then, the prices will increase all of these prices. Like this. So, ensuring backward linkages in food processing industry. So, FPO system. Farmers cannot get adequate price for their produce without the value addition and FPO's bridge the gap between producers' expertise and marketing of the product. Cost of production can be reduced by procuring all necessary inputs in bulk at wholesale rates. Aggregation of produce and bulk transport reduces the market cost. Thus, enhancing the net income of the producer. The intermediaries are aggregators. They are aggregators. They are aggregators. They are aggregators. They are all about a small amount of money. So, they are cut from cost transportation and all levels. Building the scale through produce aggregation enables to take advantage of economy of scale and attracts traders to collect produce at farm rates. So, they are all about a small amount of produce. So, they are all about a small amount of produce. So, they are all about aggregators. They are all about aggregators or food processing industry. So, they are also the advantage of that. Access to model technology. Facilitation of capacity. Building extension of training on production technologies. Ensuring traceability of agricultural produce. These are all things you can do. Traceability of the concern is to have a lineage trace. Like, Shimla apple, Kinnor apple. We are sending traceability on the other. Most harvest losses can be minimized through value addition and efficient management of the value chain. This helps in primary processing like drying, cleaning, grading etc. So, these things are backward linkages. Forward linkages means selling. So, FPO members are able to leverage collection strength and bargaining power to access financial and non-financial inputs. And services and appropriate technologies. Reduce transaction costs. Tap high value market. And enter into partnerships with private entities like Adani, Reliance and so on. More equitable terms. So, FPOs can bargain because they have produced. They can bargain with big sellers and retailers. Collective strength empowers farmers. Basically, FPOs are nothing but a collective strength. Collective bargaining strength, collective selling strength. To integrate their individual marketable surplus to get benefits of the economy of scale. So, farmers can connect directly with the customer, benefiting the customer and give farmers a better price. That's creating a sustainable space for agriculture. Developed countries, today there are farmers markets. Very good. Our market is not so prevalent. Farmers market is saying that every week farmers will take their produce and produce. Organic or inorganic. So, now there are mandiya. Direct farmers sell. So, what is the mandiya. What is the mandiya? The mandiya is saying that every small town is in the small town. It is in the small town. It is in the small town. It is in the small town. There are all intermediaries. Farmers are very important. So, farmers, producers, markets, FPOs, they will better adapt. Now, for example, in Mohali, they have established a good market in Punjab with respect to FPOs. They have to do direct sales. But if they don't have a good market in the small town, then they have to do the farmers. They have to do it. Air conditioned everything they gave. But infrastructure did not do. Because the consumer also has to shift the space. And they have to do it. Ok. Now, regular supply of produce and quality control is possible through proper planning, management. Price fluctuation can be managed if there are practices like contract farming and agreements. FPOs make communication easier for dissemination of information about price, volume and other farmers or farming related good-by-3. So, they can help in getting access to financial resources against the stock without collaterals. And they can help generate funds from government, donors, service providers and so on. So, that way, they can streamline the market end of the agriculture also. And they will also help in stemming the distress migration. It states, a booster state, a R&O because of the distress in agriculture. Now, from the value addition, processing, end-to-end management, input, output management to marketing, FPOs can help in fulfilling the target of doubling farmer income by 2022. Now, the target is the target. We have to do it. But, whatever the extent is, it helps us. Okay. FPOs face the challenge with respect to community mobilization, effective decision-making, governance, promoting agency efficiency and access to capital. Today, the challenges of FPOs face the same. The collectivization ecosystem in the country needs to be professionalized. The aggregates of food at every level. The new tailored capacity building support and seamless access to finance. This is all. Potential alternative financing structures such as guarantee fund, result-based finance, insurance structures, to facilitate capital infusion into FPOs need to be explored. An FPO diagnostics and credit rating mechanism can encourage financiers to unlock credit flow. So, now, the credit rating is not coming. Self-regulatory bodies such as microfinance institution network designed to protect the interest of FPOs and farmers is also needed. All these are the basic things that we can take up. Then, a question is, green revolution and consequent increase in agriculture. The produce has worked to the disadvantage of farmers critically analyze. Green revolution has 2-3 disparities created. The first is food disparity. How did the food disparity create in terms of rice wheat cycle? And the rest of the diversification hurts it. The other diversity is regional disparity. Regional disparity. Regional disparity. So, some Punjab, Haryana, UP, like the West, North Western states have adapted to green revolution very well. And it has also been a good benefit. But the eastern states and southern states have not been able to adapt it. So, the third is the growth and development disparity. And the other is the left-wing extremist affected areas are more in the East. There are developmental issues there. The third is the farmers' disparity. The poor and rich farmers started to get more gaps. The rich farmers were able to afford capital-intensive farming that was there in green revolution. They could invest more. So, due to this, they have more benefits. Subsidies are also uniquely benefits for those who can pay. That's why they can also get the subsidy. So, due to this, rich farmers got richer and poor were not much helped by green revolution. Even the land reforms and other systems were able to keep the side of the system. Because green revolution required capital-intensive farming on a higher scale. Land reform was the other way around. The big farms were able to put a ceiling on a ceiling and redistribute. But, in the time of green revolution, we wanted more and more farmers and big farms. So, the whole land reform was closed in terms of redistribution after green revolution was launched. So, these three major issues or disadvantages are the main issues that are due to green revolution. Of course, if you look at this, if you look at the environment and ecosystem level, there was a problem for chemical farming. There was a problem for chemical farming in terms of fertilizers, pesticides and all. Then, if you look at the water stress, there were other water guzzling plants like rice, they were promoted. And that creates trouble at the water level, irrigation level. Then, if I add another thing here, high yielding varieties. High yielding varieties are good in your own, but like I said, they have a very high glycemic index. So, they promoted health related problems such as obesity, blood sugar, blood pressure. All these lifestyle diseases are coming from high yielding varieties only. Because the basic protein structure, the basic carbohydrate structure got changed in those plant varieties. And that created trouble. Then, the biological level of the troubles are the same. So, these all disadvantages are in green revolution. So, these are all discussed in this. So, you can just go through the answer for this. There are also advantages, they are also written here. So, you have to ask questions, you have to ask questions, you have to ask questions, you have to ask them, you have to ask them. Food security is at least at least. So, the main concern was then the rural development. So, many people have been out of poverty. And the new technologies and modernization agriculture has been recognized. And today, we have to practice and adaption. So, they have to give us all the green revolution. Now, what is biofortification and how it can help in realizing the objectives of national nutrition mission? So, biofortification basically means that we are trying to increase the nutritional quality of food or food crop. So, how do we do that? So, that is through agronomic practices, conventional plant breeding or modern biotechnology. We have to say that in three cases. It differs from conventional fortification in that biofortification aims to increase the nutrient levels in the crops during plant growth, rather than through manual means during processing of the plant. Now, they say that in India, there are fortified rice. But that fortified rice is extra vitamins added to the outside. So, there is no biological growth level of rice in the biological biological growth. There is an extra addition in fortified rice. If there is fortified milk, the vitamin A will add extra to the outside. So, if you are going to add that packet in the package, you will make F plus S a sign. So, that means that it has been fortified. Okay. So, how would it help? Essentially, there is something called silent hunger. So, it helps to deal with that. Silent hunger denotes the prevalence of lower nutrition within the children, although they are eating enough. So, the mission aims to prevent and reduce the prevalence of stunting among children, which is highly prevalent in India, and anemia among women. So, these are two things that have major troubles in India. So, they help them with that. So, that's that essentially. What is conservation agriculture? Discuss its advantages and the wake of climate change leading to soil degradation. So, this is a lot of news in conservation agriculture. Because there are different forms. There are organic farming. So, there is a set of soil management practices that minimize the disruption of the soil structure, composition and natural biodiversity. So, that is basically conservation agriculture. Proven the potential to improve crop yields while improving the long-term environmental and financial sustainability of farming. And it shares three core principles that are maintenance of permanent or semi-permanent soil cover. Minimum soil disturbance through tillage. Regular crop rotation to help combat various biotech constraints. If we take one type of fossil, we will take one type of soil. So, biotech constraints will be because it will drive the soil in one type of nutrients. If we change the nutrients, we will replenish the other nutrients. So, that way we need to work upon it. Now, CA uses or promotes where possible or needed various management practices listed below. So, that is utilization of green manors or cover crops. No burning of crop residue. Integrated disease and pest management. Controlled or limited human or mechanical traffic over agricultural soil. So, all this helps in conservation agriculture. And climate change leads to reduction in the potential of land to produce benefits. from a particular land use under a specified form of land management. And is considered to be one of the major problems of the world in the recent time. So, conservation agriculture can help in soil degradation by by one checking soil erosion, enhancing organic matter, replenishing nutrients, protecting soil biota. So, basics, you can remember the details. You can remember the details of the whole thing. You can remember the tons of water. So, all are the basic facts. You can remember the details of the world. You can remember the details of the world. You can remember the explanation of the world. So, be careful. Okay. And examine the concept of cooperative farming in the light of the problem of land fragmentation in promoting the socio-economic welfare of the farmer. which is far below the world average of 3.7 hectares per person. So, in India, the per capita average operational size of land holding is 1.33 hectares, which is far below the world average of 3.7 hectares per person. So, land holding has shown a marginal decrease rather than increase from holding size that of a decade ago. So, the next year's 10 years will be less than a year. The population may divide within families. So, small and marginal holdings have adverse impact on efficient farming, thereby impacting economic prosperity because investment limit is a lot of risk. difficulty in access to agriculture credit is prominent drawback of small farm holdings. Because if a small land is 1 hectare, then it will only give the bank collateral and then loan lend us. Producers with small holdings often face problems due to inefficiencies in transporting their produce, leading to increased dependence on middlemen. Now, if it is a small land, then it will be a waste of 1 hectare. And if it is going to transfer, then there is no special benefit. Therefore, there is a loss of income which becomes middleman's commission. So, what is the need for this? First is economy of scale. So, cooperative farming can help in creating economy of scale. Let's say, the farmers of the city will be cooperative farming. So, seed, fertilizer, mechanical instruments, irrigation, including their transportation, they can share and they can yield the economy of scale. Then, marketable surplus, this is also increased. Sometimes it will be less than one's field, sometimes it will be more than one's field. But essentially, if we will do a small job, then marketable surplus is being made. And in that regard, they can keep their collective bargaining spend. Then, credit worthiness. So, 1 hectare of the loan is a problem. If the whole land, the whole town of 3,000, 2,000 hectare of the whole land, it will definitely be better. Chiticism. India has a cooperative farming issue. So, it failed to make a frontal attack on prevailing inequality in the economic structure as traditional status distinction of landowners, landless laborers, and sharecroppers are still being maintained. Mechanization of agriculture through cooperative farming will squeeze the scope of employment and is likely to make workers redundant in rural areas. It will be labor-free. For those who need to be disliked unemployment in agriculture, but it is employment. Cooperative farming is not the only method to raise agriculture productivity. There is alternatives such as HYV seeds, fertilizers, implements. So, it will also be productivity. Even crop diversification to high-value crops, HV seeds. That is the best. If you have one acre, then you will use wheat raise to make a mushroom farming. It will stack in silos. And in Punjab, two farmers have a great example. You started from one acre, and today they will cultivate two acres in the year. And they will feed the mushrooms in the year. It is so huge. And the amount of money from their income is 10-20,000,000. That is the kind of profit that people are earning out of it, if they know how to make it. It is mechanized sufficiently. There is labor use. Everything is something. But then, you can earn so much money. Now, solution of these criticisms. The members of cooperative society should be active and vigilant. Every member should exercise his or her rights and insist for transparency in operation, accountability of the executive members and fairness of activities. So, first, those who are the cooperative society types or the farmers' type of cooperative society, then the method should be democratic. It is necessary to spread the movement as people's movement. People should not think it as a part of government or department of the government. So, people should not understand that. All the operators should be fine. They should not think they are the two people. What is the blue revolution? So, this time, the government has a lot of impact on the crisis. How can it overcome the challenges of sustainability currently faced in the India's fishery sector? So, blue revolution is what? So, it has the vision to achieve economic prosperity in the country and fish farmers as well as contribute towards food and nutritional security through the potential utilization of water resources for fishery development in a sustainable manner, keeping in view biosecurity and environmental concerns. So, this is blue revolution. This should be remembered for the main problem. Okay. What are the statistics of India? The challenges of the India's status is necessary to take more attention. First is unsustainable fishing practices. So, that is a major problem because in one place there is more fishing in the same place, in the same way spread out. There are 90% of global marine fish stocks have either been fully exploited or overfished. So, that leads to biological problems. Sustainability. Then there is low productivity. So, inland fisheries and fish farming sector is low in terms of per fisherman, per boat or per farm. In Norway, a fisherman per farm catches 250 kg per day while in India it is just 4 to 5 kg. So, this is a major concern for inland fisheries. So, sea-based should be okay. Lack of modern equipment. So, marine capture fishery comprises largely of small fishermen who operate traditional boats, either non-motorized vessels or boats with a basic outboard motor. And these vessels cannot operate beyond nearshore waters. They cannot take a deep sea very far. So, there will be more fish in the deep sea. While nearshore coastal waters are highly overfished, the high value fish stock proliferates in the deep sea. If you have a big fish, then you will have to go to the sea-spin. So, they are not available here in the sea shore. So, the proper businessmen type of fisherman has big boats and that is the lack of variety. So, limited number of species grown mainly due to weak linkages between research and development and fish farms community. And high value species such as tuna cannot be caught by the fishermen who use traditional fish. So, Now, the blue revolution can overcome the challenges by using a two-pronged approach. First, sustainable capture fishery to harness marine and inland water. And expanding the horizon of fish farming to inland coverage or increased coverage and increased productivity, species diversification, better market returns. Productivity of brackish waters. So, coastal aquaculture has touched 10 to 12 metric ton per hectare. Now, our productivity has increased a little bit, but it is not enough. Then, 30,000 hectares have been added to the area under fish farming. So, this is good for India. Introduction of cage culture. So, lobsters and all the farming are in cage culture. Then, new national policy in marine fisheries. This talks of introducing deep sea fishing vessels and assisting fishing communities to convert their vessels and gear for what is beyond innovative practices. So, such as recirculatory aquaculture system seems to realize the goal of more crop per drop. So, fish or crop agricultural crop. So, the yield is increased. It is up to 3 metric ton per hectare. Then, the investment of rupees 3000 crore in the blue revolution is being supplemented through rupees 7523 crore. Fisheries and aquaculture investment infrastructure development fund. And this will meet the capital investment requirement of the hectare. So, right now, in order to meet the ever-influencing demand for animal protein, global fish production should touch somewhere like 196 million tons by 2025. But this is not happening. And it currently stands at 171 million tons. So, this is the prospect of our products that if we increase the fish production, then we will get our product. So far, so good? Do you understand? Do you understand? Do you understand? Do you understand? integrated farming system how it can help in tackling the farmers distress so ifs is an interdependent interrelated often interlocking production system based on few crops animals and related subsidiary enterprises in such a way that maximizes the utilization of nutrients of each system and minimizes the negative effect of environment so that is integrated farming system what about the video routine questions i mean recently the interrelated interdependent interlocking nature of ifs involves utilization of primary produce and secondary produce of one system as basic input for the other system thus making the mutually integrated as what oh just both in a mutually reinforcing virtual cycle so it is dusky like this so how can it help in agriculture or in helping farmer distress or improving agricultural growth take you first is utility byproducts second is maximizing yield rejuvenation of systems of productivity then control the built up reducing the use of chemical fertilizer increasing natural resources or nutrients so mitigation of negative impacts effective tool for northeastern farmers which is the hilly regions and crop cultivation so these are the basic things in ifs you have learned what steps need to be taken to improve livestock productivity in india and how does it help in ensuring doubling farm income by 20 22 So, what is the livestock sector? We have got the information from the basic economic survey. What are the problems that are now? What should we improve? Feed and fodder, research and development, strengthening infrastructure and services, new technologies, conservation of animal biodiversity and animal health. For this, we have already known that the economic survey is a long list. So, this can definitely increase farmers income. How? First is resource potential to cattle population in India. Boon for landless farmers, dairy subsector significance, diversification of income, employment throughout the year and focus on women labor. So, all the data are given here. Please pick it up for your examination. Then what is national policy? Examine water policy, national water policy of India and discuss its potential for promoting water use efficiency in agriculture. So, 2012 policy is a policy. If you have to ask the government in mind, then you have to ask the question. Old question. What is carbon fertilization? How it can impact agricultural output? So, carbon fertilization has come back from the news. It is basically artificial enrichment of the atmosphere of greenhouses with carbon dioxide as an essential nutrient for plants and vegetables and also known as carbon dioxide fertilization. So, it is used to improve production levels both from a qualitative and quantitative point of view. If we live in more oxygen-rich environment, then our health will be better. If we live in more oxygen-rich environment, then our health will be better. So, it is particularly suitable for cold climates and can be used for growing practically all types of vegetables and greenhouse fruits and ornamental plants. That is where you use it more. So, what it helps in, so increase in photosynthetic rate, increase in water use efficiency, plants grow faster, they distribute a greater proportion of photosynthetic to the roots, so they become stronger. And the reproductive biomass growth as well as vegetative biomass growth is usually increased by elevated carbon dioxide. Like our growth will be better in plants. Like this. The reason behind mounting areas of sugar mills and distress in sugarcane farmers. So, this is the sugar sector. Like the tea was on the top, this is the sugar sector. So, there are some issues that come in. Just go through this. Generally, we have something called high production costs and lower realisation. Sugarcane farmer's cost is more than the cost of the farmer's cost, but he doesn't get money. So, the minimum distance criteria. So, the mills should be 15 km in the middle of the pool. So, it doesn't have to be negative. So, that's why there are monopoly in a different mills. Uncertain production output. Low yield of sugarcane. Short crushing season. 4-7 months, the rest of the sugar mills are free. Low sugar recovery rate because of transportation loss in India. And, uh, This is the solution. First is state advised prices. Fair and remunerative prices. This is the same as SAP added. And then, agriculture is also added. And then, the price of sugarcane is added. Let farmers have the freedom to set to any mill that may want to pay more. So, abhi kai na ek mil ki monopoli ni hoi siya. Abdan rakhiya. Farmers should be free to sell sugarcane to any mill they prefer. Minimum distance criteria should be removed. Sector needs infusion of capital. But also, policy measures and structural changes. States should migrate to the progressive revenue sharing formula to ensure farmers receive a share in profits. Production costs can also be reduced through proper utilization of byproducts of the industry. So, all these things are being done. Then, government should encourage ethanol production. And it will bring down the country's oil import, build and help in. Diversion of sucrose to ethanol and to balance out excess production in sugar. So, E20 ethanol blending program is starting to start our share. So, this will be good if you do it. What do you understand by feminization of agriculture? We also have read it in the report. So, this is a question from that lens. If it comes, what points do you need? Then, what is meant by peri-urban agriculture? So, this is basically something that is surrounding the boundaries of cities throughout the world. and includes products from crop and livestock agriculture, fishery, forestry, etc. We will do non-wood forest products as well as ecological services provided by the agriculture, fishery and forestry. We will do the city's little farming and gardening systems. So, that's called peri-urban. It is a rural, an urban, and a peri-urban. Like in Chendigarh, there are small towns in Chendigarh. Where all the peri-urban agriculture are doing. What is the benefit of this? One is green zones around urban areas. So, breathing pockets are created. Reduction in urban heat island. No need for transportation. Because in cities past, there is a whole supply of food. Diversification of food basket. Restrict unplanned urbanization. Because there is a agricultural land, there is a lot of urbanization. Then, land reforms. There is a question that has come to this in the UKC. So, they are necessarily not the only tool to boost agriculture growth, but also to eradicate poverty in rural areas. So, land reforms has significance. How do we do? So, you already have studied all the static points. What are the objectives? How did we do? How did we do? How did we do? How did we do? How did we do? How did we do? How did we do? How did we do? Then, agriculture sector in India is critical for the consistent growth and food security perspective. So, the significance of agriculture is a question. How can we do that? What you've studied on our own, that is all we can do. How did we do all this? It's just the same question answer written in a different format. So, basic points you have to prepare for this. In 2020, the question is, what are the salient features of the gel shakti abhyan launched by the government of India for water conservation and water security? So, the recent government launched initiative, that is the question. The core question is, what are the challenges and opportunities of the food processing sector in the country? So, already we have dealt with the newer questions, same things are here. Okay? Now, the rest of the previous year questions have been given. So, how do we write the exact answers? How do we write the questions on MSP? For example, just go through them. And that should be it. Now, let's see what we can improve in your particular answers. Okay? So, similarly, this pesticide management. We have learned the things on MSP. We have to critically analyze the role of biotechnology in improving the condition of the farmers in India. Then, discuss in what ways food processing industry can be a game changer for Indian agriculture. In pursuit of doubling farmer, income Indian agriculture policy must emphasize converting farmer into agri-preneurs. So, basically, intermediary, some farmers could forward backward linkages handle. That's the basic meaning. The real challenge of India's food security is poor grain management rather than shortage of grain production. So, post-harvest management or forward linkages, they need to improve the quality of the policy level interventions to convert farmers into agri-preneurs requires which are the following. What do you understand by precision irrigation? We discuss the advantages of precision irrigation in India. What we use today's laser levelers and IT in irrigation. We have to discuss about it. Despite having several measures to reduce the vulnerability of farmers in India, the farmer sector and the farmers continue to suffer from losses. So, how can we improve? Basically, again, forward-backward linkages question. So, shifting priority from land productivity to irrigation water productivity has its own set of challenges. So, per drop more crop is a work out. We can increase land on the market, we can increase the productivity on the market or water productivity. The awareness of the extent of malnutrition despite agriculture growth has led to need to coverage agriculture and nutrition. So, what was on the national nutrition mission on the fortification mission. We have all the points here. Identify the issues related to stubble burning. If you ask, it's not a problem every year. Every year it's not a problem every year. Every year it's not a problem every year. Okay. So, this is again a repeating issue in agriculture. So, deal with the questions. Try and write them in your own words. Set a timeline that you have to write 20 questions in 3 hours. Write it in terms of it. After reading all the articles, write it in terms of it. That will then make you speak that you are able to write it or not. The main concern is that you don't know anything for now. The main concern is that you have to write in the ground level at that time. In given 3 hours, 20 questions. So, in agriculture, you have to write questions in your hands. Read all the questions. You have to read all the points in your mind. Then you start writing them. That will help you a lot. In the economy, write more questions in other countries. But in agriculture, it's a lot of people. Because it will handle 50% of your marks. If you have 120 numbers, then 60 numbers. You have to write about the question in agriculture. Now, you have to write about sufficient material levels. Start with that criteria. Tomorrow, we will work out on industry and infrastructure. This is not a problem. Thank you. If you have any doubts, please do ask.
