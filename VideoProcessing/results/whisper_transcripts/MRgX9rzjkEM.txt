 How to get rid of pests on your plants? Here is a natural solution for you. Bugs like aphids can develop a huge colony in no time and they will suck out the sap of your plant. And if you see some ants around, they are farming aphids for their onidoo. Take a container of 1 liter, add a small teaspoon of organic soap, fill with water, and place the bottom end of a lemon. This will make the pH of the water slightly acidic and more effective against aphids. Pour your solution into a sprayer, spray directly on the aphids and let it sit during 15 minutes. And then wash the leaves. You can then brush the leaves with a soft sponge. Your plant is now free of pest. And green love to you!
