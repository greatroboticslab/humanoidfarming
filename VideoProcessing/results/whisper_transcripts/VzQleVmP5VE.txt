 Did you know what happens if a sheep never gets a haircut? It's actually dangerous! Their wool keeps growing, did not stop! It gets so heavy they can collapse, even break their bones! In 2015, one lost sheep named Chris was found after 6 years in the wild, and his wool weighed a shocking 90 pounds! That's a Guinness World Record! But here's the good news! They shaved it all off, and guess what? Chris made a full recovery!
