Education
 Always get the question, how do I start farming? How do I become a first generation farmer? How do they go about doing something like that? I had no clue how I was going to do it when I got out of college. And then looking back today, the opportunities I had then, I don't know how people are going to do it today. It gets harder and harder every year. Thankfully, the pig industry was strong and that allowed great opportunity. All the buildings that were going up at that time. Biggest thing is, is get to talking to people. If you want to work on the farm, if you want to be out here, get to know your neighbors and, you know, do you need help this, this, and, you know, show up on time, work hard, show you want to be there. And, you know, they'll give you opportunities and your time will come. You've just got to keep grinding and keep showing up.
