1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,140

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:08,730
undergrad and a two-year master's degree

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:11,990
would eventually mean that I am actually

4
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:16,109
professional gate holder but here I am

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:19,130

my husband gets back he went to help a

28
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:46,789
friend who has dairy steers to take to

29
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:48,170
market and needed an extra trailer so

30
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:52,810
when he gets back we'll talk on the mud

31
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:56,569
we are enjoying a mild 55 degree day

32
00:01:52,810 --> 00:02:00,280
even though it's rained an inch and a

33
00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:03,770
half this weekend and feeding is

34
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,509
absolutely horrendous because of the mud

35
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:09,979
and because we have we still have our

36
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:13,220
cows and calves and smaller Lots because

37
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:15,230
they're not quite done calving basically

38
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,910
almost and as soon as they are then we

39
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:19,550
will work I'll run them through the

40
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:22,970
chute and we'll work them and put them

41
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:25,300
out on some larger pasture but you

42
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,190
believe how fast that little monkey

43
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:32,959
drinks that milk

44
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:35,540
you're out done look at that anyway so

45
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:39,140

46
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,580

47
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,730

that but we do that so on Mondays they

49
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:49,340
go to a co-op and mom gets a day off to

50
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,990

pictures I don't know y'all it's just

59
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:14,739
always a lot going on here anyway we'll

60
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,300
head out in the mud in a minute on this

61
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:18,550
I don't need that I'm just going up the

62
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,640
road I almost forgot though that I need

63
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:24,760
to make a phone call business phone call

64
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:28,000
and we don't have a landline because

65
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:31,360
it's not working and our cell phone

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:37,209
service is really crappy so I go to the

67
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,230
barn to conduct business in my truck so

68
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:40,630
that's amazing

69
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:44,860
yeah a rural internet and cell phone

70
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:49,569
service still no hope one day we'll get

71
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:52,989
by okay off its time done and the wind

72
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:56,500
is whipping out there which is good

73
00:03:52,989 --> 00:04:02,350
because when the wind whips the mud

74
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:04,209
starts to dry I mean hopefully and I

75
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:08,950
almost forgot that somebody is coming to

76
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:12,459
get corn tonight that hasn't been bagged

77
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:21,810
yet so I guess he gets to do that and

78
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:26,110

81
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,870
husband picking corn with his old corn

82
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:42,010

00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:48,820
so bags that we sold at least yeah we

85
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:50,520

00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:14,979
alright that's done ten bags that need

91
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,289
to be closed but um I don't know how to

92
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:20,050
do it my husband has this fancy little

93
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:22,600
knot he does and I haven't mastered it

94
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:28,380
so I figured I'd leave something for him

95
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:31,660
to do yeah there we go

96
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:35,410

98
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:42,460
to take a load of cab to market for a

99
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:46,630
neighbor yeah this money obviously this

100
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:49,330
is not ideal we have another way right

101
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:51,479
now we would do it but we do the best we

102
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:56,590
can with what we have

103
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:58,740

104
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,740

105
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:21,510

106
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:25,440
years I have been able to add something

107
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:29,790
else to my resume gate holding

108

109
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:36,090
years of undergrad and a two-year

110
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,310
master's degree would eventually mean

111
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:42,050
that I am actually professional gate

112
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:46,100

and the Sun came out maybe for more than

115
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:58,340
30 seconds and the winds blowing so

116
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:58,340
