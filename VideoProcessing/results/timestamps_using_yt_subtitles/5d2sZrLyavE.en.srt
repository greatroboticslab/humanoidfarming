1
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,920
is

2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,279
will just be charging the battery and

3
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,599
when the battery is

4
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,599
tag then in the evening we just connect

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:41,520
the bobs so this is the solar panel

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,120
it goes to these crocodile clips

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,360
you just clip those onto the battery

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,960
and then it'll charge the battery and

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,800
these go to the lights

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:59,840
we've got two lights here one over here

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,840
one here clip them both to the battery

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:13,439
and then i suppose put the solar panels

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:18,080
out on the roof

14
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,080
so it's in the sun it's charging

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,840
what do you think easy

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840

19
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,599
and this will brighten up over a few

20
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,520
seconds yes long

21
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,080

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,400
on it

23
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,080
yes it will run too bad just can you

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,800
avoid this one

25
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,400
so people will welcome the light or will

26
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:50,080
they welcome the lighting

27
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:50,080
