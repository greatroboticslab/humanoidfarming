00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,360
when temperatures drop and snow covers

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,000
the Wyoming range lands like you see

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,850
here today livestock producers feed

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,520
harvested forage to their animals this

6
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:21,860
forage helps cattle sheep and other

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,130
domesticated livestock maintain body

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,869
condition and health winter can be a

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,720
stressful time for animals and humans

10
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:31,310
alike this is why livestock producers

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,980
monitor their animals energy

12
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:36,140
requirements the lowest temperatures

13
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,870
that livestock can tolerate before

14
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,840
needing a boost in fed energy is 20 to

15
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:43,970
32 degrees Fahrenheit these temperatures

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,690
are for dry livestock and do not include

17
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,380
windchill

18
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:50,750
if livestock are wet and/or it's windy

19
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:52,670
increased fed energy by one to two

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,920
percent for every degree the wind chill

21
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:58,070
temperature falls below that 20 to 32

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:01,370
degrees energy is most easily provided

23
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:03,830
through additional hay during summer and

24
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,540
fall alfalfa oats and grass are

25
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,369
harvested and stored in bales for

26
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:10,700
producers to feed their livestock a

27
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:12,860
needed boost in nutrients other than

28
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:15,260
wind chills and low temperatures deep

29
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:18,250
snow conditions may require livestock

30
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,630
producers to feed hay to their animals

31
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:23,200
supplementing rangeland grasses with bed

32
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,400
forages is a common practice in Wyoming
