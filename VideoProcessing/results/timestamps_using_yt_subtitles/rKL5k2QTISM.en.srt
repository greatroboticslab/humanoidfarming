00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:13,660
hello my name is Hakeem doberman I'm the

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,040
deputy director-general for research of

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,590
the international rice research

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,470
institute or URI and the gentlemen

5
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:24,430
besides me here is Lee while is the head

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:26,770
of our experimental station and what we

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:29,560
want to do with you in the next few

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,669
months is actually learn how to grow a

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,640
crop of rice

10
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:36,100
not just any crop of rice we want to do

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,800
it in the best possible manner we can

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:41,920
think of now we are scientists so we do

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,989
a lot of research we believe that we

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,210
know a lot about rice and how to grow it

15
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:48,399
in different part of the world and we

16
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,280
have lots of recommendations for farmers

17
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,620
and extension workers we often call them

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,019
best management practices you can find

19
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:58,420
them on the internet and all rights

20
00:00:56,019 --> 00:01:02,199
knowledge bank in extension but there's

21
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:04,930
in books and scientific papers but what

22
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:08,590
we really really want to do is try to

23
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:11,290
practice what we preach because often we

24
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:14,229
scientists may come up with things that

25
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:16,240
you know don't really work in practice

26
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:19,390
or sometimes you wonder why aren't

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,130
people using them so that's why Lee and

28
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,470
I have decided well why don't we do it

29
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,329
ourselves as much as we can do ourselves

30
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,710
because some of the things we may not be

31
00:01:25,329 --> 00:01:29,619
really qualified to do but we'll try

32
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,479
okay we will we will be qualified not

33
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:34,149
only what qualifies you to grow the

34
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:37,750
scope of rice yes well I'm something of

35
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:40,360
a fraud myself I am a rice farmer in

36
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,710
Australia but juda dry conditions and an

37
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,079
absence from Australia for the last

38
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:46,960
three years I have a stood my rice crop

39
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,090
last rice crop six years ago six years

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,280
ago now I'm a little rusty as well and

41
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,890
you have not really done this in a

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,500
setting like this one here in the humid

43
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:59,950
tropics with small field and wet

44
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,570
environment exactly right I'm out of my

45
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:03,219
comfort zone I suspect you're out of

46
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:05,920
your comfort zone so that's a good place

47
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:07,570
well I've done research on this for 20

48
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,039
years but really you know have

49
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,440
I have already done all these things

50
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,630
together in a larger field probably not

51
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,850
you know I have other people or had

52
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,350
other people to do it for me

53
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:19,360
but you know that's probably not the

54
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:22,510
right thing to do so come and join us

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,640
come back with us pretty much every week

56
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:28,510
in the coming months and learn with us

57
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,730
what what we do will also not be shy at

58
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,530
all to show you what we might screw up

59
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:34,840
I'm sure we're going to mess up a few

60
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,530
things you know but that's it we want to

61
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,570
learn and we want to make sure that the

62
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,150
things that we recommend the farmers

63
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:45,280
coming out of our research actually work

64
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:47,080
so we'll see where we are four months

65
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,860
from now in terms of what crop we have

66
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,450
grown what its yield has been we are we

67
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,130
are setting a high yield target

68
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:56,739
we're not embarrassed to say that yeah

69
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:59,590
what's the target well normally we would

70
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:01,060
say with best management practices you

71
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:05,680
would like to shoot for a yield of about

72
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:07,989
80% of yield potential new potential

73
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,480
here is for any good dry season it's

74
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:13,390
between nine and ten tonnes nowadays so

75
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,959
our goal should be probably let's say a

76
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:19,780
seventh on crop that sounds whether we

77
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,240
achieve it we don't know but we'll be no

78
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:24,870
more than four months from now

79
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,870
thank you
