  "text": "hey guys little project today is uh i gotta get this uh plow set up because i gotta go plow the barbecue parking lot out anyway i bought one of those weld on plates for a quick hitch and i welded it onto a plow blade i had bought at an auction and this is it right here there's the work master and here's the plow i set up it's welded there welded down there i use a piece of box steel so i got to put the angle cylinders on that's my next thing all right we're getting parts all right i got pins i hope these pins work all right so i got the thing hooked up now i'm going to try to do a little plowing i finally got it pinned in i had to go bang into that snow bank over there to get it so the pins would work so let's go do a little plowing i think i got angle now look at that oh it went all the way that way now it's not going back oh i gotta switch to the other handle in case i want to put like a rotary mower on it has to dump all the way back to the sump on the tractor know why that thing won't go in there all right guys i got pressure on it well best way to do that is to turn the tractor off turn the tractor off cycle this hopefully i'll drop the pressure down and i can get this to plug in yep there we go that works every time boy i got my hands oiled up that new holland hydraulic oil is good for my complexion okay back out see what happens i went one way and it didn't go to the other well that don't make any sense maybe it's not what i thought it was [Music] because it's stuck always some go bang into a snow pile now let's see what it does seems like out of work well let's go plowing so oh that works wow i wonder why it doesn't float more wow actually works pretty good all right i'm gonna go over plow the parking lot see how that works oh know i gotta get used to this thing i don't know why float doesn't work so well i'm gonna keep dumping i gotta keep picking the bucket up wow that was the best push so far this stuff's gonna freeze up sell as a rock oh the winds are blowing i might want to put gloves on ah yeah the wind though it's gotta be 30 mile an hour winds that's awesome [Music] do [Music] [Music] oh gotta get my battery charging [Music] well let's get back on the tractor and see what's going on i hope this mic's working i don't know if it is or not i think i kind of like this thing it seems to be working okay once i get the angle i got to set the angle of the uh the bucket tilt the tilt's got to be right or it doesn't doesn't seem to want to work good also it works better with the blade straighter it doesn't dig in as much so that's kind of good to know weather's a little icky out today all right let's see if we can get this plowed out nice [Music] wow i like having this on a boom i could i could pick it up and just shove stuff way back that again give that another sweep i think we're gonna get more snowing i'm gonna have to plow again before we open on thursday we'll see what happens ah scraped up a little grass nothing too bad be really nice if the sun came out melted this stuff almost kept hitting the wrong lever all right we're gonna get close to the building what i like about this work master i got the uh forward reverse shuttle and a regular standard shift everybody wants hydrostatic hydrostatic sucks down more power and honestly this reverse shuttle is the shift on the fly back and forth you can almost if you're not going too fast you can shift it without clutching i don't know how they work it but it works all righty where am i going now yeah i gotta finish this out [Music] [Music] oh [Music] do [Applause] [Music] all right i think i got her good enough anyway yeah the only weird thing is depending on where the angle is i gotta i gotta roll the bucket back or forth got to be careful getting in the barn i don't want to crash into anything tight squeeze all right and we're back let's see if our welds held up i think they did ah nothing seems broke but i don't have to do something with these hoses this one's ripping way down there ah i don't know get it like this i'm probably just gonna oh you guys trying to attach them there or something i don't know but looks like i got them plenty long enough all right well that looks like about a wrap for right now so just a little video doing some plowing uh if you like my videos like and subscribe and share that'll be great trying to build up a little channel here so uh go ahead and hit that subscribe button and that's always good for the algorithm it's so mysterious an algorithmic",
