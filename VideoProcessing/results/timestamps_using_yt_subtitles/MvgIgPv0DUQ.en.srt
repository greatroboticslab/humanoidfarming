1
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:19,160
Monsoon is not only one of the most

2
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,519
challenging problems in atmospheric

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:24,160
science it is also a very important

4
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:28,000
subject to study because of the very

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,519
large impacts it has on the economy and

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,759
the food grain production agriculture of

7
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:34,399
the monsoonal regions of the world so

8
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,840
today I'm going to talk about Indian

9
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,760
Summer monsoon GDP and

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,239
agriculture in

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,840
fact couple of years back the the

12
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,640
opening remarks by our then Finance

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,719
Minister pranam mukarji in the budget

14
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:55,399
speech to the Indian Parliament said I

15
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,719
seek the blessings of Lord Indra to

16
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,320
bestow on us timely and bountiful

17
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,879
monsoons so this is how important the

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,400
monsoons to the Finance Minister of

19
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,600
India

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,479
and in fact what was pranab MJ's concern

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,920
it was about the year-to-year variation

22
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,920
of the monsoon interannual variation of

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,759
the

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:19,400
monsoon on the all India scale that is

25
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:22,439
to say Indian Summer monsoon rainfall

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,040
what we used to call ismr and whether it

27
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,880
will be a drought whether it will be an

28
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,280
excess monsoon season or what now this

29
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:33,920
is a figure which shows how the ismr or

30
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,640
the Indian Summer monsoon rainfall has

31
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,520
varied from the time data are available

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,240
1876 to now and as I have mentioned

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,479
before the standard deviation the mean

34
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,079
is about

35
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,240
85.4 the standard deviation the mean is

36
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,759
given

37
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,680
here sorry the standard deviation is

38
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,320
about 10% of the mean and because it's

39
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,360
about 10% of the mean we Define a

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,960
drought

41
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:07,560
as a season in which the deficit is

42
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,440
larger than 10% or the ismr anomaly is

43
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,680
negative and magnitude larger than 10%

44
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,400
when the ismr anomaly is positive and

45
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,360
magnitude larger than 10% we call it an

46
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,480
excess Monsoon year okay it can also be

47
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,200
defined by Anomaly normalized by

48
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,000
standard deviation ismr Anomaly by

49
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,120
normalized by standard deviation to be

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,360
less than minus one for droughts and

51
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,519
greater than one for excess Monsoon

52
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,959
seasons

53
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:37,000
now as far as the impact of the monsoon

54
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,599
on uh economy is concerned we often read

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,680
about it in the

56
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:43,760
newspapers although uh we could not find

57
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,280
a single systematic study before the one

58
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,400
I'm going to present today uh to give

59
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,200
quantitative assessment of the impact so

60
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,080
for example the impact of monsoon 2002

61
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,120
was felt of course in

62
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,360
2003 and there is a headline in Hindu

63
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,200
which says drought conditions curtail

64
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,599
economic growth okay that it is now

65
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,560
likely to go grow only at 4.4% as

66
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,799
opposed to last year's growth of 5.5%

67
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,280
because of the drought as you

68
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:19,000
know 2002 was a major drought this is

69
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,840
2002 a very major drought and it had

70
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,760
impacts similarly another report from a

71
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:29,080
newspaper saying GDP growth slips to

72
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:31,400
2.6% in the uh third quarter so this is

73
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,439
the way we reach about the impact but it

74
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,680
is important to have a quantitative

75
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,080
assessment of the impact of the monsoon

76
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,720
for various reasons including assessment

77
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,000
of the value of forecast benefit of

78
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,920
alternative agricultural strategies Etc

79
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,920
however the system is complex with

80
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,280
several factors beside the monsoon

81
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:56,079
having a significant impact so now I

82
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:59,280
will uh talk today about an attempt of

83
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:01,400
such a at such a quantitative assessment

84
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,879
and this this is uh from a paper we

85
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,799
published called Indian Monsoon GDP and

86
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:08,079
agriculture in economic and political

87
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,640
weekly in

88
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:13,519
2006 now what are we concerned with we

89
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,280
are concerned the data basic data is on

90
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,560
variation of of course Indian Monsoon

91
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,000
rainfall which are readily available

92
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,199
from the iitm website tr. rest food

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,320
grain production data from Ministry of

94
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,160
Agriculture and GDP at Factor cost data

95
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,960
from Central statistical organizations

96
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,600
EP W

97
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:38,000
Foundation now as I said the index for

98
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,759
the Summer monsoon rainfall is all India

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,800
Summer monsoon rainfall Indian Summer

100
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,639
monsoon rainfall ismr so all India

101
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,720
average of the Summer monsoon rainfall

102
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:51,759
ismr long-term mean is 85.2 4 cm

103
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,919
standard deviation is 10% of the mean

104
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,280
and this is a plot showing the actual

105
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,240
ASMR what you saw earlier were the

106
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:01,800
anomalies from the mean and what you see

107
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,680
is that there are a lot of fluctuations

108
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,960
these are the major drought years

109
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,199
including 2002 which appears here but

110
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,240
there is no Trend okay basically the

111
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,039
mean rainfall has remained the same

112
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,160
there are epoches in which it is above

113
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,800
normal for a long time below normal for

114
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,199
a long time and so on but by and large

115
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,000
the rainfall has remained the same there

116
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,759
are no long period Trends now ASMR

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,319
anomally we Define as the difference

118
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,280
between the actual value of ismr for the

119
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,880
year and the long average so ismr

120
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,520
anomaly can be considered to be

121
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,520
representative of most parts of the

122
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,479
country only when there are droughts or

123
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,759
excess rainfall Seasons because during

124
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:43,639
normal Monsoon quite a few parts of the

125
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,560
country may have above normal

126
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:48,880
substantial part may have below normal

127
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,960
so it is only when we have droughts that

128
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,840
a very large part of the country

129
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,199
actually has deficit uh rainfall and

130
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,680
similarly only when we have excess

131
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,400
Monsoon excess ismr then we have l large

132
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,680
parts of the country having above normal

133
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:07,520
rain so now let us first see we have

134
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:11,440
already seen how ismr has behaved and by

135
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,160
and large the mean is uh remain constant

136
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,319
and there are wide fluctuations around

137
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,000
the mean now this is how GDP has behaved

138
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,840
and you can see that it has grown since

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,759
Independence in a remarkable way very

140
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,120
large growth of GDP that you have uh

141
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,360
that we have registered this is the

142
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,199
Indian economy growth now this is the

143
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,520
food grain production all India food

144
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,880
grain production of the country that has

145
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:40,319
also increased substantially from the

146
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,680
50s to now the it has the increase has

147
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:47,680
been more than by a factor of four okay

148
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,319
so from 50 to about 2010 you have

149
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,319
enormous increase in both now what is

150
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,039
the relationship between the two so up

151
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,440
there is ismr anomally and down here is

152
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,120
the same food grain production and what

153
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:05,360
you see is that large dips

154
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:07,720
in ismr in fact give rise to substantial

155
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,520
dips in the food grain production that

156
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:12,080
is what you're seeing here including

157
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,199
this one year 2002 also gave a

158
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,639
substantive dip in the food grain

159
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,520
production so fgp is the total of the

160
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,160
production over different agroclimatic

161
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:24,120
zones which will depend on Regional

162
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,280
rainfall and it's subseasonal

163
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,919
distribution only when there are large

164
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,160
deficits or excess in ismr most of the

165
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,879
country experiences anomaly of the same

166
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,919
sign that is drought or excess rain and

167
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:39,199
we expect similar anomalies for food

168
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:42,720
grain production now how do we go about

169
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:48,120
quantitatively assessing the impact of

170
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,120
monsoon on food grain production or GDP

171
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:53,000
gross so while the monsoon and the

172
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,039
factors that depend are dependent on the

173
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,800
monsoon fluctuate from year to year the

174
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,479
other factors leading to the change in

175
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,199
growth of agricultural production GDP

176
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,560
Etc vary on a much longer time scale we

177
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,840
have seen right from 50s to now there

178
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,639
has been a sustained growth of GDP so

179
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,720
this is on a time scale of decades that

180
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:17,280
it is changing food grain production has

181
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:20,240
also has this kind of a long-term Trend

182
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,280
okay so we expect deviations from this

183
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,440
long-term Trend to be related to the

184
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:28,919
impact of the monsoon of that year okay

185
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,759
however it must be noted that other

186
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:33,479
special events which have time scales of

187
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:36,279
about an year such as Wars economic

188
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:39,800
crisis Etc will also contribute to these

189
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:42,560
deviations so what we are doing uh is

190
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:46,120
quantitatively assessing if you wish the

191
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,600
impact of the events of a specific year

192
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:51,040
now a major event of a specific year is

193
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,360
the monsoon but there can be major

194
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,880
events in other years you know such as

195
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,440
Wars and crisis financial crisis and so

196
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,720
on which can also have an impact and we

197
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,440
will come to that

198
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,160
now we expect the growth rate of G GDP

199
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,680
to be proportional to the value of GDP

200
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,240
that is we expect the growth of GDP to

201
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:14,600
be exponential okay because the more GDP

202
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,040
you have the better growth you get so it

203
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:21,519
is proportional to GDP now parti who is

204
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,240
in fact to be given credit for

205
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:27,480
generating this ismr data uh at Indian

206
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:29,880
Institute of tropical meterology has

207
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,959
shown that an exponential function is

208
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,000
also a good fit for the trend of the

209
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:38,640
growth of food grain production so

210
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,560
approach is that if we fit exponential

211
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,560
curves for fgp and GDP with the growth

212
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:46,160
rate assumed to be as simple a function

213
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,600
as possible so we do not want to

214
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:52,920
complicate our life we can we will

215
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:55,519
actually fix um we will in fact fit

216
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,680
curves which are as simple as possible

217
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,680
for the growth rate pairs of lines or

218
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,560
quadratic and so on these these curves

219
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,440
represent the scenario in the absence of

220
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,880
monsoon fluctuation now we try and

221
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,480
relate the deviations from these curves

222
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,440
to the impact of the

223
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,800
monsoon so this is the GDP and you can

224
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:18,000
already see here there are some dips

225
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,640
here that occur and these are in fact

226
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,480
the impact of the monsoon so since we

227
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,880
know that we going to fit an exponential

228
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:30,120
what we have is here is the log of GDP

229
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,920
and log of GDP versus ear and that means

230
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,120
we can fit straight line This is a line

231
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:39,399
with a certain

232
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:41,959
slope and then we find that after 1980s

233
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:45,240
we have to fit another line with a much

234
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:48,760
sharper slope that is to say the rate at

235
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:51,680
which GDP grew exponential rate is in

236
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:55,120
fact somewhat smaller up to 80 than it

237
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:58,200
is beyond 80 and this is because of

238
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,079
the impact of the economic reforms since

239
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,200
the 80s now had we continued along the

240
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:05,519
same path we would have gone along the

241
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,320
green curve and would not have reached

242
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,720
as high as GDP as we have seen so what

243
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,720
are the best fits for GDP Now log gdpi

244
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:17,560
this is just the

245
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:20,680
uh the growth rate here and it is about

246
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:24,839
3.5% per year up to

247
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:30,279
1950 and Beyond 1950 it has increased to

248
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:32,160
5.5% per year Okay so this is the actual

249
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:34,639
GDP what we saw in the earlier figure

250
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,040
was the log GDP and you can see it is

251
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:40,720
growing exponentially it would have come

252
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,760
only up to here had we uh continued

253
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,680
along the same path but since the 80s

254
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,279
the growth rate has picked up and we

255
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:51,959
have gone on a much steeper slope here

256
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,959
okay are the empirically determined

257
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:56,959
Trends consistent with what is known

258
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,839
while the GDP has increased at the rate

259
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:03,839
of about 3.5% during 51 to 80 since the

260
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:08,800
80s it has increased more rapidly at the

261
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:12,440
rate of 5.5% okay now this 3.5% was

262
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,800
known as the Hindu rate of growth of GDP

263
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,959
and only with the start of

264
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:19,160
liberalization in

265
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:20,959
1980 we have had a higher growth rate

266
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,440
and this has been documented in

267
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,600
literature so what we have found by

268
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,079
fitting the curves is consistent with

269
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:29,800
what is known this is from a book end of

270
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:32,880
poverty by saxs Jeffrey SA

271
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,480
and he has a picture of the GDP of India

272
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,480
and you can see this is British Raj

273
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,120
Colonial Ila we the GDP didn't grow at

274
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,320
all because we were being exploited and

275
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,480
now then there is one rate here and

276
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,120
another rate here so what we have found

277
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,399
is very consistent with what other

278
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,639
people have also found now we look at

279
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:56,199
the food grain production again we fit

280
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,360
curves but this time what has happened

281
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:01,600
is while the GDP grew faster

282
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,760
than the earlier one the food grain

283
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,040
production the growth rate has actually

284
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,720
dipped since the '90s so had we

285
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,839
continued we would have been much better

286
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:14,600
off but actually there has been a dip in

287
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:18,959
the thing so what are the trends from 51

288
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:21,360
to 94 it has grown about 2.7% a year and

289
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,839
notice that the growth is right from 51

290
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:28,279
even from before the Green Revolution of

291
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:30,160
the' 70s and this is because a large uh

292
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:32,519
investment was made by the free

293
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,480
government after the end of the colonial

294
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,240
rule in many things which promoted

295
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,720
growth of food grain production such as

296
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:43,040
irrigation making fertilizers available

297
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:47,320
and so on and so forth okay now from 94

298
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,959
to 2004 actually the FR rate of growth

299
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:53,160
of food has dipped very much to less

300
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:55,279
than 1% this is very very worrying and

301
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:59,040
you see it here in actual food grain

302
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:02,360
production that you have this kind of a

303
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:06,720
flat you know very slow growth rate in

304
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:10,320
this period as opposed to what you had

305
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:14,440
earlier so the growth rate of

306
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,720
fgp has uh the fgp has increased

307
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,120
steadily at about

308
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,800
2.7% from the early '90s consistent with

309
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,720
the analysis up to the early '90s so

310
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:29,040
this is consistent with the analysis of

311
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,920
Kurosaki who also showed this now now

312
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,720
the growth rate has decreased to less

313
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:35,800
than 1% in the last decade because of

314
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,480
the unsustainable strategies leading to

315
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:42,040
a decrease in growth rates of irrigated

316
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,320
land see irrigated land quite a bit of

317
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,639
it has fallen out of cultivation due to

318
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,279
salinity water logging Etc and decrease

319
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:52,440
of growth rate of yield because of the

320
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:55,000
steady decrease of fertility that is

321
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,720
nutrient availability of the land due to

322
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,120
intensive agriculture in the previous

323
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,880
three decades change in cropping

324
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,000
patterns leading to decrease in area

325
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,880
under cultivation so because of all this

326
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,839
the growth rate has decreased and it is

327
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,040
a reflection of what has happened the

328
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,720
world over even if you look at the world

329
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,000
food production then you find that there

330
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:18,240
is a fatigue of the Green Revolution

331
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,440
this is the very fast growth rate that

332
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,800
was achieved during the Green Revolution

333
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:25,399
now there is a fatigue and we are also

334
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,120
experiencing it so what are we saying

335
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:30,639
now there are long-term trends which are

336
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,279
exponential IAL and there are also local

337
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,560
growth rates this is what most

338
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:36,399
economists report on this is what we

339
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,560
hear on

340
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,360
the radio or TV and this is what we see

341
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:45,399
in the newspapers the GDP rate coming

342
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,680
down from 5.5 to 4.4 that was in the

343
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:49,639
newspaper cutting that I showed earlier

344
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,199
refer to this growth which is called

345
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:55,720
local growth so this local growth rate

346
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:58,160
is simply how much the GDP changed from

347
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:00,839
last year to this one normalized by last

348
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,000
year's G GDP multiplied by 100 and

349
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:06,560
similarly we can have a local change of

350
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,839
fgp also so when it is negative it means

351
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,519
that GDP has decreased when it is

352
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:14,000
positive it means GDP has increased from

353
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,959
last year to this year so this local

354
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,160
rate looks like

355
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:22,000
this and this is fgp and this is GDP

356
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:24,519
basically it fluctuates a great deal

357
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,920
okay now this is the GDP that we had

358
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,759
seen in and this is the fitted curve and

359
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,800
now what we looking at his deviation

360
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,360
from the fitted curve you can see it is

361
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,600
higher than the fitted curve here and

362
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,160
lower than the fitted curve here and

363
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,480
here and so

364
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:43,440
on now this is the fgp and here the

365
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,839
deviations are more

366
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,800
spectacular okay so now how do we assess

367
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:51,560
the impact on the monsoon for each year

368
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,519
the difference between the GDP and the

369
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,880
fitted curve representing the long-term

370
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,800
trend of GDP is defined as the deviation

371
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:04,560
in the GDP so what do we say GDP

372
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,560
deviation is the GDP of that

373
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:10,799
year let's go back here for example we

374
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,039
take this point here so it's the GDP of

375
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,720
this year minus the fitted curve which

376
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,959
is the red one so the GDP deviation is

377
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,880
positive for this and it is actually

378
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:24,319
negative for the next Point here okay so

379
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,520
that is what how we Define it we say GDP

380
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:30,039
deviation in an year is the GDP of that

381
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:33,480
year minus GDP fitted at that year and

382
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:35,799
similarly fgp deviation is defined as

383
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,200
the value minus the fitted value now

384
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:41,559
since the fitted GDP varies considerably

385
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,799
over the 50-year period the expected GDP

386
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:46,799
from the fitted curve that is GDP F year

387
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,120
is used to normalize the deviation each

388
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:52,280
year and express it as a percentage of

389
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,600
GDP so this is a minor point we have to

390
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,000
normalize it to express it as a

391
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,960
percentage so deviation is expressed as

392
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,559
a percentage use using the fitted curve

393
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:06,039
and same thing with fgp but for ismr

394
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:08,360
there are no trends at all so ismr

395
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:11,760
anomally is simply defined as the ismr

396
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:14,640
of that year minus average ismr and it

397
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,080
is normalized by the average ismr itself

398
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,600
we don't have to worry about special

399
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,360
fited values in this

400
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:24,919
case now we expect the observed

401
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,960
deviations of GDP and fgp for a specific

402
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:30,440
year which we have just defined to be

403
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,919
related Ed to the important events in

404
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:36,200
that year particularly the monsoon

405
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:39,080
rainfall that is to say the ismr anomaly

406
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,360
of that year so what are we saying we

407
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,559
expect the extent to which the actual

408
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,400
fgp of that year food grain production

409
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,320
of that year differs from the fitted

410
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,600
curve which is the expected food grain

411
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:55,600
production given the long period Trend

412
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:57,960
or how much the GDP of that year differs

413
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,760
from the expected GDP which is obtained

414
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,400
from that curve that we had of whatever

415
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:06,360
it was 5.5% growth or

416
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:08,440
whatever so we expect these deviations

417
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:10,720
to be related to events in that year and

418
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,720
particularly the ismr

419
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,760
anomaly however the deviation of GDP

420
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:18,400
from the fitted curve we found depends

421
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,039
not only on the events such as the

422
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,320
deficit Monsoon of that year but also on

423
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,919
the deviation of the previous year this

424
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,480
is what made the uh computation a little

425
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,520
more complicated we could not simply

426
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,559
call deviation of GDP as the impact of

427
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,600
the events of that year and to show what

428
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,679
the problem is consider the deviations

429
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:43,960
of GDP as well as the local growth rate

430
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,440
GDP GR in the period 84 to 96 and that

431
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,280
is what is shown

432
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,520
here now this is the local growth rate

433
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,799
so this just relates to this year minus

434
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:56,960
previous year kind of thing and what you

435
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:59,919
find is that after the drought of 87 the

436
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,080
growth rate was positive in 88 the local

437
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:06,600
growth rate and so on and so forth

438
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,360
notice that there was a huge dip in 91

439
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,400
and we will see later this dip had

440
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,840
nothing to do with the monsoon this had

441
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,320
to do with the financial crisis so this

442
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,640
is the GDP dip due to the financial

443
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:22,280
crisis which occurred in 91 and notice

444
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:25,240
that after that in fact the GDP has been

445
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:27,559
increasing steadily from year to year

446
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,799
okay there is no negative growth but in

447
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:32,159
spite of that that when we look at the

448
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:36,039
actual GDP Visa with the expected long

449
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:39,000
period Trend then we find that this dip

450
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:41,679
that occurred in 91 could not be made up

451
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,159
till 5 years later so the curve remained

452
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,320
below the fitted curve for several years

453
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,880
because of this particular dip that

454
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,960
occurred in 91 so we cannot simply

455
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,880
blindly now relate this deviation from

456
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:58,360
the fitted curve to impact of that year

457
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,840
see subsequent to the major dip in 19

458
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,320
1991 probably in association with the

459
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,760
balance of payment crisis although the

460
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:08,600
growth rate GDP gr this is the local

461
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,360
growth rate now increased to almost

462
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,120
equal the long-term growth rate of 5.5%

463
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,760
in

464
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,760
1992 increase further in

465
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:21,360
1993 and was substantially higher in

466
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:24,039
1994 the deviation remains negative for

467
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,760
9293 and

468
00:21:24,039 --> 00:21:30,520
94 thus even in

469
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,799
1994 which was a SE excess which was a

470
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,600
season with excess Monsoon rainfall and

471
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,919
which is considered to be a high point

472
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:41,039
of growth per anom in the period after

473
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,919
1980 the GDP deviation is negative

474
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:47,320
clearly Dev GDP reflects sustained

475
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,440
impact of the LGE DP in 91 and cannot be

476
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:53,200
considered to be the effect only of that

477
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,919
year so what do we do we actually assume

478
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,720
that in the absence of variation of the

479
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:01,200
monsoon GDP would increase at the rate

480
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,400
as per the fitted curves hence in a

481
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,039
scenario in which there is no impact of

482
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,240
the fluctuations of the monsoon the GDP

483
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:10,559
in any year would be related to the GDP

484
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,000
in the previous year simply by the

485
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:17,799
equation that

486
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:21,799
uh GDP of that year is equal to GDP year

487
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:24,360
minus 1 into 1 + m where M will have

488
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:29,360
different values for this period 51 to

489
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:33,120
80 and 81 to 2003 okay

490
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,520
so we are saying it is growing with the

491
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,480
uh given rate now impact of the monsoon

492
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,960
and the GDP of a specific year will then

493
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,720
be the difference between GDP and GDP

494
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:48,200
zero see left to itself GDP would grow

495
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,360
at the rate M now if it did not grow at

496
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,799
the rate M it would be something

497
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,400
different from GDP Z and the difference

498
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,480
between GDP and GDP zero will be the

499
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,760
impact of monsoon or any other event of

500
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:02,279
that year now it can be shown that the

501
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,039
impact so defined when normalized by GDP

502
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:06,919
F of that year which is what we had done

503
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,240
is given in terms of the normalized

504
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:13,159
anomal as impact of GDP will be

505
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,039
deviation of GDP year minus deviation of

506
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:18,039
GDP year minus one this can be shown

507
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:20,360
it's a matter of doing the

508
00:23:18,039 --> 00:23:22,440
algebra now impact of the monsoon

509
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:25,240
rainfall and other events in a specific

510
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,120
year on the fgp does not appear to be

511
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,960
sustained for longer than a year so

512
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,760
unlike GDP we don't have to worry too

513
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,279
much about fgp and the fgp deviations

514
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,520
for successive years are poorly

515
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:37,480
correlated correlation between them is

516
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:42,440
only minus

517
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:45,159
0.05 okay thus we expect the fgp

518
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:47,600
deviation for any year to be a measure

519
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,799
of the impact of the monsoon rainfall of

520
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,799
that

521
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:58,000
year okay now here is the final plot

522
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,799
that came out from this and what you see

523
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,440
here is the impact on

524
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:07,159
GDP and uh on the y axis and the

525
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,200
percentage departure of ismr this is the

526
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:12,760
monsoon rainfall on the

527
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:16,200
x-axis um now what you see is this is

528
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:19,039
the zero line on the x-axis so all these

529
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:22,120
years there has been deficit Monsoon and

530
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:24,600
Beyond minus 10 there are all droughts

531
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,600
and they are marked with red dots here

532
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:29,240
okay

533
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,159
now this this is all positive this means

534
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,880
Monsoon rainfall has been above normal

535
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:36,200
for the country as a whole and if when

536
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:39,039
it is more than 10 the ismr normally

537
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:43,360
more than 10% then you have all these

538
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:46,320
excess Monsoon Seasons here okay now

539
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:49,000
what is the impact like first thing that

540
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,600
strikes you is that the if you wanted to

541
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,880
fit a curve of the Impact versus Monsoon

542
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,799
it's a highly nonlinear curve you see as

543
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,640
the deficit increases it dips very f

544
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:03,279
fast in other words when you have large

545
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,760
severe droughts we get a very very large

546
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:10,360
impact and you

547
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:13,399
know it doesn't matter when it is even

548
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,919
2002 which is after so much progress and

549
00:25:13,399 --> 00:25:18,480
as I will show later uh you know the

550
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,919
contribution of Agriculture to GDP has

551
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,640
decreased from around 50% towards the

552
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:28,640
beginning of this period in 1950 to less

553
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,679
than 20% now and so would have thought

554
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,000
that the economy would become drought

555
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:36,480
proof but this is this shows a point to

556
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:38,440
the contrary that even in 2002 when

557
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,480
agriculture did not contribute so much

558
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,960
to the economy still a drought had an

559
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,279
impact of more than 2% which is a huge

560
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:50,600
impact so all the droughts have impact

561
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:53,640
between roughly between 2 to 5% and in

562
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:57,200
this part the more the deficit the more

563
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,320
the impact you know the impact increases

564
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,919
rapidly

565
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:04,880
with the uh magnitude of the deficit in

566
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:08,440
Monsoon rainfall but on this side it

567
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:12,640
hardly increases so we have a very large

568
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:15,760
impact due to negative uh anomalies of

569
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:18,679
ismr we have a bad impact in other words

570
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:22,880
dipping of GDP or

571
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:25,919
negative GDP uh GDP impact associated

572
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,320
with negative ismr anomalies but the

573
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,399
positive GDP impact associated with

574
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,240
positive anomalies is not at all

575
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:35,679
commensurate with the negative impact so

576
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,720
this is a highly nonlinear thing and

577
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:40,600
this was most unexpected so what we see

578
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,080
is that in

579
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:48,399
fact the negative impact of uh deficit

580
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:52,640
Monsoon is much larger than the positive

581
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:55,559
impact of above normal Monsoon with the

582
00:26:52,640 --> 00:27:00,320
same magnitude of the ismr anomaly and

583
00:26:55,559 --> 00:27:03,799
for fgp the story is exactly the same

584
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,480
again highly nonlinear we get a huge

585
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:09,399
suppression depression in fgp when we

586
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,760
have droughts but we don't have any like

587
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:14,760
the increase when we have good rainfall

588
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:17,679
so the same story

589
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:20,039
again now before I go to the impact of

590
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,159
the monsoon which I'm going to dwell on

591
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:25,640
of course we have to remember that there

592
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:28,440
are other events which also have an

593
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:31,200
impact we talked of the event of

594
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,200
1991 and what has happened

595
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:38,840
is we can see here

596
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:44,120
now let us see the impact of

597
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:47,120
1991 and you see it here see this is 91

598
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,760
so that it was not a very large deficit

599
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,919
Monsoon as you can see most of the

600
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:56,519
points for this uh kind of a monsoon are

601
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,159
around here but we got a very very large

602
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,519
dip in GDP

603
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,519
because it was

604
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:08,039
a because of other reasons other than

605
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:11,279
the monsoon so the adverse impact of the

606
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:13,039
deficit monsoon in 1991 is much larger

607
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,480
than that expected from the

608
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,039
corresponding ismr anomaly although the

609
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:22,279
impact on the fgp was near the expected

610
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:24,760
level so in fact impact from fgp is

611
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:26,679
exactly near the expected level you see

612
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,960
so what happened is because the monsoon

613
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:32,840
was not that much in deficit the impact

614
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:34,919
on food grain production was not very

615
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,960
high okay in magnitude it was

616
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:44,240
commensurate with what we expect

617
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:47,360
but but the impact on uh GDP was very

618
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:51,559
large I mean it was larger than many

619
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,559
many droughts that we have

620
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,960
seen so clearly a part of the value of

621
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,039
minus 5% for the

622
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:04,720
impact on GDP at 91 must be a result of

623
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:09,279
the balance of payment crisis similarly

624
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:12,640
while I fgp that is to say impact on fgp

625
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:15,240
of droughts of 65 and 66 is comparable

626
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,240
adverse impact of 65 on GDP is much

627
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,840
larger probably because of the war with

628
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:26,880
Pakistan so let us just see here 65 and

629
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:29,159
66 the impact see 65 and 66 this is the

630
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,120
impact on food grain production and you

631
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:34,000
know the anomaly is close to minus 15%

632
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:37,880
and impact of food grain production is

633
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:43,399
very very similar for 65 and 66 but if

634
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:46,279
you see here on GDP 65 is a point which

635
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:48,880
comes way below the expected Year and

636
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:52,880
that is probably this extra is because

637
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,880
of the war with Pakistan that we

638
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:59,760
had okay now in 71 the year of the

639
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:01,799
Bangladesh for if GP is positive and

640
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:06,880
near the expected value for the positive

641
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:09,960
is normally but the IG DP is large than

642
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:16,200
negative so uh let us see if we can find

643
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:20,159
this 71 here and uh here it is see 71

644
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:24,240
actually has an ismr anomaly of 5%

645
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:28,720
positive and for that year we have uh

646
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:31,640
impact on fgp is exactly on the Curve

647
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,600
but if you look at 71 you see impact on

648
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:37,519
GDP is almost minus 4% so big impact

649
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,840
again and this has to do with the

650
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:43,279
Bangladesh War but by and large you know

651
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:46,919
there are only few years where you see

652
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:48,840
that the impact is uh not of the monsoon

653
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:53,519
but some other events probably some

654
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,880
other events okay so values of igdp

655
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,320
which are very different from those

656
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,279
expected from value of ASMR anomal

657
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:02,039
associated with incidents such as Wars

658
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,600
or economic crisis not related with the

659
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:08,200
monsoon but now we don't worry about

660
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:11,960
that now we look at most of the years

661
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:14,639
for which actually we can uh understand

662
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,600
the impact understand the deviations in

663
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:20,080
fgp and GDP in terms of impact of the

664
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:23,120
monsoon itself now what are the best fit

665
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,360
curves for these that you saw now we are

666
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:27,720
talking about the best fit curves like

667
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,000
this one this is the dashine which is

668
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:34,679
the best fit curve

669
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,679
here this one and

670
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:45,840
uh the equations for those best fit

671
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:49,039
curves are uh that you have uh 4518

672
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:51,480
anomal ismr minus this Square you can

673
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,720
see how nonlinear it is it is a

674
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,960
quadratic form you're getting here and

675
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,559
similarly you have a best fit curve for

676
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:02,279
the impact of GDP as well so from these

677
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:05,279
best fit curves we can get a first

678
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:09,200
assessment of how much is the impact of

679
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:13,120
the monsoon on GDP or fgp and impact on

680
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:17,440
GDP is16 times the ismr anomaly impact

681
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:20,519
on fgp is 45 times the ismr anomaly that

682
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:25,760
is to say a moderate drought 15% deficit

683
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:28,440
has an impact of 2.4% on GDP and 6.75%

684
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,880
on fgp that is is to say if the impact

685
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:33,519
were according to those fitted lines

686
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,200
which I just show you and already you

687
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:39,720
can see that for ismr anomaly of the

688
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:44,320
same magnitude a negative anomaly will

689
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,320
have much larger impact than a positive

690
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:52,840
anomaly and we will see that so the

691
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,480
impact of the monsoon and fgp and GDP is

692
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:58,200
highly nonlinear with the magnitude of

693
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,120
the impact of a negative is anomaly

694
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,159
being larger than that of a positive

695
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:06,039
ismr anomaly of the same magnitude so

696
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,960
even if the all India Monsoon rainfall

697
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:11,039
does not vary over long period the

698
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,360
impact of deficit rainfall years will

699
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:15,720
never be made up by impact of normal or

700
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,080
good Monsoon years now this is a very

701
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:20,080
worrisome thing because this means that

702
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,720
the integral effect of the impact of the

703
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,159
monsoon will be to decrease the food

704
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,519
grain production over the years simply

705
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,399
because impact of negative anomalies are

706
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:32,080
never made up by impact of positive

707
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:34,840
anomali furthermore this

708
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:37,519
asymmetry in the impact of the monsoon

709
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:41,039
and fgp increased sharply in the last

710
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:42,679
three decades whereas in the earlier era

711
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,559
the magnitude of the impacts of a

712
00:33:42,679 --> 00:33:48,399
drought and a surplus of fgp were

713
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:50,679
comparable in magnitude after 1980 the

714
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,519
impact of surpluses has become almost

715
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:55,799
negligible now this is the same graph

716
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,760
this is in the era before 1980 where you

717
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:00,639
have some Surplus

718
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,960
but after 1980 there's hardly any

719
00:34:00,639 --> 00:34:05,039
surplus at all although you have more

720
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,359
Monsoon so if you look at this is the

721
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:13,760
period from 51 to 80 for selected and 81

722
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:18,280
to uh 2004 then impact of a 15% deficit

723
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:22,040
is- 10% in the earlier era and minus

724
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:24,760
8.65 now so roughly comparable but

725
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:27,800
positive anomaly of the same magnitude

726
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:31,560
impact earlier used to be 6% which is

727
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:34,560
comparable to 10% but now it is almost

728
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:36,480
just down to one less than 1% so now

729
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,000
you're getting hardly any positive

730
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:45,079
impact of positive anomaly so in fact

731
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:49,440
the curve of impact of igp fgp or GDP

732
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:51,119
versus Monsoon ismr is nonlinear but now

733
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,760
it is becoming more

734
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:57,240
nonlinear in the later era after 1980s

735
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:00,359
this is an observation so NE negative

736
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,880
impact of deficit on fgp is much larger

737
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:04,280
than the positive impact of above

738
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:07,079
average rainfall the asymmetry and

739
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:10,520
impact on fgp is particularly high in

740
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:13,640
the modern era why this problem we have

741
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:16,640
to address if we want sustainable

742
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:19,119
development now an asymmetry in response

743
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,640
to rainfall is not surprising in the

744
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,640
light of Li's law of the minimum which

745
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:26,079
says that the yield of a crop is

746
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,640
determined by the scarcest resource the

747
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,839
so-call limiting resource now during a

748
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,960
drought one expects that water is the

749
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:34,880
limiting resource but this need not be

750
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,560
the case in the case of normal or

751
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,280
Surplus rainfall however one can draw a

752
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,839
significant conclusion from the

753
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,560
observation that the impact of surplus

754
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:47,839
rainfall has diminished with time it is

755
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:50,319
much less after the 80s than it was

756
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:53,000
before this suggests that while in the

757
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:55,599
earlier era water was the primary

758
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,880
limiting resource in recent times other

759
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,800
factors determine the Yi Y in years of

760
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:03,359
normal or Surplus rainfall identifying

761
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,680
these factors can play a crucial role in

762
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,079
increasing these yields so we now try

763
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,760
and see what these factors could be so

764
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:12,880
look at what has changed over the period

765
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:15,280
changes in cropping patterns with large

766
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,040
tracks now under monoculture leading to

767
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,800
a high intensity of attack by pests and

768
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:23,520
diseases loss of fertility of land due

769
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,400
to intensive cultivation because of

770
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,640
these two things application of

771
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:30,079
fertilizer and pesticide is NOW

772
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:32,240
essential for getting high yields even

773
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,240
if you have good rainfall you will not

774
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,000
get high yields unless you apply

775
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,280
fertilizers to make up for the loss of

776
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,000
fertility of the soil and unless you

777
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,280
apply pesticides to keep the pest under

778
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,040
control because now pests have become

779
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:48,280
endemic in many regions so earlier you

780
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:51,000
know for example in semiarid region

781
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:53,960
where we worked near pada they used to

782
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,079
be a whole variety of crops grown a

783
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,960
large number of millets and so many

784
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,680
other s and pigeon p and so on this is

785
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,200
the rainfall weekly rainfall in that

786
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,599
region and the entire rainfall profile

787
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:11,240
used to be utilize now what they do is

788
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:15,720
use primarily grut and horse G only two

789
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:18,800
crops are now grown so there is much

790
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:23,000
less much less Variety in cropping

791
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:25,720
patterns now so now to understand why is

792
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,240
the impact nonlinear we consider the

793
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,920
variation which season rainfall of the

794
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,640
yields of some important rainfield crops

795
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:36,400
on Farmers fields and that of the same

796
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,520
varieties under the same soil climatic

797
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:43,040
conditions at agricultural research

798
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:45,760
station so we are comparing the yields

799
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,920
in the same agroclimatic region for the

800
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,960
same variety of the crop but grown by

801
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,560
the farmer on the one hand and at the

802
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,680
agricultural resource station on the

803
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,280
other the difference is what is called

804
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:00,040
the current yield Gap and this

805
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,680
difference between what is achieved in

806
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:04,040
with the current level of Technology at

807
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,880
the agricultural station and the yields

808
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:09,200
at the farmers Fields is the yield Gap

809
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,480
and actually scientists at IAT in

810
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:13,839
Hyderabad have carried out a detailed

811
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,920
analysis and this is one of the figures

812
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:20,119
from this what you see is this is the

813
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:23,160
grain yield and this is of several crops

814
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:25,760
here Millet sorghum and Maze and this is

815
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:28,119
the seasonal rainfall so seasonal

816
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,480
rainfall increases as you go this way

817
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:32,240
red dotts correspond to Farmers Fields

818
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,640
blue dots correspond to yields on the

819
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,000
research station what you see is that

820
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,119
when the rainfall is low there is not

821
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,720
too much difference between the two but

822
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,880
as rainfall increases then the yield Gap

823
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,400
widens and what is achieved at

824
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,319
agricultural stations in terms of yield

825
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:53,800
is much much higher than what the farmer

826
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:56,040
gets okay so yield Gap is very large

827
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,560
only for above rainfall years and a

828
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,280
similar result Creet people have got for

829
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,960
ground nut soyab Bean pigeon pea

830
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:04,920
chickpea so many other crops so when the

831
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,440
seasonal rainfall is low the yields at

832
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,560
agricultural stations are comparable to

833
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,079
those on the farmers Fields as the

834
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:14,119
seasonal rainfall increases the yields

835
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,800
at agricultural stations increase much

836
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:18,839
more rapidly than those at Farmers field

837
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,680
and so the yield Gap increases with

838
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:22,760
rainfall now why does this happen so

839
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,400
what is the difference in the

840
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:28,000
agricultural practices in the two uh

841
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,240
situations the major difference in the

842
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,599
management at agricultural stations and

843
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,400
Farms is in the application of

844
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:37,720
fertilizers and pesticides in the recent

845
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:40,240
decades with large tracks of land under

846
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:42,560
monoculture leading to high intensity of

847
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,200
attack by Pest and diseases and loss of

848
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,760
fertility of land due to intensive

849
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,839
cultivation it is not possible to get

850
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:51,920
high yields without application of

851
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:53,960
fertilizers and pesticides however in

852
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,160
the absence of a reliable prediction of

853
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,680
seasonal rainfall the farmers do not

854
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,040
know whether the investment in

855
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,280
fertilizers and pesticides will lead to

856
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:05,160
enhan yields that is to say it will be

857
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,240
cost effective or not the point is only

858
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,720
if the rainfall is normal or above

859
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:12,960
normal it pays to invest in fertilizers

860
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,520
or pesticides as you have seen when the

861
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,640
rainfall is low even with fertilizers

862
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,119
and pesticides agricultural research

863
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:21,760
stations were not able to get much

864
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,119
higher yields and Farmers have to pay

865
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,400
for the fertilizers and pesticides so

866
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:29,119
they have to calculate what is the

867
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,720
enhancement in yield that they would get

868
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,119
by the additional expenditure on

869
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,880
fertilizers and pesticides and they do

870
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,480
not believe it is cost effective that is

871
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:43,119
to say benefit is larger than cost if

872
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,400
the rainfall is not high if it is low so

873
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,960
since they don't know whether the

874
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,400
rainfall will be low or not the farmers

875
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,960
do not invest in them although they have

876
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,400
the know how and will apply them at

877
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,599
irrigated patches on the other hand at

878
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,640
agricultural stations Farm economics is

879
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,640
irrelevant because they get all their

880
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:03,000
money from the government so liberal

881
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,760
doses of fertilizer pesticides can be

882
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,280
applied even then the yields are not

883
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,119
very much better than the farmers yields

884
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,560
in poor rainfall years in normal or good

885
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:15,040
Monsoon years the yield enhancement due

886
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:19,720
to this application is very large hence

887
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:21,599
the yield Gap is in increases with rain

888
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,440
so now what is the what are the farmers

889
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,839
doing farmers in these rainfed tracks

890
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,720
are basically not investing INF

891
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:31,680
fertilizers and

892
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:35,480
pesticides

893
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,680
now so they are adopting a strategy

894
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:41,680
which is the same strategy year after

895
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,880
year okay which is not using any

896
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,000
information that we have on rainfall

897
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:50,640
variability even if we did not have

898
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,520
prediction for a specific year say 2013

899
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,400
as to how the rain is going to be over a

900
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:58,640
region we have a lot of data 100 Years

901
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:01,520
of data and with that we should be able

902
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,359
to see what is the possibility what is

903
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,839
the probability of occurrence of low

904
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:10,560
rainfall low as defined on that yield

905
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:10,560
curve so we want to

906
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:18,000
know see the farmers are really

907
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:22,359
concerned with the case of rainfall

908
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:25,400
lower than around here because after

909
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:27,920
this then application of fertilizer and

910
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:31,720
pesticides does give substantive

911
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,640
enhancement in yields here so we want to

912
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:36,160
know what is the probability of rainfall

913
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:39,480
lower than this and that can be easily

914
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,200
calculated surely that is never 100%

915
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:45,319
even in small regions it will never

916
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,319
exceed 30% or so

917
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,800
so

918
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,240
uh

919
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:54,240
sorry I think we

920
00:42:54,440 --> 00:43:00,319
have Okay so so

921
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:03,240
now hence the farmers do not invest them

922
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:05,480
on the other hand they do huh so the

923
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,960
farmers are adopting a strategy which is

924
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:09,760
insensitive to climate variation and is

925
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:14,280
not appropriate for a majority of the

926
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:16,599
years for example ASMR deficit is large

927
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:18,920
meaning uh that you have actually

928
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:23,040
droughts if you consider the period of

929
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:27,040
58 to 2010 it is large only for 25% of

930
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:30,520
the years so on 75% of the year Farmers

931
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:33,200
could have actually gained so if you

932
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:36,839
think of a long-term average by applying

933
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:39,359
pesticides or and fertilizer they can

934
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:41,520
gain and they can close the yield Gap

935
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:43,040
successfully but what they're doing is

936
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:46,800
adopting the strategy which is

937
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:50,319
appropriate for say 25 30% of the years

938
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:54,200
every year and that is really what is

939
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:57,680
causing this huge yield Gap and also

940
00:43:54,200 --> 00:44:01,160
that is what is leading to they're not

941
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:03,880
getting benefits of good Monsoon because

942
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:06,000
they're not giving another very

943
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,359
important input to the system

944
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,400
fertilizers and they are not controlling

945
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:14,240
pest which can have a very large impact

946
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,960
on the thing so our problem that the

947
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,760
negative impact of a deficit Monsoon is

948
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,520
much higher than the positive

949
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,599
impact which will lead on the in the

950
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:28,040
long run to a successive uh decrease in

951
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:30,280
the food Grand production if we want to

952
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:33,520
actually stop that if we want to

953
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:36,760
mitigate about that then it is essential

954
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,480
that the farmers appro adopt a strategy

955
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,200
which is appropriate to the rainfall

956
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,240
variability of the region now if in

957
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,520
particular a reliable prediction of a

958
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,839
non-occurrence of droughts is possible

959
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:52,119
then it will have a very huge impact on

960
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:56,040
agricultural production that is very

961
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:58,280
clear so if we are to maintain self

962
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,720
sufficiency in food production it is

963
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:02,359
essential that the loss of deficit Years

964
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,079
be made up in other

965
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:09,280
years now how do we do that price has to

966
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,400
be at a level at which these practices

967
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,839
of yield enhancement become economically

968
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:16,040
viable because why are farmers not

969
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:18,520
investing in it not because they don't

970
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:21,200
know they invest in it in on irrigated

971
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:23,119
passages where the yield is assured

972
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,200
they're not investing it on rainfed

973
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:29,800
patches because their estimate of

974
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:33,319
enhanced benefit due to enhanced yield

975
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:37,040
is not larger than the cost they incur

976
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:38,720
in some of the years now if the price

977
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:41,920
was hi to a

978
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:45,520
level to a higher level than the present

979
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:48,559
then obviously the enhanced benefit due

980
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,960
to enhanced yield will be larger and

981
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:53,880
that may make it economically viable for

982
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,920
them to actually invest in fertilizers

983
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:58,880
and pesticides so this is something

984
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,200
thing that we have to think about and

985
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,680
institutional mechanisms need to be set

986
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:07,240
up to allow carry over the profits of

987
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:09,520
the good years to compensate for some

988
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,440
loss in poor rainfall years now this is

989
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:14,280
where it is very difficult for marginal

990
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,599
farmers and Farmers without any Capital

991
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:19,040
to do but this is where farmers in

992
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:20,839
places like Australia are able to

993
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,319
actually tailor their strategies to

994
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:26,160
climate variability and in their case

995
00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:29,559
wheat is not irrigated like in ours and

996
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:32,040
in Australia three years large profits

997
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:34,839
can take care of seven years of

998
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,720
relatively low profits or even losses

999
00:46:34,839 --> 00:46:38,559
and this is because the farmers are able

1000
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:42,160
to carry over this so we may need to

1001
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:45,319
make up mechanisms to address

1002
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:48,119
this so a surprising result of this

1003
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:51,599
study which was a straightforward study

1004
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:55,440
of impact of monsoon on fgp and GDP made

1005
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:57,400
by fitting long period Trends and saying

1006
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,359
that the deviation of these Trends must

1007
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:02,720
be deviation from these Trends long

1008
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:05,920
period Trends must be caused by events

1009
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:08,480
of the year which include Wars which

1010
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,000
include balance of payment crisis but

1011
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:14,040
most often which incl include vagaries

1012
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:16,920
of the monsoon so by saying that the two

1013
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:19,880
should be related we assess the impact

1014
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:23,000
of the monsoon on both food grain

1015
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:25,839
production and on GDP and the most

1016
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:30,520
surprising result from here which was

1017
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:34,520
was not uh expected from the work uh

1018
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:37,200
literature on the subject was the

1019
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:40,040
enormous nonlinearity very strong

1020
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:43,480
nonlinearity or the market asymmetry in

1021
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:46,599
the response to negative versus positive

1022
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:49,119
ismr anomalies so there is a marked

1023
00:47:46,599 --> 00:47:51,480
asymmetry in the response to Monsoon

1024
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,920
variability with the magnitude of the

1025
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,880
negative impact of a drought being more

1026
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,640
than that of the positive impact of a a

1027
00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:02,400
surplus and in recent times while the

1028
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:04,559
impact of a high deficit in ismr which

1029
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,640
is 15% is

1030
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:09,160
9% that of a surplus of the same

1031
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:12,559
magnitude is less than

1032
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:14,359
1% so unless this situation changes it

1033
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,520
will not be possible to maintain the

1034
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:18,920
growth rate of food grain production at

1035
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:21,520
an adequate level for ensuring food

1036
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:24,240
security the most striking feature we

1037
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:27,520
observe is the impact of a severe

1038
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:29,839
drought on GDP remains 2 to 5%

1039
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,280
throughout despite the substantial

1040
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:36,079
decrease in the contribution of

1041
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:38,559
Agriculture to GDP over the 5D past five

1042
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:41,119
decades now this is important and we

1043
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:43,880
need to understand why that happens that

1044
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:46,839
happens because although agriculture is

1045
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:50,319
contributing less and less to GDP the

1046
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:52,880
purchasing since 60% of the population

1047
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:56,240
depends on agriculture for its living in

1048
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,799
one way or another they purchasing power

1049
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:02,000
depends on the agricultural production

1050
00:48:58,799 --> 00:49:03,720
so it has a very large impact a deficit

1051
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,440
Monsoon which has a large negative

1052
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:08,880
impact on agricultural production has a

1053
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:12,119
large impact on the purchasing power and

1054
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:14,640
hence on the GDP in fact we estimate

1055
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:16,720
that for a drought of moderate intensity

1056
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:19,359
at current levels of economy and

1057
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:22,240
production and this is an estimate made

1058
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:24,559
in 2006 when the paper was published the

1059
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:28,839
impact on GDP at current prices is

1060
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:32,359
around 50 ,000 crores so this is 10

1061
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:36,119
times one of our usual scams so it's an

1062
00:49:32,359 --> 00:49:39,400
order of magnitude larger than that and

1063
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:42,640
so the impact on GDP is 50,000 crores or

1064
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:45,040
more and an fgp deficit of around 10

1065
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:48,000
million tons in food grain production

1066
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:50,119
just let us see for comparison that the

1067
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,559
Mahatma Gandhi National rural employment

1068
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:55,520
scheme budget at that time was 40,000

1069
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:58,599
crores so this will give you an idea of

1070
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,760
of how large the impact of the monsoon

1071
00:49:58,599 --> 00:50:04,359
can be and we ought to do more than we

1072
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,920
do to be prepared for that given the

1073
00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:07,760
magnitude of the impact it's not

1074
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,160
surprising that in the wake of the

1075
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:14,000
severe drought of 2002 with ismr deficit

1076
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:17,760
of 21% the central government mobilized

1077
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,960
20,000 crores to finance relief programs

1078
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,200
including Calamity relief release of

1079
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:24,960
food grains free of cost waver of loans

1080
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:27,880
Etc in addition to such mitigatory

1081
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,079
efforts it is essential to identify and

1082
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:32,040
adopt strategies that lead to a

1083
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:34,400
substantial reduction of the impact of

1084
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:36,880
the drought it is also important to

1085
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,280
identify and adopt strategies which will

1086
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,319
enable us to reap benefits of normal and

1087
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,839
good rainfall in the majority of the

1088
00:50:41,319 --> 00:50:45,400
years which are not droughts so that at

1089
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:48,240
least a part of the impact of the

1090
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:50,799
droughts can be made

1091
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:53,160
up thank you I think this is where I'm

1092
00:50:50,799 --> 00:50:53,160
going to

1093
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,440
stop
