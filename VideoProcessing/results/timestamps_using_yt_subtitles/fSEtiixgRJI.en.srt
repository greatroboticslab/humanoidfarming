1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:05,100
regenerative agriculture is a set of

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:07,350
farming practices that increase

3
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:09,480
biodiversity in soil organic matter

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,670
currently most agricultural practices

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,650
are devastating to biodiversity even

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,450
organic agriculture while not as bad

7
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,640
still does more harm than good

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:19,350
regenerative agriculture is a way to

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,260
reverse this trend to actually make a

10
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,150
positive impact on the land so what does

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,310
regenerative agriculture actually

12
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,869
involve answering this question is

13
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,789
actually pretty tricky because the

14
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,769
practices that work best largely depend

15
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,790
on the land that's being worked with so

16
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:35,010
the variety of different practices

17
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:37,380
border on infinity a bit more than this

18
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,300
video can cover however let's look at

19
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,309
three common forms that regenerative

20
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:46,289
agriculture can take the soil is full of

21
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,780
organisms which are helpful for plants

22
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,879
some convert soil nitrogen into a plant

23
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,170
usable form some bring water to the

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,590
plants that would otherwise be out of

25
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,850
reach others loosen and aerate the soil

26
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:59,129
increasing water absorption and allowing

27
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,050
plant roots to penetrate deeper when

28
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,329
soil is turned over by a machine

29
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,890
most of these organisms are killed so

30
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,630
the crops must rely on chemical

31
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,700
fertilizer which ends up leaching into

32
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,100
the water

33
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:13,860
central to no-till farming is to not do

34
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,259
that instead of tilling plant cover

35
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,030
crops whose roots break up the soil let

36
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,220
the worms aerate the soil and bring down

37
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:21,900
nutrients keep the soil covered with an

38
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,580
organic mulch which will break down over

39
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,700
time adding more organic matter to the

40
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,700
soil

41
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,250
from the release of methane to clearing

42
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,050
forests for pasture land cattle raising

43
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,480
is known for being very environmentally

44
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:37,790
destructive but this is not inherent to

45
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,680
grazing animals if the right practices

46
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:41,000
are put in place enormous amounts of

47
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,220
carbon can be sequestered into the

48
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,020
ground soil can be built an even

49
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,390
desertification can be reversed in a

50
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,490
matter of years here's how it works

51
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:52,100
the growth of grass tends to start slow

52
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:53,930
accelerate and slow down again this

53
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,150
middle area is where it accrues the most

54
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,800
biomass that most efficiently if it's

55
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,470
eaten before it gets to this point its

56
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,850
growth will never speed up this is what

57
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:03,890
happens with traditional pastured

58
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,180
animals they eat all the grass which

59
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,740
doesn't have the chance to grow back

60
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,290
fast enough before getting eaten again

61
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,260
and we have over grazing this leads to

62
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:14,000
soil erosion drought and desertification

63
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,470
but if the animals are kept in a tightly

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,600
packed herd like they used to be in

65
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:19,880
nature the grass has time to grow before

66
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,160
being eaten all that biomass in the

67
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,380
grass is carbon that comes from the air

68
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,390
not all the grass gets eaten however

69
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,709
some of it gets pooped on and trampled

70
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,720
which ends up creating the perfect

71
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:31,820
conditions for new topsoil to be built

72
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:38,180
this ends up happening incredibly

73
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:40,100
quickly this is one of the most complex

74
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,570
and location dependent practices there

75
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,820
are I will therefore be over

76
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:45,560
generalizing a bit it always starts with

77
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,209
observing a local forest and the

78
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,280
relationships between everything in it

79
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:51,260
the plants the animals the fungi that

80
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,030
landscape the soil the water and then

81
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,890
recreating these relationships in a way

82
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,680
that's just as ecologically resilient

83
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,360
but produces more food food forests are

84
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,850
often thought of as comprising seven

85
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,489
layers the root layer the ground cover

86
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:06,769
layer the herb layer the shrub layer the

87
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:09,320
low tree layer the high tree layer and

88
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:11,209
the vine layer every one of these layers

89
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,489
either produces some sort of food or

90
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:15,620
medicine or is in some way helpful to

91
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:17,480
the system as a whole the plants are

92
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,750
mostly perennials and include as many

93
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,700
native species as possible

94
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,260
these three examples of regenerative

95
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,700
agriculture plus all the rest of them

96
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:27,740
all have something in common

97
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,720
whereas in conventional agriculture you

98
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:32,390
seek to create as many of one thing as

99
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,340
possible in regenerative agriculture you

100
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,130
seek to create as many relationships

101
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:38,990
between things as possible you are one

102
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:40,790
of those things what sort of

103
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:42,240
relationship with the land do you want

104
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:51,139
to foster

105
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:51,139
