  "text": "thank you br uh good afternoon everybody uh my name is AEL Garcia can you he me there uh I am the irrigation specialist uh as you can see here we have several uh trials uh as regarded to irrigation uh most of them are kind of high-tech but uh we are looking at two ways to provide information to our producers uh one is the applied research and the other one is a little bit more basic uh the overall objective of these projects are to study uh drought tolerance in this case for corn uh you might think that uh we know everything about drug tolerant for corn but basically what happens is that uh Wyoming has a really unique environment and uh and it's even much more unique if if we come to this part of the state so it's very dry really really very dry we haven't had rainall at all and uh we wonder what we should do as producers If eventually we don't have enough water at certain point during the growing season so we are going to try to respond to those things uh the much more practical issue is related to uh water balance we want to know how much water the crop uses for in this environment and also we would like to know what what is the water use efficiency of the Corn well how we how do we do that we do following different uh methodologies we use uh some things that are called crop simulation models to support our field research we also use what you see there are infrared thermometers what we do with those equipments are to measure the temperature of the canopy and actually when the plant is transpiring uh the plant Co off is cooler than the temperature of the air so those infrared thermometers are able to measure to determine that temperature in the canopy the information is sent every certain period of time to a station that you can see there in the middle of the experiment and Via radio the information is sent directly to our office uh this work is is uh part of the research uh of Marcelo arita he is my PhD student soell um so he's going to develop this project during four years he started just now this season this system here is a Surface treat irrigated it's a system that we installed this year and the reason uh why we are using treat irrigation for corn here is mostly because we need to know exactly the amount of water that we are applying to the crop so so by having this system we can do that very easy and uh if you need to know a little bit more about the specifics of that you should ask Marcelo he's the one that is running all the programs in his computer that just comes from time to time to his office and see whether or not everything is okay sometimes actually he corrects me and uh what else uh as uh Dr has said we have several experiments similar to this one and this is on the surface trip we have another one over there is the subsurface DP and we have a third one far away there in in the sprinkler system one of the Practical results we've gotten so far is that for example we compared uh yield of corn produced on these systems with the flooded one uh in terms of yield we got pretty much the same but the water use efficiency of this irrigation systems is really very high for the crops is very high and uh we were able to reduce the amount of water that the crop needs in more than four times I mean 25% of the water that we are using uh 25% of the water we use uh in a flooded irrigation is the one we are using here at most so as you can see the crop looks really very healthy and we are expecting this year to have even even a little bit more y than the other uh irrigation systems uh this is what I have for you in this first stop uh if you have any questions please uh feel free yes sir nit nitrogen rate I don't remember Marcel I think we app here was kind of 150 almost pounds per acre 150 pounds per acre yeah any other question have you had any trouble with these hoses clogging up with weeds well it's uh first time and this is on Surface uh I don't think we will have problems right now uh it's first year I mean from uh moss and such in the irrigation water no we don't do know it's from a well yeah it's from a well yeah yeah good for you thank you so you might just tell the other trailer what the question was excuse me what was the question oh uh the question was whether or not we have some problems with clogging emitters here due to uh WS or something like that but the water is a is a well water so it's no problem so far any other question is there any plan certainly water use efficiency is one of the budgets budgets that you're looking at what about the economics of of this system compared to Conventional uh Mike moris as asking about the economics of this as compared to Conventional uh we don't have yet of course it's first year but we plan to we plan to to look at that as well thank you sure yes sir the I think the well maybe it's uh cold than the natural water uh is there difference the well water and the natural water yes the quality uh mainly to the to the uh Co production yes well there is one thing here we don't get rainfall at all hopefully we don't we won't get today but we don't get rainall at all the corn approximately needs 400 MM the whole season divide by 25 it gives you inches uh here if you do not irrigate you don't produce actually yeah but uh the difference in water rainfall or well water is mainly the quality yeah rainfall is much better than we were the difference I mean the difference to the production oh production well no I don't know I don't know but probably there is not a huge difference yes Iration test yes but uh we shouldn't have too much difference uh the question here is whether or not there are differences in yield with uh rainfall water or well water no no R that's uh the natural water natural water yes CH water canal oh Canal water okay differen is between uh ditch water and uh yeah well water well the the main the main difference is quality still Yes quality and the the temperature of course yes temperature as well",
