  "text": "each year over 93 million tons of onions are harvested globally with the integration of Advanced Technologies the efficiency and quality of onions are ensured from Harvest through to packaging typically grown from seeds sets or transplants the cultivation process requires careful management of soil water and Pest Control to maximize yield once the onion tops fall and begin drying it signals that they're ready for harvesting mechanical onion Harvesters are impressive machines capable of uprooting cleaning and collecting onions in One Sweep across the field equipped with Digger blades these machines slice through the soil lifting onions to the surface while minimizing damage and keeping the roots intact Conveyor Systems then transport the onions gently removing excess soil and debris cleaning mechanisms like brushes and air blowers further clean the onions before placing them into large storage bins or trailers connected to the Harvester these bins hold large quantities enabling continuous operation before requiring unloading the use of such machines significantly boosts efficiency allowing Farmers to harvest large Fields quickly while reducing manual labor key to preserving onion quality and freshness by minimizing spoilage risk once harvested onions are moved to processing facilities upon arrival they are unloaded into large receiving bins before being transferred onto conveyor belts for an initial cleaning phase this phase involves removing soil debris and loose skins aided by conveyor belts designed with perforations that allow debris to fall through while onions remain on top high pressure air blowers and rotating brushes complement the cleaning process ensuring the onions are as clean as possible before further processing following the cleaning onions are sorted and graded automated machines equipped with Optical sensors categorize onions based on size shape and quality these systems detect imperfections and separate onions that don't meet quality standards this precise sorting guarantees uniformity in the final product and identifies onions suited for different processing purposes such as dehydration or frying Conveyor Systems play a crucial role in onion processing facilities ensuring efficient continuous movement from arrival to packaging automating these processes streamlines operations reduces manual labor and maintains consistent quality at every production stage this use of Technology ensures that onions move seamlessly from the field to the factory ultimately delivering high quality products to consumers worldwide AI enhanced sorting systems have revolutionized onion processing these systems use Advanced Optical scanners cameras and machine learning algorithms to sort onions accurately and quickly conveyor belts with individual compartments and precise sorting mechanisms ensure each onion follows the correct path optimizing both efficiency and product quality this integration of Agriculture and artificial intell elligence represents the future of food production where efficiency and precision are Paramount the packaging process for onions is complex involving different methods and Advanced Machinery to ensure efficiency and product quality bulk packaging uses mesh or burlap bags for wholesale while smaller consumer packages typically use mesh or plastic bags vacuum sealed bags or pre-cut onions in plastic containers provide added convenience and extended shelf life automated Machinery including bagging sealing and labeling systems streamlines packaging with conveyor belts transporting onions through each stage of the process from cleaning and sorting to final packing and distribution large facilities may even use automated guided Vehicles AGS to transport packaged onions to various areas or loading docks further enhancing operational efficiency and maintaining product quality for industrial scale onion peeling Innovative technology is essential traditional manual peeling is labor intensive and time consuming making it impractical for large scale production mechanical peelers use abrasive surfaces or rotating blades to remove onion skins minimizing damage to the layers underneath these machines are adjustable to accommodate various onion sizes and varieties ensuring consistent results some food processing facilities take onions through peeling washing and cutting processes to create convenient ready to use products this transformation caters to Consumer needs for pre-prepared onions saves time in home kitchens and ensures uniformity in cooking and flavor distribution additionally processed onions such as diced or sliced versions offer a longer shelf life through washing and vacuum sealing techniques these readyto use products are popular in the food service industry where efficiency and consistency are crucial as well as in homes for preparing soups stews sauces salads and more common products include diced onions sliced onions for cooking onion rings as appetizers and onion soup mixes for added flavor processed onion products are packaged in ways that ensure freshness and convenience while meeting Market demands common options include resealable plastic bags with Ziplock seals cardboard boxes for dehydrated onions and vacuum sealed pouches for products like frozen diced onions or onion rings automated Machinery is used to efficiently handle and package delicate products such as crispy onions using heat or ultrasonic sealing techniques to secure the packages this Machinery also takes care of labeling date coding and Quality Inspection ensuring that only top quality products reach the market Market the large scale production of onions is a highly coordinated process with Advanced Technologies integrated into every stage from harvesting to packaging mechanized Harvesters automated sorting systems and specialized packaging Machinery ensure efficient operations while delivering highquality onion products to Consumers worldwide AS Global demand for onions Rises continued Innovation is crucial to meeting Market needs sustainably [Music]",
