  "text": "The Castro's comprehensive secondary school was a buzz with excitement this past Friday as students, teachers, and officials gathered to celebrate World Home Economics Day 2025 under the theme tackling over consumption. The event hosted by the school's vocational department placed a spotlight on food security, sustainable agricultural practices, and the role of responsible consumption in public health. This year's observance took on added significance with the presence of the Ministry of Agriculture, signaling the start of a promising partnership aimed at integrating agra food systems development and education into the curriculum. Acting Deputy Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, Dr. Randall Esnard delivered a compelling address underscoring the importance of local food production and youth engagement in agriculture. This is why today's event is so important. It brings awareness of these issues and highlights solutions through education and sustainable practices. The Ministry of Agriculture is committed to ensuring that food and nutrition security and sustainable agriculture are not just national priorities but also uh accessible and practical for our citizens. We have several initiatives that have been implemented to encourage responsible food consumption and promote locally grown produce. These include the youth in agriculture uh the youth agri entrepreneurial entrepreneurship program sorry uh the year program which I'm pretty sure that some of you guys have heard about uh in one form or another which is designed to empower young persons like yourselves to explore careers in agriculture food production and agra business. The day's activities saw students participating in interactive sessions, food preparation demonstrations, and exhibitions showcasing innovative ways to reduce waste and incorporate more locally grown produce into their diets. The Ministry of Agricultures educational booth featured live demonstrations of sustainable farming techniques, composting, and the benefits of organic food production. Head of the vocational department, Priscilla Kodra, in emphasizing the importance of equipping students with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills that align with national priorities says she stands ready to partner with allied institutions and relevant authorities to help bring about a greater awareness and appreciation for the benefits of local a food offerings among her students. It's a step in the right direction. This is the kind of thing we want to be doing with our students. What we did today, educating them because they are the ones who will cater for us later and cater for themselves and we are supposed to guide them. So tackling over consumption help us help our students open their eyes. I was even surprised that even the art students some of the creations that they came up with in showing how to take care of of over consumption not just with food but how to manage the waste you know so it definitely started the students thinking you know about our future and how they are eating because look at our situation with the NCDS the non-communicable diseases diseases. These are seriously on the rise in St. Lucia and to me we need to do much more. We need to have to me weekly activities, monthly activities to address those issues. The event also tied into St. Lucia's independence theme, Duva Assam, health and well-being for a prosperous nation. Reinforcing the message that food security is integral to national development with discussions on school gardening projects and upcoming agricultural training initiatives. The foundation was laid for a continued relationship between Castra's comprehensive secondary school and the Ministry of Agriculture. From the communications unit of the Ministry of Agriculture, this is Amanda FC Clark reporting.",
