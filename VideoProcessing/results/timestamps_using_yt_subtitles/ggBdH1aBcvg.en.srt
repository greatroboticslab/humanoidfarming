1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
today we're gonna do our own solar

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,600
system we know you want your own solar

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,120
system you want that free power baby

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:09,760
we're gonna play with some 240 volt

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,240
wires and try not to shock ourselves

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,840
get some free power out of it let's go

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,040
so in front of us we have all of our

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,480
components

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,480
the big boy the 295 watt solar system

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,320
295 watt solar panel the star of the

11
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,760
show

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,080
you thought that was it this is it the

13
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,760
micro inverter this allows you to string

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,079
them all together and get the most power

15
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,760
out of each one of them hell yeah

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,280
here's your performance meter in meters

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,079
performance

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,360
ac disconnect

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,040
big turn off

20
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,440
turn on

21
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,280
this is for uh mounting the actual racks

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,360
and panels to the roof this is the wire

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,480
to connect all the micro inverters

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,160
together

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,640
run it to your system and finally

26
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,640
combiner this is where you combine your

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,640
strings

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,760
nice so here we are on the roof we're

29
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,159
getting 24 panels at 295 watts each that

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,040
works out to about 7 000 watts

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,560
getting 12 panels on this south facing

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,560
exposure

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,720
and 12 more panels

34
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,240
on this west facing explosion so right

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,520
now we're going to do some layout for

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,439
those rails

37
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,000
rails on those exposures that i

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,479
mentioned we need three feet from the

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,479
top of the ridges to the top of our

40
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:35,240
solar panels so we're going to lay that

41
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,240
out take our measurements get to work

42
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,799
so

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,319
so it's a little hard to tell but we

44
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,399
laid out our grid by doing a perimeter

45
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,680
measured everything out put in the holes

46
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,440
around the perimeter

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,080
and then we just ran our string line

48
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,000
between each point to make a little grid

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,800
and we just drill where the string lines

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,440
meet

51
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,840
and put our pieces down after that comes

52
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,840
the rails

53
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:33,770
[Applause]

54
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,920
yeah they only go on one way okay they

55
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,879
idiot roofed up man

56
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,200
on the dc right

57
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,800
so here's the actual micro inverter

58
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,920
you use one fastener in the center and

59
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,360
that slot

60
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,280
slides into the top slot of this rail

61
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,000
and doesn't even need to slide in and

62
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,000
actually drops in

63
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,519
easy

64
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,840
do you want me to hold it

65
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,560
so the full run of railing spans 20 feet

66
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,319
uh but the railing sections that we have

67
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,319
are 14 feet each

68
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,640
so we have these couplings and go

69
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,890
between them and we'll stitch on an

70
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,270
extra piece to the end

71
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:27,270
[Applause]

72
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,440
okay here's our first string runs from

73
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,879
the bottom set

74
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,879
up to the end of the top set

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,799
there's the end of it which will go to a

76
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,720
j box

77
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,200
and get ran off the roof to that

78
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,840
combiner box drinking game every time i

79
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,400
say daisy chain take a shot so a quick

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,640
difference between a traditional setup

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,120
and the micro inverter setup normally

82
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,560
you would just daisy chain each solar

83
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,560
panel to

84
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,400
every other one in the chain and then

85
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,840
you would run that

86
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,200
dc wire to an inverter with the micro

87
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,239
inverter setup

88
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,480
you run

89
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,000
a micro inverter for every single panel

90
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,480
so the dc solar panel wire then goes to

91
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,120
the micro inverter and each one of those

92
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,120
is daisy chained together uh and at that

93
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,919
point it's ac that's what the inverter

94
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,720
does

95
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,880
so

96
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,960
right now we have all of our micro

97
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,080
inverters laid out before we get panels

98
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,720
on the roof

99
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,040
we're going to daisy chain each micro

100
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,520
inverter in its respective string

101
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,960
together and run it to the end i'm

102
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,759
watching it

103
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,759
here's the start of the second string

104
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,280
this one's only half a string the other

105
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,880
half of the string

106
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,199
is on the other roof

107
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,520
so we'll run it down here

108
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,960
jbox at the end of this guy

109
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,759
then we're going to run this through

110
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,360
some conduit to match up with the other

111
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,919
half that's going up in a little bit

112
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,280
another look at these micro inverters

113
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,039
here they are this is your dc connection

114
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,960
for your solar panel

115
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,360
and this wire right here is the daisy

116
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,120
chain ac wire

117
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,720
solar panel here

118
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,400
ac there

119
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,639
to your jbox

120
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,960
to your combiner so just a quick

121
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,360
overview of the difference between your

122
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,720
central inverter versus your micro

123
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,360
inverter

124
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,479
benefits and downsides with that central

125
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,720
inverter you have to run low voltage to

126
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,880
each panel and then all the way down to

127
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,919
your inverter so there's some voltage

128
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,000
loss but the bigger disadvantage is that

129
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,560
it's kind of the idea that your chain is

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,800
only as strong as your weakest link with

131
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,240
your central inverter set up the string

132
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,639
will only do as well as the lowest panel

133
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,720
in that string so if you have one panel

134
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,039
that's in the shade that whole entire

135
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,440
string is going to suffer because of it

136
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,680
with the micro inverter setup each panel

137
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,400
has its own micro inverter and the

138
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,639
output just gets added up between them

139
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,639
if you have a roof like this one where

140
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,479
we have panels in different elevations

141
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,400
where the amount of sun that each panel

142
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,039
is getting varies quite a bit from panel

143
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,039
to panel within the same string

144
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,960
you definitely want micro inverters the

145
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,960
biggest downside of a micro inverter

146
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,800
setup is that it's more expensive you

147
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,600
have to have a micro inverter for every

148
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,319
single panel we have 24 panels on this

149
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,880
roof which means 24 micro inverters and

150
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,360
the cost certainly adds up but

151
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,120
especially for this roof the benefits

152
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,840
far outweigh the cost

153
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,160
and i wouldn't want to do a traditional

154
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,319
central inverter setup for this guy

155
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,400
we have our first six panels on the roof

156
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,960
we're gonna get those connected

157
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,639
and mounted and go from there

158
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,720
for fasteners

159
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,440
they just use these little

160
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,120
bolts with uh caps on the end of them

161
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,520
that basically just pinched down on the

162
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,520
panels

163
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,280
and a couple spacers for the end pieces

164
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,880
and while we got the dream team

165
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,160
doing panels

166
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,160
we got my dad doing layout

167
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,479
here are the end spacers and back to the

168
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,520
fasteners

169
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,520
just clip these on

170
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,039
and this is used at the start and end of

171
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,750
a run so we have our six panels on the

172
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,939
bottom

173
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,939
[Music]

174
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,919
that gives us some support on the end

175
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,800
just like that panels are on

176
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,039
okay here's our second

177
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,039
set second elevation

178
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,960
you see all the micro inverters are ran

179
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,319
and strung

180
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,919
important step so these are the ac wires

181
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,039
the daisy chain the micro inverters

182
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,800
together

183
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,120
before we hook the panels on it's

184
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,759
important to note you do want to cap off

185
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,840
this daisy chain wire because as soon as

186
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,080
the panels get some sun they're working

187
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,680
as soon as you connect those panels

188
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,400
they're sending electricity through here

189
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,840
so yeah i kept these off because they

190
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,879
will be live when they're hooked up to

191
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,560
panels

192
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,120
and just like that

193
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,759
we have two elevations of solar panels

194
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,759
we got 12 panels here

195
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,800
12 panels there

196
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,199
24 panel system 7000 watts next up we

197
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,840
need to run our wires some junction

198
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,080
boxes and some conduit and then run it

199
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,680
down to the disconnect and the combiner

200
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,440
and all that stuff down there so that we

201
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,519
can actually get some power out of this

202
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,760
so we're back from the future we did

203
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,919
these panels a little bit wrong

204
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,080
in the sense that when you wire them you

205
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,360
cannot have the wires actually sitting

206
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,040
on the roof

207
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,399
so this time we're going to use these

208
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,399
clips

209
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,640
to hold the wires

210
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,480
in place off of the roof

211
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,839
we're going to put the panels back down

212
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,839
and then we'll be good to go

213
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,279
easy as that

214
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,519
and here's what the roof looks like with

215
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,560
the j boxes and with the conduit

216
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,880
installed an important note is that this

217
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,600
kit actually called for three quarter

218
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,480
inch conduit but we used one inch

219
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,320
conduit this made it so much easier to

220
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,680
run the wires through and when you're

221
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,480
pulling this many wires through

222
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,399
three-quarters conduit it's just not fun

223
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,000
go with one inch it'll save you some

224
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,640
time and struggle

225
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,640
and here you have the combiner box you

226
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,800
can see the three strings

227
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,360
are the top two breakers

228
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,440
as well as the one on the bottom left

229
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,200
the red black and white

230
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,399
this middle breaker is the power that

231
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,560
goes out which then goes to the ac

232
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,600
disconnect this allows you to quickly

233
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,839
turn your system on and off

234
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,399
the power coming from your panels then

235
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,880
going out here's the performance meter

236
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,959
without it installed obviously that's

237
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,360
for the power company to do

238
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,560
and here is where it goes back into the

239
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,440
panel

240
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,000
you can see our breakers clearly labeled

241
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,160
up there for the solar system

242
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,920
here's the conduit running down from the

243
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,200
roof to bring those into the combiner

244
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,519
box

245
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,680
lastly we have the system all buttoned

246
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,600
up here's our panel that we shot

247
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,600
here's the performance meter again the

248
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,920
city needs to install the actual meter

249
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,920
here's the ac disconnect closed as well

250
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,360
as the combiner box closed

251
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,519
and sitting on the wall it looks pretty

252
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,320
neat and organized almost professional

253
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,560
almost and we're back to show exactly

254
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,560
how much this thing is made

255
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,040
so right now it's a little bit overcast

256
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,760
the sun's poking through just barely and

257
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,720
the system's making 3.6 kilowatts right

258
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,519
now

259
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,360
so throughout the span of a day

260
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,800
it'll vary depending on where the sun's

261
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,519
at a little less in the morning and

262
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,079
evening but uh you can expect with this

263
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,959
right now to get about 30 kilowatt hours

264
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,120
a day

265
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,480
and we've had it running now for about

266
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,040
six weeks

267
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,560
and it'll cycle through and tell us

268
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,240
that it's made 1375 kilowatt hours which

269
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,839
you know you do the math that's roughly

270
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,959
about 30 a day so we're tracking right

271
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,800
there that adds up a lot especially

272
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,560
with power costs increasing depending on

273
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,959
where you're at this could be a

274
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,279
significant reduction to your bill and

275
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,360
you saw how easy that whole thing was

276
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:30,320
highly recommend the micro inverter set

277
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,880
up to get your maximum output on your

278
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,120
entire roof and as you see it will

279
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,600
directly save on your power bill please

your own home system or you're just more

284
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,120
curious about how this works thanks guys

285
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,120
we'll see you next time
