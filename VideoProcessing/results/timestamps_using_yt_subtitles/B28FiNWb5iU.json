  "text": "foreign hey welcome back to Lori Farm everybody uh today we're going to be doing a hydraulic fluid change on this old 1949 8N tractor so to start there's a there's actually three main drain areas on the tractor that you're going to want to drain from directly below the gear shift but on my tractor I don't know what the previous owner did I have no idea this thing almost looks like it was either mangled up or welded on or something I'm not going to be taking that off today I'm a little bit worried that once I get it off I'm going to have a problem so we're going to start on this bolt over here it's right next to the exhaust and uh I think I've watched a few videos and guys have said that theirs is a 9 16. mine's a three-quarter I don't know if if it was changed out at one time which is why it's a three-quarter but that's where we're going to start um the tractor should hold five gallons of hydraulic fluid when um when it's full so I have a three gallon bucket here so we're gonna have to stop at some point I've actually never taken this bolt out I've done changes on it before but I always took the the big one here in the back loose exclusively but I thought today I'd try this one all right well we let that drain out of there a little bit this uh this rear one I think is an inch and an inch and a sixteenth which on hand that socket so I'm going with a an inch and an eighth that I have put a rag in just to get this thing loosened up like I said there should be five gallons in here so I got a little three gallon bucket so we might stop a little ways and and uh go pour out into a bigger bucket and come back and get the rest well while that's draining down on the bottom of the tractor whatever open the cap here up on the top for the fill it uh it looks like it's a looks like it's a bolt but it's actually not kind of like a radiator cap almost I'm actually surprised the old oil doesn't look too bad so that's a good sign I remember the first time I changed it that uh it was pretty white and scummy well there's probably a million great ways to fill but that's the way I'm Gonna Fill things up the the dipstick is over here underneath the underneath the seat and um so we'll fill for a little bit and then we'll we'll check our level and see how we're we're doing and we'll check our fluids here pretty hard to see on there but it should be right on the money well we got the oil all put back and got the cover back on so ready to go we'll fire her up and see if she holds well thanks for hanging out today and uh hopefully we all learned something and maybe you guys want to check out this video right here have a great rest of your day",
