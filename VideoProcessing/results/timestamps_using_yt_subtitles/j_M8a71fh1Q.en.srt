1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:13,679
[Music]

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,759
all right so John and I are going to

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,480
split ours uh up we're going to talk to

4
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,800
you a little bit about uh biocurity like

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,480
you heard um Dr Speer talk we have to

6
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,720
step up our biocurity so we really got

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,960
to think about the things we're going to

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,199
do and how we're going to uh how we're

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,800
going to move forward so I'm sure

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,960
everybody has been doing some thinking

11
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,559
on some of the things that you know what

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,719
are we going to do what what's that

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,200
Shield going to be that we're going to

14
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:39,480
do on our Farms to really protect us

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,079
from biocurity and you know when it

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,440
comes down it comes down to all of you

17
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,039
and me we're The Growers we're the ones

18
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,399
that make the decision on who comes on

19
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:50,840
our Farms if we don't stop it nobody

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,039
else is so there might be some

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,640
unpleasant um situations but we need to

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,559
deal with those certainly very important

23
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,640
so when we're talking about our plan we

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,199
need to think about really the three

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,680
things our production site what are the

26
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,400
things that we can do in our production

27
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,560
site the people coming in and then also

28
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,360
um equipment and vehicles so let's talk

29
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:16,080
about our production site what are the

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,479
some of the things that we can do Dr spe

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,240
talked about this line this dirty line

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,880
and this clean line what are some of the

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,439
things anybody got any ideas of some of

34
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,439
the things we can

35
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,960
do change your foot change your Footwear

36
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,840
right Tina so we can think about from

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,320
each house a lot of people have Annie

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,960
rooms some of some people don't have

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,079
Annie rooms we can put separate shoes

40
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,720
from house to house we can put on the

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,240
little slipon

42
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:48,680
booties uh from house to house we've got

43
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,520
the plastic ones uh also so another

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,680
thing that um we have done on our farm

45
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,159
is trying to think of some of the things

46
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,159
that we carry in and out we're carrying

47
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,399
in and out

48
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,159
buckets we're carrying I have chicken

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,439
picker uppers I call them the regets so

50
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,119
we shouldn't be carrying those in and

51
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,360
out so we bought I took two buckets per

52
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,720
house cleaned them all up disinfected

53
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,680
them we lose like a 10% um bleach

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,280
solution clean them up cleaned up our

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,239
chicken picker uppers we put up little

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,760
hooks in our houses they those buckets

57
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,680
and those chicken picker up or stay in

58
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,200
those houses they're dedicated to that

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,440
so we're picking up chickens and you

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,640
know you're driving down with your golf

61
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,560
cart or your Gator your tractor whatever

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,840
you sit one bucket outside the door but

63
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,360
when so when you're dumping your dead

64
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,160
chickens out

65
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,680
you can you're not taking that bucket

66
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,480
outside don't let it touch anything

67
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,160
outside but you're keeping that kind of

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,000
that clean and dirty line so I think

69
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,400
it's just those type of things that we

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,239
really need to think about to to take it

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,120
to that that certainly to that next uh

72
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,680
level

73
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,959
people my gosh my mother comes over you

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,760
know she drives right down the bar I'm

75
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,480
like Mom you cannot drive down to the

76
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,599
barn she's bringing us lunch but you

77
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,319
know call us you know we'll we'll come

78
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,440
up but you know it's just this

79
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,519
re-education of things that we just

80
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,000
really don't don't think about the

81
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,000
people that come on our farm I had a um

82
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,200
grower call me last week and said Jenny

83
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,640
I was home for the day and you know she

84
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,440
works off the farm she say the electric

85
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,080
person came up from the electric company

86
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,239
to read the meter you know farmer next

87
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,879
door has you know grows for amch one

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,640
grows for mount air one grows for Allen

89
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:25,560
one grows for Purdue so um they didn't

90
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,040
have the smart meters yet so we worked

91
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,040
uh don't you know most of you know that

92
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,040
I sit on the DPI board also so we d a

93
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,799
letter Bill worked on John and I worked

94
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,760
on to send out to the Allied Industries

95
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,000
to you know let them know there's you

96
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,000
know there's this threat of Avan

97
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,439
influenza we've got to do everything we

98
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,239
can if you got to go to a farm don't

99
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,519
drive down to the production area put on

100
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,360
your booties you got to go read the

101
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,720
meter go read the meter walk back to the

102
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,079
truck throw the booties away there so I

103
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,720
think those will just be the simple

104
00:03:54,079 --> 00:04:00,239
things and we have to be that first um

105
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,599
line of defense I just put on our for

106
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,560
you between the house and the production

107
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,280
area I just turned up some orange um

108
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,040
vegetable baskets trying to think now

109
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,879
what could I do to stop people and lo

110
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,799
and behold I got a phone call from my

111
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,560
biocurity sign that had a phone number

112
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,639
on it it was a trash man and I forgot

113
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,359
because we had told him that we were

114
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,799
going to move our trash dumpster up up

115
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,000
to the house I really don't want it up

116
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:25,960
to the house cuz it's ugly and I when I

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,080
pull up my Lane I like the way that it

118
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,000
looks so I said well can you he comes

119
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,880
back next week I said not this week but

120
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,600
next week we'll move it up to the house

121
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,639
so that so just those little things that

122
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,600
you you know you don't think about so

123
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,520
think about those things and then um

124
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,560
equipment uh

125
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,479
Vehicles think about it John's going to

126
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,160
talk a little bit about you know washing

127
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,639
equipment um when we talk about

128
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,560
equipment one of the most important uh

129
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,560
pieces we have what's

130
00:04:54,919 --> 00:05:00,280
this how many germs do you think are on

131
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,199
this thing where does it go it goes

132
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,000
everywhere with us how many people Tak

133
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,000
in the chicken house with

134
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,080
them so you might want to think about

135
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,320
while you're washing your hands before

136
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,320
you go in the chicken house keep some

137
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,080
disinfectant wipes clean your cell phone

138
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,400
or leave it don't take it in and clean

139
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,960
it when you get done there's just these

140
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,680
little things that we really just really

141
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,680
don't uh think about so these are really

142
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,680
the absolute things that we just need to

143
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,600
think about and the things that we do uh

144
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,240
on our Farms no back yard poultry I

145
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,560
think we all know that but we just need

146
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,000
to say it and let everybody know if you

147
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,800
have any neighbors that have backyard

148
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,080
poultry the Maryland Department of a has

149
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,840
sent out the poultry premise

150
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,759
registration just make sure that

151
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,039
everybody gets registered so if there is

152
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:49,080
an outbreak that everybody will

153
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:51,759
know uh so I mean we see backyard

154
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:53,080
poultry everywhere you know on Route 213

155
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,720
there's somebody that has backyard

156
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,360
poultry and they're on the road half of

157
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,639
the time I have a heart attack when I

158
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,280
drive past them I have to check to make

159
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,880
sure they are registered

160
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,680
um but no pet birds the same you know

161
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,800
the same thing I think we all we all

162
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,919
know a lot of this Dina talked about you

163
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,000
know dedicated Footwear I don't care who

164
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,639
comes on your farm they either put

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,400
plastic boots on or they have dedicated

166
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,039
Footwear you'll see my grandson a little

167
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,639
while he has dedicated Footwear when he

168
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,240
comes stays right in the we have call it

169
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,560
the man cave that we put our boots on

170
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,479
but it's it's a cheap thing that we can

171
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,639
do for something that can devastate our

172
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,160
industry and devastate each one of us

173
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:34,039
most of us have mortgage payments and um

174
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,000
things that we need to pay for so and if

175
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,560
you're worried uh somebody's going to

176
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,240
wear them off paint them pink paint them

177
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,039
purple I don't care do something so

178
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,639
someone's not going to take them um off

179
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:46,280
the

180
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,039
farm uh we talked about this um

181
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,680
unauthorized visitors you know when

182
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:51,440
we're not on our farm we really don't

183
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,840
know who's coming up there we really

184
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,639
don't if you anything you can do to keep

185
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,080
unauthorized visitors and it's hard

186
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,680
because we got feed trucks you know

187
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,759
coming on our farm we've got people um

188
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,080
delivering propane so but like I said

189
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,280
it's our job you see that propane coming

190
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,479
truck coming up and they haven't

191
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,400
disinfected put a little pump up sprayer

192
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:12,400
out there I think most of us now have

193
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,240
probably mailboxes up John's going to

194
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,160
talk about those you know put a little

195
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,800
pump up sprayer out there can hurt so

196
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,680
make sure that you do have all the

197
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,280
personal uh protective equipment John

198
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,720
and I have uh you know the coveralls

199
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,639
anybody that's coming up you can put

200
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,120
them in your

201
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,280
mailbox uh there's all kinds of foot

202
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,360
oops

203
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,879
Footwear we've got the little cloth

204
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:38,680
things we have little cloth footies we

205
00:07:35,879 --> 00:07:42,039
have the plastic ones we have a hair net

206
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,639
or headnet also disinfectant wipes oh

207
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:45,919
and then our just our hand hand

208
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:47,319
sanitizer so a lot of things don't

209
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,400
forget to get your sign tonight put your

210
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:52,199
phone number on there it worked worked

211
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:55,199
for me just just last week so just some

212
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:58,560
things uh really to think

213
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,960
about uh things are going to break down

214
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,479
and we're going to have to call one of

215
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,960
the poultry stores I call them you know

216
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,000
to come fix things so and they're all

217
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,759
all are certainly aware but that's our

218
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,919
job to check on them you know where you

219
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,680
going to make them Park make sure that

220
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,319
they've got their protective equipment

221
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:17,159
on make sure you have a place for them

222
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,879
to dispose of it when they come on to

223
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:21,400
your

224
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,599
farm mortal oh

225
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,440
mortality we've got to be doing a good

226
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,159
job of composting that's certainly very

227
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,720
important because if we don't do a good

228
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:30,000
job of composting then we get all these

229
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,279
little critters

230
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,200
and we don't need that because that they

231
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:37,200
just spread they just spread disease so

232
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,880
some other things to think about educate

233
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,320
your employees educate your families

234
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,720
people that have um employees same thing

235
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,959
you know they need dedicated Footwear

236
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,680
dedicated coveralls or clothing

237
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,080
something that they they leave on your

238
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,120
farm they put it on when they get there

239
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,080
between that dirty and clean line think

240
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,240
about you know those kind of things

241
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,680
washing your hands just very simple

242
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,959
basic things we all talk about not the

243
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,360
flu you know and colds more you wash

244
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:07,160
your hands certainly the better off

245
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,920
you'll be so again just back to those

246
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,600
absolute things no backyard poultry

247
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,040
we've got to have dedicated clothes

248
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,959
dedicated Footwear no unauthorized

249
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,000
visitors um personal protective clothing

250
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,920
you can buy this I mean all this I'm

251
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,399
sure you can get it on Amazon you can go

252
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,480
to the you know I call G&M sales and

253
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:32,160
they send it to me that works uh very

254
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,640
well and then um also um do a good job

255
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,920
with your

256
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,519
composting so without these things you

257
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,200
really don't have a biocurity plan and

258
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,079
you need to talk to talk to your family

259
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,000
about it talk to your partner about it

260
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:47,120
you know just different things that we

261
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,920
really don't think about oops okay all

262
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,920
right so now we're going to go through

263
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,760
this we're getting late so I'll try and

264
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,360
go through this quickly how's that if

265
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,760
you have questions just raise your hand

266
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,959
I'll slow down okay some factors to

267
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,120
consider you all know where your Farms

268
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:01,279
are located there's things you need to

269
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,360
be aware of are you located next to a

270
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,200
big pond well if you build a new Farm

271
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,680
you have a storm Runner storm water pond

272
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,320
so we have that we're kind of making

273
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,760
things a little harder for Farmers but

274
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,880
we want to be aware we wear an area

275
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,200
where there's a lot of water foul who

276
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,360
lives next to our farm we need to know

277
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,800
who our neighbors are do they have

278
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,360
poultry do they have backyard poultry

279
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,640
are we located next to a big road I mean

280
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:24,440
there was a farm I saw put on a for Road

281
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,680
the other day and I I drive by I can see

282
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,399
all the feathers from the live Hall

283
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,399
trucks already sucked up into the cool

284
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:31,200
cells so we want to make sure we do it

285
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:32,440
we can to keep our farm safe and if you

286
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,440
have any of those things we have to do a

287
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,000
little more but things we recommend

288
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,600
visitor logs visitor logs are great

289
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,600
because then we know if there's anything

290
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,320
happens who was on your farm we can

291
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,800
start tracing these diseases and find

292
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,320
out who we need to really worry about or

293
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,839
if somebody brought it on we can start

294
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,320
looking and see where this disease went

295
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,760
thing about visitor logs is we put them

296
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,079
in a mailbox love mailboxes go buy one

297
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,680
of the biggest ones you can because then

298
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,560
there's lots of room for

299
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,440
spiders just

300
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,240
joking then you can take and stuff some

301
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,639
uh personal protective wear in there you

302
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,079
know we can put in some cover all some

303
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:07,399
boots and all that that way if anybody's

304
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:08,880
coming on your farm and you aren't there

305
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:10,959
you can tell them the clothing is there

306
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,800
for them and tell them where it's at and

307
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,160
these are real easy way to put it on or

308
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,320
if you have somebody show up you know

309
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,160
where it is it's right there at the

310
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,440
entrance to your farm so it makes it

311
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,560
real simple to do the other thing is put

312
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,399
up a

313
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,519
sign do sign stop disease signs no but

314
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:29,320
they stop people it's interesting we've

315
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,079
actually had calls lately people ask

316
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,880
asking why are we seeing these biocurity

317
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:34,279
signs I think that's great because that

318
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,680
means people are noticing that we're

319
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:37,399
worried about our birds and what we're

320
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,440
doing it gives us an opportunity to talk

321
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:40,600
to them about why farmers are putting

322
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,000
them up and what we need to do to

323
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,000
protect our

324
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,120
Birds okay at the same place if we're at

325
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,360
the same place we're still where we put

326
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,720
our mailbox up what about putting a

327
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,639
chain or something across the road there

328
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,200
to stop people from just driving on in

329
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,040
Jenny put up their little cones or

330
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:59,880
upside down uh vegetable baskets that's

331
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,320
it go get some soccer cones you can get

332
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,920
them at Walmart they're cheap put those

333
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,240
across there anything that will stop

334
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,279
people from driving on down that way

335
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,880
they're thinking uh this again if you

336
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,560
have all this I mean he's pulling across

337
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,279
the chain but his mailbox is sitting

338
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,760
right there so everything is right there

339
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:15,399
for anybody that comes on the farm so

340
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,560
he's got it all right there it's not oh

341
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:19,959
well where am I going to look where am I

342
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,240
going to find it this is a camera on

343
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:23,720
another farm this way anybody pulls on

344
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,800
their Farm they can't see it they live a

345
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,320
little ways away around the corner but

346
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,360
if I pull on their Farm it takes a

347
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,120
picture of me in my vehicle and it sends

348
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,560
it to them and they know I'm there great

349
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,279
thing about it you know who's on your

350
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,320
farm bad thing about it takes pictures

351
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,600
of Doe's in the middle of the night I

352
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,839
don't think they'd complain if it was a

353
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,040
big buck but they were complaining it

354
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,680
was a dough locks locks are very

355
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,120
important keep things well keep things

356
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,279
locked down we do have a lot of crime

357
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,600
going on we need to keep people out has

358
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,240
anybody paid attention to what happened

359
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,880
down in South Carolina last spring and

360
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:58,560
summer you heard about it didn't you

361
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,000
200,000 Birds killed somebody went in

362
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,399
and started playing with controllers and

363
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,959
everything else we want to make sure

364
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,959
we're doing what we can to prevent that

365
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:07,720
from happening here so lock doors lock

366
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:11,440
things

367
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,800
up let's see bird exclusion Dr Shiro's

368
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,480
talked about this a lot I just want to

369
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,959
add this when we Birds go out we often

370
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,839
leave our end doors open for days on end

371
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,000
and I see it all the time maybe we need

372
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:24,320
to shut them if we're not working in

373
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
there just shut the doors kick on your

374
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,360
minimum ventilation to keep it aired out

375
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,839
but we need to shut those doors cuz

376
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,399
Birds after about the first 2 4 hours

377
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,120
they're going to start going in there

378
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:34,920
those birds are possibly going to bring

379
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,839
some type of disease parasite or

380
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,279
something I'm you know Northern fomites

381
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,760
I've seen that happen before so we want

382
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:43,120
to make sure we keep those birds

383
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:45,639
out rodent

384
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,560
control again you don't want to see this

385
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:49,199
rat rats running down the rafters I had

386
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:52,000
a really cool picture I can't find it's

387
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,720
a rat drinking from a nipple Drinker and

388
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,880
it's I mean these are things you see in

389
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,160
chicken houses if things are not done

390
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,759
right now I will say we do a good job

391
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,759
job around here keeping our stuff out

392
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:04,320
whether you use the homemade type of of

393
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,920
bait stations or you buy the bait

394
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,160
stations we're doing a good job this is

395
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,759
what we want to see we want to keep our

396
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,399
pads clean Dr Shapiro mentioned

397
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,680
that um Beetle control another one we

398
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,120
don't think a lot about beetles can

399
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,399
Harbor disease and carry them from one

400
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,800
flock to the next so we want to make

401
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,079
sure we have a good Beetle control

402
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:24,399
program to try and knock those bugs

403
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:25,839
down foot baths I'm a fan of foot baths

404
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,560
when they're done right that foot bath

405
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,480
is not right you can smell it from where

406
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,680
I'm taking the picture this person

407
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,079
should have known better that's wor

408
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,920
you'd have been worse off stepping in

409
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:38,199
that than just going straight in the

410
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,160
house if you do it right they work but

411
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:42,680
remember we don't want to see this we

412
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,399
want to see something like well like

413
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,199
this see he's got a good clean foot bath

414
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,480
if we can get Jenny's grandson to play

415
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,680
in the water and clean his boots we can

416
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:53,639
train our employees and us to do it how

417
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,600
old four years old can understand a foot

418
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:58,320
bath so we want to make sure we do this

419
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,720
clean things up here's a brush remember

420
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,000
when we clean our shoes to get it right

421
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,519
we got to get that mud off or it's not

422
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,519
going to do any good in disinfecting so

423
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,360
we've got to get the debris off so we

424
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:08,320
want to make sure we clean things up one

425
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,920
thing we might want to do it's hard to

426
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,199
see in this picture but flat shoes with

427
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,440
no no big grooves by doing that you're

428
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,600
not going to get a lot of debris stuck

429
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,880
in the bottom of your shoe work great

430
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:20,880
except for if you step outside on ice or

431
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,519
brand new litter kind of get slippery so

432
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,160
we got to be careful

433
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,920
there I'm a fan of dedicated Footwear in

434
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,519
each house when I had a farm that's what

435
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,240
I did each house had its own Footwear

436
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:33,120
slip in when you go in slip it off when

437
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,880
you come out boots are cheap they're not

438
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,360
that expensive Dr Shapiro showed one way

439
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,000
where you sit down on a bench take your

440
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,720
shoes off throw your legs over the other

441
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,079
side of the bench put the other shoes on

442
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,680
just a simple change like that granted

443
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:46,399
we have a lot of houses without Andy

444
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,560
rooms so we need to find other things

445
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,240
out other ways to do it but yall are

446
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,040
very creative and and I'm sure you can

447
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,759
find ways to make these kind of systems

448
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,040
work foot baths whatever works for you

449
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,560
but you need to find a way to make it

450
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:00,360
work on your farm and then you need to

451
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,720
be the one that always does it so that

452
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,279
if you have other people that work with

453
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,600
you they see you doing it CU if people

454
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,560
will watch you and if you're not doing

455
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,880
it they're going to figure they don't

456
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,319
have

457
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,880
to uh hunting waterfoul again kind of

458
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:15,399
risky right now I don't know if we have

459
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,959
any big waterfoul hunters in here but uh

460
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,759
if you're going to hunt water foul take

461
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:22,040
extra precautions or maybe take a year

462
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:23,399
off uh not my place to call that but be

463
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:27,360
very

464
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:29,399
careful you laugh at that all right be

465
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,000
careful around convenience stores love

466
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,240
it this was a picture that used to have

467
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,800
a whole bunch of poop here but by the

468
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,360
time we got there the rain washed it off

469
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,519
so it's a picture of a nice curb but

470
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,480
look at this truck here pull into their

471
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:41,959
gas station he's sitting there with that

472
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,360
do you think that spread manure as he

473
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,240
drove down the road yeah do you think

474
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,240
it's kind of a good way to be can you

475
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,160
imagine what the front of that truck

476
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,959
looks like these are the people you're

477
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,600
dealing with so when you go to the store

478
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,399
make sure you don't take those shoes

479
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,720
back down this is where everybody stops

480
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,480
to get their coffee and donuts in the

481
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,000
morning you don't want to pick something

482
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,720
up from somebody else that went there

483
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Again Farm dedicated

484
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Footwear water ponds geese we need to

485
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,640
find ways to discourage them from coming

486
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,480
in I'm a fan of a young retriever

487
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,760
Labrador chesap doesn't matter just a

488
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,799
young retriever let him go out there and

489
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:18,039
Chase the heck out of them it's legal

490
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:19,600
you're not harming them so there are

491
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:21,199
some things we can do as well you can

492
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,640
get permission to Addle eggs where you

493
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,039
go out and shake their eggs up or break

494
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,559
their eggs you have to get permission

495
00:17:24,039 --> 00:17:27,199
there are legal ways to do it there are

496
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:29,320
some ways to get permits to do

497
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,080
deprivation hunts but there are ways to

498
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,120
help lower the number of water foul

499
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,720
around your

500
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,559

house we're kind of dirty and they pick

506
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,840
this bucket off off the back of their uh

507
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,200
their four-wheeler and they carry this

508
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,919
bucket every day they go out when they

509
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,600
start going around fill it up with clean

anything this is one of those hand

514
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,200

the defense what happens on your farm I

542
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,559
can't control you're the only one that

543
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,080
can control your farm so you are the

544
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:00,360
ones that need to stand up and say this

545
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,200
is what the limits are and this is what

546
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,760
we're going to do and don't be afraid to

547
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,000
tell people hey look I know my motor's

548
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,960
broke but you need to put on this

549
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,480
equipment before you can go work on it

550
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,559
or if you're coming down here I want you

551
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,799
to do this it's your farm you set the

552
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:17,360
rules again the absolutes no backyard

553
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:21,440
Poultry Farm dedicated Footwear and

554
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:23,640
clothes no unauthorized vehicle Vehicles

555
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,640
visitors visitors wear protective

556
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,080
clothing and make sure we take care of

557
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,840
our dead birds properly what we would

558
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,480
suggest even better let's get some

559
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:34,520
signage we see a lot of that that's

560
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:36,400
going good visitor logs limit

561
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,200
access you know if someone doesn't need

562
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,440
to come on your farm like you need to

563
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,760
meet with a banker or something we've

564
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,240
been telling the bankers meet at

565
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:44,720
McDonald's or some other restaurant you

566
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,280
know go down at the doughnut house go

567
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,559
down to Dunkin' donut buy them a cup of

568
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,080
coffee while you sign the papers there's

569
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:50,720
no reason they have to come to the farm

570
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,200
other than convenience for you so maybe

571
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,400
it's meet somewhere else to do these

572
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,720
kind of

573
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,159
negotiations Beetle control rodent

574
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,320
control clean up litter wash hands wash

575
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:01,960
all your equipment if we do all this

576
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,080
it's going to help prevent disease not

577
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,240
only AI but it will help with all of our

578
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,360
btry diseases so it's going to be a

579
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,679
win-win for us if we do this if we never

580
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,880
get AI which I hope we don't if we do

581
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,159
these things it's going to help us with

582
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,679
other disease as well and with that

583
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:18,600
since we only have one or two visitors

584
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:20,039
and I know them pretty well we can kind

585
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,880
of skip through this but what I want to

586
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:23,840
say if you're visiting Farms if you

587
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,840
don't need to go down to the farm meet

588
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,440
him at the gate if your truck doesn't

589
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,679
need to go on the farm don't have the

590
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,720
truck go on the farm keep your windows

591
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,679
set we pick up a lot of unwanted

592
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,159
visitors you know passengers in our car

593
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,440
when we leave our windows down let's

594
00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:38,120
let's make sure we don't do that some

595
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,640
simple things we can do to help farmers

596
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,840
out if you need to go to a farm just go

597
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,600
to the part you need to don't go to

598
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,919
everywhere don't go wandering

599
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,720
around and with that remember our goal

600
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,960
is to stop the spread of

601
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,590
disease so let's all work together on

602
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:57,660
this and let's make sure we get it done

603
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,660
