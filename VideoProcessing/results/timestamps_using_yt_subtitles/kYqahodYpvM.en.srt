00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:37,440
what if I told you a single clove of

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,000
garlic could multiply into a small

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,520
fortune if you do it right by saving

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,680
your own seed year after year you can

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,239
compound your profits and turn just a

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,520
small handful of cloves into a thriving

11
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,760
profitable small farm Enterprise garlic

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,800
is one of my favorite crops to grow it's

13
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,199
easy in some ways you plant it in the

14
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,399
fall Harvest it the next summer and

15
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,960
there's little maintenance in between

16
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,519
but to grow a successful profitable crop

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,439
you need to follow a few key strategies

18
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,479
from planting dates to KN when to

19
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:12,360
harvest I've faced pests diseases and

20
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,640
even total failures but over time I've

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,280
developed a system that works and in

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,680
this video I'll show you how to

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,600
sterilize your seed stock prepare the

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:25,119
soil fertilize plant protect Harvest

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,560
cure and save your own seed so you can

26
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,000
grow garlic that thrives year after year

27
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:32,240
if you're new here I'm Chef Mikey I'm a

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,880
former executive chef turned Urban

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,040
Farmer and garlic is the crop that truly

30
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,560
inspired me to start growing my own food

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,560
after more than 20 years in the

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,119
restaurant industry I was used to seeing

33
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,799
garlic come in tubs already peeled and

34
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,719
not very exciting but then I discovered

35
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,399
a variety called music at my local

36
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,600
farmers market it's a hard neck garlic

37
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:56,240
that originated in Italy and made its

38
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,320
way to Canada in the 1980s thanks to a

39
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,479
garlic Enthusiast named Al music known

40
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,000
for its love large easy to peel cloves

41
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,799
and incredible flavor it's no surprise

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,239
it's become a favorite amongst Market

43
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,280
Farmers it's my absolute favorite crop

44
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,480
to grow when I first started growing

45
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,440
garlic I assumed it would take about 8

46
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,319
months from planting a clove to pulling

47
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,440
up a perfect head but I quickly realize

48
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,400
it's not about the amount of time it's

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,640
about the right conditions in my climate

50
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,200
no matter whether I plant in October

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,120
December or even January it's usually

52
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,560
ready by early to mid June and more

53
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,160
Northern climates it can indeed take 8

54
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,120
months or longer but here planting too

55
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,840
early caused my garlic to grow too fast

56
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,159
and the tops get damaged by winter now I

57
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,120
wait until about December 20th and I've

58
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:48,319
been seeing much better results now

59
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,959
spacing and fertility turned out to be

60
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,599
just as critical garlic is a heavy

61
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,560
feeder and overcrowding can really stunt

62
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,760
its growth even after I fixed my

63
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,040
planting date spacing and fertility

64
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,560
regimen then I found some of my bulbs

65
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,720
rotting in the ground a test from my

66
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,120
local Extension Office revealed garlic

67
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,000
bloat nematodes probably introduced

68
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,760
through contaminated seed now I

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,000
sterilize my seed and save my own seed

70
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,519
stock year after year I also manage

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
common pests like alium Leaf Miners and

72
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,159
onion maggots with insect netting by

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,200
experimenting with interplanting flower

74
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,200
and crops to attract Predator insects it

75
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,920
took years of trial and error but I

76
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,680
finally fig figured out a system that

77
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,560
reliably produces healthy Market ready

78
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,080
garlic now let's dive into exactly how I

79
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,280
plant fertilize and protect my garlic so

80
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,200
you can avoid my mistakes and grow your

81
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,599
best crop yet I actually grow my garlic

82
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,159
on a least property rather than in my

83
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:51,519
backyard it takes up a lot of space and

84
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:53,200
stays in the ground for a long time so

85
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,200
it just didn't makees sense to use my

86
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,400
most valuable real estate at home the

87
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,159
plot I'm using this year was basically a

88
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,640
blank slate about a year ago I started

89
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:05,720
by tarping the entire area until late

90
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,280
February which helped kill off any of

91
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,519
the weeds and gave me a clean start

92
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,159
after pulling off the tarps I planted a

93
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:16,440
cover crop mix of peas oats and mustard

94
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,639
that cover crop fed the soil and once

95
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,400
terminated acted as a sheet mulch to

96
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,560
suppress future weeds we built beds

97
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,199
right on top of that Mulch and planted

98
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,720
winter squash there for the summer then

99
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,720
after harvesting the squash in September

100
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,039
I tarped the plot again to keep it weed

101
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,000
free until garlic planting time in early

102
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:37,840
December I pulled back the tarps and

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,880
Broad forked the beds to help with

104
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,880
drainage my soil is heavy clay that can

105
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,840
get really compacted after loosening it

106
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:49,520
up I added a solid six in of fresh

107
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,080
compost on top and laid down wood chips

108
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,320
in the walkways this created a nutrient

109
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,800
Rich weed-free environment that's

110
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,479
perfect for planting garlic to prep my

111
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:03,199
seed garlic I started by gently breaking

112
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,880
each bulb into individual cloves keeping

113
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,240
the skins on if I can but don't worry if

114
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,520
a few cloves lose their skins I've never

115
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,639
seen any negative effects from planting

116
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,199
them that way next I soak the garlic in

117
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,240
cheap vodka for about 20 minutes the

118
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,880
Vodka helps kill off garlic bloat

119
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,840
nematodes bulb mites and any other

120
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,160
pathogens that might be lingering on the

121
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,280
cloves and it usually meets organic

122
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,919
standards although I use organic

123
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,000
practices I'm not formally certified so

124
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:35,240
cheap vodka works just fine for me after

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,680
the soak I strain the garlic and spread

126
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,600
the cloves on my greens drying rack to

127
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,319
let the alcohol evaporate meanwhile I

128
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:45,919
make a compost tea by steeping a pouch

129
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:48,280
of compost in a 5 gallon bucket of rain

130
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,720
water then adding a couple cups of fish

131
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:53,960
Emulsion I also mixed in a fair amount

132
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,240
of micro risal inoculant called MOG gasm

133
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,160
that my friend Heber makes I've had

134
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,960
great results with it on my tomatoes and

135
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,319
I'm excited to see how it benefit fits

136
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,400
my garlic finally I place the dried

137
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,080
cloves into these old Olive containers

138
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,120
that restaurants give me for free I pour

139
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,800
the compost tea until they're fully

140
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,759
submerged I snap on the lids and I let

141
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,120
the cloves soak while I drive out to my

142
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,840
least property about 30 minutes away by

143
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,240
the time I arried they've been in the

144
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,680
solution for roughly an hour then I just

145
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,039
pour off the liquid before planting we

146
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,599
prepped the beds a few days earlier so

147
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:30,880
everything was ready when we arrived

148
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:34,720
with our pre-soaked clothes each bed is

149
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:37,560
30 in wide and 50 feet long with 18inch

150
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,400
walkways we use 100ft tape measure to

151
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,520
easily measure each 50ft bed just

152
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,240
stretch it down the center and mark off

153
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,280
three rows at 6-in spacing we place the

154
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,000
cloves on top of the compost in their

155
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,919
spots making sure each one is root end

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,680
down and pointy side up we're planting

157
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:58,000
into about 6 in of compost ensuring that

158
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,680
each cloves root end touches the native

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,199
soil below over time the compost will

160
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,560
settled so we bury them just deep enough

161
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,280
to allow for that without risking rot in

162
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,080
the clay or making the Harvest too hard

163
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,199
once everything's lined up we simply

164
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,560
pushed each clove in with our fingers or

165
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:17,120
a small digging tool then moving on to

166
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,080
the next row in my Tennessee climate I

167
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,039
don't do much after planting I don't

168
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,360
bother irrigating or adding extra mulch

169
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:27,919
our Winters are relatively mild and

170
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,759
straw or hay can introduce weed seeds we

171
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,319
also get enough rain in the winter in

172
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,879
Spring that I don't need to set up

173
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,479
irrigation I usually see garlic shoots

174
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,720
poking through around February from

175
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,039
there maintenance is minimal a wire

176
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,599
weeder once or twice in the spring helps

177
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,120
keep weeds in check and the Deep compost

178
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,159
mulch does the rest as the weather warms

179
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,479
watch out for pests like onion maggots

180
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:54,560
and Alum Leaf miners which can devastate

181
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:56,639
a crop in early April you can cover the

182
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,720
garlic beds with insect netting so the

183
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,759
adult flies can't lay eggs on your

184
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,879
plants complete exclusion is the best

185
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:07,599
prevention organic sprays like spinosad

186
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,599
can also work but it's less work to just

187
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,639
cover it once then spray multiple times

188
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:15,680
and let's face it nobody wants garlic

189
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,960
that's been sprayed about 4 weeks before

190
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,960
Harvest you'll see a curled choot

191
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,639
emerging from the center of each garlic

192
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,520
plant that's the scape basically the

193
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,520
garlic flour if left alone it produces

194
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,720
seeds though it can take years of

195
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,919
replanting to get a full bulb that that

196
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,000
way removing the Scapes can increase

197
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,120
your bulb size by up to 25% because it

198
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,919
sends the plant's energy back down to

199
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,000
the bulb plus the Scapes are edible and

200
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,080
can be a tasty and profitable early

201
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,399
season crop after removing the Scapes

202
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,560
watch the bottom leaves when the lowest

203
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,760
three to five leaves have turn brown and

204
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:54,480
the rest are still healthy it's time to

205
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,279
harvest waiting until all the leaves die

206
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,000
can degrade the bulbs and hurt their

207
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:01,440
storage potential weather can also push

208
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,560
your time timing if heavy rain is coming

209
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,959
and I'm close to harvest I'd rather pull

210
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:09,519
them early than risk rot or pest issues

211
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,760
to harvest I simply pull each ball by

212
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,680
the stem because I plant in a deep

213
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,000
compost mulch rather than heavy soil

214
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:20,200
they come up easily then we trim the

215
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,880
tops down to about 6 to 10 in just pile

216
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,680
them in crates and then we take them

217
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,000
back to the home base for drying and

218
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,720
curing we just leave the trim tops in

219
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,640
the field for now since we won't be

220
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,720
planting anything else here until fall

221
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,440
drying and curing is the most critical

222
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,480
step after all those months of work you

223
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,320
don't want your garlic to spoil in

224
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,600
storage properly cured garlic can last

225
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,040
up to a year but if you do it wrong

226
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,399
you'll lose a lot of your Harvest early

227
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,640
on I tried drying my garlic Outdoors

228
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,640
undercover for a couple of weeks but

229
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,480
Tennessee's heat and humidity in June

230
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,640
are a perfect recipe for mold it's also

231
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,399
tempting to rinse off your bolt and

232
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:02,040
reveal that pretty purple striping but

233
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:04,680
washing can ruin their ability to store

234
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:06,920
instead I just brush off any loose dirt

235
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,200
by hand leaving as much of the papery

236
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,959
skin intact as possible also keep 6 to

237
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,120
10 in of stem on each bulb so it can dry

238
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,480
and help protect the bulb from pathogens

239
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,519
entering since I don't have space to

240
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,680
hang my garlic in bunches I use a 4x8

241
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,959
grow tent equipped with a ventilation

242
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:28,279
system air filter and a dehumidifier I

243
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:31,279
spread the bulbs in a single layer on

244
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:33,279
wire shelving the dehumidifier pulls out

245
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,639
the moisture while the ventilation

246
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,720
system brings in fresh air and filters

247
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:40,320
out the strong garlic Aroma from the

248
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,959
house I check on them periodically over

249
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,959
the next two weeks to make sure they

250
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:47,639
don't show any signs of mold or rot once

251
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,320
the Skins turn papery I trim the roots

252
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:52,880
and the stems a bit more peel off the

253
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,240
outermost layer and store the bulbs in

254
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:59,360
mesh bags for long-term storage I keep

255
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,440
them in my office which stays around 70°

256
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,200
and 50% humidity ideally you'd want 60°

257
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,160
and 60% humidity but that's hard to

258
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,519
maintain in most homes right now I only

259
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,360
sell a small amount of garlic each year

260
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,600
because I'm building up my own seed

261
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,120
stock my goal is to offer certified seed

262
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,360
garlic in the future and I'm probably a

263
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,040
year or two from hitting that milestone

264
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,440
in the meantime I hope you'll stick

265
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,360
around and follow along and good luck

266
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,360
with your own garlic Harvest
