  "text": "welcome to good works tractors guys how we doing today we are going to compare category 1 quick itches versus category 2. so you're going to see a cat one on both of these outside machines right here you'll see them in red these are all speako quick hitches you're also going to see one tucked down here as well we'll get to that in just a minute so if you're in the market for a quick hitch or you just want to make it easier to attach your three-point implements right up to your tractor pay attention stick around watch this maybe it'll save you some money maybe it'll save you some frustration we have two different category one quick hitches and then over here we're gonna have a category two quick hitch so the main difference besides the color between these two quick hitches right here both being category one as this is going to be the really popular version that does not use bushings you can see this right here for any attachment that you have with a traditional style of quick hitch you're going to need to put a set of bushings on every implement so if you have a box blade a rear blade a ballast box a tiller a brush hog all that kind of stuff you need to get a set of these bushings to put on every single attachment and that can get really expensive with a quick hitch like this you avoid this no more bushings required it's a direct pin size here i don't know the answer why bushings have been required for years and years on all the traditional style of category one quick hitches but no more you don't need it however when we get into the category two sizing you are going to have to use bushings there's not an option for a direct pin fitment on the category two so you need a set of these or sometimes you have the kind of the clevis hook on a three-point hitch where you have two pieces of steel and then a pin in between there you'd have a different style of bushing but regardless a bushing is going to be required so how do you know if you need a category one or a category two well it's pretty simple really so when you think about a category one that's going to be what's on your tractor the three-point hitch that's back there and so if you have a 10-25-hour or even all the way up to a 40-66-r that's all going to be category one equipment so sub compacts and compact tractors once you're starting to get into five series tractors like this utility tractors that's when you're gonna be into category two you're even gonna see some that are a cat one cat two kind of little crossover type of thing there it can get a little bit tricky with one of those stick around to later in the video or read the description below as well you'll want to pay attention to all the dimensions the left to right spacing the up to down spacing even the gaps in between the arms of the quick hitch check that against what you have on your machine there to make sure it's going to work for you so whatever category your tractor is means that's going to be what size attachments hook up to it so if you have a category 2 machine like this one here you're going to hook up category 2 attachments same thing if it's a cat 1 machine you're gonna hook up category one attachments to it these two category one quick hitches here are gonna weigh right around 70 pounds give or take an ounce or two when you get up to the category two that's going to weigh in at a whopping 134 pounds how we've been shipping out these category one quick hitches is going to be wrapping them up we don't put them in a box we don't do anything like that we've had really good success just wrapping them up with corner protection and bubble wrap and shrink wrap or stretch strap and sending them out ups ground once you get up to the category 2 though it starts to get a little bit cumbersome to try to wrap that up and have ups come here and pick those up so i think what we're gonna do is start shipping those out on a really small pallet if you can find a location a commercial loading dock or maybe even have it picked up at a shipping terminal those are gonna be the cheapest ways to ship these products right here the category two so in particular if you're thinking about getting a category two we're all gonna be shipping a pallet there anyways if you wanna fit some other products on there like wheel weights suitcase weights maybe a set of pallet forks something along those lines it can be really economical and be a really good savings going to a commercial address with a loading dock or even picking up at the destination terminal give you a real quick rundown here of what these quick hitches include they are all a little bit different on what's included i don't know why the most popular version here the category one e hitch by spiko is not going to require any bushings therefore no bushings are included the other goofy thing is it doesn't include a top pin one of these can be purchased from like a tsc farm and flee online on amazon very easy it's just a pretty standard pin here that you have in the top but just want to make sure you know about that over here on the more traditional style of category one quick hitch you are gonna have a set of bushings that is included you are also going to have the top pin here and then even this little funny looking contraption right here which is called a floating top link adapter this is really designed to be used in place of a top hook it'll kind of hang down like this and you can hook up maybe a non quick hitch compatible attachment to it over here on the category 2 quick hitch you are going to get a set of bushings again like this and if you have the clevis style that has again the two pieces of steel with a pin in between this doesn't work on there but there are a lot of attachments out there that do use this style of bushing you are also not going to get that top pin on this version either so make sure you pay attention it's gonna be a little bit bigger pin size a category two pin size that you wanna have for your category two quick hitch this video idea came about because of a lot of questions from customers that have or want a solution maybe to having a category one and category two quick hitch compatible quick hitch and i don't really know a product that exists like that and that's where the dimensional spacing really comes into play it's true that a lot of the the quick hitches out there require bushings on there that are going to size it up to a category 2 or category 3. talking about these things right here they take if it's a category one pin that's on your attachment they size it up to something larger than that however there's spacing that's involved that becomes a real issue that's what we're going to talk about now so here's where the challenge lies is particularly particularly the lower dimensions okay you're inner to inner out of the outer doesn't matter on a category two quick hitch your id okay from inside to inside is 32 and three quarter inches you bounce over to one of these category 1 quick hitches it's going to be 27 and a quarter a full 5 inches narrower or larger but a 5 inch difference there and so that's going to be why a category 1 attachment doesn't fit into a category 2 quick hitch and vice versa you also have variation between the lower links to the top links on the category 2 here it's going to be just a hair under 15 inches from the bottom link down here to the top link on the category 2 it is welded in place this top hook presumably to add more structure rigidity strength to the overall system on the category one quick hitch you're gonna have a range for that top hook you know a max height a lowest point you're gonna have basically 14 and a half inches at the minimum to and a 17.5 inches so you have three inches of play room wiggle room from the bottom to the top gonna give you a couple quick dimensions here both on the hooks and then also back to the id on the inside of where you would mount one of these quick edges to your three-point hitch on a category two quick hitch these hooks measure about one and three quarter inches wide over on the category one these links are going to measure oh just shy of one and a quarter inches the last dimension i want to give you is actually going to be the id right in here where the quick hitch attaches to the three-point arm and this question or this dimension i guess i'm giving it to you because i've had a few folks that have actually had a stabilizer arm that doesn't come back and tie in somewhere mid-point on the three-point arm it actually comes all the way out and would tie in with a pin right up here kind of unusual and it took me a little while to catch on to that but they were concerned about having enough space inside here to not only have the three-point arm come but also their stabilizer arm come up and fit in there and then have a pin slide through and connect it all so if we take a look down here on the inside of a category one quick hitch your id of where that lower link is gonna go in there is gonna be an inch and not even three quarters probably an inch and 11 16 it looks like over here on a category two quick hitch we take a look here at the id and you're gonna have about an inch and seven eighths not quite 15 16. well hopefully that helps you know again if you have a category one tractor even as large as a 4066 r or something equivalent to it it's category one it's really simple get yourself one of these guys or if if you want to use the bushings go ahead and get one of these down here down to a little 10 25 little subcompact doesn't matter kubota mahendra massey coyote you name it they're all going to use those category 1. if you're into a larger utility style of tractor category 2 that's going to be what you want unfortunately there's going to be that small gap that's kind of a crossover you get to some of the smaller 5 series like a john deere 50 45e something like that or an mx series in kubota something equivalent to that you're going to have that category 1 category 2 crossover if you have category 1 attachments and also category 2 attachments you're going to have to get really creative on finding a solution to make them all mate up with one quick hitch again because of the spacing it's not only spacing that's on the quick itches here it's also spacing that's on the corresponding attachments that you had that hook up to the three point now don't forget goodworks tractors.com go ahead check them out on there shoot me an email we can place the order with you we ship them all over the country all the time these smaller ones again we can ship them ups ground right to your house you get one of these category twos it's gonna have to ship on a skid a small skid you know if you can find that commercial address or the the local destination terminal to pick it up at those are typically your cheapest options if you want to maximize the shipping savings stack a lot of stuff onto that same little skid there and you'll really minimize that savings when you spread it out across all the equipment you're buying if you would take a second give a thumbs up a thumbs down and also subscribe to the channel that would really help us out read through that description below for all sorts of helpful links on cool stuff for tractor owners and check out the other videos on the channel until next time stay safe we'll see you soon",
