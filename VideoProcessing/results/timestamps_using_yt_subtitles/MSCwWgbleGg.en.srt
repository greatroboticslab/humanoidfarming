1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,160
again historically drainage was just

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,480
thought of as getting rid of water as as

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,480
uh quickly and as efficiently as you

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,519
could uh to make the the crop ground

5
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,759
more productive but more recently with

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,320
some of the more climate streams that

7
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:14,040
we've seen where we still have those wet

8
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,520
intense uh Springs with intense

9
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,080
rainfalls but maybe the drier Summers

10
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,320
where we're actually seeing some crop

11
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,240
stress and yield loss due to not enough

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,760
precipitation uh we're looking at more

13
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,359
of a multi-purpose practice of drainage

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,679
water recycling where we're still

15
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,920
draining the agricultural lands but

16
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,480
instead of just draining all of that

17
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,559
water Downstream we're C capturing some

18
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,760
of it and storing it uh in a pond or

19
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,640
reservoir uh and then later on in the

20
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,760
season in the summer when it's maybe a

21
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,680
little drier and the crop uh needs more

22
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,520
water the land owner can then utilize

23
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,960
that captured water to irrigate it back

24
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,239
on uh to their Farmland so this is a

25
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,480
really exciting uh new type of project

26
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:50,800
um that we're seeing a lot of momentum

27
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,800
in
