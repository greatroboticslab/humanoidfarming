  "text": "uh welcome to the first beef and lamb new zealand north canterbury farming for profit event for 2021 really cool to have a few of you along uh i'm your new facilitator for the program sarah o'connell and i'm now working at the agri-business group based in lincoln where my main role is facilitation so tonight's webinar it's all on working dogs um and we have got with us laurie linning who is a vet through vet life in alexandra and she has been involved heavily in the teammate program um right from its get-go almost which was way back in 2003 the teammate program is a combination and a team a team work project really through massey university and the working dog center at massey university and vet life but um laurie will go into that in a little bit more detail she's been the lead veterinarian for the program since the very beginning of it so she's got plenty of information to share with us on the topics that we've worked on this evening so we're going to look into general health such as housing and vaccinating and worming feeding dogs so looking at what's the best type of feed to feed your dog is the dog that you've got does it need specific feed for the kind of work that it's doing and so on and then what are some of the ins and outs around buying a dog so laura's going to share her knowledge wisdom and insights around all of that information for the evening so um i've just seen a few additional people have jumped onto the call since we first started so welcome everybody um just a quick reminder keep your lines muted if you have questions pop them into the chat box function um and we'll get those answered as we go through so time to crack into a wee bit of content now so i'm going to hand over to laurie and laura you can introduce yourself uh introduce their teammate project a weebit and then we'll get into our content topics um or starting with uh general dog health yeah good evening everybody my name is laurie lenny and i'm a veterinarian in alexandria i've originally from canada i've been in new zealand for over over 30 years and one of my biggest passions certainly is working dogs i was a large animal vet for quite a few years before i ended up being um i became a really really interested in orthopedic surgery so with that comes lameness and all sorts of activities that involve our working dogs so from that we decided to look at um setting up a program give us a little bit more information of the general health and what exactly was going on with our working dogs because if you look at the information that we have available to us on the general husbandry and management of new zealand working dogs it amounts to about one small box in a warehouse so we decided to set up a basically a five to six year program that was um looking at just about everything we could with working dogs right from feeding vaccination worming um what they were fed how they were housed what kind of animals they worked with how many how many stock interactions they would have so basically we did full on recording for six rounds so those animals were hands-on examined by a veterinarian um six times over the course of those years um about four years from 2014 to 2018 and we ran an embedded parasite study as well as we used hay rex monitors for about 18 months and recorded some information there now there's been a lot of information come out of it there's still an awful lot more to come um so it's pretty exciting it doesn't seem like it's um earth shadowing for some of the for some people but um it's going to be referred to as a baseline project for for many years to come so um without further ado we might head into the first topic which is basic general health um so the working dog project was 126 owners involving about 640 dogs we sort of had in our heads we were going to look at about 300 but it soon morphed into something a bit larger so it was pretty interesting so um part of our big things with germa health is vaccination so the core vaccinations that we would look at are the vaccinations that we have available to us for dogs the core vaccine which is parvovirus december adeno2 virus or endovirus ii which is hepatitis and there is one also that um is involved in one of the viral types of kennel cough and and para influenza which is also a respiratory virus kennel cough vaccinations which usually are either entering a nasal or subcutaneous injection are mostly for the bacterial component of kennel cough and that's bordetella bronchosceptica we're currently um in most of our regions are undergoing or experiencing an outbreak of kennel cough right from christchurch south um with there is i'm sure there's a world further north from that we don't pay that much attention to it but uh certainly in the southern part of the south island we're certainly experiencing lots and lots of kennel cough both in pet and working dogs um the last one on that list is leptospirosis we don't tend to worry about it too much in the south island because it um doesn't tend to be much of a clinical issue that does become an issue if your animals go to the north island and require vaccination for that so general recommendations well best practice recommendations would be that you vaccinate for with the core vaccine and your big big one is parvovirus i'm sure that everybody knows about parvovirus that causes hemorrhagic diarrhea in puppies and can have quite a high mortality rate um very infectious and lasts a long time in the environment now that those core vaccines they should be started at between six to eight weeks and be vaccinated every four weeks until over 12 to 16 weeks and depending on what type of which vaccine you're using and what the recommendations are the current world small animal veterinary association recommends that your last vaccine be after 16 weeks of age to get over any residual maternal immunity that some um puppies might have that means that that immunity that they get from the colostrum will interfere with their ability to mount an immune response and they do recommend um that their last happy vaccination be after 16 months so after they have their set of puppy vaccinations they are usually vaccinated again at six to twelve months and then as an adult every three years as far as kennel cough goes that's um generally you can start whenever you like it only takes three days for intranasal and um 14 days after two injections to mount an immune response but those need to be boosted annually as does leptospirosis so those are the best practice recommendation in the real world well that doesn't tend to happen that much uh through our study we found 45 of dogs were vaccinated only as puppies so they had their course of puppy vaccinations and then they were vaccinated i never vaccinated again after that and another 12 were never vaccinated and then the remaining um 40 odd percent were um had some or variable types of vaccinations and um different vaccination intervals but working dogs are a little bit of a different situation compared to pet dogs in that they're usually living in fairly um you know areas that are far away from big populations of dogs so they don't tend to come in contact with a huge number of dogs except in a certain situation say of the shepherd who may move from property to property those dogs in particular are more likely to spread disease than the ones that live on the same farm for their entire lives um i think where we probably have to be very careful with those puppy vaccinations primal vaccination um is the one that probably caused the greatest incidence of disease in our working dogs and certainly uh that's a very good vaccine it has a really good protection against the disease and so usually if they have one to two vaccinations with carbo virus vaccination they if they do come down with the disease it's usually a mild form and certainly is often protective for a very long period of time um how long exactly those vaccinations are protective for while the drug companies you as adults give you every three years and they don't have um haven't gone beyond that to get the data um to prove how long those vaccinations last uh simply because it's a money related issue now the other thing i guess you can do or that is being done overseas is that people are doing um titans anybody titles to see if their dogs need to be vaccinated in new zealand that's cost um really cost prohibitive it's just cheaper to vaccinate than i suppose um but certainly there are people who don't want to vaccinate any more than they absolutely have to and that um that can be offered but so for your general working dog don't please don't miss those core vaccines as puppies um it's a way way easier thing to do to prevent the parvovirus than it is to treat it certainly a hang of a lot less expensive um certainly distemper and hepatitis we don't see too much of any more there is a little bit tinkering around but the amount of evidence that's in the population isn't really that significant um back from that we go to worming of pups and adults now this probably seems pretty pedestrian to a lot of people but it's amazing the variation in um husbandry that we found with worming um through a lot of people you know we would ask people generally you know do you worm your dogs yes we were my dogs and it was every combination of how often and when and certainly the sheep measles um treatments were something that really amazed me oh measles has been around for years and years and years and you think that everybody sort of would know how to sort that one out but but indeed um a lot of people just weren't aware of of how often and when you should be treating for that so starting out with pops pups should be wormed starting at two weeks of age um you know it's heartbreaking to to have a puppy brought in for a post-mortem and have it full of um for the worms that have a gut rupture or obstruction simply due to the fact that it's got massive aspirin loads or blood out due to footworm infection so again something that's that's pretty easy to prevent um certainly in the the parasite trials that we did run we we did found that they've um that the couple of wormers that are commonly used in dogs um don't tend to look like they're causing um resistance still effective and um you know not an issue to continue on with what we have so those pups start at two weeks of age and then um continue on every two weeks until they're 12 weeks of age as they get a little bit older they do develop some immunity and certainly have much less reinfection rate um as at after 12 weeks we go every once a month until they're six months of age and then as a as an adult we'll talk about down to that down below um certainly use a broad spectrum warmer make sure you're using something that treats the biggest thing in puppies is round worms astrid's um as they get older tapeworms are are more important but um certainly use a broad spectrum warmer in those puppies um as far as your adults goes there are two trains of thoughts there some people treat for shape measles and some people don't if your dog never has opportunity to um come in contact with either untreated offer or mate then there probably isn't a huge infection rate and those people believe that um because of those the way they manage their fee that they don't need that uh we i still come across dogs that have tapeworms um every now and then so i think still an important issue so as an adult if you're not going to worry about sheep nasals then for their own health they should be warmed once every three months with a broad spectrum warmer that's to get both roundworms and tapeworms most people still use still treat for sheep nasals and sheep measles needs to be treated every 30 days that's the the length of time it takes for infection so um basically you're looking to treat once a month with a tape warmer and every third month with a broad spectrum warmer to get you back into those um roundworm treatment for the animal's health so again if you look down below there it says month one use a broad spectrum warmer and then the two months in between you just need to use a tapeworm they're tapeworm medication by itself is much less expensive um and certainly an easier way to go financially than treating with broad spectrum warmers all the time um part three of general health i guess we're going to talk about housing and that was that was an interesting thing that we that we got to look at lots and lots of kennels um there was a lot you know a big variation of materials and types of kennels um some people are are getting pretty swish as far as what they're getting into with heated insulated kennels in some aspects in central attack where we can get off the cold in the winter time down into the to the um you know low 15s and 20s and it's um staying cool for those guys out there with without much protection so basically your housing will affect the energy requirement and quality and quantity of sleep that your dogs are getting in at night um and so that affects how much you need to feed them and also affects how much recovery your dog's going to get overnight and how tired they're going to be the next day and i guess i always i don't think it's a big jump to believe that um you know a dog like a person if you get a poor night's sleep then you're going to be more likely to be not paying attention at work and cause yourself injury during the day um so i guess the things that we maybe need to think about are um shelter and position of kennels so putting them in a place where they can get some sunshine on them in the day take them up and out of the wind if at all possible and certainly in some places um in central otago it's pretty tough because the wind comes from several different directions certainly in canterbury we know that to be a fact but there are ways and means of providing them wind protection especially in the wintertime when the winds are really really cold being some people would put carpet that they wrapped around the outside of the kennels so it broke the wind and that made a huge difference to the the warmth of the kennels themselves um removable doors or flaps so the dogs could go in and they had a chance to let their own body heat kennels up especially if they were uh insulated doesn't take an awful lot to keep them comfortable um bedding there was um about 44 of the people that we we canvassed used some type of bathing and that varied from um straw to sex stuff with wool or straw actual um burlap beds that that are pretty popular nowadays to to proper bedding carpet in the bottom um and you will always come across dogs that their very favorite thing to do is to as soon as you put that bidding in they like to tear it all out and those dogs become can become a bit of a problem i did come across one fella locally and he just kept trying different options until he found something that they that they would leave and most dogs um he said he could get them to figure out that actually they were better off with betting them without uh but he did have one dog in particular that there was no way that he could keep betting in his kennel and sometimes you know you might leave it for a week and then have a tanty and then throw his toys out of the cough and have no bedding is killing it again um insulation is starting to be more common there's about 14 of people that look at insulating their kennels be it using bats or styrofoam especially under the floor that's where we tend to get a lot of grease coming through may have nice tin walls but those floors are always flattered and they tend to let an awful lot of cold air up and in through the with the dogs actually sitting um and then we look at coats and there was 24 of our people that used coats and probably quite a few more people used coats by the time we were finished than than when we started um they were only just beginning to sort of becoming involved around about you know early to 2010 and certainly becoming more and more popular again you do come across some animals that especially puppies that are quite happy to take their quotes off but the more common story we hear is that the dogs line up to have their coats on it at night when they hold them open they run in and you know they run straight into the yolk of them to be strapped in for the night so there's a lot of people that are using a lot more people now using coats than they did before now we have had one question come in and i came up with the question myself um so does drontel cover sheep measles yes it does so brontells um got protection against both round worms and tape rooms so dronta will do that's your one that's the broad spectrum warmer the one that you would marry up with that in the months in between would be drum set which is just tape remember by itself or there's uh variable ones available out there now um called t you know they've your veterinarians will help you guide through those they've all stopped different ones we tend to i think there's there used to be an anchor tape warmer there's another it's just called tape warmer but that that tends to to cover what you want so drawn tall is a broad spectrum drawn foot is tape warmer only cold thanks laurie uh so the question that i had was also in relation to to worms and it was worms and puppies and my query was kind of around where did those puppies get those worms from so rounds are pretty clever um if you want to if you want to reinfect a puppy then the most sensible thing to do would be have your uh larva sitting on the teeth and that's exactly what happens so the eggs pass in the mother's feces and those larvae get um sit around the teeth puppies latch on and that's how they become infected they can't have direct fecal contamination but generally that's that's where their um their infection comes from and so certainly that are worming your mothers very very important that you know in the just the weeks up to leading up to when your is going to have puppies that you should be wearing her to help decrease that warm burden that she might have uh another question that has come in um what do you recommend to use for pups yeah so um round rooms are your are your big concerns so you just make sure that you've got a product that's that's going to cover that um there used to be some lovely suspensions that we don't have available to us anymore you can make suspensions or get them made for you by by crushing tablets up and um injecting them you know just instringing them into their mouths and you just got to be careful the doses that you're using based on the kilogram of coffee that you're you're treating because getting a getting a worm tablet down a puppy of two weeks of age ain't that easy cool so how do you know you've got the right dose uh that'll be that's basically um most worm tablets are are based on a on a per kilo basis so you weigh your puppies and goes to your heaviest puppy and you know if you're having trouble figuring out your amounts if if you're thinking of making a suspension make sure you talk to your battle sorted out for you it's not a problem like we make up um you know we'll crush a 10 kilogram tablet and and suspend it in 10 mls of water so it's one mil per 10 per um kg so if you've got a puppy that weighs 500 grams and you give them half a mil so there's those ways but please if you're not really happy with your math get someone to help you out with that thank you lori really awesome um you did a fantastic job and uh awesome amount of knowledge that you've got all right thank you thanks very much",
