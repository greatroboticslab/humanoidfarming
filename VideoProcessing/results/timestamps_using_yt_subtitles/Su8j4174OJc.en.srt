00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,080
welcome to sturgeon Creek farm this is a

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,200
family operation that we've done

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,370
Wilson's sturgeon Creek farm in Jackson

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:17,070
County has been in his family since 1831

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:20,550
before Jackson County was a county today

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,539
Wilson the eldest of three sons farms

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,609
these rolling hills with his three sons

8
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:29,429
formerly a diversified farm with cattle

9
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:32,099
hogs and tobacco Wilson now runs a

10
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:35,430
cow-calf operation with both commercial

11
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:38,250
and registered Angus cows he calls it a

12
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,440
typical Mountain farm without the bells

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,390
and whistles

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,570
Wilson is working with Jackson County AG

15
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,539
Extension agent David Coffey improving

16
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:51,059
her genetics in his breeding program but

17
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,399
it's about more than just that it's it's

18
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:54,870
the total operation it's it's how we're

19
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,180
managing forage is how we're going to

20
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,129
manage water how we're doing a nutrient

21
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,250
that was produced on the on the farm

22
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,809
through the manure how we manage that

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:06,930
how we manage our wildlife have a

24
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,720
manager our timber just a total program

25
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:14,700
Wilson has big goals for his farm for

26
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:16,979
improving forages fencing and rotational

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,500
grazing and letting the cattle do most

28
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,530
of the grazing while cutting some for

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,560
hay those ideas are in line with what

30
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:28,680
coffee has in mind and with this program

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,630
I wanted to focus on the broad entire

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,119
operation so everything from their

33
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,310
forages their genetics their you know

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,170
rotational grazing their even their

35
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,850
forestry and you know horticulture if

36
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,470
somebody's doing some of that so I

37
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,540
wanted to check to try to you know cover

38
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,090
everything and just help them to better

39
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,149
manage exactly what that producers doing

40
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,509
Wilson is one of about 17 producers who

41
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:54,090
started out in the program two years ago

42
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:57,990
including the happy Hollow Farm owner

43
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:02,280
Bob Hornsby is working to downsize his

44
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:05,520
cow numbers from 125 to about 50 to make

45
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,890
it more manageable he is adopting many

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,270
of the principles on his farm being

47
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,040
touted by coffee

48
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,570
to get on a total pastor program maybe

49
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,570
feed one month the other year or just

50
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:18,670
when it snows so I worked with David

51
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,140
quite a bit on that he did all soil test

52
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:23,110
last year and so we've got our soil

53
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:25,300
testing so we work very hard this year

54
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:26,160
to try to get everything hopefully we

55
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,340
don't have a drought

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,830
Hornsby plans to use rotational grazing

57
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,790
using nine pastures to move his cows

58
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:39,340
through to utilize the forages and

59
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,590
hopefully feeding less hay Hornsby and

60
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:45,100
Wilson are trying to follow the plan

61
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,810
designed by coffee and so far it seems

62
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,700
to be working I've been very pleased

63
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,530
with with the progress and the results

64
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,510
from it and what a lot of these guys are

65
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:54,040
doing they've made some real progress

66
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,510
and to look at it you might not think

67
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,460
it's that much difference but it was

68
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,920
just like we said here at me on 500

69
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,690
acres you make one one change in

70
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,670
management you know that influences the

71
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,470
whole operation a lot from the

72
