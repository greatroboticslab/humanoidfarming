00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,200
hey hey what's up garden friends jeff

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,920
here how's everybody doing i hope you're

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,200
doing well

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,599
i am great kind of a rainy

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,240
drizzly day out here so doing things

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,559
from

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,920
under the umbrella the broken umbrellas

8
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,960
hopefully that'll provide the protection

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,119
needed to

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,640
do this thing and not destroy the camera

11
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,039
sitting out here with a whole bunch of

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,320
lovely plants on the table ones that i'm

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,480
really excited to talk about

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,599
really common plants ones that i do get

15
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,199
questions about

16
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,760
fairly often the and amanda villas

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,680
diplodenia mandevillas both of them are

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,120
fantastic plants they make great annuals

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,559
they're really good perennials where

20
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,480
they can be perennial

21
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,600
i love these plants for their beautiful

22
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,920
glossy green

23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,200
foliage their abundance of flowers these

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,600
plants will flower

25
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,559
and flower and flower they just keep

26
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,440
growing and

27
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,239
they're very low fuss they don't need an

28
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,320
awful lot

29
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,840
they don't need deadheading fertilizing

30
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,719
should be minimal with them the

31
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,160
pollinators

32
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,559
love these plants and they can be used

33
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,320
as fillers spillers climbers

34
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,239
lots and lots and lots of versatility

35
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,760
with how the plants can be utilized you

36
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,520
would think that because they're

37
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,200
pretty easy and simple to grow that that

38
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,720
means this should be a short video

39
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,479
there's not a tent to say about them

40
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,320
and that might be the case i'm going to

41
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,400
go over the quick care for people who

42
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,840
don't want like a long video and

43
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,960
don't need a ton of details about the

44
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,479
plants they just know what to do with

45
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,880
them i'll do the quick care

46
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,880
shortly here and then it just go over

47
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,240
like the differences between mandevillas

48
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,479
diplodinius

49
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,079
some tips for care and just go a little

50
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,799
bit more in depth about

51
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,840
some of the nuances propagation leaf

52
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,920
drop yellowing

53
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,240
those sorts of things let's hit that

54
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,920
quick care for starters diplodinias and

55
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,240
mandevillas carrie's gonna be pretty

56
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,079
much

57
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,600
identical for these two plants we'll

58
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,040
talk about why later

59
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,119
they're typically regarded as hardy

60
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,640
zones nine and up some sources will say

61
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,640
zone ten they don't like

62
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,840
cold weather and frost so if you have

63
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,280
frost and colds

64
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,119
probably not gonna be a perennial for

65
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,399
you maybe they will be go over that a

66
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:58,479
little bit more in depth later

67
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,119
but for part to full sun they are sun

68
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,560
lovers but in areas with really dry air

69
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,240
some afternoon shade might be a good

70
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,159
idea just to help avoid the foliage

71
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,200
getting kind of burnt up and crispy

72
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,039
they like their soil to stay

73
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,280
consistently moist but if you let the

74
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,440
top inch to two inches of soil dry out

75
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,800
between waterings that's usually okay

76
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,160
once these are established if you're

77
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,760
growing them in the ground they can be

78
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,040
very drought tolerant they aren't going

79
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,400
to be as demanding for

80
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,920
watering if you have them in the ground

81
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,360
versus in a pot gonna need to water them

82
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,400
more if they're in a pot personally i

83
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,760
don't do a ton when it comes to

84
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,440
fertilizing these plants too much

85
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,800
nitrogen can inhibit flowering so i just

86
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,560
make sure that there's a good continuous

87
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,280
release fertilizer with them when i pop

88
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,720
them up

89
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,720
and then usually i'll repeat that maybe

90
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,239
three months later mid-summer

91
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,160
give them just a little bit more of the

92
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,599
top dressing size is really variable

93
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,319
with these plants that's a hard one to

94
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,599
talk about

95
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,440
generally the diplodinies are going to

96
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,840
be smaller with more rounded habit the

97
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,720
mandevilla the vines those are going to

98
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,480
vine up to 10 feet if not more like they

99
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,599
can find more than that just depends on

100
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,440
which type you're growing because there

101
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,840
are a lot of different cultivars out

102
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,280
there

103
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,879
these are plants that don't particularly

104
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,959
mind being pop-bound

105
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,400
i really only re-pop these plants when

106
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:01,599
it gets to a point where i've noticed

107
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,959
that when i water them

108
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,400
they're not really responding to being

109
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,879
watered when it's difficult to keep them

110
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,239
hydrated that's when it's time to repot

111
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,920
or if you notice roots growing off the

112
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,720
top and bottom of the pot that's another

113
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,640
good way to tell

114
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,200
sap can cause skin irritation so maybe

115
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,840
wear gloves the toxicity on them is

116
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,879
considered

117
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,879
low but can cause problems so keep it

118
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,920
away from curious mouths just to be safe

119
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,440
there it is fun easy plants that's like

120
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,239
essentially everything you need to know

121
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,280
about growing them they're not too fussy

122
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,080
what's the difference between a

123
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,159
mandevilla and a diplodynia i have

124
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,680
all of them here in front not all there

125
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,560
are tons of different diplodinius and

126
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,560
mandevillas

127
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,760
but i have diplodynia and mandevilla

128
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,920
here on the table

129
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,599
diplodinias tend to have more of a

130
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,599
mounded growth habit to them

131
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,959
so if you put them up against something

132
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,400
you can train them to climb but they're

133
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,760
not going to climb very much

134
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,239
whereas amanda villa like over here see

135
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,920
nice big mandevilla that's a vine they

136
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,000
are going to climb and climb and climb

137
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,280
they come in all different colors and

138
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,040
leaf shapes like you can see this

139
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,319
mandevilla in the back is the more

140
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,959
classic mandevilla

141
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,959
has much much much larger leaves on it

142
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,120
and larger flowers they don't flower

143
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,480
quite as prolifically as the other ones

144
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,120
that have the smaller flowers like i

145
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,439
just showed

146
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,400
but their leaves are so cool i really

147
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,239
like both of them

148
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,639
this one right here i believe is an

149
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,040
alice dupont but i'm not positive which

150
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,759
is just

151
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,520
a classic form of mandavilla that's been

152
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,000
around for a long time

153
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,040
this other one i think it just said like

154
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,040
pink

155
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,400
i don't know what kind it is it's a pink

156
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,680
mandevilla and then

157
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,440
over here i absolutely love

158
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,120
this one that's back here where's its

159
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,479
tag i can show you the tag that is the

160
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,560
sun parasol

161
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,000
apricot which is like only kind of in

162
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,479
focus this particular

163
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,199
one the flowers start off this fun

164
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,240
peachy

165
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,400
or apricot like color it's a very light

166
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,080
light pinkish orange and then they fade

167
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,000
to a kind of a creamy

168
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,759
light yellow color i enjoy that a lot

169
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,199
because you get multiple colors on one

170
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,440
plant there's no such thing as an

171
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,600
ugly mandevilla or diplodinia they're

172
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,280
all beautiful plants the mandevillas

173
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,800
also will often times have larger

174
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,400
flowers on them like you see back here

175
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,960
with alice dupont

176
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,479
that's not always as true anymore though

177
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,919
because there's so many cultivars that

178
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,280
have come out that have that like you

179
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,440
see the flowers

180
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,199
right here on this manda villa are

181
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,240
essentially identical

182
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,720
to this diplodonia right here see that

183
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,000
they're basically the same flower the

184
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,320
leaves are even pretty similar

185
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,919
too they're native to central america

186
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,600
and i believe parts of northern

187
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,360
south america so those are the main

188
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,360
differences some difference in flower

189
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,280
size depending on the cultivar but it's

190
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,720
mostly mandevillas or vines whereas

191
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,120
diplodinias are more like

192
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,160
little shrubs all diplodinias are in the

193
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,680
mandevilla

194
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,280
family and that's why they care on them

195
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,639
is basically the same there will be some

196
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,400
differences because

197
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,759
well one's a vine and sometimes you have

198
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,440
to take some different things into

199
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,280
consideration with vines like if you

200
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,639
have them planted up against the wall

201
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,720
you don't want afternoon sun on them

202
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,919
because they could get baked they could

203
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,680
get kind of crispy

204
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,360
particularly with the ones like the

205
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,120
amabilis types or the

206
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,280
alice dupont that have those really big

207
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
leaves sometimes in the afternoon sun

208
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,039
that can be an issue if there's a big

209
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,680
reflective surface nearby or right

210
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,759
behind them

211
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,520
and then with the diplodinius sometimes

212
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,039
their growth can end up being

213
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,639
somewhat stringy it'll look like it

214
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,919
wants to vine you can either cut that

215
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,880
off to encourage the plant to keep

216
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,400
staying bushy

217
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,680
or you can go ahead and put a support

218
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,280
behind it and let it do a little bit of

219
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,400
vining but again it's not going to be

220
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,160
anything like

221
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,680
on the actual mandevillas those are

222
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,720
going to vine far far

223
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,560
far more aggressively than a diplodynia

224
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,319
some diplodinius have been hybridized

225
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,720
and cultivated well enough that like

226
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,160
they

227
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,919
hopefully won't even do that they'll

228
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,600
just maintain their bushy shape they're

229
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,120
plants that do appreciate the warmth

230
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,120
they like get pretty toasty when

231
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,080
temperatures drop below 45 degrees

232
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,759
fahrenheit

233
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,600
i try and make sure to cut back on the

234
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,960
watering i'm much more cautious with the

235
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,000
amount of moisture around their roots

236
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,560
because they're going to be more prone

237
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,039
to rotting if it's cool and if they're

238
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,039
damp

239
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,720
too much fertilizer too much nitrogen

240
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,000
can inhibit their flowering

241
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,599
it can also sometimes cause some

242
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,199
discoloration on the foliage though i'll

243
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,240
go over a leaf drop in yellow and leaves

244
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,800
and all that

245
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,680
here in a moment less sun is also going

246
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,720
to mean

247
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,360
less flowers so they can go part to full

248
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,720
sun

249
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,560
but the more sun they get the more

250
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,199
they're going to flower depending on

251
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,039
where you live

252
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,360
afternoon sun might be a bit much for

253
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,080
them so just keep an eye out i generally

254
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,080
prefer these

255
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,440
get some filtered sun in the afternoon

256
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,280
and just bright direct sun in the

257
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,759
morning time but my yard there's a lot

258
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,599
of

259
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,520
pavement and brick and lots of

260
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,440
reflective surfaces so that's why

261
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,599
sometimes i have issues with scorching

262
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,680
i see these planted out as annuals all

263
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,479
over the place where i live and they get

264
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,360
bright bright bright direct sun all day

265
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,199
long

266
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,120
and they're totally fine so it's gonna

267
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,479
be somewhat region specific that's why i

268
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,199
said you just kind of have to evaluate

269
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,400
your area

270
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,479
i already mentioned they don't need to

271
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,080
be repotted very often they kind of like

272
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,440
to be root bound but one thing to keep

273
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,120
in mind with them

274
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,120
particularly with the mandevilla the

275
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,240
vine more than the diplodynia

276
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,919
is to be cautious about right where that

277
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,120
root or not the root right where the

278
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,960
stem

279
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,360
comes to the soil when you're repotting

280
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,360
the plant it's a good idea to keep that

281
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,800
really well supported when you re-pop

282
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,520
these when you pull this out from its

283
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,440
can

284
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,520
if there's too much disturbance in this

285
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,960
area and in the root zone in general

286
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,800
they're going to be far more prone to

287
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,520
leaf drop to dropping some leaves and

288
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,319
throw in a fit when they get repotted so

289
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,479
it is helpful

290
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,720
with these vines to try and disturb the

291
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,960
roots as little as possible

292
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,560
when repotting them if the roots are

293
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,319
wrapped and twisted

294
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,599
root bound then you might want to go

295
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,120
ahead and give them a little tickle and

296
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,880
try and loosen that up and just break up

297
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,000
that circling habit

298
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,320
but you don't have to go too

299
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,159
aggressively with it just lightly try

300
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,080
and loosen it up and that's only if it's

301
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,159
really really like hardcore

302
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,399
wrapped in a circle would i do that

303
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,720
otherwise i try my best to just

304
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,720
maintain whatever root shape is there

305
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,640
plop it into a new pot with maybe

306
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,839
a couple of inches of extra space on the

307
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,839
outside diameter

308
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,600
refill with an all-purpose potting mix

309
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,680
that is generally fine for them

310
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,279
they aren't nutrient hog so they do okay

311
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,920
with that water them in and they're good

312
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,120
to go

313
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,399
and a little bit of continuous sweet

314
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,360
fertilizer they appreciate that i

315
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,279
already talked about that the

316
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,000
diplodonius and mandevillas

317
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,360
oh hello camera both of them do

318
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,279
propagate very easily

319
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,800
m cuttings from green growth put some

320
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,920
breeding hormone on it pop it into a

321
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,519
moist soil

322
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,200
and they should take off or you can take

323
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,279
the growth and wear it onto

324
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,200
a fresh soil that maintains moisture cut

325
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,000
a little notch in there maybe use a

326
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,839
rooting hormone

327
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,120
and bury where you made that cut and

328
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,640
that should take root and the plant will

329
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,200
take off from there and you can sever it

330
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
and

331
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,880
keep it going that way that way you

332
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,240
don't have to risk losing the cutting

333
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,040
it'll just keep getting some nutrient

334
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,600
from the plant while

335
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,800
getting rooted really simple to do but a

336
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,120
lot of these are

337
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,080
trademarked and owned because they've

338
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,519
been cultivated

339
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,200
always put a lot of hard work and time

340
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,040
into coming up with their own varieties

341
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,560
of diplodonia's mandevillas so

342
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,839
it's a good idea to check the legality

343
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,640
behind doing that if you want to

344
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,880
propagate them

345
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,560
particularly for resale right like

346
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,240
somebody else owns it so gotta be

347
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,480
careful there i've never had many pest

348
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,279
issues with diplodonia's or mandavillas

349
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,120
but they

350
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,640
can't be prone to just the commonpass

351
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,880
aphids whiteflies

352
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,640
uh smealybug i haven't heard much about

353
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,640
scale comment down below

354
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,839
and let us know what problems you've had

355
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,160
with them if any

356
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,519
i really i haven't had any issues that i

357
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,040
can think of as far as pests are

358
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,800
concerned with them even when i've taken

359
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,800
them in the house for the winter time

360
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,000
still they generally just kept on going

361
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,839
the mealybugs and everything else

362
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,800
usually stay away from them however i

363
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,160
have a lot of plants

364
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,440
so that could just mean that i have

365
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,079
other plants around that the mealybugs

366
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,920
favor

367
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,279
so that so my experience there doesn't

368
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,880
really mean anything like i said comment

369
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,519
down below so we can all learn together

370
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,640
from that one

371
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,880
the main things they had to ask about

372
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,680
with them is leaf drop or yellowing

373
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,079
their cold hardiness and overwintering

374
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,000
indoors beef trap is a complicated one

375
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,200
there can be a lot of different causes

376
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,560
for it so i'm just going to

377
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,240
run through all the different

378
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,440
possibilities the different things that

379
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,120
could be causing them to

380
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,040
drop their leaves for starters there's

381
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,000
root rot which would typically mean the

382
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,760
plant has been over

383
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,680
watered or just the roots have been

384
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,320
overly disturbed that can cause

385
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,920
leaf drop and yellowing as well over

386
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,480
watering will cause yellowing

387
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,880
correct or inconsistent fertilizing and

388
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,120
watering that can also cause yellowing

389
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,880
and also just excessive fertilizer that

390
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,920
can cause issues with the foliage and

391
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,519
the flowering as well

392
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,279
cold temperatures that's another

393
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,560
possibility extreme changes in

394
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,160
temperature if you have them indoors

395
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,000
they're near a draft that could be a

396
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,200
problem this is really big for leaf drop

397
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,680
and leaf yellow wings there are a lot of

398
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,440
different

399
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,279
causes that could be going on there's

400
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,279
the process of eliminations figuring

401
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,480
that one out when growing them indoors i

402
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,839
make sure that these get

403
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,440
as much sun as possible like basically

404
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,440
all day long so a south

405
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,720
south fest facing window i'm probably

406
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,279
keeping them a foot or two away from the

407
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,720
window

408
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,880
especially in winter if it's really cool

409
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,959
and drafty and i don't water them

410
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,000
at all the same during winter as i do

411
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,320
during the summer

412
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,920
i just give them a little drink maybe

413
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,519
like every 10 days or so

414
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,360
just let it go through the pot about

415
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,040
once and i let the top two

416
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,720
to sometimes even four inches maybe up

417
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,760
to 50 of the soil

418
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,880
dry out it's one of those things you

419
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,240
kind of have to watch the plant they'll

420
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,519
get a little bit wilty and let you know

421
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,040
when they need to be watered

422
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,560
and then you can kind of learn the

423
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,360
routine and the habit of the plant and

424
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,880
how often you'll

425
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,480
need to water it it'll get a little bit

426
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,680
more leggy and kind of funky looking

427
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,200
when you have them in the house

428
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,880
if you have really long winters like i

429
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,399
do but when i bring them back outside

430
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,120
give them a cut back and get them into

431
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,040
the sun and they

432
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,040
pop right back out and look wonderful as

433
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,800
far as overwintering them is concerned

434
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,079
oh i'm almost out of memory

435
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,200
i'm going to go through this really fast

436
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,000
as far as overwintering them is

437
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
concerned

438
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,480
they don't like frost they don't like

439
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,160
cold temperatures it's why they're hardy

440
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,680
zone 9 or 10 and up

441
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,200
but if you have really short winters

442
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,200
like maybe just a month or so

443
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,800
you can usually mulch about the first

444
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,440
foot or so of stem coming out of the

445
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,120
ground

446
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,639
and then when the heat returns pull that

447
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,160
back and sometimes the growth will come

448
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,240
back out of there i know people who have

449
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,920
had these in zone 8 like 8b

450
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,920
and they've returned for them okay

451
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,279
that's it lovely beautiful plants
