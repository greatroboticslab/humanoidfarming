1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
time we're gonna go through some of the

2
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:05,580
question and answers there's been

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,259
several posted on the QA farms some have

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,750
been answered in text form but we're

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,840
gonna go through them orally here as

6
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:21,150
well let's go bill first one of the

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:23,400
questions was on well I think this

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:26,880
question ended up going to both both

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,939
bill and Doug but you know the the waist

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,260
being land applied and I think the

11
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,960
alligator's you showed us the

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,450
demonstration of the irrigation duck

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,079
bill are there some of the solid

14
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:44,190
material some of the solid solid matter

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,820
from the nutrients well you know reality

16
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,300
there the biggest part of waste that we

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,460
get from fishes after processing and

18
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:56,579
there's there's actually two things we

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,649
do with that well is more than that we

20
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,960
we have a large mink industry here and

21
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,629
that that's one of the primary one of

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,519
the best resources to use for the mink

23
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:09,080
industry whether whether you like mink

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,390
or not farming but but that's one thing

25
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,340
we have a large company here that makes

26
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,909
fish hydrolysate and I actually make

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:20,549
that two and basically it's it's

28
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,850
digesting the everything that you don't

29
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:26,659
eat so that's the head though the

30
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,030
innards and scales everything the skin

31
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:33,210
whatever you don't eat is digested in a

32
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,549
cold digestion process and you make fish

33
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,700
hydrolysate which is quite a bit

34
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:42,329
different than the stuff you can buy in

35
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,689
the store this is a it doesn't smell as

36
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:48,840
bad it's not cooked or any of the

37
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:51,390
nutrients taken out of it so it's uh if

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,450
you can buy fish hydrolysate made that

39
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:58,649
way it's an organic supplement and and

40
00:01:54,450 --> 00:02:00,420
people that are in the the gardening

41
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:04,079
business the flower gardens and the

42
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,570
vegetable gardens they just love it and

43
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,759
then they can also be used for also

44
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,310
feels and you can be written guys with

45
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,870
the deer farms you might be interested

46
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,890
also love it because are there food

47
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,750
plots

48
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,910
are as a high priority item and I'm

49
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:24,800
trying to think of another but anyway I

50
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:27,450
also have the high school's use it in

51
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,280
hydroponics so we can take fish I draw

52
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,760
the sate and use it directly and get rid

53
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,110
of all the other fertilizers and they

54
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,480
they actually like it better than any

55
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:42,090
other first synthetic fertilizer that

56
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,980
they've bought so but then the other

57
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,280
side of that is you can directly apply

58
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,950
fish waste right and soil to and that's

59
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,440
in large processing facilities that's

60
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:57,810
what they do so there's it's almost

61
00:02:52,440 --> 00:03:02,610
nothing wasted on that site with

62
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:04,560
alligator farming the waste the nutrient

63
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:06,330
material can be land applied and you

64
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,150
demonstrate an irrigation system have

65
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:13,739
you seen alligator manure being applied

66
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:15,239
using other systems yes all right yeah

67
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,060
actually Ron one of the things he was

68
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:21,860
doing was trying to precipitate although

69
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:25,019
he was not really looking that as a as a

70
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:28,260
fertilizer more of an industrial source

71
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:32,549
of phosphate the I was looking at the

72
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:36,170
analyses the if you had some kind of

73
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:39,690
solid separation the solid portion of

74
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:45,360
the the pond waste was almost all

75
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:47,340
phosphorus and pretty good that it's

76
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,640
basically all phosphorus and then the

77
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:54,420
liquid portion is about looks like about

78
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:59,070
a hundred to one PK into the phosphate

79
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:01,380
so it's uh if you could separate the

80
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,120
solids and store it in a way that would

81
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,489
or maybe digest it so they wouldn't

82
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,310
smell so much that would make a very

83
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:11,070
good phosphorus fertilizer that could be

84
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:14,630
transported long ways and for cropping

85
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:18,840
systems the through irrigation basically

86
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:21,150
if you separate the solids then you you

87
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,510
could apply to an irrigation system like

88
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:27,100
a center pivot so I know there's no

89
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,600
there's nothing that would keep you

90
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,820
from using that other than the odor

91
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,410
control thanks Brandon to you Doug just

92
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,110
brought up transportation of manure and

93
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:41,020
the moisture content all the manure

94
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,270
plays into that you compared the

95
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:46,000
moisture content between the different

96
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,680
types of servants you want to comment on

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,900
that and and the application of that

98
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,300
transport transport ability of the

99
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,940
manure I will and that was one question

100
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,550
that came up when the QA typed in and I

101
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,630
tried there's fun about a minute ago one

102
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,720
of the big things would see especially

103
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:04,180
in the county where I am in Texas is we

104
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,840
used to be the largest dairy capital in

105
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:08,200
Texas

106
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:10,450
if since moves to the Panhandle the big

107
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,300
thing about dairy especially dairy

108
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:16,330
manure dairy excellent the limitation is

109
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:18,400
water content it is only viable for a

110
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,170
couple of miles and after that the

111
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,960
break-even no longer make sense for

112
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,430
application so we're not even as worried

113
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,350
with yes there are environmental

114
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,510
regulations there environmental concerns

115
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,730
one application but a lot of that

116
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:33,460
environmental concern becomes we only

117
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,140
have a finite area where it can be

118
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,590
applied and then we can't apply it any

119
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,870
further

120
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:39,940
that's really and I can't say that any

121
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,190
deer farming operations are making use

122
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,650
of this right now but that's where I see

123
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:46,750
the next big thing the big opportunity

124
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:48,430
is this is a dry manure you don't have

125
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,740
the energy input of drying it down

126
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:52,480
before it can be used so we've got

127
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:57,730
already made products that all it needs

128
00:05:52,480 --> 00:06:00,040
to be done is transport thank you Bill a

129
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:03,340
question to you reiterating and that

130
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:05,350
came through the through the Q&A with

131
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,330
aquaculture what are thoughts about

132
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:11,680
keeping prices competitive with foreign

133
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:14,200
markets such as Southeast Asia well you

134
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:19,420
know right now 90 some percent of

135
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:22,300
everything that we do is import it it is

136
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,100
it's strange very difficult to get our

137
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,130
arms on it and I've been working on that

138
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,630
for about twenty years

139
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:31,720
fortunately I'm raising a product it

140
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:34,720
doesn't have any competition but I the

141
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:37,360
biggest one I see is that people are are

142
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,610
growing as tilapia and a lot of them are

143
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,020
are doing tilapia or they have to do it

144
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:45,760
indoors or

145
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:47,680
even for assault but tilapia is warm

146
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:51,460
water I think about 80 degrees is

147
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,800
optimum but when you come to process

148
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,590
it's almost none of it is process the

149
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,930
United States and that's a killer

150
00:06:56,590 --> 00:07:02,740
they have another double set of bones

151
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:05,620
and I've been trying to figure out what

152
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:09,040
to do with it because of all the big

153
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:12,220
markets are the big tilapia producers

154
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,610
that I know of none of them sell their

155
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:19,000
fish process and that means that they

156
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:20,470
all have to go to live markets and and I

157
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,590
never even would have thought of that

158
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:27,670
but so you're you're strapped with a

159
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:29,560
large trucking live fish to live markets

160
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:33,850
and there's only a few big cities that

161
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:36,820
can take large quantities of that so

162
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:40,840
that I mean that's just one species I

163
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:43,830
know for a long long time and I'm

164
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:46,390
straying out of my my expertise in

165
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:49,390
catfish farmers were doing real well and

166
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:52,480
then they had import problems and they

167
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:54,910
had some serious problems but it's

168
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,410
always going to be a problem and and I

169
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,750
work with the North Central Regional

170
00:07:56,410 --> 00:08:02,220
aquaculture center I'm on their board

171
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:04,600
and we are constantly looking for

172
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:07,840
species to raise that we can do

173
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:10,240
economically and that's the key so as

174
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,380
you saw in my church a lot of the fish

175
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,350
that we're raising now are

176
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:17,580
non-indigenous species to our our state

177
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:20,740
and we're trying to do more and more

178
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:24,790
shrimp is coming in I think Marcus first

179
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:27,610
shrimp will be very strong if we can get

180
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:30,430
the technology down if we can get the

181
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:33,220
perch going that'll be big we're working

182
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:36,960
on walleye too and the perch and a

183
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:40,660
walleye earned there's no competition

184
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:42,910
from agent imports at all so I mean

185
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,010
there's gotta pick your species but you

186
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:48,220
have to pick your economics too and it's

187
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:49,660
not that simple I don't know about the

188
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,150
rest of the audience but through all

189
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:54,100
three presentations I kept hearing some

190
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,730
very strong similarities to those

191
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,510
species

192
00:08:54,730 --> 00:09:00,550
we are a lot more familiar with Doug a

193
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,959
question for you as I look outside my

194
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:03,910
window here in Minnesota is the

195
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:07,060
snowstorm and the blizzard has started

196
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:12,160
why are the alligators in Louisiana

197
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:14,019
generally kept under roots I think when

198
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,820
I was researching for this I think most

199
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:19,660
of the ones in Florida are also kept

200
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:22,630
under roof I think it's because they

201
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:24,040
they won't escape for one thing and the

202
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,410
other thing is probably they get a

203
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:30,940
better product if they can control the

204
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:32,949
climate heat is you saw those buildings

205
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,570
were very well insulated but I don't

206
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:36,100
think heat is that big of a problem for

207
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:38,560
them particularly if they have the

208
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,810
sprinklers but they get a better control

209
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,560
over the the leather which is their

210
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:48,029
moneymaker

211
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:55,269
mostly brand another question for you

212
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:58,029
with with the in Texas or larger region

213
00:09:55,269 --> 00:10:00,519
if you're familiar with it what is the

214
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:02,170
the main for the different species of

215
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:04,389
servants what what is the main purpose

216
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,970
of raising room is it for the hunting or

217
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:08,470
is it for the for the meat rather the

218
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:11,319
hunting is always going to be the

219
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:14,560
biggest deal especially in this state

220
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:17,319
but I know in other areas to big-game

221
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,360
ranchers have popped up and it's

222
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:21,970
becoming a bigger thing we're losing

223
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,680
some public lands so there are not as

224
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,180
many native populations we've gotten

225
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,980
disease issues chronic wasting disease

226
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:30,040
being the biggest one among service

227
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,290
they're taking out some of the wild

228
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,019
populations so it's going to be the big

229
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,149
game army marketable meat it's always

230
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:41,199
going to take a second place to it if

231
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:42,850
for no other reason than the markets not

232
00:10:41,199 --> 00:10:45,670
seeing any more questions come up in the

233
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,779
QA so I think well we'll start wrapping

234
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,410
it up here I want to thank our three

235
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:50,490
speakers

236
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:52,720
Brandon Doug and Bill for sharing their

237
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,519
sharing their background and their

238
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:57,600
insights into these less than typical

239
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:57,600
species for the rest of us
