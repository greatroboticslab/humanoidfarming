00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,100
2012.

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,320
in the next week or so you'll be

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,300
receiving the October November issue of

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,880
farm equipment magazine that features

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,380
the 2013 dealer Outlook and Trends

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,840
report

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,700
this is based on the survey of North

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,340
American dealers we conduct annually

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,160
just prior to the farm progress show in

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,620
Boone Iowa in early September I had the

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:45,840
opportunity to travel for a day with

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,059
some investment fund managers visiting

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,340
farm equipment dealers in Iowa

16
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,079
at some point during one of the meetings

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,239
someone asked me what I thought about

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,579
equipment sales in the year ahead

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,980
based on my conversations with dealers

20
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,620
at the time I told them I thought sales

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,180
might be down as much as 10 percent

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,220
several times throughout the rest of

23
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,580
that day I was asked why I thought sales

24
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,380
might decline in 2013. I told them that

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,360
dealers didn't seem to be as confident

26
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,360
this year as they were last year at this

27
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,100
time and I pointed out that my comments

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,580
at that time were based solely on

29
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,860
empirical data it it had become obvious

30
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,439
to me that the impact of the widespread

31
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,259
drought of 2012 and the farmer's

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,259
reaction to it were the biggest unknowns

33
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,900
going into the new selling season

34
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:36,479
now the results of the annual survey add

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,820
more Credence to those comments last

36
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,340
year at this time 55.3 percent of

37
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,560
dealers surveyed forecast new equipment

38
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,159
sales would rise by two percent or more

39
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,740
this year that percentage fell to 42.6

40
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,540
percent the percentage of dealers who

41
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,540
believe sales would decline by two

42
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:59,399
percent or more a year ago was only 11.5

43
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:01,439
percent versus 26.4 percent this year

44
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,240
but there were other indications from

45
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,399
this year's survey that showed that

46
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,560
dealers are not nearly as confident as

47
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,840
they were a year ago

48
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,239
one was the number of pre-sales this

49
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,180
year versus last year according to our

50
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,940
most recent survey almost identical

51
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,540
percentages of dealers say their early

52
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,160
orders are down this year 24.9 percent

53
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,700
of those dealers said they were down

54
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:29,400
compared with 25.3 percent who reported

55
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,220
their pre-sales are up compared with a

56
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,800
year ago on top of this less than six

57
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,440
percent of dealers surveyed said they

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:41,360
don't expect a price increase on new

59
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,700
equipment in 2013 but a big majority

60
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,099
86.4 percent believe price hikes for new

61
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,959
Machinery will range from one percent to

62
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:51,540
six percent

63
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,340
on a positive note more than 82 percent

64
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,680
of the dealers say that order

65
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,080
consolations were about at the same

66
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,420
level as they were last year with only

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,040
about 10 percent reporting cancel orders

68
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:07,860
were higher compared with 2011.

69
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,800
dealer comments were also telling about

70
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,379
how dealers felt about their business

71
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,560
prospects for 2013.

72
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:19,860
one Indiana dealer put it this way farm

73
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,319
income is such an unknown for 2013 and

74
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,959
I'm not sure where it will end up I've

75
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,060
given my answers to the survey but I'm

76
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,860
not confident they will be accurate As

77
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,440
Time plays out

78
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:34,620
I plan to be very cautious in ordering

79
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,319
in 2013 until I have a clear picture of

80
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:39,360
the conditions we will be dealing with

81
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,580
all of this is not to say that we're

82
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,280
looking at a difficult year in 2013.

83
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,040
what it does say is there seem to be

84
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,900
more unknowns this year than usual for

85
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,420
dealers to think about

86
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,700
