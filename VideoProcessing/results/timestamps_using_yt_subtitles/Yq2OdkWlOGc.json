  "text": "thank you Jason uh I'm like Ray uh the word noil does not on my slide I start with the word residue first it's residue that protects the soil it's residue that's helping feed the soil system it's residue is what I want to keep out there now Dwayne's talking after me so I'm not sure what all he's going to cover but I had the benefit of watching these three guys in front of me to know what they're talked about and I actually had two different presentations loaded for today and the one was a more in-depth on cover crops how to and what all all it can do for you the other was more for them the residue and soil structure well in the original program came out Jim Herman was going to talk more about cover crops what' he do he switched more to soil biology and I'm like or soil compaction so I'm like all right which presentation this is a blend it's called adjust on the go the beauty of PowerPoint and computer so anyway when it comes down to it I make a statement Point Blank Jim talked about so compaction statement point blank is tillage has never built soil structure tillage destroys the existing soil structure now if you got a bad structure like compaction and you can reach it with your tillage implant and you break up the soil structure the bad compaction that's good right but what if you have a good structure or what if you have the compassion and you break that up you broke up all the structures there the next pass in the field can create more compaction it's a vicious circle when it comes to tillage but when I look at tillage and I started thinking about Water Management years ago there's some researchers saying studying the soil said you know the average silt B soil holds 2 inch of water per foot you tell it 6 inches deep that's one inch water affected about half of it goes away that's how these kind of numbers show up now half inch in an average year before planting who cares maybe I have irrigation maybe I got another spring rain coming maybe the soil's too wet anyway and you got to till it to dry it out you've all heard that never do that by the way but when you start thinking about it what if we did in the olden days there was three four tillage passes half inch per trip we dried out 2 Ines of water remember 2 inches per foot the olden days everybody had fur openers and their Planters trying to push away dry so and clouds trying to find moisture to plant into that's expensive half inch per trip now very few of us do four trips anymore pre-plan you know some guys are down on one trip some guys are one in the fall one in the spring whatever but I start looking at that where's my residue where's my so biological life think about what else is going on out there without residue there to keep the wind off Sol surf we have wind erosion problems without residue there absorb raindrop impact that energy detaches those solil particles then they start washing on us you we still got a triple whammy here we got the yellow unproductive soil up there because all the good stuff washed away we got the gullies there where washed out crop cut some gullies h on the sprayer going across them down at the bottom sealed in some crop that's all because of lack of residue to absorb Rain Drive Impact and a lack of soil structure to let the water soak in where it lands and again tillage erases all that so we want to go away from the tillage now even if you don't have slopes and erosion problems there's still an infiltration problem you know I growing up many many years ago in northeast Nebraska I thought it was great to have a crust in the soil dad put me out on the tractor says you get to drive 10 m hour the rotary hole trying to break that up wait a minute that's not great when you look at that you know this farmer is digging in screwdriving and if you know where to look you can almost see corn plants trying to come through there I look at the other wave cop can't get up more importantly the water can't get in if water can't get in it's going to run off so again I want to build structure now I say this is many years ago uh we got Farmers now that cut way back on tillage they're leaving residue out there we had to the 85 Farm Bill said residue cover it's going to solve our erosion problems it didn't quite it helped but when it comes down to it we're still doing ourselves a favor when it comes to soil structure 1981 I received a grant for three years to study different tillage systems I actually started working with noil in 78 with my Master's thesis in 81 established a set of plots Southeast Nebraska about 10 miles east of Lincoln to Sly clay LOM soil and Dryland and at that time grain sorum soybeans were popular crops for Dryland Nebraska Corn varieties weren't quite there yet for that location of the state so I did grain start sing rotation for a number of years this picture was taken about the mid90s I loved no till I loved the residue now remember I started no tilling back before we had cheap glyos you know at that time Roundup was only about $100 a gallon I learned a no tail without that now be truthful today I do love Roundup Ready beans as such I hate Roundup Ready corn with my crop rotation I don't want to use Round Up in the corn year we don't and I don't because we put down our early pre-plant get it rained in and activated and that's what we learned back in the 80s when we didn't have all the post emerged products our pre-emerge products rained in couple weeks had of planting when I plant all my moisture all my nutrients are there for my crop weeds haven't been using them the other thing is I love the residue every Bean is up and growing because the soil moisture was protected it's not going to crust not going to wash out not going to dry out in the tilled side there's some beans under crust or some beans in dry soil some beans never going to grow but when it really comes to soil health take a look at the average elevation of this soil surface compared to this over here there's about a 4 in Step there that many years of tillage compared to that many years of not tilling Jim talked about it sand silt and Clays and organic materials those are our solids in the soil the air space the POR space is air and water should be about half por space half solids as I come through doing tillage I break up the soil structure the solids are not compressed what happens is the pores are squeezed out of the soil particles between them and what happens is they reappear on top a lack of soil structure this soil is denser than this this soil has less pore space those less pores fill up with water quicker soil gets saturated quicker and worse than that it dries out quicker because you don't have the storage there and so a lot of guys with Tilly say well my soils are too wet well they're too wet for a couple days and they're too dry in the next couple of days no mine is a lot more buffered and that's what I like about soil structure and again lot of guys say well no tail it has to be continuous no tail to get the soil Health has to be a continuously fed soil system to get the soil Health you know the year he planted this corn no tilling to the bean residue yes he saved trips not doing till saved some fuel save some labor but that's still a till soil when it comes to crusting when it comes to runoff when it comes to lack of infiltration when it comes to lack of so biological life so it's continuous no till it does it and here's an example of about 12 years continuous no till here we can see some good PS and Aggregates like Ray talked about we can see where water can soak in we can see where Roots can penetrate walked across the fence this is the same soil type continuous tillage you can imagine Heavy Rain you can see why we get runoff or flat soils you can see why we get ponding again I want to build that soil structure to get that healthy soil out there again the tillage destroys it rapidly you know the disc is one of the worst offenders that was to developed as a compaction tool to build roads to BU break up existing solil structure and create a subgrade compaction layer to build a road I don't know why we thought we could use it in farming systems but when you start thinking about it again I showed this for compaction uh Jim talked about compaction the full width tailing compaction you hardly ever see I saw it because I had no tail next to it Jim said compare it to your fence row you can see how that's been beat down yes it looks like it's been fluffed up but that weight of that disc has been carried underneath and on wet soils the wet soil particles are lubricated they compact more easily again earlier I said you may have heard it say I got to till that what Sol dried out it's exactly the worst time to till it when it comes to soil health because it does destroy soil structure now some people say I'm going to till shallower I'm G get one of these new colder tillage tools that's exactly the worst layer to till that's the one with your Sol biological life you're trying to build why destroy that and then pack below it where you're trying to put the seed the other form of compaction is shown back here wheel traffic compaction typically Wheel tracks are as deep as you till because again till you erase soil structure there's nothing there to support you so again it's a vicious circle here now wheel traffic compaction larger tires reduced PSI more footprint on the ground more axles to carry the load that's how I reduce those and build soil structure how reduce those but even if the soil's dry you're not doing yourself a favor doing tillage yes I'm breaking up clouds why we created them with previous tillage pass now this is going to be an extreme example this is a wheat F producer out in western Nebraska he is an organic weak fellow producer so every time he's got a flush of weeds he does another tillage trip now earlier I said tillage doesn't build soil structure I'm wrong tillage actually built a soil structure that we call massive it has taken every poor space out of that soil now the soil surface is Right Above This the residue is just sort of hanging down into this hole that we dug below this he's been discing on his first pass and then he switches over sweeps and blades and we found layers in there you could actually pick that up and you could find the shmear mark from the blade the sweep or whatever that ran in there now depending upon the year he had anything between 13 to about 18 19 trips for tillage on his wheat fellow rotation because remember he has about 14 months he's doing tillage look below that layer though some beautiful soil structure that free Tha weding and drying builds but you know what if my roots can't get there my water can't get there this down here doesn't make any sense doesn't make any difference don't do the tillage on top organic wheat fow Ray Ward and I walked out there and Ray we should have paid attention I should have made a crisper footprint but take a look at that footprint take a look at that soil take a look at the lack of biological life does it look much different than that Neil Armstrong we all know there's no life in the moon I'm not sure there's much more life in that soil is there again we've done some dumb things at tillage you know this is a native soil structure out there the grass that was built by having a Living Root in that soil system that was actually growing there 10 11 12 months a year depending on where you're at what the winter is like and it's having a Living Root putting carbon down in there that's the darker soil we see as we lose everything on top and as we erode that away we get down to this again to rebuild that we need to get carbon back down in there that's Roots that's going to be our cover crops our cash crops it's going to be perennial crops to rebuild it the fastest because perennial crops would sent the roots Down Deeper that's what built this to start with was perennial grasses or a mixture of trees grasses Forbes whatever out there again let's go back a little bit in history and some of the dumb things we've done you know the more word plow everyone says I got to plow that soil to make a seed bed you can still go to the farm progress show and see plows being demonstrated yes they're still being sold but we start thinking about what we're doing we're breaking up all the existing soil structure we're coming in there taking that non-uniform seed bed and we're going in there and doing discing field cultivation or whatever and this is a real bad example here this is a at alurn Alabama National soil tilth lab the compaction layer of the plow pan where the plow packed below that then you can see some secondary pans from the discs and field cators you see no soil structure up here in the root Zone look down below though beautiful soil structure but again if the water and Roots can't get to it we're in trouble I'm an egg engineer by training egg Engineers figured out a long time ago you know you take a stick out here a shank and put it down below this layer and as you drag it through there it's going to fracture at a 50 or about a 45\u00b0 angle so you put it 50% deep and put another shank over here fracture that I can fracture I can break up the bad soil structure compaction right the chisel plow was born 12 in shank space and 12 in deep you go through there and you break up the bad so structure of the compaction of the plow layer and you come back and you smooth it out pack it back down after a few years you took a all right which one of you two were the plower and chisler these two are laughing he took a plow pan from 8 in and you make a chisel pan at 12 is that enough of a root Zone to graze a crop in here's a photograph from someone sales literature where they're selling a ripper and I love this when I was out there doing his last tillage operation I think he got stuck here and I don't know how he got out but you can tell he had that big white discer field cator and he came and he drove around here and hung that big wide disc or field cator over that wet spot I have to till it to dry it out out he turned plenty wide so he wouldn't get stuck and came back and dried out the rest of it right every time you do that you now packed it tighter that next time it'll stay wet longer because the water can't soak in I gave this presentation one time in Ohio and I had a guy come up to me he says I run a tile business there's guys who have this problem that hire me to cut in a random tile line to drain that wet spot I go yeah he says when I do that I usually cut the pattern tile that was already installed and it's because they created a compaction layer above the pattern tile again I've seen it here in South Dakota people are putting in tile to get rid of water I'm going like no save the water use the water that's not I get rid of it well you saw the tire tracks there maybe I switched to tracks less compaction right tracks work because of a couple things one it is lower PSI on the soil surface I can do that with inflated tires as well it's also got more axles that's sort of axle one axle two these two together probably carry the weight of axle three these axle for again think about trucks when we go to the field or go to the road to carry more weight without destroying the road we add more axles on a truck let's do that in our Fields as well I love toe carts I love things that put more axles out there to carry the load because it's a lower weight per axle in but again you're not doing yourself a favor if you're doing tail AG farmer friend of mine from Illinois he's been chiseling for years he's got compaction layer down there about chiseling depth Harvest time he's got riced tires on his combine some people call them logger tires if you're not familiar with them they're a real tall lug to cut down through anybody's ever put rice lug tires in their combine admits two things one they admit they have no soil structure they need that deep lug to cut through the mush to cut down to number two they admit they have a compaction layer and that's where they're going to get their traction now anybody brave enough to raise your hand do have rice leg tires in your combine we've done some dumb things at tell guys because we're destroying our soil structure okay Paul pan at 8 in a chisel pan at 12 50% deeper shank spacing equals operating depth the V rippers were born 18 to 20 inches deep 18 to 20 inch shank spacing and you got to like your fuel man and buy that big tractor and we come along and we smooth it all out so we can plant destroyed the Sol structure now we packed it down you see what's coming we've done some dumb things haven't we is 18 to 20 inches enough of a RIT Zone that's me in my younger day this is that Husker Harvest days DMI was showing off their new deep Ripper 30in shank spacing that run 30 inches deep remember you got to go 50% deeper than the 20-inch layer fortunately we've not seen a lot those Nebraska you probably haven't seen too many in South Dakota because we haven't till the soils when they're that wet like they do back east again never tillette soil you're going to create compaction simple as that it's 30-in enough RIT Zone look close under here this is in farm Journal Magazine on a contest I had said I built the best Mike Peeper compaction doesn't have a chance and Mike Peeper deep rips with this rig he designed and built 13 foot wide Implement takes 320 horsepower to pull earlier I said you got to like your fuel man Mike's Fuel Man M's mic we've done some dumb things guys let's go to noil Dwayne is going to talk about let mother do it mother nature freest sty wedding and drying Roots build soil structure and leave residue out there it's the residue that's going to make that system work and again a lot of guys say well do I need to go out and rip that up do I need to do strip tail to me strip tail is a temporary tool to get rid of a compaction ler that may have been caused from years of tillage to open it up to get the crop plant and then next year I can go no tail rent the tool you don't need it every year once you get rid of the pan if you don't reform it that's how strip till works you get rid of the pan of the first trip don't reform it do some digging spend some time on the spade look what you've got there now if you're digging and your roots look something like this there's no root restricting layer the pan doesn't necessarily mean you got to do tillage a root restricting layer does a water restricting layer does break that up iron can do it Roots can do it I prefer Roots because they'll build soil structure this one's interesting that's uh that living history of farming deor years ago there's a display there that's my finger point The Roots went all the way to the floor those roots went down and they actually spread out below the tillage layer with no residue up here there's no solar moisture up there there's no roots up there now let's think about that quick quarter inch rain that blows through on a summer thunderstorm soaks in about an inch no roots to pick that up it dries out I'm a no tailer I got residue up here I Got Roots up here that same rain means a lot to me meant nothing to my till neighbor so again think about the root system look see what youve got in the soil leave residue out there this is one of our Fields already planted residue everywhere that's what we want to see that residue is going to be that mulch to keep the soil cooler and wetter at planting time yeah yes a little bit but it's definitely going to keep it cooler and wetter the rest of the growing season that's what makes the money you know this past year there was a lot of shortages of feed you know I can't fault someone who has to keep their livestock alive maybe this is a cheap form of feed for them but you know what it's a double whamming when he looks at what happens to the soil system as we take it away for the guys who got greedy are selling their residue think of every one of those Bales at least is a $20 bill and about a th000 pounds of residue there you're going to put on at least 20 pounds of extra nutrients to pay for that which you just hauled away but think about what happens to the soil itself I'm hauling away carbon that I can't buy at the elevator as we look at the a lot of people say that's already got half cover you know nrcs will tell you half cover is good for erosion control well when it comes to moisture reducing evaporation Norm Clocky is an irrigation especially down at K State he's been doing some work on measuring evaporation from residue covered soil surfaces with bear he's measuring about 8/10 of an inch or 800 an inch per day you'll say well that's not much multiply 100 day growing season that's 8 in of water loss to evaporation as he left cover out there 7/10 7/10 710 100% cover was 510 that's three hund times 100 days is three inches of water difference I looked at that and said wait a minute conservation Tilly says 30% cover Cuts erosion and a half 50% even 75% cover didn't cut water loss much why and Norman explained it to me this way he says you know you build the best house you can build you got r19 insulation of the walls and R30 insulation of the ceilings and these triple pane windows and the kids go out the door and leave the door open and all the heat gets out water does the same thing when it comes to residue cover it follows a lease path resistance preferential flow and the water goes out of the soil the water vapor he says you want at least 80% 100% is better leave the soil covered you can't afford to sell it because you just lost three inches of water in this case also leave it upright standing catch the snow that is moisture I don't want that to blow away and I want to catch it uniformly you know too often I hear from producers that you know Hilltop doesn't produce much but boy those valleys sure do but if they did something like this and they lost all this moisture and they tilted and lost even more moisture but down in The Valleys where all their water ran off or all the snow accumulated that's why there's differences this is a noer left his residue standing he's got about the same snow catch everywhere that's going to be more uniform soil temperature more uniform soil moisture for planting next spring compared to this one so again leave the residue leave it standing upright upright anchored attached I don't have to cut it compared to flattened since it's attached when I'm going through it the soil holds it so I can pass across it I love my residue I want to leave it there uh here's an example from our research farm corn our corn residue we cut pretty high it's rubbing the paint off of our front axle of the tractor off of the planter toolbar these are two visitors from United Kingdom they couldn't believe in they had to take pictures I had to take a picture of them taking pictures but again you see how tall the residue is a lot of people say well all that residue holds a soil cold and wet well if you knock it down early and you make a mat you don't get any air movement down the soil surface I leave it standing as long as I can so I get air movement of this whole surface so I get in there to plant earlier I knock it down at planting time you notice there's not a whole bunch of root balls rolled out we're planted down the old road the soil biological life and long-term no tail is that the root ball rots out from underneath it doesn't roll over when you hit it with a planter in fact the so biologic activi is once I get the residue in contact with that so biological life my res disappears in a hurry hey that's okay it's breaking down now releasing carbon dioxide into the canopy it's releasing carbon into the soil releasing nutrients into the soil when my next crop is growing compared to my neighbor who did tillage this fall it's releasing all that stuff now and his next crop won't be growing for another six months so again I want the residue to break down when the next crop is there now I apply it down the old row for crops and rotation for corn on corn we actually go beside the old row beside the old row for more uniform depth control more uniform seed placement if you really want to wear out your tractor tires real fast plant exactly between the old rows and you'll wear them out because you're driving on the old row so again I leave the residue in place I love rotation I love wheat wheat gives me a cool seasoned grass to go along with my warm seasoned grass of corn my warm season broad life is soybeans as I go to the soybeans into wheat in this case Southeast Nebraska a lot of guys say you can't plant soybeans till after May 5th conventional utilties because the soil is not warm enough yet May 5th I already had them up and growing because I planted them in April 15th into 87 bushel wheat straw the soil structure is such the excess water soaked away cold wet soil temperatures is because you can't soak away the water build the structure soak it down deeper and no tilling into heavy wheat straw is not a problem now let's go back to this I started earlier half inch doesn't sound like much been doing a lot of work in my uh early days I had research grants with rainfall simulator to measure the effects of residue and reducing the erosion and that 30% level in conservation compliance came from research like this Across the Nation we started doing demos for extension type meetings where we put out 100% cover no cover on the other side we had 30% maybe we had 50% we had this different things every time you ran the research every time you ran the demo residue reduced erosion every time we did that looked at the runoff we says boy residue didn't change the runoff much you know at the time the storm's occurring it doesn't change it much but when you look at what happens when the residue is gone and when you build soil structure there are big differences big differences let's come back to evapo transpiration the measurements typically about 1/4 of our water that comes from rainfall is evaporated off from the soil surface off a wet crop canopy off a wet residue lost to evaporation quicker you close the canopy the less this will be now the rest of the water goes through the soil system into the roots and transpired by the crop to keep the crop cool and to grow more crop now some people say take all the e out of ET well you can cut it in half roughly because it's still going to come off wet surface wet residue but the more I can get into the soil the more goes through the crop the more yield I get I throw this up these are Nebraska numbers just to give you a quick reference in your mind western Nebraska ET is lower than Eastern Nebraska wait a minute isn't hotter and drier out west the reason it's less out there is they use shorter seasoned crops if you get a 90day corn versus 120-day Corn that's the difference in water use it's growing longer uses more water and look this direction alphaalpha grows only about eight months a year compared to corn and beans only about five months a year wheat grows in the cool of the winter cool of the spring uses less water so there's all sorts of things affect ET but think about those when you're using water a cover crop in the offseason of corn soybeans is in this cooler season it's going to use less water simply because it is a less water intensive time a year something grows year round uses more water again if you got excess water grow something to use the water so that's why I just throw these up for et when nor Clocky was at Nebraska he was measuring ET and he separated out again what was off the evaporation what was transpiration and what was amazing sort of is 16.8 was transpiration I can show you producers in Nebraska that pump 20 to 30 in of water a year which means they're wasting irrigation water that means they aren't even using the rainfall again vaporation let's cut that in half if we can Norman went out there and he took just 5,000 pounds per acre equivalent of wheat straw spread it out there two different years data here just by taking a bare soil and covering it he cut evaporation roughly in half growing a crop he also cut it in half because he cut the wind and sun off the soil surface and residue in a crop cut it even more yet grow something protect the soil keep the Sun and wind off the soil surface a lot of people say well I never have this condition over here sure you do if you don't have a cover crop you've done tillage you've got that if you leave the residue there it's worth a lot more if I do residue and a cover crop it's worth a lot more to save water he's norm since moved to Garden City Kansas here's corn residue wheat residue straight no tilling in soybeans and corn this is simply this difference now so he did the math for you he finds two to four to almost five inches of water saved by reducing that evaporation so let's put this on here I'm going start running total here by the way you know here's a crop sunflowers sunflowers supposed to be drought resistant because they Root Down Deeper right 2005 was a drought here in Southeast Nebraska the sunflowers burned up because of a lack of residue if you don't have residue there and evaporation I just lost five inches that was my crop 2005 there were some neighbors there that says you know I have to chop silage to harvest what I can to feed my Liv stock true now the next spring when they went in and planted their corn it was a dry year that corn burned up there's not an ear there on part of the field they left to run the combine through just so he get his insurance payment had to run a grain yield had residue there the corn is still green and it's forming an ear the residue are you took away that year cost him the next year the little bit he left was a plus now the guys are starting to argue well you get the drought year and you got that short corn out there what do you do there's a lot of guys run their combine through it just to spread the residue and process the residue they're not taking it away because they know the value of the residue so a researcher out that way West Central research extension centers at North Plat Nebraska he went in straight soybean residue and raked away some and left the other there now I did a nutrient testing he made sure nutrients wen't limiting factor this simply the residue mulch he irrigated the rest of the field based upon the residue level this was under irrigated because of the viation and you can see how much yield he lost well some guys say we just irrigate more to make up for this wait that costs money don't do that or you're the dry Lander here was wheat after harvest left the straw in place and in part of the field he bailed the straw because he needed some straw baales gave up 20 bushels this guy figured out he buys his baales from the neighbor because the neighbor hasn't figured it out yet he leaves his residue in the field the next year Steve Melvin at our Curtis research Farm has a good rainfall year his Dy yields weren't that much reduced yeah there some look they were reduced both though when he removed residue we got guys down there in Southeast Nebraska that don't even allow Sil to be chopped in their Farms because the yield they give up when that residue disappears and one of those Farms is our University Nebraska research Farm the Agronomy group already figured this out and the animal science group is mad because they got to buy the silage from The Neighbors The Neighbors haven't figured it out yet again that residue is what drives this soil system I can't afford to give it up here's back to my tillage plots in uh 2005 first week of June we had five days in a row over 100 degree heat now it cooled off and it rained where there's no residue in the till that sor basically went dormant now it didn't die you can see all the plants are still there but look where how healthy that growth is when the rain came this took off and we didn't expect too much yield difference when the combine rolled it was 35 bushel difference 2000 was a year that during the growing season we got 11 inches of rain County average of soybeans that year was 23 Bush per acre or 25 bushel per acre I'm sorry my tilled soybeans were 23 on 11 in of rain my notail was 47 I can't give up that residue earlier I said rainfall simulator we said not much difference in runoff big difference in erosion we had one site we're doing all this research that uh when we stood there and on the tilled side we got run off after about 20 minutes of water applied that's an inch of water in 20 minutes and all the farmers standing there said see tilling it you open it up the water can soak again on the other side the residue was standing we stood there for an hour and a half three and 3/4 inches of water applied before we saw any runoff and we said boy this site's not like the other 21 sites that we just done this one's wrong I'm sorry to say this was the right site Charlie fster had a no tail as a Cham fellow versus tillage fellow what this plot was he' been there for 13 years already 13 years a no tail build it such that three and 3/4 inches of water soaked in before we saw the first runoff compared to this one one inch of water that single storm is two and 3/4 inch of water difference because the so structure of longterm NOA again long-term no till this is from my tillage plots tile Spade full of soil you see the good Peds and Aggregates you can see where water can soak in compared to the tilled where it's denser you can't see the water soak in now before taking this picture I should have lined this up 4 inches lower than that because the soil surface is 4 inches lower wasn't thinking when I snapped the picture but now some interesting work coming out of France see that good soil structure the heat from the earth Rises up through those same holes and they are measuring in no tail fields in March being about 5 to 10 degrees warmer than tilled fields in March it's because this tillage making it more dense and no poor space there the Heat Can't rise I started paying attention to that on our usage Farm we started measuring so temperatures our no tail where the water can soak in and heat can come up as the same soil temperatures are tilled in fact with the soil structure we can plant no tail before our till neighbors can plant theirs and again remember I said I had soybeans into heavy wheat straw 15th of April and Convention till neighbors aren't plant soybeans till May 5th because it's too cold no tail soil structure solves a lot of the problems when you get air exchange gas exchange water movement we've done some measurements on infiltration I use controll wheel traffic as well Jim mentioned that in his final present or slide there till 2/10 inch per hour could soak in 410 on the soft row we haven't driven and this has hadn't been driven on it for more than 25 years but the tillage makes that top layer so it doesn't take in water very fast we pulled out the nrcs soil survey and it said that the intake rate should be between 210 and 610 because of the clay content of Sly clay LOM soil that was now what was interesting though this is saturated for more than 24 hours before he took this measurement so this is not just initial intake this is actually what's moving through the soil go to the notail there's 610 that's the high side of the two to four 2 to six it's over 4 in per hour there any of you who visits Dakota lakes Dwayne will show you this on his long-term noil with that water can just disappear it soaks in when you build that structure Southeast Nebraska it's the typical spring thunderstorm blew through and actually late spring 6inch rain came overnight from June 12th to 13th we're out there walking around taking pictures and as we're taking pictures of this it's got a crust on Terrace is over top Terrace is washed out the farmer drove up he just shaking his head said worthless rain just like anybody else I said how much did you get he says six Ines worthless rain crusted the soil Washed Out The Terraces when am I going to get in there when's it's it going to be dry enough for me to replant the grain sorghum worthless rain his neighbor acrossed the fence long-term no tiller sorum's already up soil structures there took a soil moisture Pro Rod had a full soil moisture profile to 6 feet deep and sorghum June 13th 6 foot of moisture he says beautiful rain the difference of so structure guys all right I put a question mark on the six you don't always get that kind of thunderstorm it's impressive yes we've easily measured two extra inches of water because of better infiltration less runoff and again going back to that 11inch rainfall year 61 with tillage to the line no till 121 that's what we see when you get that infiltration and residue and soil structure and remember I'm adding this is working together areal view of that research Farm 10 miles east of Lincoln it's a terorist farm terorists are put in back in the 50s and 60s when he said we got to control runoff you know what with controlled wheel traffic and long-term no tail and nice broad crop rotation we have next to no runoff very seldom do these Terra see water right here is a repair and buffer Strip This Terrace basically defines only runoff that comes through that buffer strip is off of this field that buffer strip was put in in 1998 because everyone says we're going to put in buffers to filter everything coming out of the runoff was it R I think you said it buffers were a Band-Aid this field was no tilled about 10 years already by then 98 they put in the buffer 99 they put in eight runoff sampers in front of the buffer and four behind so they can compare the water in water out see how affected the buffer was about five years ago they quit putting the runoff Samplers out there in the spring because they never measured runoff into that buffer it all stays in that field doesn't run off we raise 250 bushel of corn dry land down here dropping populations in Dryland 33,000 when our neighbors are raising 142 is the county average and they're dropping about 25,000 I'm treating it like irrigated because we're using our water now again our neighbors they're using their terrorist we're keeping our water all right you've seen the running total 5 to 12 I easily get the five extra did a meeting down Boot Hill in Missouri I was there for three days and rained five inches they get 50 inches of rain there they had land levelers trying to get the land level to get rid of the water then you looked in the background and they had pivots I'm going 50 inches of water and you got pivots yeah when the rain stops in June it stops s till September we need irrigation I go 50 in of rain they have a tilled soil that's not letting the water soak in it's all running off they need irrigation he's been there he's nodding we go to Minnesota we switch to Noel we go to Iowa Illinois wherever we switched to noil we used to be corn soybeans with tillage we had runoff we had evaporation and we had 30 inches rain 40 inch of rain whatever they get and they save 5 to 12 remember Cornell used 16.8 they say 5 to 12 what's the first thing they do they complain about cold wet soil they say I'm going to get rid of that by doing strip tail blow off that spring soil moisture they also set themselves up again this is a norm Clocky leaving the door open that soil moisture leaves them all season long not just that time of year all year long so again some people till the water out and they continue to lose the water all year for me it's up to you what you do with the extra water that no tail saves you know a drought year that's your crop in a non drought year that's opportunity to do something else you know irrigators in Nebraska the average for Center per irrigation is about $15 an acre inch saing five inches the low end is 75 bucks an acre more profit you're the dry Lander the low end again remember I said 5 to 12 corn responds about 12 bushels per acre inch 5 time 12 is 60 extra bushels of corn we are running at R moral Farm past 5 years we are more than 60 bushels of County average on a Noto corn we're running over 200 Bush of corn where the county average is 140 that's where my extra water is beans 3 and2 Time 5 is 172 again that's extra profit if you use your water comes down to can you use your water can you store your water out west used to be wheat F because they didn't think they had enough water grow crop every year they're using noil using residue and they're raising the crop every year they're using their extra water noil gives them down South Oklahoma and Kansas used to be a lot of wheat fow they went to no till they learned they can raise continuous crops they went to no till and they actually learned they can use double crop because they're growing wheat that uses less water in the offseason they go beans uses the water when the water is available comes down to timing now when your water available producer I know in Pennsylvania he says you know we got wet Springs I grow alala because it's a high water Ed crop it starts using water clear back in March I take first cutting and by then it's already used 8 to 10 inch of water he says I wait for regrowth I plant corn I spray out the alal and I raise good corn he gets 40 inch of rain 10 15 went to the AL Alpha the rest went to the corn he says I got conventional till neighbors who plow up their Al Alpha to kill it set themselves for erosion and runoff they plant their corn and the erosion and runoff no water getting into the solar profile and their corn droughts out says I'm a no tell I got two crops and they got zero they're using the extra water extreme case in Nebraska after Corn Harvest plant wheat planted in skip RS you plant your soybeans that when you combine your wheat your soybeans are already there they're using extra water now I say extreme case in Nebraska this is the Dryland corner on a pivot the beans got up this high and died because the wheat already used all the water now back east in Illinois Indiana on in Ontario they love it they call it relay cropping we got a Living Root there almost a year round with irrigation we got that Living Root and they're raising good wheat and good corn or good soybeans using that extra water and they're keeping track of the irrigation they it's only putting on six extra inches of water because the no tail and the rainfall they only need 60 extra for two crops in a year so again think about using the water and again I look at how much water can you store we have some potential losses if we have a c profile it's already full we get extra water in Nebraska we have trouble with deep percolation taking nitrogen down to our drinking water if we use some of that water growing a cover crop we reduce the nitrate leeching Dwayne is going to talk more about Catch and Release nutrients we have a crusted soil or saturated soil again we lose water build structure protect it or if it's unprotected soil we got evaporation we lose water leave residue out there and again once you're full it's wasted now a normal spring in Nebraska we hope to have our solar moisture profile refilled by March we don't plant till maybe April or May I got an opport for cover crop to use water if it's going to be a dry year maybe I'll look at a fall cover crop to empty out water in the fall such that I can save water in the spring you go huh think about it if it's got a wet fall and it fills up right away everything in the winner is wasted sometimes you make the cover crop decision on the Fly And the main thing is I want to grow the water rather than lose it because I'm going to be growing root and growing soil structure talk quickly about cover crops here for my last get 17 minutes that's not bad then Ralph derps friend of mine he's a crop consultant uh learned no tail back at least 40 years ago and he's been sort of the leader in getting no started in South America he's living in Paraguay now but he started with German government he's gone into areas that have never been tilled never been farmed before and they're planting no till and I say that because they're not used to the big tractors we have they're using a lot smaller tractors they have not invest in the horsepower for tillage they've never seen the soil bear they think it's logical to have it covered we've seen it be thanks to Grandpa thanks to Dad so we're not used to seeing the residue near as much but they're out there planting and what they're doing is they're using cover crops to provide extra carbon biomass to the soil system to use some water to protect the soil to build the soil and to them cover crops is a no-brainer now the interesting thing I when you start thinking about it and we saw this on slide earlier but we think about when is the crop using water when's the water available our summer planted crops and you could substitute just move this axis over and call this fall or winter crops if you're doing wheat but think about it they take off growing in the spring corn that's sometime in May they're really actively growing they reach a peak in July they taper off that in September they're done using water that's when we produce the biomass that's when it uses the water but from an ARS study where they took this they said we missed some opportunities to produce I love their big words resource simulation dry matter production I say they basically they're losing the opportunity to use some water and some carbon dioxide and also sunlight now think about it sunlight we don't store at least not in the crop field carbon dioxide we don't use in a crop field in the off seon now when a crop is growing there is so that's what the cover crop is for now water we can store and some people argue well this water it's not really lost if I can store it and use it for next crop but too often I see where the soils might be already full and this is now deep leeching or it's deep percolation or it's evaporation off an unprotected surface in the spring with heavy spring rains it is again again by planting a cover crop I can use some water and accumulate some biomass and more importantly get some roots in that soil and use some of that carbon dioxide and sunlight rather than waste to it use some water but I have to manage the water and that's why I show the break off here if it is a wet spring you let that covered crop grow longer use some water because you got plenty of water and that breakoff might even occur out here or if it's a dry spring it might break off here or if it's always dry in your area PL a cover crop that winter kills and there's nothing even appears here again the water management is up to you a little bit on your risk and a little bit on what you're trying to accomplish and when I say what are you trying to accomplish again here's down in South America when they first started raising soybeans down there a lot of people said well it's beans on beans every acre every year and that's what kills our soybeans Market in the US I had an opportunity to go down to Brazil and Ray W was along that trip last year and we saw a lot of Acres beans on beans every year but you know what after soybean Harvest they had enough growing season enough sunlight and carbon dioxide and water they grew a cover crop this is black oats in this case rolled down or it could have been a short season forage because they had livestock or it could have been corn or cotton and they grew those through the winter months again using a crop groin when the water's available is what they're doing now when it comes to The Pest Management beans on beans when that first rainstorm comes and hits that black oats residue how much Bean disease is going to Splash on that new beans crop none a cover crop can be a pest management tool reducing Splash in this case the thing I encircled here is this tree in the background that's the same tree a few weeks later and you look at that and say the beans don't look bad and you look at that and you go where did the rest of that residue go the biological life is digesting it putting in the system and I said that's when I want it to happen when the next crop is growing I thought it was pretty neat I thought it was real neat when Ralph showed me this that's what it does when you grow a crop cover crop and using the sunlight and carbon dioxide when it's available using the water to grow the soil by having that Living Root in there it's feeding the soil system so what do you grow I've got this seed box in my pickup right now these some different cover crops I've planted in different plots people always ask me what do you plant I go what are you trying to do the laundry list that I borrowed from under Nebraska nrcs and their cover crop plan they put erosion control on top that's what the name actually come from is cover to reduce the soil erosion if I want erosion control I want to quit growing something like a grass to get it up there and absorb rain do impact what if I'm doing nutrient capture nutrient cycling I want something takes up a lot of nutrients and then releases it slowly next year and again Dwayne's going talk catch to release nutrients improve solo Health any Living Root will do that water management the two-edged sword you use the water if you have it or better yet grow some residue to keep the Sun and wind off the Sol surface to conserve the water that you don't have it can work both ways increase biodiversity by simply getting a cool season versus a warm season a r versus a grass just change the biodiversity to change that so biological life balance carbonation ratio if you want residue to hang around a long time you want a high carbon out there corn stocks wheat straw will hang around a long time compared to peas or soybeans will break down in a hurry because it's a low carbon higher nitrogen ratio well again if I want to Decay my residue and I got a lot of cornstalks or wheat stubble there put a legum out there you Decay your residue in a hurry or if I'm like me I got a lot of Sol biological life and I don't want to Decay as fast I'm going to put more high carbon stuff out there more Grass more Rye to get the residue to hang around longer nitrogen fixation that's with the early days most people looked at cover crops to grow nitrogen because we were organic producers before they invented fertilizer well we got organic producers or we got others who are cutting their nitr because they're growing on their own reduce compaction it's a two-edged sword there as well the one is yes it can when you got a good vigorous roote growing but the more important thing is the good vigorous route actually provides some soil structure and stability to reduce the compaction from next trips on the field getting that road out there weed suppression the right selected cover crop can suppress the next weeds you just want to make sure you select the right cover crop doesn't suppress your next crop and again that's why I can't tell you what you need to plant because I don't know what you're doing next Forge of grazing I do that for the soil system but again some years drought conditions maybe I need that for my four-legged livestock e T-Bones out of and so again we got to think about it like I said a lot of cover crop tours out there you go out there and look at them lot usually they're planted in single species just so you can see the individual crop you get benefits of mixing them in a cocktail the benefits build and it's uh really helps you out that way but this is a set of legumes then see how much nitrogen they fix planted into wheat stubble or this case into wheat stubble cover he used a sorum sedan grows in the heat in summer doesn't use a lot of water but the good news is it's up and growing that when his pastures and rangeland need a rest he can put the livestock over here and they got feed recovery time on pasture and rangeland is worth big bucks that'll pay for your cover crop because you get the cattle off of there so again we got to think about how we manage the system again with selecting a cover crop first question what do you want Want To Do With It Go on a planet because it's the hottest topic out there that's not the reason to do it that's why so many lemings go over the cliff they've never asked why it's just everyone else is doing it no why do you want to do it again what do you select then can you grow it it doesn't matter if it's something that really works great in South America and they can't grow here black oats for instance if you want to raise black oats for seed you got to move South a long ways it only takes about 170 days to mature it now for a cover crop I don't need 170 days because it doesn't need to mature can you manage it can you kill it can you plant it can you row again you would select something you can't will it affect the next crop one of my favorite examples is at Harvest time when you're hauling wheat to the elevator and they refuse it because of scab and someone walks up to you and say I'll buy that wheat from you because I'm going to use it as a cover crop seed you'd be glad just to sell it right well I plant that scab wheat as a cover crop and it comes up and I spray it up before it makes a head and every gets heads scab who cares I'm planting my next crop is soybeans who cares I plant my next crop is corn you serum heads scab and ferium stock crot is the same ferium guys you just shot yourself in a foot when it come to raising corn if you use wheat as a cover crop in front and had ferium so again will it affect the next crop I see the same thing with sunflowers and white mold things like that so be careful what would the seed cost my cheapest cover crop seed has been floor sweepings well my next cheapest has been bin run grein serum you know Milo is not worth much Milo is planted at 5 pounds the acre Bush Milo 56 pounds it'll P 10 acres for about three bucks four bucks five bucks depending upon the price Milo is a warm seasoned grass following wheat it's perfect because that's the cool season grass so again how does it fit what will the seed cost the best is what is left in your seed shed when you're done seeding dump it all together and plant it because you know you can grow it all well help the so system I sure hope so that's why I'm doing it and again some cover crops won't help as much again different species out there there's flax flax I used to not think too much of it until we had 2in hail for 20 minutes with two inches of rain with 80 mph winds everything in the area was destroyed except for my flax cover crop this isn't it this is a different plot the FL cover crop is such a small spining thing it sprang back up and the day after the hill storm you're walking out there go how come it Miss that strip it didn't that plant was that resilient now I contrast that to this one right next to it that's sunm it's a legum fixes nitrogen Sun hemp as a name implies is a rope I would spray that out sooner than this producer did because you know as a rope any residue mover on your planter it's turning wraps up so tight that you need a torch to get it out this producer says don't run residue movers you just plant right through it I go that works he goes great it works so again what are you after if you're after residue cover grasses will provide that fastest if you're after nitrogen it has to be a legum and you have to inoculate it with a proper inoculant for that species just because you've planted soybeans before doesn't mean their isob are there it's going to help you on peas or vet or even alphalpha they're all different you use the right one brascas a lot of people look at them getting rid of the compaction because the Braska family includes the oil seed radish and the turnips those big Roots but they're also notorious for residue cycling because they will break down the residue underneath them others the others category that's I already showed you flax that's not any of these sunflowers is other biodiversity is what I'm after cool season versus warm season it's pretty obvious to really get the good growth you plant the opposite what your cash crop is following wheat Harvest a cool season crop I do a warm SE seon because In The Heat Of July and August you want a warm season sorum Sudan or soybeans or cow peas that grow out there now going the other way after a warm season crop like Corner soybeans I'm going to go cool season my aern winter peas even a spring pea oats all my cool season crops grass versus broadleaf versus cocktail again that's balancing the carbon nitrogen ratio cocktail gets you the balance of everything and it gives you some risk management as well what if it is too hot and dry and the cool season legum you planted burned up while my warm season grass might be still growing so again it gives you some management if you need to learn more about cover crops ARS out of Mandan put together this periodic table just like the one you hated in chemistry it is sorted by down the column the related again grasses down the ends simpler things on top more complex than the bottom then it's grouped also within column by legumes here Broad Leaf here warm season cool season and they got these little footnote things in the corners here on their life cycle their water use and how they grow again you'll say huh well if I'm in an area of wind erosion I want an upright if I'm in an area of water erosion I want something that lays flat again just think about differences what you need out there but then you're saying okay what the world's a looping you click on that and if you run it online it goes straight to the file or you can download it to your computer it's a PDF file it's available again on that website you click on loopin and it comes up saying here's what it looks like here's what it is cool season Broad Leaf legume goes down low water use acid soil if you're going to feed it it's got some protein if you want the bonus points in your CSP plan it attracts the pollinators you know what it doesn't form my micis associations again will it build soil this one not as fast because it's not going to help the fungi near as much or you click on serial Ry one of my favorites because I don't raise a lot of wheat in our area uh cool season grass following Corner soybeans it's great anel upright upright catches more snow for me high water use well that's why I be careful when I kill it in the spring do I kill it late or early is it a wet or dry spring go on down here you know uh will form micro Riz Association very good at Scavenging nitrogen again once you decide why you need a cover crop you can go to a table like this and help you decide which cover crop do you need again the cocktails are nice here's after wheat Harvest a cocktail it had a cool season legum warm season legon brasas warm season grass cool season grass this is after the first Frost the warm season grass of the Sorghum sedan frosted off the cool season grasses underneath are still growing in fact they'll really take off now that the weather cool down likewise the brasas are still growing down here they'll take cooler temperatures again when you start thinking about managing the cover crop can you kill it can you manage it a cover crop roller rollers work great on a single species because you know exactly when to roll it you're supposed to roll it about the time it's star to do reproduction now you got this cocktail mix here when do you roll that I'm not exactly sure well wait a minute if this already Frost killed and the rest of this is going to frost kill maybe I don't even need to worry about a roller so again how you're going to terminate depends what you're growing the cover crop rollers they love them in South America here's again from Ralph derps this is a black oats crop rolled down no herbicide those that black oats is expressing all the weeds raising that corn so again weed control there some guys say I can use till to terminate the cover crop remember they told us for years you plow under that green manure crop when it comes to soil biological life is exactly the worst thing to do yes I put that residue into the soil but I destroyed a lot of other stuff as well we got a grad student in Nebraska working my PhD in organic weed control using cover crops he had two four six and eight species cover crops he found that once you got to six or eight species you could suppress weeds when you're down at two or four you actually almost increased weeds he found that when you terminate with a disc you increased weeds because you planted every weed seed and you got R rid of the benefit when he used a blade undercutter and he left the residue on top then the 8pc cover crop paid for the ganing production so again we got to think about what's going on out there don't use tillage to kill it guys use the herbicide use the roller or you PL into it wait before I can tell you to do that check with your RMA check with your insurance check with your FSA in Nebraska I can guarantee you if you do this your crop is not insurable if you plant into a cover crop or worse yet if your cover crop even heads or buds your next crop is not insurable we have to kill our cover crop early in Nebraska if you want crop insurance but you know what Terry Taylor in Illinois he's got excess water he's growing the excess water out he's planting he's got beautiful mols there that planter actually was this cover crop roller who really knocked it back for him and his one poster herbicide took care of the rest of it he didn't have pre didn't have a whole bunch of other stuff out there but again we start thinking about it think about growing it terminating it but why are you growing it it's going to increase that soil biological life if you have a soil surface that has no residue and you got a lot of evaporation use a little bit of water to grow the cover it reduces evaporation I got to throw up some data and you mentioned the group up at uh Marlin RoR up in uh North Dakota bismar you had about 15 inches of annual rain after p Harvest he had very little residue he planted a cover crop it all Frost killed the next spring he had beautiful residue and over here he had no residue and over here he had weeds where he had the residue he had less weeds so he saved a herbicide application he had the residue there it saved water and when they took these measurements the day of corn planting in May going down to 4 foot basically no difference what's interesting is look on top where there was no cover the soil was exposed and it dried out where he had cover he actually saved water near the soil surface to plant into so numbers I got from Dwayne he only went to 3 feet and this is 20-inch rainfall area onto a wheat stubble again with a cover crop that Frost killed this is spring planting time he had more moisture near the surface because he kept the Sun and wind off the so surface and not only then all the way until the crop canopy took over so it saves even more water going into the next season the cover crop does again here's on our Rogers Memorial Farm has two Bush of corn the day after harvest I'm planting a cover crop Austin winter peeas a lot of people say you got too much residue there you know what that drill just put the residue in contact with the soo microbes this is long-term no tail next spring March one this is the same field we're also where's all my residue so microbes are digesting at the cover crop is starting to grow that's Austin winter peeas March 15th by the time it came time to plant about April 20th those a peas fixed about 90 pounds of nitrogen I paid for the cover crop it cycled my residue I'm getting excited about cover crops here's Keith glue extension educator plant some 20-inch corn in this demonstration plot this is irrigated corn on corn with a Sero R cover crop we had corn Ry cover crop corn R cover crop R corn cover crop this is the fourth year corn we took a conventional tilled field and with seven crops remember four corn three cover crops we stepped up biological activity such that here's the rise sprayed out we're planting the corn here's a few weeks later where's all the Rye residue where's all the irrigated corn residue breaking down because of the biological activity fly it on could be an option in soybeans we're getting good luck in Nebraska because the soybeans we do it right before Leaf Drop the seed falls down in the ground the leaves cover it up it's the mulch the soybean mulch allows the cover crop to grow in corn you fly it on there's a lot up here in the leaves never make it to the soil until the combine runs and you don't make the mulch like the dropping leaves do we don't recommend it in Nebraska and corn in fact Lor Alor nrd will pay the cost of the flying to put it on because they want the erosion control helicopter they're using that the fun thing about a helicopter doesn't have to return to the airport they put the totes out the day before each tote held enough seed for 40 acres helicopter just dropped the tote slid to the side dump the tote in they did 1300 acres in one afternoon and it looks like this then at Harvest Time this is a sandy soil couldn't store all the offseason prip his cover crops already growing when he combine the beans protection is there keeping the Sun and wind off the soil surface this producer reported those Bean the cover crop corn did about 20 bushel per acre better than where he had Sandy soils without a cover crop because he kept the Sun and wind off the soil surface other guys spread it with dry fertilizer guys in Iowa do a lot of that mix their 1152 with some cover crop seed when they go out there and spin it they get enough rain they get the fertilizer on they get the cover crop up some guys use the drill they're putting on the fertilizer for the next crop they're putting on a cover crop for this crop again different ways of getting it out there some put it with the manure now dry feed lot manure is a little hard but a lot of Michigan work and Pennsylvania work mixing in with slurry when they spread the slurry it gets incorporated or they spread it with a dry spreader and then they do a manure application across the top like with an airway or something they incorporate it or in this case feed lot manure spread hair bar to smooth it out the drill then cut up the rest of the residue and this is actually great to reduce nutrient runoff loss from surface Supply manure because a lot of those nutrients are now tied up in a biological form be released later in corn I say we don't fly it on if you got hybrid SE corn production there's not much canopy there they do fly on at hybrid SE corn production or they do it when they destroy the mail row here's the cover crop already starting to come up here's a few weeks later when the corn was harvested I like that hybrid sea corn production you over fertilize and overwater the cover crops an excellent scavenger we already saw a couple of these I'm going repeat them here's a seed corn producer that's got a det tassler he says I detassel my hybrid Seed corn but you know what the tassel is not needed in regular corn AFF pollinated he goes out there and need hous regular corn and he's blowing cover crop seed underneath we already saw this one a lot of guys say we can't cover much ground you know what at it's a nice cover build a bigger spreader this is 90 ft wide you can cover some ground this one's got some ground clearance and again they're doing that to get the cover crop seated in that growing corn but again talk to your insurance man in Illinois they can do that in Nebraska if I see that cover crop and growing corn they're going to say there new crops growing and your previous crop is no longer insured depends talk to them before you do it again summary after low residue crop let's grow some residue after corn Sage or wheat because there I've got a longer growing season to do that and again here's the one that catches a lot of people by surprise if you got a Sandy so can't can't store all your offseason preset maybe a cover crop something to consider use the water when it's available rather than lose it biging the soil that black is the roots get more Roots out there pero crops cover crops drilled crops winter crops you're going to build that soil Carlos coretto about a 40-year no down South America grain belongs to a farmer residue belongs to the soil I believe in that again quick commercial for our crop production crop scoty newsletter Nebraska with that I bumped the pause button here so it didn't vibrate on me it says I got five minutes left but I'm sorry I went into your break I'll be around to answer questions during the break because I don't want to show you visiting our exhibitors because they help pay for this [Applause]",
