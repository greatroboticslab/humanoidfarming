  "text": "turn this um what's on this in this field here done this is sweet potatoes that we had just planted okay we planted solve them a week ago and then the ones that are being irrigated now we planted yesterday okay and it's very important that you don't get rain after your planting too if you don't have irrigation it's it makes it real difficult for the weather the plants get a established after your clowns you got your tractor hooked up to a pump it's hooked up to a water pump that runs out up on a PTO okay power take-off power take-off okay and it it produces about a hundred and ten gallons a lot of a minute you can use that for takeoff for any number of things right most anything with applications at the track if it requires a PPO adapted to and that thing actually moves is that correct you've got it on our cable and it yeah it went is itself across the field that's why they call it a water that's a water winch okay they drag the hose behind it and we hook it to a tree and it winches itself across the field nice got three different views on it and depending upon how dry it is Oh as far as the speed goes I like the speed go so that's how you regulate how much water you put down as by how fast it it winches across right it's got one two and three and if I put it in the fastest Gill I can put out half an inch of a non before you get any moisture so these are these are no these are red potatoes what kind of these are red potatoes can I get you to hold those up again there you go you say these are potatoes that this is what potatoes look like when they need a little rain yeah see these actually if we if we if we did not get any more rain yeah or like let's say this crop didn't get water anytime this week mm-hmm and we didn't get irrigation on it then what what happened is these small potatoes would size up as long as vines are still green okay that's how they would size up but that's not what you want do you want two potatoes to size up with moisture rather than from the vine Oh in other words it would be taking the moisture moisture out of the vine there it would be that's and then when the vine is dead the potatoes are done going okay I mean there's at least at least a good month's gross here yeah these potatoes could size this potato being not much bigger than a marble right would could size up to the size of your fist by the time it's to be harvested so that rain is really critical right now very critical so some people go to Las Vegas to gamble and you choose to fire my guess that's exactly right well so here's the potatoes that we get at the farmers market nice if we don't get any rain if this storm misses us tomorrow night I'll have to set up your Legation over here and that's going to take me a day over to one well at this point every day is critical sure brilliant so maybe maybe mother nature will be kind to us tomorrow night and one hope so how many feet long are these that Greathouse is 128 feet long 128 feet long and you've got all tomatoes in here all tomatoes in this box that you've got in here what is that that box down there is a beehive there's a beehive it's got bumble bees in it okay and that's how we pollinate the tomatoes okay one flowers flowers like this when they open up the bee pollinates maybe with a little luck we might see some bees pollinating okay and then again we may not it depends on what the humidity is in here right in the only pollinate when the humidity is just right oh is that right but sometimes you'll still see them flying around pollinating it it looks like the more ripe tomatoes are at the bottom is that at the bottom and having ripe and then you just this would be picking this cluster next week the next week if you take off of this cluster this week will be taken off of this cluster so they're open from the bottom and then they keep on growing they grow up they grow up to these schools that are okay and if it will you taken let them down like that and move them to the right that's what they call leaning and lowering I've never heard of that and then the vines eventually at the end of season you'll have a big long column of vines you can see this they've been a roller to fight a few times already so the findings are all leaning this way and you've already picked the tomatoes off the bottom they're already been picked off the bottom okay like some several weeks back okay so you give them a little bit of slack with the reel when the wheel the right just like a domino effect and when they reach the end and what are they planted in their planet in media called pearl a pearl white pearl a okay it's a white media it comes out of volcanoes and then it felt like a vermiculite or exactly and there's in the same family is that it takes the place of soil okay then how does it get watered they take it out of volcanoes and then they pop it just like popcorn hello and then it turns into this I didn't realize that it makes a good media base for soil I did not realize that really holds water well and how does it get watered two of these feed to each tomato plant has its own feed too so they have plenty of water and it's all put out okay that's what they call cat face it can't facing cat facing and it's due to cold temperatures doing pollination right after pollination ok so that's that tomato was falling way back in February very small tomato and that's why it turned out that way can't facing interesting so this is the strawberry this is how we grow the strawberries the Grauman's stack is like this this is everbearing variety and this another held up with pipes and then you've got what this black pipe is what water this is a feed tube and then they're just put on stack is that we evolve so when you're picking you can just spin this like you can oh very convenient like a miniature carousel you might soon and here's this one that being a burbank variety we'll see what the summer brings i'm sure sure nice and this is the same way we grow out greens for the winter time oh is it right is that right winter farmers market Oh in stackers like this ok this is probably this is probably equivalent to maybe several acres of greens outside sure because of the way we grow this is the vertical stacking exactly perfect and the same with the strawberry operation sure that little half acre of stackers is probably equivalent to like five six acres of strawberries that's amazing and the tomatoes the same thing Wow same thing well would be equivalent to well that particular house that tomatoes are by the equivalent to about fifty acres of tomatoes Wow if you try one well we all enjoy your produce at the farmers market and we certainly appreciate you taking the time today to show us around oh I was a pleasure was all mine okay thanks nothing",
