1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:09,269
okay go to the next one the aquaculture

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,710
industry we usually talk about fish but

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:12,780
it actually includes anything that you

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,940
can grow in the water or in a water

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,300
environment but I'm typically going to

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,490
talk about fish here and even at that we

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,519
have a broad perspective to go through

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,710
we I should preface this whole thing by

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,470
saying I'm from Wisconsin and I

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:33,380
typically deal with the northern central

11
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:36,300
tier of states so what I have to do with

12
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,160
managing water and efforts and so forth

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,020
is probably going to be quite different

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,420
than East Coast West Coast or the

15
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,780
southern states but up in the northern

16
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,360
tier we have access to cold water cool

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,210
water warm water fish we can have fish

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,390
and plant combinations like aquaponic

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,910
situations we have people that just have

20
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:00,660
plants growing a hydroponics with no

21
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,910
fish if we do an outdoor culture we've

22
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,070
got a lot of variety there the whole

23
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,979
pond may give me you can have net pens

24
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:10,350
cages floating raceways on tide on side

25
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,689
teen culture we have flow through

26
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:14,970
systems that are indoor and we have

27
00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:18,299
recirculating aquaculture systems which

28
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,520
are called Ras you know use Ras quite

29
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,439
frequently so I have to repeat it but

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,619
that's a system that's indoors that

31
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,380
recycles all the water and never wastes

32
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:30,720
it to the outdoors and we also get into

33
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:34,170
saltwater systems like right now we're

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,960
starting to get into shrimp so just to

35
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:38,130
break down what we are growing oh and

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,310
then the other thing I wanted to mention

37
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,409
about 90% of the aquaculture in

38
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,130
Wisconsin that we consider aquaculture

39
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:50,100
is actually baitfish and then there's

40
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:54,210
the next 9% is growing trout and the

41
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:57,719
last 9% is all the other species the

42
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,880
last 1% and so I'm just going to go

43
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,790
through what we actually culture for

44
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,340
food fish and that will apply to bait

45
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,990
fish if they're doing culture an intense

46
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,270
culture so forth so we have

47
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:12,030
non-indigenous cold water species that

48
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,350
were working with Atlantic salmon arctic

49
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,600
char our new

50
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:18,630
rainbow trout is the standby that's not

51
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,690
an indigenous species but it it seems

52
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:24,540
like it cuz it's so cosmopolitan then we

53
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,510
get into what we call cool water wall I

54
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:30,660
saw a guy perch saw a guy is actually a

55
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,340
hybrid walleye Sagar and it looks the

56
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,380
same as a walleye so I'm just going to

57
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,720
put one picture up but those are cool

58
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:40,980
water fish and then the next slide will

59
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,870
show and both these are indigenous and

60
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,610
then the indigenous fish and this

61
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,760
picture is your bluegill which is pretty

62
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,010
cosmopolitan but if we want to go

63
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,960
indoors to a real warm water species we

64
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:56,880
start with tilapia which is normal

65
00:02:51,960 --> 00:03:00,300
aquaponics and we have shrimp there's

66
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:05,220
there's a rule of that I always use in

67
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:07,440
managing fish culture what we have to

68
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,870
realize is that we're actually doing two

69
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,760
resources one is your biological

70
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,110
organism that we're managing and that's

71
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,610
what we're thinking of managing and then

72
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,240
the other one is the big one is the

73
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:20,520
water so any successful aquaculture is

74
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,740
really an exercise in wastewater

75
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:25,170
treatment and as long as you can provide

76
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:26,910
good water quality your fish or any

77
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,340
other organism you're working with will

78
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:33,780
be happy and you will have a successful

79
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:36,420
operation so when we consider the cool

80
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,990
and warm water species in the northern

81
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:42,810
tier States we can we can raise them but

82
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:45,210
we're really limited by maybe three to

83
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:48,120
four months that they at the tops

84
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:50,670
walleye maybe a little longer if we go

85
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,680
to cold water species while we were

86
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,320
talking about trout and some onit's

87
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,140
we're either using artesian or well

88
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,150
water yeah and obviously they're cold

89
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:02,310
water so they they're growing season is

90
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,000
quite a bit longer and for indoor

91
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,940
systems

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,860
we're generally working with

93
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,620
temperatures that are 65 to 80 degrees

94
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,840
usually on the higher end and that's in

95
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,440
an Ras system the recirculating

96
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,720
aquaculture system and by and some of

97
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,979
these species are definitely warm water

98
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,620
they cannot be grown outdoors the types

99
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,350
of waste that we get we generally will

100
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,330
get a solid waste from the

101
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,160
and that's our pcs and we're it's very

102
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,650
obvious if you raise fish in aquarium

103
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,290
you'll see that but an additional waste

104
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,840
comes from our operations if we're

105
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:41,420
feeding food which we always go for on

106
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,620
the grow but that food if we over feed

107
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:49,840
that is an excess solid waste and that

108
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:52,640
could be more more biological oxygen

109
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,670
that could be more demanding than

110
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,970
defeated then the fish feces itself and

111
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:00,980
we also have dissolved waste coming from

112
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,650
the fish usually from the gills and

113
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:06,410
that's on nitrogenous waste ammonia and

114
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:10,310
that has to be taken care of and then if

115
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:13,250
we go back indoors to an RAS system we

116
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:18,290
have to treat both the solid waste and

117
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:21,230
the dissolved waste typically an RAF

118
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,790
system is self-contained but we as we're

119
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,220
pulling the waste out of it we might

120
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:29,240
have to make up about 10 percent of the

121
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:32,090
total volume of the RAS but all these

122
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:35,240
wastes are oxygen can to consuming

123
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:38,360
entities and they have to be that that

124
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,550
waste has to be solved so let's go to

125
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,090
the treatment of waste in the outer

126
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:45,920
systems fort on the treatment is going

127
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,760
to be aeration there's almost nothing

128
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:52,850
else you can do and if you're in a pond

129
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,960
whether it's a cage or in a pond proper

130
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:59,420
aeration is going to be mandatory

131
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:01,610
especially when we get to the warmer

132
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,930
temperatures of July and August and the

133
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:06,110
farther south you go the more that

134
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:08,000
becomes a bigger problem sometimes if

135
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,000
you're using floating Raceway static

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,620
raceways or on-site tanks the flow is

137
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,810
sufficient to eliminate the need for

138
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,620
oxygenation but it has to be there as a

139
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:20,540
standby the indoor systems we have some

140
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,210
flow through systems but generally not

141
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:25,550
most of them are closed-loop systems and

142
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:27,920
they require a more sophisticated waste

143
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,780
treatment system you know you start with

144
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:32,690
solids removal and then you have a

145
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:36,130
second step for the dissolved solid and

146
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:38,900
gaseous waste which would be basically

147
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:41,070
converting ammonia to nitrate and that's

148
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,990
a biological process you know

149
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:47,420
a little bit about the complications of

150
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:49,980
that later so I put a couple pictures in

151
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,540
for those that I mean I think you know

152
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,970
most of what I've been talking about

153
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:57,090
except these slides are of what I have

154
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,520
does by pondside teen culture the ones

155
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:03,510
on the left are the low profile and I

156
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,900
use those for spawning eggs feet

157
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:09,780
training fry and fingerling size grading

158
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:12,210
but then the next year when I go I have

159
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,980
the bigger tanks for the grow-out and

160
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,170
basically you're starting with like

161
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:18,270
these are for perch and if I'm starting

162
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:20,490
with a four inch perch I'll go to the

163
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,350
grow out in four months so that's that's

164
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,960
the setup for that and notice that

165
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:27,840
here's the girl tanks and then this is a

166
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,060
this is actually a solid collection tank

167
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,160
so that's one of the things I do so

168
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,430
there's no solids collection here but

169
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,550
there's no solid waste accumulating

170
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,290
there either and this is a little odd

171
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:44,760
for our part of the country but this is

172
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:48,060
a shrimp tank set up a lot of them this

173
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:52,860
is about 80 degrees and this is just a

174
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:56,130
large full barn and this the one on the

175
00:07:52,860 --> 00:08:00,240
right is a small aquaponics you have the

176
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:02,040
fish tank a little degassing tanks for

177
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,380
ammonia treatment and then you have

178
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:06,390
that's converted to nitrates what is

179
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,940
used by the plants and that's a very

180
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,750
small unit being on high school or maybe

181
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,090
your basement

182
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:15,210
so not nothing real big there's

183
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:17,900
obviously they're very large systems

184
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:20,970
when they get into aquaponics okay so

185
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,470
let's talk about the physical parameters

186
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,320
and what are the most important

187
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:27,000
parameters to look for the one that

188
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:28,020
drives everything I talked a lot about

189
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,830
oxygen

190
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,870
INRI oxygenation and the one thing about

191
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:37,800
oxygen is that it's all temperature

192
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:41,370
related oxygen saturation is the highest

193
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:43,320
at low temperatures and you lose

194
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:45,900
saturation the higher the temperatures

195
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,930
are that's why we have so much problem

196
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,550
holding oxygen in July in August then

197
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:54,540
there we have to put a lot of aeration

198
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,940
in in a system and conversely in the

199
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,970
winter

200
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,520
we don't may not aerate at all the rate

201
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:02,800
of waste treatment occurs much faster

202
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:06,600
with warm temperatures again as the

203
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,610
warmer temperatures occur then we get

204
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,130
oxygen eaten up a lot faster because the

205
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,320
waste treatment occurs faster

206
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,330
oxygen consumption by fish and the

207
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,760
wasted justin is significant lowering

208
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:21,240
cool temperatures which would be winter

209
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:25,450
which is most of the time up here and

210
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:29,110
the cool spring and fall is cool so very

211
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:31,060
little oxygen demand or I should say

212
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,770
extensive oxygen demand in the middle of

213
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:37,090
summer but not so in the rest of the

214
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:39,460
time indoor systems generally they're

215
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:42,370
really warm but sometimes they go with a

216
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:45,130
cold water fish and it's important to

217
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:49,000
know this is critical right here the

218
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:51,160
rate of converting ammonia to nitrate

219
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,310
which is what you have to do an indoor

220
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:58,390
system will be dependent upon your

221
00:09:54,310 --> 00:10:01,780
biological treatment system very much

222
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:03,460
reduced in coal temperature so for

223
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,940
working with warm temperatures it works

224
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:09,610
pretty good but you have to be cognizant

225
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:14,410
of the fact that it doesn't work if at

226
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:17,440
all when it's very cold okay for solids

227
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:19,630
removal typically we're actually I'm

228
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,820
able to remove solids from an outdoor

229
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,890
pond until after a growing season or if

230
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,790
we have to take a pond down there's one

231
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:29,440
other thing I forgot to add in here a

232
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:32,440
lot of ponds you can do wheat harvesting

233
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,450
and that's that's a reduction in solids

234
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,320
but there you're you're really doing

235
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:40,660
that to pull out the nutrients and

236
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,300
actually if you let that overwinter all

237
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:46,060
those plants are going to decompose in

238
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:49,210
your pond and actually be a deficit for

239
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:52,240
oxygen so that's a solid removal where

240
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:55,480
that comes in some outdoor situations as

241
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:59,470
I said before you can remove solids as

242
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,990
as are generated like in raceways and

243
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:05,740
flow channels and specifically in in

244
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,990
ponds I taste which is what I do in

245
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:12,490
general

246
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:14,620
we we don't have many permits wastewater

247
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:18,070
permits typically the federal

248
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,930
requirements prevail they're pretty much

249
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:23,470
best management practice for the

250
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:25,990
aquaculture industry however the largest

251
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:29,200
discharges may be subject to wastewater

252
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,520
discharge permits I think we only have

253
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,390
one or two of them in the state of

254
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:36,760
Wisconsin so that shows you how

255
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,980
infrequent a permit is everybody's

256
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:42,820
supposed to be under the best management

257
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:46,830
practices most states will follow the

258
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:49,600
federal loo lead with respect to permits

259
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:52,390
and if you do have a permit it's going

260
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,520
to be based on solids biochemical oxygen

261
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:59,080
demand an ammonia and now most recently

262
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,600
we're seeing new restrictions on

263
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:06,070
phosphorous and he's a very low level

264
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:10,029
but they're based on Basin whole Basin

265
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:12,520
waste Lord watershed loading and so it

266
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:14,730
may be a problem at hundred miles away

267
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:16,779
but it starts at your place so

268
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,410
phosphorous is the new kid on the block

269
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,410
here
