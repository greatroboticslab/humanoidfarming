1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:05,819
good morning everyone are you enjoying

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,250
the conference so far yeah

3
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:09,599
good while I'm excited to be back here

4
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,250
this year I wasn't sure I was going to

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,750
be able to make it and so that I'm happy

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:18,869
that I'm here the original intent for

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:21,060
this session was for dan and I to make

8
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,680
an announcement about some new projects

9
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:24,930
and joint projects a joint project that

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,010
we are working on rather than as a

11
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,679
workshop so we're going to kick off with

12
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,250
the description of some very exciting

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:39,059
news and then after that I'll elaborate

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:40,800
and expand on it a little bit and then

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,790
we can have an open Q&A and talk about

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,530
whatever it is that you like to talk

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:48,390
about as we did last year and I've done

18
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,320
several times before while I'm really

19
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,969
personal what I'm really passionate

20
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,070
about in this space of regenerative

21
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:54,930
agriculture is having regenerative

22
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:56,850
agriculture models become the standard

23
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:59,460
become the status quo the mainstream

24
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,350
globally around the world by 2040 that's

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,579
why I found that advancing eco

26
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,290
agriculture of why I'm doing the work

27
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,700
that I'm doing why we started the

28
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,810
podcast and freely readily share

29
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,760
information make it available to

30
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:13,470
everyone and one of the pieces that has

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,360
become abundantly clear is that in order

32
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,869
to understand regenerative agriculture

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,700
agronomy well there are so many

34
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,220
different areas of science that we need

35
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,619
to understand growers need to know a

36
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,880
little bit about horticulture they need

37
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,840
to know a little bit about the genetics

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,189
or I shouldn't say a little bit but

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,110
actually a lot they need to know a lot

40
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,720
about genetics a lot about 40 culture a

41
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,590
lot about biochemistry biophysics plant

42
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,090
pathology entomology there are so many

43
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,680
integrated areas of science that all

44
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,649
come together in understanding

45
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,780
agriculture and plant production and

46
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:47,820
this is a significant challenge this is

47
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:51,540
a challenge for growers and it's also a

48
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:55,320
challenge for us as a company when we

49
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:57,030
hire someone to join our team our

50
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,369
agronomy team and our consulting team we

51
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,880
have a challenge we have set such an

52
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:05,880
extremely high bar and a high standard

53
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:08,069
of leadership and our team is expected

54
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,599
to be extremely knowledgeable about all

55
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:12,569
these different areas and be able to

56
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,440
implement them in any given situation in

57
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:16,500
the operate

58
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,900
so when we hire someone to join our team

59
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,420
one of our significant limiting factors

60
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:26,260
to growth as a company is our ability to

61
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:28,950
train people and get them to understand

62
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:31,510
all these different areas we have had

63
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:34,200
PhDs go through our training course we

64
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:38,500
have a very intense training course and

65
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:40,720
they have said that they learned more in

66
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,880
the first 90 days of our training course

67
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:46,030
and they did in their entire degree it's

68
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,860
a very common feedback that we get so I

69
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:49,870
believe it's very important to

70
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,030
democratize information and to digitize

71
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,269
information make it widely and readily

72
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:57,220
available but the learning there is such

73
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:59,230
a large volume and quantity of

74
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:03,400
information that is valuable and needs

75
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,870
to be learned and it takes time to

76
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,319
process all of that and to assimilate

77
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,030
all of that one of the questions that

78
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,760
I've been thinking about a lot is how

79
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,519
can we restrict that how can we remove

80
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,519
that barrier to adoption and to grow if

81
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,560
both for our team as a company and also

82
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:26,019
for growers around the world

83
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:27,579
so our over the last four years I have

84
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,430
been thinking quite deeply about a

85
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:32,410
project of digitizing all of our

86
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,079
knowledge and putting together

87
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:38,049
algorithms that take all this

88
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,880
information and report results and make

89
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:43,420
agronomic recommendations in exactly the

90
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,220
same way that we do as consultants so

91
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,870
this is obviously a significant

92
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:54,420
challenge because there are so many

93
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:59,049
interrelated areas and I'm quite I'm

94
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,790
quite excited over the last few months

95
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:03,700
we have begun actively working on this

96
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:06,880
project as a for this moment we're

97
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:09,459
calling it the AI agronomist our goal is

98
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,340
by the end of next year this time next

99
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:14,920
year to have a beta launched where

100
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,019
people will be able to upload all of

101
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,289
their soil analysis data plant SAP

102
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,870
analysis irrigation water varieties be

103
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:25,390
able to put in all their agronomic data

104
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:27,479
that they have and we will be we have we

105
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,130
will have very specific

106
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:33,460
requests for information that is needed

107
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:36,039
to make the information complete and the

108
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:39,130
then the AI agronomist will give you

109
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:40,599
specific recommendations for what types

110
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,490
of soil amendments you might need or

111
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:44,050
what types of microbial inoculants you

112
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:45,430
might benefit from for what types of

113
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,990
foliar applications you might benefit

114
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:50,110
from what types of varieties might do

115
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,699
well in your situation so there will be

116
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,580
a tremendous amount of information

117
00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:57,280
flowing into the backend we will be

118
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:00,460
collecting meteorological data lunar

119
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,750
cycle data soil information so there's

120
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,220
there's a lot of information that is

121
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,960
publicly available there is also a lot

122
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,759
of laboratory work that may need to be

123
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,310
done on some farms to prepare us and get

124
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:12,639
to this point but what I'm really

125
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:15,909
excited about is that when we make this

126
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,440
available all of a sudden someone who

127
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:18,940
becomes interested in regenerative

128
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,250
agriculture and wants to grow food in

129
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,520
this way for the first time they can

130
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,530
they can learn about it in December and

131
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,780
in February they can have some guidance

132
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:33,820
on what they are going to do on their

133
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:35,740
farm it really it can supersede the

134
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:37,150
learning process obviously the learning

135
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,530
still needs to happen the education

136
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,719
still needs to happen but this can help

137
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:43,270
take all of this knowledge that is

138
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:46,419
represented by so many scientists in the

139
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:50,949
field and put it into a usable practical

140
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:52,870
form that anyone can access and what I'm

141
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:54,520
really excited about is that that is

142
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,349
then not just available for growers here

143
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,930
in North America where AEA is working a

144
00:05:56,349 --> 00:06:01,240
lot but also for growers in South

145
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:05,110
America and in Africa and in Europe and

146
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,930
in Asia and around the world so this I

147
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:10,389
believe will be a foundational piece to

148
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:13,690
making regenerative agriculture become

149
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:15,819
the mainstream here's why I'm so excited

150
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,860
about the conversation today many quote

151
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:20,319
what really drives many growers decision

152
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:22,090
making process and it's a very human

153
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,710
tendency is rather than planning of how

154
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:28,000
to prevent problems we react to problems

155
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:31,120
and so many growers are looking for

156
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,199
solutions to a specific insect pest or a

157
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,870
specific disease so all of the

158
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,360
information exists today to be able to

159
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:43,960
identify the underlying nutritional

160
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,210
issues that result in a specific insect

161
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,330
pest being in a crop let's say that we

162
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:53,469
have a potato farmer in Colorado who has

163
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:55,930
11 fields of potatoes it's possible for

164
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:58,330
that potato grower to get an alert that

165
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:59,939
says you need to begin scouting your

166
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,560
potato fields for Colorado potato beetle

167
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:04,090
because they're expected to emerge from

168
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,449
winter dormancy in the next 24 to 48

169
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:10,210
hours and of your 11 fields field number

170
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:12,969
3 and field number 8 are very highly

171
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,830
susceptible to infection field number 3

172
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:16,810
is susceptible because it has high

173
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,310
levels of nitrates and has high levels

174
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,440
of nitrates because you have low levels

175
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,909
of molybdenum and you need to apply 50

176
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,039
grams of molybdenum to per acre to

177
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:26,590
remove your susceptibility from a 9 down

178
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:28,270
to a 2 field number 8 is very

179
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:31,030
susceptible because it has low levels of

180
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,650
magnesium you need to apply 5 pounds per

181
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:35,069
acre of magnesium sulfate to move their

182
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,629
susceptibility down to it too that

183
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:40,509
completely changes the conversation the

184
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:42,699
conversation is now no longer about you

185
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:44,710
need to apply this insecticide it's

186
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:46,509
about this is why you have the problem

187
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,120
and this is what you can do to reverse

188
00:07:46,509 --> 00:07:51,310
it all the information already exists

189
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,379
who put that platform together but

190
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,060
nobody has done it yet and we intend to

191
00:07:53,379 --> 00:08:03,979
do it

192
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:08,340
[Applause]

193
00:08:03,979 --> 00:08:11,039
thank you so those of you who know

194
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,080
Noah's only been conspiring for one of

195
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,629
the decade together and this has been

196
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,690
one of our fantasy projects for many

197
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:20,099
years and so to be able to be publicly

198
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,110
announcing the fact that we're working

199
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,970
on this together and you know there's a

200
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,190
real timeframe in which this is going to

201
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:30,300
occur I think is I'm just really honored

202
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:32,610
and yeah exhilarated to be here

203
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:33,930
I think the agreement we make about ten

204
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:38,930
years ago was that John ago the

205
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:41,399
for-profit and we coordinated magazines

206
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,870
so that's pretty much what's been

207
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:44,039
happening and we give each other a hard

208
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:47,880
time about various things at various

209
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,980
points in time but yeah to to build this

210
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,620
framework out which we've you know

211
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:55,200
established to a large degree with the

212
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,520
open team with the you know all the data

213
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,410
partners were working on with the real

214
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,360
food campaign collaborative framework

215
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,300
with companies and universities and

216
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:07,770
organizations and farmers open source to

217
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:10,020
look at the in field dynamics and then

218
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:11,640
to be able to build the hardware that

219
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,430
can do the sensing I think that's the

220
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,040
one piece John didn't talk about was the

221
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:19,170
ability to do in field assessment with

222
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,660
spectrometer anybody who's been working

223
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:23,130
with him do the plant set of analysis

224
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,170
and harvesting the leaves and sending

225
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,760
them off to Europe and spending hundreds

226
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:28,620
of dollars a week and getting reports

227
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,750
back two weeks later I think it's one of

228
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,950
been one of John's really systemic

229
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,070
frustrations over the past couple of

230
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:38,820
years is how can we get this real-time

231
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:40,829
in field data back sooner and you know

232
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,450
the answer is if we can assess what's

233
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:44,570
going on in the plant in real time with

234
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,190
something like a spectrometer then

235
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:48,830
we have the ability to actually take

236
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,680
that you know whatever that investment

237
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:53,170
is that you'd be spending on sampling

238
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:56,360
leaves and sending them to the to

239
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:58,760
Hollander Netherlands to be able to

240
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,340
basically take two weeks of investment

241
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:02,480
in in plants leaf samples and have a

242
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:05,480
piece of hardware that you can use

243
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:09,410
forever thereafter so it is a big

244
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,760
complicated hairy audacious project and

245
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:14,240
we don't working on it for a while and

246
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,410
it's gonna require resources but you

247
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,720
have to be able to formally announce

248
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,130
this and really move forward actively

249
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:21,800
and pulling an office is very

250
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:23,240
exhilarating so this is John stage I

251
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,140
just wanted to be here or he asked me to

252
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,130
be here to confirm it as well so thank

253
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:31,510
you all for being here and I'm sure

254
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,510
you're gonna have a wonderful next hour

255
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,409
[Applause]

256
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,330
so I think one of the important pieces

257
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:44,330
that Dan and I have agreed to

258
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:45,650
collaborate on and our collective

259
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:46,760
enterprises with advancing eco

260
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:49,520
agriculture in the bio nutrient Food

261
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:51,650
Association one of the strengths that we

262
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:54,290
have is that we have a lot of historical

263
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:56,240
data on a large scale forum right at

264
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,520
this moment in time we have I don't know

265
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,610
the exact count but we have several

266
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,810
hundred thousand data points closer to a

267
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:06,350
million than to the bottom end of the

268
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:08,720
scale on that represent 48 different

269
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:10,370
crops across the country 48 crops so

270
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,670
those are 48 crops that we have a

271
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:16,730
significant amount of data on and what

272
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:19,070
we have learned in from experience is

273
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:22,100
that many growers may have the best of

274
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:23,810
intentions but they often lack the

275
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:25,190
bandwidth and the resources to be able

276
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,800
to collect samples in a timely manner

277
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:30,110
during the growing season and so in our

278
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,700
work at AEA in any area where we have a

279
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,930
local concentration of growers we're

280
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,990
working with large number growers we

281
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:37,670
actually have our team our staff is out

282
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,960
in the field collecting all the data

283
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:42,950
they're doing all the sample collection

284
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:46,700
and so our collaboration over the course

285
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:48,290
as the spectrometer is developed we will

286
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:52,810
be working closely with the spectrometer

287
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:56,390
to develop all the data libraries and to

288
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:58,260
match what is happening of what the what

289
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:02,160
the spectrometer readouts are with

290
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:04,500
historical sap analysis and based on

291
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,270
simply on the volume of data that we go

292
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,480
through in a single growing season or in

293
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:11,490
as little as a few months we expect to

294
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,170
be able to have a very strong data

295
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,610
library to be able to use the

296
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,110
spectrometer in the field to make

297
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:23,640
management decisions very rapidly very

298
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:25,050
quickly and dan is correct we have been

299
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:30,630
dreaming about this for a decade

300
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:32,340
so in fact I I first I first wrote that

301
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:35,220
I wrote the first set of algorithms in

302
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:39,860
the first outline for what we're now

303
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:43,050
calling the AI agronomist in 2014 and I

304
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,810
got done with this spreadsheet that was

305
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:48,930
an absolute monstrosity and when I got

306
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:51,330
done my last sentence at the bottom said

307
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,370
we have everything that we need to make

308
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:54,930
this work in real time except we don't

309
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:58,590
have a sensor that can analyze

310
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:00,200
nutritional profiles in the field so

311
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:02,460
that's what we've been waiting for and

312
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,780
certainly we can do it and we will be

313
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:08,130
doing a lot of this with laboratory

314
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:10,440
analysis even to to help develop the

315
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:13,200
spectrometer but the eventual

316
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,430
expectation is that if the spectrometer

317
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,350
does well we believe it's going to be

318
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:19,860
capable of doing we will have an infield

319
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:22,050
tool imagine having an infield tool that

320
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,730
could do a soil analysis that could do

321
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,340
an irrigation water analysis that could

322
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:29,430
do a leaf SAP analysis you can do all of

323
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,990
those things and more so that's that's

324
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:34,910
the dream and the aspiration that we're

325
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:39,890
working toward it's all it's all good

326
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:45,320
all right so Dan asked me to also speak

327
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:47,630
a little bit about the some of the

328
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,670
information that is going into the

329
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:59,500
agronomist and some of the pieces that

330
00:13:49,670 --> 00:14:02,570
are behind it and it's really big and

331
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:05,030
it's almost more than I can describe

332
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:08,600
very quickly and easily but there are a

333
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:10,580
few pieces that I will describe that I

334
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,840
might be unexpected I'll focus on some

335
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:16,520
of the unexpected pieces of the

336
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:20,330
unanticipated pieces one of those is we

337
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:23,120
were still reviewing data to make all

338
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:26,780
the correlations and connections but it

339
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,030
seems that there is a connection between

340
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:31,700
overall plant health and performance and

341
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:36,920
cosmic radiation as measured on the KP

342
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:39,880
index and the Phi angle so you can there

343
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,560
are a number of resources one that I

344
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:44,980
enjoy out paying attention to is a

345
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:51,350
website called space with their news and

346
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:53,590
essentially it gives us when we look at

347
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:57,290
sunspot activity and solar activity

348
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:59,690
sunspot activity correlates to well

349
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,220
first of all the the photons coming from

350
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,540
the Sun can have either a negative or a

351
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,210
positive charge they're not all the same

352
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,730
and the charges that reach the Earth's

353
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,990
surface depend on a number of different

354
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,430
factors including the radiation

355
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:15,140
shielding magnetic shields the event

356
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:17,120
Allen belts etc and there is a

357
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:20,600
counterpoint between silver radiation

358
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,460
and cosmic radiation and what that means

359
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,320
is that when we have periods of stronger

360
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:26,810
solar radiation we have that actually

361
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,710
strengthens the magnetic field protect

362
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:32,330
the envelope protecting the earth and

363
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,580
that effectively shields cosmic

364
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,830
radiation coming in or you can have the

365
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,480
opposite effect where you have very weak

366
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:42,020
solar radiation and you have much

367
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,030
stronger cosmic radiation coming in why

368
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,040
is this important why should it matter

369
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,810
well there's two reasons one is that

370
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:51,170
solar the

371
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:53,330
rgeous on the solar radiation actually

372
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:55,160
influence plant health very strong that

373
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,200
we've started observing a few years ago

374
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,120
once as we really dialed in to plant

375
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:02,720
health more and more we started

376
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,910
observing that there could be periods of

377
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:10,070
a few days or in some cases even a few

378
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:12,200
weeks where solar radiation seemed to

379
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,300
actually impact plants negatively rather

380
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,460
than positive positively and of course

381
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,350
that's the opposite of what you would

382
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,790
expect to be happening that's when we

383
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:23,020
first started looking at the qualities

384
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:28,850
of solar radiation and how it varies and

385
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:33,560
then of course for those of us thinking

386
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:36,980
about biodynamic agriculture and when we

387
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:39,500
plant seeds in alignment with various

388
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,440
solar cycles and lunar cycles as as

389
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,060
according to the various constellations

390
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,480
all of a sudden it because we realize

391
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:51,260
that the influence of cosmic radiation

392
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:54,050
is also mediated by solar radiation so

393
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,430
when you have very weak solar radiation

394
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,600
which allows a lot of cosmic radiation

395
00:16:55,430 --> 00:17:00,130
to come through which is actually has

396
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:03,530
happened a lot this last year then the

397
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:05,420
influences of when you plant a seed in

398
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:06,560
correlation to different constant the

399
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,150
presence of different being in the

400
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:10,910
presence of different constellations has

401
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:13,790
a much bigger impact and this is another

402
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:16,130
topic that is a bit out in left field

403
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:19,490
for some people but I think it's a very

404
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:23,329
important one what we have observed is

405
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:26,480
that the timing at which you plant seeds

406
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:31,429
according to in association with a given

407
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,560
constellation has less of an impact in

408
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:37,910
fact I can say that it has almost no

409
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:39,440
impact on very challenged soils soils

410
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,940
that have very low organic matter cells

411
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,140
that have very little microbial activity

412
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:44,690
you don't see much of a difference if

413
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:46,670
you separate planting by a few dates by

414
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:48,710
a few days but when you have high

415
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:50,510
organic matter soils and you have really

416
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:52,429
active microbial activity that

417
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,679
difference becomes can become extremely

418
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:56,270
pronounced so the healthier your farms

419
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:58,970
are the healthier soils are the bigger

420
00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:00,590
of a difference you can make by

421
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:07,429
selecting the dates of what you plant

422
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:14,470
seeds so that was some far out of left

423
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:14,470
field information what else is important

424
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:21,830
obviously we're including all of the

425
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:30,230
information on soil analysis plant beef

426
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:33,049
analysis we expect it will take some

427
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,610
time we don't yet have enough data it

428
00:18:33,049 --> 00:18:38,149
will take some time for us to develop

429
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:40,970
the data on understanding which

430
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:45,340
varieties correlate to given nutritional

431
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:49,909
profiles and given environments but I

432
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:52,159
expect there we will without let me back

433
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:55,490
up just a moment when we first started

434
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:59,090
using plant sap analysis in 2011 plant

435
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:03,080
sap analysis really revolutionized our

436
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:06,049
understanding of the interaction of

437
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,789
minerals inside plants and how to best

438
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:09,470
supply those minerals with implants

439
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:11,270
because for the first time we had an

440
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,590
accurate and an accurate window into

441
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,940
what was actually happening what was

442
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,480
actually going on we no longer had to

443
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:19,330
guess

444
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:22,850
and as a result of plant SAP analysis

445
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:24,529
displacing tissue analysis on almost all

446
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,320
the operations all the operations that

447
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:29,240
we work with we there were some things

448
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,390
that we expected to find and we learned

449
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:33,590
a lot more that we didn't expect that we

450
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,500
didn't know that we had no idea what's

451
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,669
coming I expect the same will happen

452
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,440
once we begin collecting all this

453
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:42,649
initial information looking at all the

454
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,980
correlations and on a digital platform

455
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:47,600
we will be able to make correlations

456
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,210
between specific nutritional profiles

457
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,299
specific varieties that we can't

458
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:57,230
anticipate and don't expect right now

459
00:19:52,299 --> 00:20:02,390
what we have observed already with the

460
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:05,330
plant SAP analysis is that the genetics

461
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:08,750
the given variety of a crop has a

462
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:11,059
tremendous influence on absorption of

463
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:14,330
nutrients from the soil we know that we

464
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:16,039
can have two different varieties dan

465
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:17,510
and with his work here at the BFA has

466
00:20:16,039 --> 00:20:20,269
described how you can have the same

467
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:21,620
variety of carrots and have radically

468
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:24,140
different nutritional profiles from

469
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:27,740
different soils but the other additional

470
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:30,140
element is that if you then take those

471
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,929
that one variety and you put it onto the

472
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:37,549
optimal soil the soil where it really

473
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:40,250
thrives the best you can plant another

474
00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:42,019
variety right beside it that might now

475
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,940
have three times a higher nutritional

476
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:46,389
profile in the original variety so there

477
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:50,510
are also varietal differences and then

478
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:52,789
to add another layer the nutritional the

479
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:55,639
these various varieties will perform

480
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:58,970
differently on different soils so on one

481
00:20:55,639 --> 00:21:00,889
soil or in one environment where the

482
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,940
original variety tested might not do

483
00:21:00,889 --> 00:21:03,529
well it might not have a good

484
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,450
nutritional profile there is another

485
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:07,820
variety that might have a 5x higher

486
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:10,070
nutritional profile on that soil so

487
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,659
there are both varietal differences in

488
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:13,669
soil differences that we expect to be

489
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:14,899
able to correlate once we have more of

490
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:18,679
the information or the data to be able

491
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:20,600
to do that so I'd like to open it for

492
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:23,269
questions do you have any questions on

493
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,100
what we're working on and or suggestions

494
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:28,059
on what you would like to see when are

495
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:30,799
we releasing the AEA planting calendar

496
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:32,450
don't know I haven't thought about that

497
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:37,570
we actually did release a couple years

498
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:40,370
ago the AEA foliar spraying calendar and

499
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:42,409
that one is still in existence and

500
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:44,029
floating around somewhere it's been a

501
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:48,070
while since I spoke about that but we

502
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:50,990
observed a very distinct 28-day cycle

503
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:53,570
with plant absorption of nutrients the

504
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:54,860
original observation occurred with the

505
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:56,779
Dutch team and the Netherlands that

506
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,190
developed sap analysis they observed

507
00:21:56,779 --> 00:22:01,630
when they were working with hydroponic

508
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:06,139
growers they would measure not only the

509
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:07,909
the SAP analysis but also the quantity

510
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:09,679
of nutrients that came through their

511
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,960
hydroponic system so how many nutrients

512
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,480
were left in the water at the end of

513
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:17,990
each week and they discovered a very

514
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:22,429
distinct cycle where one week out of the

515
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:23,510
four and I can't remember which which is

516
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:25,970
which right now I'd have to reference

517
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:28,070
the calendar but out of the total

518
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,889
four-week cycle one week out of the four

519
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:33,499
plants absorbs 75% of all the nutrients

520
00:22:30,889 --> 00:22:35,960
in the water two weeks out of 450

521
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:37,159
percent and the one week out of four

522
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:38,479
which was two weeks out of phase with

523
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:40,720
the seventy-five percent they only did

524
00:22:38,479 --> 00:22:43,549
25 percent so radically different

525
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,919
absorption of nutrients from the soil

526
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:48,049
based on the lunar cycle so we've

527
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:51,710
actually been able to correspond to that

528
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:53,389
and try to better time when we put on

529
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,759
foliar applications and when we put on

530
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:56,869
irrigation applications for some crops

531
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:58,519
for growing high-value food and

532
00:22:56,869 --> 00:22:59,600
vegetable crops it really doesn't matter

533
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:01,700
because we're going to be doing it

534
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,320
constantly all the time but for crops

535
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,840
where we're only putting on three to

536
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,489
five applications per season timing

537
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,059
those applications to match up with the

538
00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:12,649
lunar cycles gives us a tremendous crop

539
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:13,580
response and a much greater efficiency

540
00:23:12,649 --> 00:23:18,109
for the products that we're actually

541
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:20,239
applying so and again this what I get

542
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:21,409
excited about is that I can be here

543
00:23:20,239 --> 00:23:23,179
having this conversation with you

544
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:24,769
talking about lunar cycles and we have

545
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:27,340
the PDF published somewhere on the

546
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:30,080
advancing iko iko cultural website but

547
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:33,200
now we will be able to take that

548
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,210
information and put it into a

549
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,739
recommendations engine to say you need

550
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:39,309
to put on your soil amendment

551
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:42,830
applications you need to put on your

552
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:44,210
biological applications this week don't

553
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,799
put them on in two weeks from now put

554
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:47,419
them on this week and you'll get a much

555
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,889
bigger soil health response and much

556
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:52,159
bigger crop response all of a sudden

557
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:54,769
that information that can be shared

558
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,619
verbally and trained and needs to be

559
00:23:54,769 --> 00:23:59,059
also becomes immediately executable and

560
00:23:57,619 --> 00:24:03,489
implementable by everyone around the

561
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:06,489
world that's what I'm excited about yeah

562
00:24:03,489 --> 00:24:06,489
yes

563
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:14,240
reduction treaty on time this is to only

564
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:16,760
have been academic so all this data are

565
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,640
assembling analyzed against a great

566
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:23,600
exciting there's a dark I incident

567
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:26,380
after the first is that of a social

568
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,110
scientist which is that this is still

569
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:32,960
operating very much limited mention

570
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:35,920
paradigm of acupuncture proficiencies

571
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,200
the remedy that would power inputs we're

572
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:43,640
for this and the measurements you have a

573
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,440
second reality essential chemical use

574
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,280
biology as a remedy

575
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,870
you don't analyze violence or biology as

576
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,230
a cause for some of these things that's

577
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:57,230
very active do i I can see that I see

578
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:59,830
someone is reinforcing business model or

579
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:03,190
farmers are not investigators

580
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:06,230
diagnosticians analysts problem solvers

581
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:08,620
and the worth becomes our automatons

582
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:12,140
there was a really comprehensive

583
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:14,559
recommendation you as apartments do what

584
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,559
they're told

585
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:46,360
that's building into this this is

586
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:49,460
fundamentally the biological yeah yes so

587
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:52,040
thank you for that comment I have you've

588
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:56,450
raised a couple of different points so

589
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:58,100
to the first of influencing and managing

590
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:03,100
biology rather than purely taking a

591
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:05,750
chemistry approach the I I've framed

592
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,220
spoken about primary to the chemistry

593
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,450
piece because of the implications of

594
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:12,140
course the spectrometer that Dan is

595
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:15,500
developing however the the information

596
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:18,200
that we're collecting we are also

597
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,790
measuring a number of different soil

598
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,650
parameters including infiltration rates

599
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:23,450
and we're you're correct on those of

600
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:26,030
microbial assays those are a challenge

601
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:27,830
because we need a microbial assay that

602
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:30,230
is both quantitative and qualitative at

603
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,700
the same time it's we it's not enough to

604
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:35,140
just identify the presence of an

605
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:38,030
organism we also need to know the

606
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:40,670
quantity of a given organism present and

607
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:41,930
as of yet there isn't technology capable

608
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:48,620
of doing that but there there is

609
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:50,240
qualitative information on when we look

610
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:53,960
at soul aggregation we can do some

611
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,760
analog metrics and we are using those

612
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,860
analog metrics and we are also making

613
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,270
recommendations for compost applications

614
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:00,800
for what types of cover crops for use

615
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:03,800
for what type of tillage to use or not

616
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:08,420
to use and our entire the way we're

617
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:11,540
framing the entire conversation in the

618
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:14,420
engine that we're developing is to shift

619
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:16,820
the thinking to in two ways one is to

620
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:18,830
think about the cause of the problem

621
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:22,640
rather than just the symptom and the

622
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:24,410
second is to think about the or to have

623
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,090
the recommendations emphasize the

624
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:27,740
biological solution not the chemistry

625
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,070
solution so I failed to mention that

626
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:33,740
that is

627
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:39,410
important then to your point on the

628
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:43,640
sociological implications every time a

629
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:45,020
recommendation is made this will take

630
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,250
some time to develop of course because

631
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:49,300
there's so many explanations but every

632
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:51,620
time a recommendation is made we want

633
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:53,240
anyone to be able to challenge that why

634
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:56,150
is this recommendation being made and

635
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,380
immediately for us to provide a

636
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:58,850
reference and a link that they can look

637
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,910
and say okay this is why we made the

638
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:05,300
recommendation this way to give people

639
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:07,070
the capacity to see that learn that and

640
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:12,830
also to disagree with it and give us

641
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:15,170
feedback and then to your extreme

642
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:23,180
example of our idea of farmers becoming

643
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:28,490
automatons is what many farmers do today

644
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:32,660
so very different from that yeah but I

645
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:33,590
think this you raise an important

646
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,880
question it's certainly something that

647
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:38,300
we have thought about that we need to

648
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:41,450
think more about the the desire is to

649
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:43,610
completely change the relationship with

650
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:47,800
the crop that they're growing because I

651
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:50,300
very strongly believe that one of the

652
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,830
significant failures that we have in our

653
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,500
agriculture today is that our

654
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:56,960
agriculture has no soul it has no heart

655
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,940
there is no longer a heart connection

656
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,340
with the plants that we're producing

657
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:04,490
it's become very mechanistic very

658
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:07,550
intellectual and that in order for us we

659
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:13,070
know that if we want to produce food

660
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:15,950
that has the capacity to produce I'll

661
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:17,540
use the words spiritual coherence food

662
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:19,910
needs the plants need to be grown with

663
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:21,590
love they need to grow be growing with

664
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:24,020
heart they respond to that and there's a

665
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:25,430
lot of information behind this again

666
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,900
this might be coming really out of left

667
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,640
field for some people if you want to dig

668
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:32,090
more deeply into this I very highly

669
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,750
recommend stephen hara Buner series of

670
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:40,670
three books the first is titled the lost

671
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:43,610
language of plants the second is the

672
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:50,120
secret teachings of plants and the third

673
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:53,690
is plant intelligence yes the first book

674
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:56,810
is the lost language of plants the

675
00:29:53,690 --> 00:30:00,100
second is the secret teachings of plants

676
00:29:56,810 --> 00:30:03,710
and the third is plant intelligence

677
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:06,620
Steven Buner is perhaps my favorite

678
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:08,000
author for his writing style I purchased

679
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,740
every book that he ever wrote even the

680
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,710
ones not related to agriculture because

681
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:15,200
so much enjoyed reading his writing but

682
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:18,380
those three books are perhaps my three

683
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,260
personal favorites they are absolutely

684
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,800
incredible and I'll just give you one

685
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:23,570
hint

686
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:27,290
I've gifted these books to many

687
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:29,450
different people and many people

688
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:30,800
particularly the lost language of plants

689
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:32,900
when they start reading it they can't

690
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,650
put it down there I have had people read

691
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:38,960
for 26 hours straight to finish the book

692
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:44,360
more than one person more than a handful

693
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:46,490
and to give you just a glimpse of some

694
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:48,530
of the pieces that Steven speaks about I

695
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:50,930
can't possibly begin to do justice to

696
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:55,400
all the topics that he covers he

697
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:58,640
describes the science of plant human

698
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:01,010
communication but he also and he

699
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,570
described the science of plant to human

700
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:04,220
heart communication it's not just an

701
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:10,970
intelligent process or an intellectual

702
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:13,370
process and in the in the last of the

703
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:17,870
three books plant intelligence he

704
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:22,430
describes plant neural networks and this

705
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:24,650
one I read a lot I'm not often surprised

706
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:26,480
I was surprised and delighted by the

707
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:29,600
book of plant intelligence he describes

708
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:33,830
how we historically have thought of

709
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:36,200
human intelligence in the context of the

710
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:38,870
brain the brain being a specific organ

711
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:43,760
with a number of neurons large number of

712
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:45,500
neurons and as our thinking has evolved

713
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,910
we realized that it's not just a brain

714
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,650
but there's actually a tremendous number

715
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,240
of neurons in our digestive system in

716
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:52,040
our gut there's a lot of neurons around

717
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,320
our heart and that we need to think of

718
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,450
intelligence not in terms of brain

719
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,850
capacity intellectual capacity but in

720
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:59,929
terms of neural networks and so when we

721
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:04,250
begin thinking about neural networks

722
00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:08,120
this is from from our neural network in

723
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:11,289
our body that's why we can actually have

724
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,159
a conversation about heart cognition

725
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:16,490
recognizing what's happening with our

726
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:18,710
hearts and also why we many times may

727
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:21,710
use the words I have a gut feeling about

728
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:24,460
something because we do have a gut

729
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:24,460
feeling about something

730
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:35,179
what really rocked me was the

731
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:40,820
realization that plants have the exact

732
00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:42,320
same neural networks as we do and not

733
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:45,830
when I say the exact same neural

734
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:48,740
networks not only the their neural

735
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:50,539
network is all the growing root tips all

736
00:32:48,740 --> 00:33:00,980
the growing root tips are all connected

737
00:32:50,539 --> 00:33:04,370
and the the neurotransmitters that

738
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:07,639
plants use are have many similarities

739
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:10,000
the neurotransmitters that humans use as

740
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:12,200
well in fact the single dominant

741
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,470
neurotransmitter in both plants and

742
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,049
humans is serotonin plant

743
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:20,240
neurotransmission is based on serotonin

744
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:23,870
and serotonin derived compounds and

745
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:28,700
molecules so when we start thinking

746
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:33,759
about plant intelligence many annual

747
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:37,549
species have smaller root systems and

748
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:40,100
they don't have a neural network that is

749
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:41,629
perhaps as large as ours but when you

750
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,330
start talking about perennial species

751
00:33:41,629 --> 00:33:47,090
particularly you have a large mature

752
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:48,710
tree the neural network of a tree is

753
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:53,389
significantly larger than the neural

754
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:56,289
network of most people so now which who

755
00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:59,509
really carries the most wisdom

756
00:33:56,289 --> 00:34:01,190
so I would really encourage everyone to

757
00:33:59,509 --> 00:34:04,669
dive into that a bit more deeply yes

758
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:07,850
there is the reality is what what has

759
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:09,319
brought me to this project and the

760
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:12,349
reason I started hosting the

761
00:34:09,319 --> 00:34:15,319
regenerative agriculture podcast was

762
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:17,690
learning that there is so much valuable

763
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:21,740
information out there as as Elaine's

764
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:25,429
work and I could give a long list of

765
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:30,379
scientists work who have done incredible

766
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:35,839
research that is not generally applied

767
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:42,829
in production agriculture and an example

768
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:44,119
of this is occasionally I've had the

769
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:48,079
desire for some time to put together

770
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:49,700
resource that on a collection of all the

771
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,619
peer-reviewed published papers that

772
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:54,980
correlate the presence of a specific

773
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:57,560
insect or disease in a crop particularly

774
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:01,760
insects with a given nutritional profile

775
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:03,200
and I started this project a few weeks

776
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,579
ago and when I started I thought oh

777
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,869
there's probably a couple hundred papers

778
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:12,680
out there and on two weeks in and the

779
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:13,849
project is going to have to be some at

780
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:15,440
some point I'm gonna have to define

781
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:16,819
boundaries and limits because it just

782
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,380
keeps spreading and spreading and

783
00:35:16,819 --> 00:35:20,750
there's thousands of papers not hundreds

784
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:22,970
my point being simply that there is a

785
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:26,270
tremendous amount of information that

786
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:28,069
isn't widely practiced and the intent

787
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:32,599
for the podcast was to be able to make

788
00:35:28,069 --> 00:35:35,569
that easily accessible to growers and

789
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:38,839
producers and then the next step of

790
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:40,730
course is how do we clearly and simply

791
00:35:38,839 --> 00:35:43,760
describe in which situations they can

792
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:45,740
apply it and how they can apply it so I

793
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,839
don't know did I give a reasonable

794
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:52,579
answer to your comment was my best shot

795
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,000
yes good question that I haven't thought

796
00:35:52,579 --> 00:35:55,569
about

797
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,960
so the question what the question was

798
00:35:55,569 --> 00:36:02,569
AEA has expressed the has the expressed

799
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,640
intent of developing nutritional and

800
00:36:02,569 --> 00:36:08,300
microbial products that are so effective

801
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:09,140
that they eventually displace the needs

802
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,000
to be used

803
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:12,290
that the soil health and plant helped it

804
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,050
also such a point that you don't need to

805
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:16,760
use the products anymore and we have

806
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:18,260
quite a number of farms who have reached

807
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,530
that goal now and that's personally

808
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:24,350
quite exciting to me at least so the

809
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:26,120
question the question was at what point

810
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:31,310
does the AI agronomist become redundant

811
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:35,210
and no longer necessary and so I would

812
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:36,650
say there's there are two points that

813
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,910
come to mind and I have not thought

814
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:40,010
about that question that's a really

815
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:42,340
great question and I am going to spend a

816
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:46,280
lot of time thinking about it but I

817
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:48,830
would say part one is that when you

818
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,380
again when the overall ecosystem reached

819
00:36:48,830 --> 00:36:53,840
such a general reaches a state of such

820
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:56,930
vibrant health that it is

821
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,400
self-sustaining then you don't need to

822
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:02,990
be constantly doing the monitoring and

823
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:06,890
measuring and the second thought that

824
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:09,230
comes to mind is I see this also I

825
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:13,070
desire it to be a tool for education

826
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:16,460
about specific problems because so many

827
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:20,690
times when I teach webinars and I teach

828
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:22,370
at conferences questions and I teach a

829
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:24,950
lot about general principles and

830
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:28,670
concepts and questions are often very

831
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:30,230
specific what do do I do about X and I

832
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:34,550
want the agronomist

833
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:36,320
to be completely enough that a grower

834
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:38,780
can able be able to ask the question

835
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:41,750
what do I do about X and find the answer

836
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:43,730
for almost any pest so then as as that

837
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:46,760
learning process evolves for the grower

838
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:48,140
and he understands and learns why we

839
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,280
have this challenge and why we have that

840
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,500
challenge of what we can do about them

841
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,570
it has farming management shifts on that

842
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,370
educational pathway the reality is that

843
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:57,470
a shift to a regenerative agriculture

844
00:37:55,370 --> 00:38:01,430
doesn't really happen in the field it

845
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:04,790
happens in here and in here and so as

846
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:08,470
that shift happens then the reality is

847
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:10,790
as if when we are successful in in

848
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:12,980
growers in developing that close

849
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:14,330
connection to their crops and to their

850
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:15,740
environment have such a vibrant state of

851
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:17,720
health and at that point I would say the

852
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,860
tool becomes redundant there's no longer

853
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:19,940
as a need for that because they're in

854
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,269
tune with what's happening on what's

855
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,609
going

856
00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:26,089
that's kind of my off-the-cuff answer

857
00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:28,219
without having thought about it yes have

858
00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:41,149
you taken into consideration climate

859
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:42,919
change events the answer is yes the

860
00:38:41,149 --> 00:38:58,009
short answer is yes the long answer is a

861
00:38:42,919 --> 00:39:00,229
really long answer well there are a few

862
00:38:58,009 --> 00:39:03,469
pieces one is that a truly regenerative

863
00:39:00,229 --> 00:39:06,069
agriculture first is inherently much

864
00:39:03,469 --> 00:39:08,179
more climate resilient healthy plants

865
00:39:06,069 --> 00:39:10,189
what we've observed is that the water

866
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:12,109
consumption or the water requirements by

867
00:39:10,189 --> 00:39:13,099
really healthy plants drops by at least

868
00:39:12,109 --> 00:39:15,649
50%

869
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:17,329
in some cases more that's a huge water

870
00:39:15,649 --> 00:39:19,159
savings that I think has not yet been

871
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:21,589
recognized I haven't heard anyone else

872
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:22,909
talk about that at all and then of

873
00:39:21,589 --> 00:39:25,279
course when you have really healthy

874
00:39:22,909 --> 00:39:27,409
soils the soils resilience the capacity

875
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:30,559
to store and hold water also increases

876
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:33,139
tremendously and the combination of

877
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:35,989
those two effects and the changes that

878
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:39,499
are happening within plant biochemistry

879
00:39:35,989 --> 00:39:43,579
also greatly increase the plants

880
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:45,379
resistance to high and low temperatures

881
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:46,969
so you can have environments that are a

882
00:39:45,379 --> 00:39:48,649
lot warmer without having the same

883
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:51,129
degree of stress impact and environment

884
00:39:48,649 --> 00:39:54,979
that are locked colder how much colder

885
00:39:51,129 --> 00:39:56,689
we've been able to lower the one data

886
00:39:54,979 --> 00:39:58,279
point that we have at this point that

887
00:39:56,689 --> 00:40:01,579
we've quantified is that we're able to

888
00:39:58,279 --> 00:40:03,019
reduce a plant's freezing temperature by

889
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:04,729
about six degrees Fahrenheit very

890
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:05,989
consistently so wherever a given variety

891
00:40:04,729 --> 00:40:08,539
or species might be we can drop that

892
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:10,939
about six degrees Fahrenheit with

893
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:13,309
nutrition on the temperature increased

894
00:40:10,939 --> 00:40:14,809
side we don't yet have enough experience

895
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:17,119
to know how much we know that we can

896
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:19,099
significantly now all those pieces that

897
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,409
I mentioned are all outcomes those are

898
00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:25,399
all results of a regenerative

899
00:40:21,409 --> 00:40:28,759
agriculture system the question to think

900
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:32,169
about or that you raised is what are the

901
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:35,889
implications of a changing climate in

902
00:40:32,169 --> 00:40:35,889
making recommendations

903
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:45,830
to a degree I mean the reality is that

904
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:47,780
we will be directly measuring soil

905
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:50,060
respiration for example soil microbial

906
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:51,560
activity will be directly measuring the

907
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,650
release of carbon dioxide from the soil

908
00:40:51,560 --> 00:41:01,340
profile will be directly measuring

909
00:40:53,650 --> 00:41:03,290
plants respiration and photosynthesis

910
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:05,690
cal almost micro indicators of what's

911
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:08,290
happening at the macro level with within

912
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:11,120
climate change

913
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:12,200
yeah those are my thoughts my short

914
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,480
answer I don't know if that answers your

915
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:15,830
question adequately yes Julie why do

916
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:21,740
plants only need it half as much water

917
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:24,590
there's two major pieces the first is

918
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:26,960
that when plants absorb nutrition in the

919
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:29,120
form of simple ions particularly nitrate

920
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,680
in a conversation I think I saw a Lydia

921
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,800
oliviers here and will be speaking again

922
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:35,870
this afternoon speaking yesterday he

923
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,450
pointed out how when plants absorb just

924
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:40,400
nitrate instead of amino acid nitrogen

925
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:43,220
that by itself can increase their water

926
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:49,780
requirement by 50 percent in addition to

927
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:56,660
that when do I have that correct Olivia

928
00:41:49,780 --> 00:42:01,720
yes water use efficiency so the second

929
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:07,550
aspect is the quantity of water required

930
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:09,980
for respiration so you have essentially

931
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:11,690
fundation Li to metabolic processes

932
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,280
going on with implants that consume

933
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:15,790
water one of them is photosynthesis the

934
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:21,110
second is respiration respiration occurs

935
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:24,380
amongst other reasons primarily largely

936
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:27,350
for cooling and when you have a healthy

937
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:29,270
plant that has a glossy waxy leaf

938
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:32,750
surface high lipid content high fat

939
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:34,520
content it conducts heat much better and

940
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,170
reflects heat much better the bottom

941
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:37,700
line is that it cools the plants much

942
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:40,310
more efficiently and there's much less

943
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,780
water required for plant cooling so when

944
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,980
you have high temperatures when you have

945
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:46,610
when you're growing plants and really

946
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:47,890
hot conditions for many of our food

947
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:49,750
crops that's the

948
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:52,089
see three photosynthetic pathway plants

949
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,829
that's above 86 degrees Fahrenheit when

950
00:42:52,089 --> 00:42:56,980
you go above 86 degrees Fahrenheit the

951
00:42:53,829 --> 00:42:59,410
quantity of water required to cool a

952
00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:01,839
healthy plant versus an unhealthy plant

953
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,309
is also significantly less I don't know

954
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:09,299
how much less but I know it's a big

955
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:09,299
number we got a question over here yes

956
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:34,569
yes yes it is possible and it is

957
00:43:32,829 --> 00:43:36,549
possible simply by changing the soils

958
00:43:34,569 --> 00:43:38,769
paramagnetism so when you have very high

959
00:43:36,549 --> 00:43:42,069
paramagnetism in the soil profile that

960
00:43:38,769 --> 00:43:46,260
fixes the problem we had a question yes

961
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:47,970
oh my goodness

962
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:51,440
the rabbit hole just gets deeper and

963
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:55,980
deeper so the question the question was

964
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:59,369
thinking about solar radiation and that

965
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:02,970
we are coming into a solar minimum both

966
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:04,619
a solar minimum on the short solar cycle

967
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:07,880
and a grand solar minimum at the same

968
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:10,320
time what are the implications for

969
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:12,869
having cooler summers and cooler growing

970
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:14,369
conditions yes so what are the

971
00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:15,930
implications for the next few years and

972
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:19,890
at what point do we shift back out of

973
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:21,330
that cycle so first of all this is not

974
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,530
my area of expertise I have been

975
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:25,470
learning a lot about this in the last

976
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:27,750
couple of years or trying to it's my

977
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:31,140
understanding that right now we are so

978
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:32,520
we have a what is it a 10 or 11 year

979
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:35,640
solar cycle think of Tinian 11-year

980
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,230
solar cycle peak to trough and we are

981
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,060
right now approaching the bottom of the

982
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:40,920
trough so the expectation is in the next

983
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:45,450
2 to 3 years we are likely to have

984
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:48,119
cooler summers and so how do we manage

985
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:50,190
that I think the implications for us is

986
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,630
that we should expect that we will

987
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:52,740
probably have harder winters we'll

988
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:54,060
probably have a harder winter this

989
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:57,270
winter for the next couple of years and

990
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:59,640
we should expect a tendency towards

991
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:02,880
having later frost in the spring and

992
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:05,880
earlier Frost in the fall by a week or

993
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,910
two I don't expect there to be any

994
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,930
significant outliers more than what

995
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:14,400
we've already been observing for the

996
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:16,650
last 2 10 years then the longer solar

997
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,420
cycle the the grant what is referred to

998
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:22,770
as the grand solar cycle we are also

999
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:24,270
approaching the bottom of the trough are

1000
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,500
starting to go on the downhill slope

1001
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,970
we've been on the uphill slope of the

1002
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,970
ground solar cycle for the last 20 to 30

1003
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:31,380
years and now we're we've crossed that

1004
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:32,940
threshold we're starting to go back down

1005
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:39,600
so I think there's a longer cycle of

1006
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:41,100
cooling as well the reality is that we

1007
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,930
have to look at what is it that we can

1008
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,550
manage that can make a difference and

1009
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:48,180
what we can manage that makes a

1010
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:49,770
difference is we can manage soil health

1011
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,450
and organic matter at capacity to hold

1012
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:53,030
water and we can measure plant health

1013
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:55,650
and resilience to temperature extremes

1014
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:56,970
when we do those two things by managing

1015
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:58,800
plant nutrition by managing soil health

1016
00:45:56,970 --> 00:45:59,269
we have created a lot of resilience and

1017
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,619
a lot of

1018
00:45:59,269 --> 00:46:01,729
or into the system that's what we can

1019
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:03,489
manage and that's what we need to do

1020
00:46:01,729 --> 00:46:12,170
particularly for the next few years that

1021
00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:16,250
answer your question move to Georgia

1022
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:16,250
[Laughter]

1023
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:26,479
look at what happened in North Dakota

1024
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:29,929
and Montana this year farmers had crops

1025
00:46:26,479 --> 00:46:30,949
buried in snow on a significant scale so

1026
00:46:29,929 --> 00:46:34,630
we'll probably see more of that

1027
00:46:30,949 --> 00:46:37,609
happening in northern climates yeah yes

1028
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:40,130
so the question was in the southern

1029
00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:41,719
climate on a farm in Virginia should I

1030
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:44,269
begin planting crops that might do

1031
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:47,989
better in a more northern climate or not

1032
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:49,759
more colder climate here's what you

1033
00:46:47,989 --> 00:46:52,279
should expect you should expect more

1034
00:46:49,759 --> 00:46:55,009
extreme climate variability there will

1035
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:56,599
be hotter longer there were longer more

1036
00:46:55,009 --> 00:46:57,949
intense periods of hot weather and

1037
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:02,359
longer more intense periods of cold

1038
00:46:57,949 --> 00:47:04,339
weather we will see more extremes so and

1039
00:47:02,359 --> 00:47:06,380
we will see both of those within the

1040
00:47:04,339 --> 00:47:10,279
same season sometimes within weeks of

1041
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:12,380
each other that's the climate that we as

1042
00:47:10,279 --> 00:47:14,149
the climate that exists now and that's

1043
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:18,909
why developing climate resilience

1044
00:47:14,149 --> 00:47:18,909
becomes so important yes

1045
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:30,890
a nose and the principal's nachos weapon

1046
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:30,890
Dacians you see that yes

1047
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:26,700
exactly that's what I'm talking about

1048
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:26,700
get all it could you guys hear that yeah

1049
00:48:36,309 --> 00:49:15,020
absolutely yes so I know there's a few

1050
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:16,970
more questions out there but we've been

1051
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:18,559
circling around this conversation around

1052
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:20,210
the importance of biology which is

1053
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:24,290
foundational fundamental I talked about

1054
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:29,450
it quite a bit last year for those of

1055
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:33,140
you that were present then I hosted one

1056
00:49:29,450 --> 00:49:36,170
of my most fascinating podcast

1057
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:38,930
interviews yet a few days ago it's being

1058
00:49:36,170 --> 00:49:41,000
post the beginning of December I was dr.

1059
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:45,829
James white from Rutgers University he's

1060
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:48,049
published a number of white papers but I

1061
00:49:45,829 --> 00:49:53,119
want to give you just just the synopsis

1062
00:49:48,049 --> 00:49:54,770
of his work so he has been he didn't

1063
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,920
originate the term but he's been popular

1064
00:49:54,770 --> 00:50:03,619
xoring that popularizing the term of

1065
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:08,980
rise of Ag rise of Ag simply means root

1066
00:50:03,619 --> 00:50:11,930
feeding or root eating and he has

1067
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:13,549
identified for those of you who've

1068
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:15,410
listened to me on the podcast on

1069
00:50:13,549 --> 00:50:17,119
webinars and in live presentations you

1070
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:19,069
know that I'm very passionate about the

1071
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:21,260
idea that plants can absorb microbial

1072
00:50:19,069 --> 00:50:23,990
metabolites that they are not dependent

1073
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:25,549
on absorbing simple ions from the soil

1074
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:27,770
solution and that if we were to change

1075
00:50:25,549 --> 00:50:29,390
plant nutrition but to the one when

1076
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:31,670
plants begin absorbing the majority of

1077
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:34,549
their nutrition as microbial metabolites

1078
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:36,380
plant health and the system's resilience

1079
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:39,430
everything begins changing everything

1080
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:41,839
changes very quickly well there's been

1081
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:43,760
actually a surprising amount of science

1082
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:45,500
around plant absorption of microbial

1083
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,760
metabolites over the course of the last

1084
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,790
60 to 70 year

1085
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:52,880
but it hasn't certainly hasn't caught

1086
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:56,450
mainstream attention and I'm really

1087
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:59,030
hopeful that James work does but the

1088
00:50:56,450 --> 00:51:04,130
foundational idea has been that you have

1089
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:08,660
a growing root tip and this growing root

1090
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:10,960
tip the cells here at the end are this

1091
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:15,740
tip is actually surprisingly porous and

1092
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:17,180
you have bacteria and algae and fungi

1093
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:20,420
and all these organisms in the soil

1094
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:23,300
profile that are actually absorbed into

1095
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:25,400
the root they penetrate into the root to

1096
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:27,770
go inside the root and they begin living

1097
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,880
completely inside the plant they have a

1098
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:30,830
symbiotic relationship here and there

1099
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,050
this is referred to when plants live

1100
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:34,190
excuse me when biology lives inside a

1101
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:35,000
plant that referred to as being

1102
00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:37,100
endophytes

1103
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,840
so you may have heard of endo fright

1104
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:42,380
free fresque you for example ran to

1105
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:44,690
fight free plants so particularly he's

1106
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:48,619
he's observed and documented fungi and

1107
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:51,550
bacteria and algae to move into plants

1108
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:54,619
then once they're inside the plant root

1109
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:59,780
they begin moving back through the root

1110
00:51:54,619 --> 00:52:02,890
system and in this pathway the root

1111
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:07,400
system are the root cells release

1112
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:09,740
superoxide and they oxidize all the cell

1113
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:11,930
membranes so the cell membranes are

1114
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:13,520
oxidized and now all of the organelles

1115
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:15,710
and and all of the nutrients contained

1116
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:17,960
inside the cell are available for the

1117
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:21,530
plant to absorb and plants actually

1118
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:23,570
absorb these macromolecules through a

1119
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:26,180
process known as endocytosis

1120
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:28,609
so endocytosis has been known in animals

1121
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:31,850
and in human cells for a long time and

1122
00:52:28,609 --> 00:52:34,280
it's been postulated in in plant cells

1123
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:36,350
since the 60s and 70s but the idea of

1124
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:41,000
endocytosis is essentially that you have

1125
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:43,700
a cell which and then when you have the

1126
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:46,340
exposure of a macro molecule on its side

1127
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:49,420
which theoretically should be impossible

1128
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:52,820
to absorb yeah I say theoretically

1129
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:56,270
discount that is not possible for a salt

1130
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:59,540
to absorb based on the presently

1131
00:52:56,270 --> 00:53:00,470
accepted science of cell physiology and

1132
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:04,430
cross membrane

1133
00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:08,000
transfer with pumps and so forth what

1134
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:11,150
actually happens is that the cell adapts

1135
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,710
its membrane into a balloon form this

1136
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:14,780
begins moving in this direction and

1137
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:18,710
ultimately it becomes ompletely

1138
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:21,590
completely encapsulated and this entire

1139
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:25,700
organelle or this entire can be a chunk

1140
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:27,109
of RNA or DNA or peptides or enzymes or

1141
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:32,240
whatever these macromolecules are

1142
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:33,980
absorbed into the plant cells so and on

1143
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,630
this pathway through the growing through

1144
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:36,830
the root system or through the root tip

1145
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:39,410
or right behind immediately behind the

1146
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:42,650
root tip this process of endocytosis is

1147
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:45,619
happening but not all the biology is

1148
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:49,099
killed in this process some of it

1149
00:53:45,619 --> 00:53:55,609
survives the process of having its cell

1150
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:57,500
membrane stripped and then when it's at

1151
00:53:55,609 --> 00:54:01,040
some point it moves out to the outer

1152
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:04,490
part of the root and it triggers the

1153
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:08,570
formation of root hair and they actually

1154
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:10,430
move out through root hair and they

1155
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:12,859
circulate for a while here at the tip

1156
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:16,040
and then they move out through the root

1157
00:54:12,859 --> 00:54:18,020
hair tip into the soil profile and then

1158
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:20,900
when they're in the soil profile the

1159
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:23,240
plant root actually feeds them it begins

1160
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:25,010
exiting in that particular location it

1161
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:28,400
begins exiting a lot of carbohydrates

1162
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:33,170
and other Connells it actually provides

1163
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:36,410
all the nutrients that the bacteria or

1164
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:37,369
fungi or algae need to reform their cell

1165
00:54:36,410 --> 00:54:38,930
membranes because these are now

1166
00:54:37,369 --> 00:54:39,950
essentially naked cells without a cell

1167
00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:42,320
membrane and it gives them everything

1168
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:46,609
they need to reform their cell membranes

1169
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:49,910
and essentially farms if it's plants

1170
00:54:46,609 --> 00:54:52,400
farm microbes the exact same way that we

1171
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:54,470
farm livestock they are feeding the

1172
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,359
microbes here and then this population

1173
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:58,339
obviously propagates through the soil

1174
00:54:56,359 --> 00:55:01,670
along the root system goes back down to

1175
00:54:58,339 --> 00:55:03,140
the root and now the plants or following

1176
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:05,960
root tips that are coming along behind

1177
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:09,970
this primary root tip access these

1178
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:11,780
nutrients from this biology rise of Ag

1179
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:15,109
yes

1180
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:16,849
there's it was a dynamite interview I'm

1181
00:55:15,109 --> 00:55:18,560
going to be posting a number of his peer

1182
00:55:16,849 --> 00:55:23,270
reviewed pipe papers which are really

1183
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:24,740
really good but in as if this and by the

1184
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:26,420
way this was an incredible interview

1185
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:28,220
these were the last 15 minutes the first

1186
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:31,010
45 minutes were probably even better

1187
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:36,320
than this or as good and he said one

1188
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:40,280
thing that really gave me a lot to think

1189
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:41,750
about so I've also said many times based

1190
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:43,869
on conversations that I've had with Don

1191
00:55:41,750 --> 00:55:47,420
Huber and other plant pathologists that

1192
00:55:43,869 --> 00:55:48,950
it is possible when we change so when we

1193
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,990
have a soil that has really active

1194
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:53,119
microbial populations and they're the

1195
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:54,680
correct characteristics the right

1196
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,960
biology of present we can develop what

1197
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:58,940
is called a disease suppressive soil and

1198
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,560
it's been my understanding in the past

1199
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:03,859
that when we have a disease suppressive

1200
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:06,520
soil it will take it will change the

1201
00:56:03,859 --> 00:56:09,290
expression of all of these potential

1202
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:12,109
pathogens such as verticillium and for

1203
00:56:09,290 --> 00:56:14,480
Syria and so forth to be sacrificed

1204
00:56:12,109 --> 00:56:15,740
decomposers of nonliving plant residue

1205
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,300
so they are still present but they're

1206
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:21,920
having a beneficial impact as a

1207
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:23,740
saprophyte but James said that's not

1208
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:27,740
incorrect but it's incomplete

1209
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:29,990
when you have let's say you have a

1210
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:34,430
strand of the cerium out here this is

1211
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:35,990
obviously I'm a great artist when you

1212
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:37,609
have path potential when you have

1213
00:56:35,990 --> 00:56:41,440
organisms that are potential pathogens

1214
00:56:37,609 --> 00:56:43,609
in the soil profile these endophytes

1215
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:47,089
that have this close symbiotic

1216
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:50,240
relationship with the plant will

1217
00:56:47,089 --> 00:56:52,010
actually colonize the Fuss area or the

1218
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:55,390
verticillium or any potential pathogen

1219
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:58,280
and when they colonize it they weaken it

1220
00:56:55,390 --> 00:57:00,339
they extract some of the sugars out of

1221
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:03,290
it some of the food sources that it has

1222
00:57:00,339 --> 00:57:06,109
but they're an important pieces that

1223
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:09,349
they change its behavior and it's no

1224
00:57:06,109 --> 00:57:12,560
longer a pathogen it actually changes

1225
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:14,480
and it now develops into an end of fight

1226
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:16,820
and it develops a symbiotic relationship

1227
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:21,520
with the plant instead of being a

1228
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:21,520
pathogen isn't that amazing

1229
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:27,520
[Applause]

1230
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:29,140
so we had we had a quite a fascinating

1231
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,450
conversation there is one other piece

1232
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:33,069
that I think is necessary pointing out

1233
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:35,589
so the end of fights that he described

1234
00:57:33,069 --> 00:57:37,359
all of these organisms that had this

1235
00:57:35,589 --> 00:57:38,790
endo FIDIC relationship with the plant a

1236
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:40,720
symbiotic relationship with the plant

1237
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:44,200
come from two places there is

1238
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,550
significant overlap between the

1239
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,410
microbial population that should be

1240
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:49,390
present in a healthy soil and the

1241
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:54,280
microbial population on the seed coat

1242
00:57:49,390 --> 00:57:57,849
and I asked the question about what

1243
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:59,770
happens when we treat seeds with

1244
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:01,780
fungicides what happens when we treat

1245
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:05,470
vegetable seeds with hot hot water to

1246
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:07,869
remove bacteria and he said that we

1247
00:58:05,470 --> 00:58:09,599
definitely do damage the microbial

1248
00:58:07,869 --> 00:58:12,520
population on the seed which has a

1249
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:15,520
really predisposes that plant to

1250
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:20,440
pathogenic invasion in the early stages

1251
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:23,710
of life but and then I specifically

1252
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:27,640
asked the question about corn and he

1253
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:29,859
pointed out that many of our modern corn

1254
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:31,810
varieties and I asked about corn but

1255
00:58:29,859 --> 00:58:33,910
realizing now that this is true not just

1256
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:34,810
of corn but actually for a number of

1257
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,790
different plants he said that when

1258
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:38,589
plants are propagated at some point

1259
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:42,670
during the breeding processes when they

1260
00:58:38,589 --> 00:58:44,230
are propagated by cell culture they lose

1261
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:47,500
all of their endophytes

1262
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:49,599
on the seed itself so now when you begin

1263
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:52,569
so what is what he's observed is that

1264
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:56,020
many of our modern corn varieties no

1265
00:58:52,569 --> 00:58:59,140
longer carry their protective organisms

1266
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:02,200
on the seed they are now very disease

1267
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:03,730
susceptible so this is something that's

1268
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:05,470
true for corn but I would say the

1269
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:07,930
logical to extrapolate that that is

1270
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:10,510
likely to be true for any seed or any

1271
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:16,060
plant which has been propagated by cell

1272
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:19,390
culture yes so the question was do I

1273
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:22,630
know if the end of fights are entering

1274
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:26,010
the meristematic area when the cells are

1275
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:26,010
different still differentiating I

1276
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:29,349
remember James talking about that in

1277
00:59:28,089 --> 00:59:32,660
some of his papers but I don't remember

1278
00:59:29,349 --> 00:59:36,650
what he said well what we do know

1279
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:39,020
from dr. May Wong hos work she described

1280
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:40,609
how we have significant transfer of

1281
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:42,770
genetic material between the soil

1282
00:59:40,609 --> 00:59:44,480
biology and plants and I suspect this is

1283
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:46,819
one pathway that we haven't been aware

1284
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,730
of in the past for significant transfer

1285
00:59:46,819 --> 00:59:51,109
of genetic material I mean we know that

1286
00:59:48,730 --> 00:59:53,240
it's been well documented when we have a

1287
00:59:51,109 --> 00:59:54,829
genetically modified plant we end up

1288
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,599
with genetically modified DNA in the

1289
00:59:54,829 --> 01:00:00,349
soil microbial profile in a matter of a

1290
00:59:56,599 --> 01:00:04,400
few days or weeks yeah so that that

1291
01:00:00,349 --> 01:00:06,710
actually that actually would it would be

1292
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:09,619
when we look at all of the various

1293
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:11,390
mechanisms and means for plant signaling

1294
01:00:09,619 --> 01:00:13,760
for plants signaling the slow microbial

1295
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:15,470
population what nutritional requirements

1296
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,140
that it has what nutrients that it wants

1297
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:19,579
the soil microbes to release this is

1298
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:21,319
probably another signaling mechanism

1299
01:00:19,579 --> 01:00:23,119
other signaling pathway in addition to

1300
01:00:21,319 --> 01:00:26,839
all the biochemical signals that we have

1301
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:29,680
identified and defined so far yeah I get

1302
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:29,680
pretty excited about this

1303
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:37,090
nice there's a bit of a puzzle which

1304
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:37,090
this helps to explain

1305
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:46,570
can you speak up just a little bit

1306
01:00:51,820 --> 01:01:06,220
important seeds with facility versus

1307
01:00:54,410 --> 01:01:06,220
uncoated seeds germinated faster Wow

1308
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:25,730
yeah you know what James work and not

1309
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:29,090
just James work but other researchers

1310
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:31,700
also similar to what you described what

1311
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:36,170
they tell me about soil biology there

1312
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:40,300
are no bad guys we created the bad guys

1313
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:40,300
by our mismanagement of the ecosystem

1314
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:46,070
that's it or by the system ecosystem

1315
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:47,960
being mismanaged in some manner yes so

1316
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:49,220
I'm I'm trying to I want to make sure I

1317
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,410
understand your question correctly are

1318
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:52,970
you asking how do we transfer this

1319
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:55,280
information how can you transfer this

1320
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:56,540
information to other growers or how can

1321
01:01:55,280 --> 01:02:01,130
you transfer this information to

1322
01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:02,869
consumers yes an important question and

1323
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:06,170
one that I don't have an easy answer for

1324
01:02:02,869 --> 01:02:07,580
so to the point that consumers can

1325
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:09,619
become drawers and I believe they should

1326
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:12,170
I believe everybody should have a closer

1327
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:13,480
connection with their food I believe we

1328
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:20,270
need to bring back the Victory Gardens

1329
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:21,710
actually we would have victory over a

1330
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:24,410
lot of diseases and degenerative

1331
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:26,810
illnesses and mental challenges and more

1332
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:29,470
wouldn't we if that were to happen I'm

1333
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:32,390
reminded of a quote that Arden Anderson

1334
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:33,800
repeated over and over again he said

1335
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:41,690
when the student is ready the teacher

1336
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:45,670
will appear and I my personal experience

1337
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:48,200
has been that I have found it to be

1338
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:50,000
generally unproductive to try to

1339
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:54,200
persuade someone who has no desire to

1340
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:56,089
learn and the good news is that today

1341
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:58,960
there are so many people who do desire

1342
01:02:56,089 --> 01:03:01,130
to learn that there is a tremendous

1343
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,920
desire for knowledge and information

1344
01:03:01,130 --> 01:03:05,270
which is why I've tried to share as much

1345
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:10,340
online as I have

1346
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:14,360
and I really believe that it is very

1347
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:16,040
valuable for any of us - for all of us

1348
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,930
to become teachers because when we

1349
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:21,740
become teachers is when we really begin

1350
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:23,030
to learn the most rapidly so those are

1351
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:24,020
my comments and response to your

1352
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:33,320
question didn't really answer your

1353
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:35,650
question yes can you speak up just a

1354
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,650
little bit

1355
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:48,650
[Music]

1356
01:03:44,930 --> 01:03:50,920
where I went to school involved through

1357
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:50,920
that

1358
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:17,750
problems I was using or the exacerbation

1359
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:17,750
of the issues hi

1360
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,910
this goes back a while and in my file

1361
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:23,910
recently

1362
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:34,170
but I'm also a student

1363
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:40,799
society takes the information that they

1364
01:04:38,349 --> 01:04:40,799
exchange

1365
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,240
No

1366
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:02,390
I

1367
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:14,390
yes yes

1368
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:22,900
we have the trickle-down

1369
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:54,809
[Music]

1370
01:05:56,060 --> 01:06:01,159
[Applause]

1371
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:08,010
[Laughter]

1372
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:37,950
society the biggest challenge I think is

1373
01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:41,160
not only people having an emotional

1374
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:45,150
relationship to the earth but developing

1375
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:49,440
a real heart as well as my relationship

1376
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:53,910
to each other yeah I to speak to that a

1377
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:56,640
bit well there's a few comments that

1378
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:58,020
come to mind but actually I see I come

1379
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:04,280
from a very different background growing

1380
01:06:58,020 --> 01:07:06,510
up in an Amish community and working

1381
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:08,760
primarily outside the Amish community

1382
01:07:06,510 --> 01:07:10,170
I've come to appreciate many of the

1383
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:13,700
values that that community holds

1384
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:16,109
particularly the value the the strong

1385
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:17,690
family and community and social

1386
01:07:16,109 --> 01:07:21,030
structure and I think one of the

1387
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:23,340
significant strengths is that young

1388
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:26,359
children growing up have a sense of

1389
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:29,310
place of who they are in a social fabric

1390
01:07:26,359 --> 01:07:31,830
but I also want to speak to your comment

1391
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:34,070
about the best available technology yes

1392
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:34,070
go ahead

1393
01:07:35,930 --> 01:07:41,269
education which is experience

1394
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:43,999
the way it trickles down to Farmington

1395
01:07:41,269 --> 01:07:47,150
learned from experience you learn from

1396
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:50,230
doing and the brain is hardwired you

1397
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:55,330
learn something too by experiencing it

1398
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:59,460
cannot forget it and you also have

1399
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:59,460
to somebody else it's a safe

1400
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:03,690
so American see internet world

1401
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:10,010
expression within everyone here is going

1402
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:10,010
to be a teacher yes

1403
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:23,049
yes good comment thank you at speaking

1404
01:08:19,490 --> 01:08:25,960
to regenerative agriculture and in this

1405
01:08:23,049 --> 01:08:28,790
this different cognition about

1406
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:30,859
agriculture ecosystems becoming the best

1407
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:33,200
available technology there has been a

1408
01:08:30,859 --> 01:08:35,420
significant shift in our work at AEA

1409
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:39,589
with the new people who contact us for

1410
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:42,650
the first time up until four or five

1411
01:08:39,589 --> 01:08:44,620
years ago generally and I'm speaking

1412
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:47,330
specifically now about large scale

1413
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:48,980
mainstream growers who have hundreds or

1414
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:51,319
often thousands of acres of fruit and

1415
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:54,290
vegetable crops often the conversation

1416
01:08:51,319 --> 01:08:55,700
would be something like historically the

1417
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:58,609
conversation would be something along

1418
01:08:55,700 --> 01:09:00,650
the lines of I've heard about the work

1419
01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:02,299
you're doing it seems really interesting

1420
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:03,680
and I'd like to try it on a few of my

1421
01:09:02,299 --> 01:09:04,880
acres I'd like to try it out and just

1422
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:09,259
see what's happening on what's going on

1423
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:11,990
today we have people calling us and they

1424
01:09:09,259 --> 01:09:13,430
say I've listened to all of your

1425
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:15,049
podcasts I've listened to all of your

1426
01:09:13,430 --> 01:09:18,380
webinars and I want to do it on 800

1427
01:09:15,049 --> 01:09:23,060
acres that has happened a number of

1428
01:09:18,380 --> 01:09:26,199
times right yes

1429
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:26,199
[Music]

1430
01:09:29,839 --> 01:09:35,600
unfortunately there wasn't a pinch

1431
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:38,770
that's junk

1432
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:38,770
[Music]

1433
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:45,440
[Music]

1434
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:49,120
Barry and Karina

1435
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:49,120
I mean he's not a whole lot today

1436
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:56,430
in fact Korean actress Margaret was like

1437
01:09:52,839 --> 01:09:56,430
about formulas

1438
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:03,030
mafia

1439
01:09:59,909 --> 01:10:05,100
but what's interesting is early on the

1440
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:07,699
recommendation was like I needed

1441
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:07,699
channels

1442
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:13,199
plants were sufficient channels so

1443
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:15,880
actually this is actually a

1444
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:19,370
contradiction for

1445
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:22,699
psycho theory would be more putting on

1446
01:10:19,370 --> 01:10:26,480
nitrogen and actually later in the

1447
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:30,139
process testing later I was recommending

1448
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:31,550
nitrogen and whereas the new treatment

1449
01:10:30,139 --> 01:10:33,050
cycle theory would have been saying well

1450
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:33,740
no at that point you should be putting

1451
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:35,820
on

1452
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:38,420
I'm wondering if you know about the

1453
01:10:35,820 --> 01:10:38,420
second theory

1454
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:50,199
as you can tell I love learning and I

1455
01:10:47,559 --> 01:10:52,300
read a lot

1456
01:10:50,199 --> 01:10:53,920
I'm not intimately familiar with corian

1457
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:57,760
natural farming I have heard a bit about

1458
01:10:53,920 --> 01:11:05,499
it the question that I would love to ask

1459
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:27,479
you is did you try both of them great so

1460
01:11:05,499 --> 01:11:27,479
we learned something oh my goodness yep

1461
01:11:38,050 --> 01:11:44,610
in one instance what I did I was still

1462
01:11:41,620 --> 01:11:44,610
using her County

1463
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:50,610
a shell

1464
01:11:54,060 --> 01:12:06,150
awesome we learn something again no I

1465
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:08,440
think I can just say simply that our

1466
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:10,660
products and our approach to plant

1467
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:12,010
nutrition continue to evolve every year

1468
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:13,680
and they're completely different now

1469
01:12:12,010 --> 01:12:17,170
from what they were ten years ago

1470
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:18,970
because we continue to learn things just

1471
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:23,260
as the example that you that you

1472
01:12:18,970 --> 01:12:26,470
described and from my perspective there

1473
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:29,580
is just the ultimate report card

1474
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:32,500
the ultimate report card is plant health

1475
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:34,480
when you have a healthy plant that is

1476
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:36,010
nutritious has higher nutritional levels

1477
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:39,130
that is resistant to diseases and

1478
01:12:36,010 --> 01:12:40,690
insects then something is working and if

1479
01:12:39,130 --> 01:12:45,670
you don't whatever you're doing is not

1480
01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:47,790
working and I am open to any and all

1481
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:51,130
pathways that get us to that point

1482
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:53,050
that's to me that's the bottom line

1483
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:55,390
nutritional products microbial products

1484
01:12:53,050 --> 01:12:57,760
compost teas etc those are all a tool to

1485
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:59,560
get to that pathway yes we do we think

1486
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:01,510
very much about plant reproductive

1487
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:06,720
cycles vegetative cycles etc it's

1488
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:06,720
everything is based on that really yes

1489
01:13:12,450 --> 01:13:15,700
[Music]

1490
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:30,130
we will never be successful at least

1491
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:47,990
like I mean that can't be done by people

1492
01:13:45,620 --> 01:14:13,070
on it

1493
01:13:47,990 --> 01:14:14,750
it cannot actually I think that's I

1494
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:24,890
think that's an important question to

1495
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:31,190
ask so we can read the first reference

1496
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:32,630
to foods implications for spiritual

1497
01:14:31,190 --> 01:14:36,050
knowledge coming from Rudolf Steiner

1498
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:38,600
Rudolf Steiner in the period when he was

1499
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:46,160
teaching described how food produced at

1500
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:48,110
that time did not have enough I'm

1501
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:50,150
looking for the right word didn't have

1502
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:52,550
enough spiritual grounding didn't have

1503
01:14:50,150 --> 01:14:54,890
enough spiritual sustenance to allow

1504
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:57,380
people to develop their spiritual

1505
01:14:54,890 --> 01:14:58,850
connection with plants and I I dislike

1506
01:14:57,380 --> 01:15:00,740
the word spiritual because it today

1507
01:14:58,850 --> 01:15:02,630
carries too many other connotations but

1508
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:06,860
to develop that heart cognition with

1509
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:11,960
plants so he pointed that out decades

1510
01:15:06,860 --> 01:15:16,880
ago and speaking from personal

1511
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:19,850
experience yes I am very stringent about

1512
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:22,730
the quality of the food that I eat and I

1513
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:24,290
actually noticed my mental acuity and

1514
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:27,380
mental clarity is the first thing that

1515
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:29,840
goes when my diet starts dropping off

1516
01:15:27,380 --> 01:15:31,460
and where I have the most significant

1517
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:34,250
challenges when I travel to work with

1518
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:42,800
farmers in the Midwest the Midwest is a

1519
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:45,110
good food desert and so to first of all

1520
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:47,090
when I am at home and when I have good

1521
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:48,950
control over over the food that I eat I

1522
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:51,110
definitely try to make good sure that I

1523
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:54,920
have a very good diet high levels of

1524
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:57,560
healthy fats and in spite of all that

1525
01:15:54,920 --> 01:16:00,290
I'm not able to grow all of my own food

1526
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:01,200
although I do and my family and I do a

1527
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:06,000
significant amount

1528
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:07,710
and I supplement intensely I supplement

1529
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,270
all the time because I don't have

1530
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:11,880
confidence in the food supply to be able

1531
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:14,460
to give my body everything that it

1532
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:16,530
requires for optimal performance similar

1533
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:18,840
to a plant I don't care about average

1534
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:20,340
performance I've experienced average

1535
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:23,030
performance in my life and I don't want

1536
01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:23,030
to be back there again

1537
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:29,459
[Music]

1538
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:39,120
[Music]

1539
01:16:56,039 --> 01:17:15,670
they're small but all together yes so

1540
01:17:12,940 --> 01:17:17,349
the brief answer just kind of has a

1541
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:20,800
general broad umbrella is that it is

1542
01:17:17,349 --> 01:17:22,150
possible to either sequester or I'll

1543
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,550
just use the word detoxify it is

1544
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:26,979
possible to detoxify every toxic element

1545
01:17:24,550 --> 01:17:28,449
that we know of from an elemental

1546
01:17:26,979 --> 01:17:30,190
perspective speaking about cadmium and

1547
01:17:28,449 --> 01:17:31,960
arsenic and lead at etc etc it's

1548
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:33,820
possible to remove all of those from the

1549
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:34,989
soil profile or sequester them in a form

1550
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:38,979
that they are not absorbed by the plants

1551
01:17:34,989 --> 01:17:41,679
that we're growing there's a lot of

1552
01:17:38,979 --> 01:17:42,789
research in the literature about how

1553
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:47,050
this can happen with humic substances

1554
01:17:42,789 --> 01:17:49,329
and also how specific plants and this

1555
01:17:47,050 --> 01:17:51,820
this is where when you start when you

1556
01:17:49,329 --> 01:17:55,659
are you have a specific situation with

1557
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:57,610
specific known toxins then you can begin

1558
01:17:55,659 --> 01:18:00,729
identifying plants that are known to

1559
01:17:57,610 --> 01:18:04,360
sequester those toxins and either remove

1560
01:18:00,729 --> 01:18:06,699
them from the soil or transmute them to

1561
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:08,320
a form that they no longer show up

1562
01:18:06,699 --> 01:18:09,309
and by the way hemp is one of the plants

1563
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,929
that does a lot of different things

1564
01:18:09,309 --> 01:18:13,449
extraordinarily well when it comes to

1565
01:18:10,929 --> 01:18:15,519
removing toxins from the soil profile it

1566
01:18:13,449 --> 01:18:18,400
actually absorbs them into the plant in

1567
01:18:15,519 --> 01:18:21,760
many cases so it's really interesting

1568
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:25,690
cannabis producers are discovering

1569
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:28,360
significant challenges because when the

1570
01:18:25,690 --> 01:18:30,729
the cannabis plant and hemp in general

1571
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:33,010
is so extraordinarily good at picking up

1572
01:18:30,729 --> 01:18:35,170
toxins that when you have cadmium or

1573
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:36,309
arsenic in the soil profile and part per

1574
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:37,840
billion or part per trillion

1575
01:18:36,309 --> 01:18:39,090
concentrations they will pick it up and

1576
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:44,590
accumulate it in a high concentration

1577
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:50,199
within the plant itself you composted

1578
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:51,820
and put it somewhere else or actually

1579
01:18:50,199 --> 01:18:54,010
maybe you create biochar out of it I

1580
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:55,630
mean I don't know the answers to those

1581
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:57,610
questions but at least we're able to

1582
01:18:55,630 --> 01:19:00,070
remove it from a broad area and perhaps

1583
01:18:57,610 --> 01:19:02,460
concentrate it more so the answers are

1584
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:02,460
out there

1585
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:17,440
we'll be able to validate all this yeah

1586
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:19,270
and the other the other aspect of course

1587
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:24,040
in addition to the elemental toxins are

1588
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:25,330
the hydrocarbons and again more there's

1589
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:27,400
actually quite a bit of research and

1590
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:28,450
both laboratory and field validation

1591
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,190
that were in the process of right now

1592
01:19:28,450 --> 01:19:32,920
but I think a year ago I spoke about a

1593
01:19:30,190 --> 01:19:34,390
new product that we're developing we

1594
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:35,710
released it in Pennsylvania use it in

1595
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:37,630
Pennsylvania this last growing season

1596
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:39,220
it's if all goes well with a regulatory

1597
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:40,780
process it'll be released for use by

1598
01:19:39,220 --> 01:19:45,550
next spring across the entire country

1599
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:48,580
and laboratory evidence suggests that we

1600
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:50,620
can eliminate all toxins all herbicides

1601
01:19:48,580 --> 01:19:53,020
all hydrocarbons from the soil profile

1602
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:54,400
in when the biology is sustained and has

1603
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:55,600
enough carbohydrates enough of a food

1604
01:19:54,400 --> 01:20:00,510
source it can happen in a matter of

1605
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:00,510
weeks and that is pretty exhilarating

1606
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:06,690
does not include plastics as in the

1607
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:10,840
still solid plastic form unfortunately

1608
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:15,910
you know one of my mentors Bruce tiny Oh

1609
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:17,710
actually develops a microbe in the lab

1610
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:20,590
or shouldn't say devotee found it in the

1611
01:20:17,710 --> 01:20:24,760
wild and cultured it in the lab that

1612
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:26,410
consumed PVC and he had a flask in his

1613
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:30,900
lab that was consuming four pounds of

1614
01:20:26,410 --> 01:20:33,250
PVC per 24 hour period and he eventually

1615
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:35,560
dumped it and tossed it back into the

1616
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:38,170
environment because he couldn't find an

1617
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:40,690
off switch he couldn't find a way to get

1618
01:20:38,170 --> 01:20:42,970
them to slow down and can you imagine

1619
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:44,230
well first there's there's a part of me

1620
01:20:42,970 --> 01:20:46,360
that would love to release something

1621
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:47,950
like that into the oceans and then I

1622
01:20:46,360 --> 01:20:49,570
also imagine what would be possible if

1623
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:59,340
somebody dumped some of that down their

1624
01:20:49,570 --> 01:21:03,700
drain in a city yeah so yeah but I think

1625
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:06,220
knowing that history knowing that Bruce

1626
01:21:03,700 --> 01:21:08,470
was once able to isolate an organism

1627
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:10,360
that was successful in doing that gives

1628
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:11,770
me hope and confidence that that will

1629
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:13,120
happen again in the future somebody will

1630
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:15,100
able to be able to replicate that in the

1631
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:17,630
future when the crisis becomes big

1632
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:20,640
enough we will figure out the

1633
01:21:17,630 --> 01:21:22,910
we are I mean there is now very good

1634
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:29,420
evidence that for instance mangrove

1635
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:29,420
Ecology's utilizing the carbon polyester

1636
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:37,860
inserted that polyethylene

1637
01:21:38,329 --> 01:21:45,820
resistant to any microbial organization

1638
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:45,820
500 years

1639
01:21:50,590 --> 01:21:55,510
but there is an accelerating

1640
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:59,730
as partners for better or worse in

1641
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,730
Jersey

1642
01:22:03,190 --> 01:22:07,810
Plastics very much

1643
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:22,579
absolutely yeah and I know there's also

1644
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:25,489
been research about wax moths being able

1645
01:22:22,579 --> 01:22:27,169
to consume plastic films very rapidly so

1646
01:22:25,489 --> 01:22:28,550
I think that is encouraging again and

1647
01:22:27,169 --> 01:22:29,929
that is because of the microbes that are

1648
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:31,070
contained within their digestive system

1649
01:22:29,929 --> 01:22:37,400
actually being capable of breaking down

1650
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:40,010
many different plastics so I'm I'm I'm

1651
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:41,389
very concerned about the particular

1652
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:43,820
micro plastics that we have in the

1653
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:47,090
environment today I think there is cause

1654
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:48,499
for grave concern there but I'm not

1655
01:22:47,090 --> 01:22:50,539
without hope that we'll find a solution

1656
01:22:48,499 --> 01:22:58,300
for it so we've got time for one more

1657
01:22:50,539 --> 01:22:58,300
question yes you got it

1658
01:23:04,099 --> 01:23:10,719
registration but I go to events I went

1659
01:23:07,609 --> 01:23:10,719
to the national basis

1660
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:17,370
I always ask the audience who's here

1661
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:19,770
depends on agriculture

1662
01:23:17,370 --> 01:23:20,989
who's here on the road I hear the world

1663
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:25,570
record

1664
01:23:20,989 --> 01:23:25,570
so hearing us talk today about education

1665
01:23:25,720 --> 01:24:03,280
I have none is anyone here from a land

1666
01:23:57,370 --> 01:24:05,590
trust no one can consult with okay I'll

1667
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:07,030
take in because of that question I'll

1668
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:09,240
take time for one more yes we'll go to

1669
01:24:07,030 --> 01:24:09,240
you

1670
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:48,430
what's your opinion so to the point that

1671
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:51,160
we made about corn breeding through cell

1672
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:53,170
culture not having the end of fights

1673
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:54,430
it's obvious that modern many modern

1674
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:57,970
breeding techniques or some modern

1675
01:24:54,430 --> 01:25:00,880
breeding techniques have stripped the

1676
01:24:57,970 --> 01:25:07,870
seeds of their associated disease

1677
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:14,610
resistance organisms and endophytes but

1678
01:25:07,870 --> 01:25:19,630
the reality is that as I see it the

1679
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:22,060
large agro chemical corporations that

1680
01:25:19,630 --> 01:25:24,670
are perceived of being in control the

1681
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:27,700
food supply actually has extremely shaky

1682
01:25:24,670 --> 01:25:29,830
foundations I don't expect them to

1683
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:31,720
survive on their present business model

1684
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:33,520
into the future for the long term

1685
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:35,830
because of the point that was made

1686
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:37,300
earlier is that they are no longer the

1687
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:42,400
best technology best available

1688
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:43,600
technology and they are particular

1689
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:46,630
they're no longer the best available

1690
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:48,790
technology for the large-scale broadacre

1691
01:25:46,630 --> 01:25:51,730
growers in one specific way that is

1692
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:54,220
extremely important and that is farm

1693
01:25:51,730 --> 01:25:57,310
profitability we know that farm

1694
01:25:54,220 --> 01:26:00,220
profitability has been on the decline in

1695
01:25:57,310 --> 01:26:02,830
fact broadacre cropping in the midwest

1696
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:04,800
have consumed equity on their operations

1697
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:07,420
for four years out of the last five

1698
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:10,120
except for those farmers who are

1699
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:12,070
planting non-gmo seeds those farmers who

1700
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:13,840
are growing cover crops those farmers

1701
01:26:12,070 --> 01:26:16,300
who are adopting these various practices

1702
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:19,150
and going down this pathway there those

1703
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:20,590
growers have higher profitability they

1704
01:26:19,150 --> 01:26:22,180
don't particularly necessarily have

1705
01:26:20,590 --> 01:26:24,870
higher yields but they consistently have

1706
01:26:22,180 --> 01:26:26,980
higher profitability at the very least

1707
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:29,440
those farmers are going to be the

1708
01:26:26,980 --> 01:26:30,099
farmers that survive financially and

1709
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:33,900
economically

1710
01:26:30,099 --> 01:26:36,790
so the existing status quo is not

1711
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:39,130
doesn't seem probable to me to remain as

1712
01:26:36,790 --> 01:26:41,230
the status quo for another let's say 10

1713
01:26:39,130 --> 01:26:42,790
to 15 year time period not much past

1714
01:26:41,230 --> 01:26:46,090
that point because it can't sustain

1715
01:26:42,790 --> 01:26:48,070
itself and it also depends on has

1716
01:26:46,090 --> 01:26:50,860
dependent historically on an abundance

1717
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:53,079
of rich topsoil which it has eroded and

1718
01:26:50,860 --> 01:26:56,260
degraded and caused to disappear when

1719
01:26:53,079 --> 01:26:57,489
that disappears my own personal story in

1720
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:59,800
the story the gentleman here shared

1721
01:26:57,489 --> 01:27:02,320
earlier is that and it's a story of many

1722
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:04,360
farmers is that many farmers that make

1723
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:06,250
the switch is that they use conventional

1724
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:09,579
mainstream practices until they didn't

1725
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:12,310
work anymore why do we get calls today

1726
01:27:09,579 --> 01:27:13,780
not just from fruit and vegetable

1727
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:15,099
growers or broadacre growers you say I

1728
01:27:13,780 --> 01:27:17,889
have listened to all the information

1729
01:27:15,099 --> 01:27:21,130
I've tried to learn as much as I can I

1730
01:27:17,889 --> 01:27:22,840
want to do my entire operation that is

1731
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:24,429
happening because they recognize that

1732
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:25,810
what they're doing right now and have

1733
01:27:24,429 --> 01:27:27,940
been doing historically is no longer

1734
01:27:25,810 --> 01:27:30,489
working that is reaching critical

1735
01:27:27,940 --> 01:27:33,040
threshold so I'm actually very

1736
01:27:30,489 --> 01:27:34,449
optimistic that I've set the goal for

1737
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:36,429
myself if I want regenerative

1738
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:39,400
agriculture to be the global mainstream

1739
01:27:36,429 --> 01:27:40,900
but 2040 to me that's a very realistic

1740
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:43,670
and a very achievable goal and we're

1741
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:55,170
well on the pathway to achieving that

1742
01:27:43,670 --> 01:27:55,170
[Applause]
