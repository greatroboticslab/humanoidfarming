00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:05,490
[Music]

00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:18,449
[Applause]

3
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:32,940
hey guys John with off-grid homesteading

4
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:37,550
welcome to a new installment of fixing

5
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:41,719
our water pump at the lower cistern

6
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:45,190
hopefully this will be the final fix

7
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:50,149
I've been using a shurflo diaphragm pump

8
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:51,710
for the first year and a half the

9
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:54,440
diaphragm pumps work great they can

10
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:57,620
actually pump up to about you know

11
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:01,159
siphoning about seven feet of pressure

12
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:04,670
and then pump it up the lines that are

13
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:07,159
going up to our upper cistern challenges

14
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,229
when it gets cold that box gets real

15
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:14,000
cold the parts and starts start freezing

16
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:17,270
and the components in there start

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,509
failing that failed last a little bit

18
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:23,840
after last winter and the components are

19
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:28,899
failing again so it's now time to take

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:33,740
this aquamarine made 24 volt DC pump

21
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:37,190
four amps max 100 foot maximum

22
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:39,470
submersible 100 foot and it'll do 1.6

23
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,460
gallons per minute but this is the one

24
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,720
of those pumps you'll find on Amazon

25
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,530
I'll put a link to this

26
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:47,179
I think it was about $90 I ended up

27
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:48,530
getting one the top was cracked the

28
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:52,250
company was real good they ended up

29
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:54,110
sending me another one took forever to

30
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,959
get it and then when I finally call this

31
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:59,319
air where the heck's my cap they just

32
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:02,119
went ahead and shipped me another unit

33
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:03,800
and then a few days later the caps came

34
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:07,879
in so I have two units now for the price

35
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:11,709
of one that's being frugal

36
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:11,709
not cheap so

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,340
with this pump I'm going to be

38
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:19,110
installing it inside the cistern I got

39
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:23,970
to drill some holes in the side of the

40
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:26,010
plastic here for the pumping lines going

41
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,660
up into the system but I got to make

42
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:32,220
sure that the pecs goes all the way to

43
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:36,360
and inside the top cap here otherwise it

44
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:37,560
will freeze and it will expand and it'll

45
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,160
correct all the metal parts in between

46
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,300
seem to crack so I have to eliminate all

47
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,230
of the metal pieces unfortunately

48
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,490
there's one metal piece down there so we

49
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,390
got a little weak link of the system

50
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:51,570
what I should have done is how to

51
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,910
actually run this continual pipe

52
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:58,200
directly into this tank the first time

53
00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:00,030
so let's go and get started Emma and

54
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,610
apologies for looking like a gimpy old

55
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:05,180
man I hurt my back last week and it's

56
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,190
been taken its toll this is I think the

57
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,170
heard on Monday today is Thursday so I

58
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:14,540
can finally at least walk around a

59
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:14,540
little bit but I still feel pretty stiff

60
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:28,510
[Applause]

61
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:28,510
I'm going to show you the flow inside

62
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:42,510
I've never shown this before that's

63
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,510
coming directly from our develop spring

64
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:52,410
I'm gonna have a text pipe going from

65
00:03:46,840 --> 00:04:03,040
here to the outside coming down to this

66
00:03:52,410 --> 00:04:05,650
pumping situation here I'm just taking a

67
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,340
regular garden hose which is the one

68
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:13,090
that seems to fit great here and I'm

69
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:16,709
going to think I'm going to go ahead and

70
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,709
give me some extra slack here

71
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,630
okay

72
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,850
that's a fairly tight here

73
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,780
I'm going to go ahead and put a float

74
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,240
valve in here just in case I can get it

75
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,140
to work so that if I'm gone and the

76
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,460
thing is pumping up to the top when the

77
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,380
water reaches the bottom it'll turn off

78
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,830
the pump keep it from burning out or

79
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:04,820
having any issues I'll need to get some

80
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:04,820
sort of wire tie to keep this in place

81
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:25,690
the original wire tie copper wire

82
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,690
[Applause]

83
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,350
okay now I'm going to drill the two

84
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:37,810
holes for the electric wires one for the

85
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:41,940
float that float switch and the other

86
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,940
one for the pump

87
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:31,910
[Applause]

88
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:57,600
okay so what you see in here I've got my

89
00:06:54,450 --> 00:07:02,040
pecs coming in to this point right here

90
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:04,500
I didn't I really like to go from 3/4

91
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:08,340
right to the opening I mean now I'm

92
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:10,530
coming on the output there but this is

93
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,080
already run it's already in the box this

94
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,750
has not broken that has not broken so I

95
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:19,320
think we're gonna be pretty safe this is

96
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:20,760
my release the water actually holds the

97
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,169
water from the top of the hill down here

98
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,360
so that if I'm working on the pump I can

99
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:27,090
shut this off work on it without getting

100
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:31,470
back sprayed so I'm gonna go and cover

101
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:36,570
these back up give it a little bit more

102
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:42,479
protection from winter I need to come

103
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:44,190
back and put some electrical tape around

104
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,190
all this and make it a little bit better

105
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:51,600
but this is the positive wire coming off

106
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:56,340
of the solar panel if this is negative I

107
00:07:51,600 --> 00:08:02,100
am going to go basically positive to

108
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:04,560
positive to positive negative through

109
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:06,900
the switch to that so as long as the

110
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,160
float is up it'll get power when the

111
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,880
float goes down to the bottom and we'll

112
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:16,289
check the pump off remember the white is

113
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:18,650
positive on the pump and the switch it

114
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:20,550
doesn't matter which side you put the

115
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,500
connection on it can switch the positive

116
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,860
or it can switch the negative no does

117
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:31,500
not make a difference doing this to give

118
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:34,280
me a little bit more slack here I don't

119
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,280
know where my wire

120
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:46,389
my special wire cutters went so going

121
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:53,949
back to what works twist those really

122
00:08:46,389 --> 00:09:05,290
good anything here okay

123
00:08:53,949 --> 00:09:08,980
yeah strip these now positive to

124
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:12,060
positive it's gonna even see if I can

125
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,060
hear the pump running for a second

126
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:27,100
I feel voltage all right so from here

127
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:50,010
[Applause]

128
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:52,240
and I had this setup for my other setup

129
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:57,640
there you go now we got voltage right

130
00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:02,680
there I had this set up for a stop

131
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:06,640
switch up top so with the black wire

132
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:08,880
that's negative so right now with this

133
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,880
one

134
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:16,890
while the float is up it cuts the power

135
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:19,120
and when the float is down it starts it

136
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:20,980
so we need it the other way around when

137
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,830
the float is up the power starts when

138
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:27,089
the photos down the power stops so this

139
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,089
one is not going to be used

140
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:34,580
and I'm going to use the opposite wire

141
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:39,050
because this float switch can work and

142
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:45,470
open up or open down and the way I could

143
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:49,190
check that real simple you look close no

144
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:52,850
spark look here

145
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:55,940
spark so you got an open circuit I mean

146
00:10:52,850 --> 00:11:00,320
a closed circuit on the red wire right

147
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:05,420
now and that's what I want I want it on

148
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:07,060
when the water is up I want it off when

149
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:10,170
the float drops

150
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:10,170
[Applause]

151
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:20,150
okay so I'm gonna put the cap back on

152
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:23,000
gather up all my crap and take it back

153
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,560
to the top of the hill and then what I

154
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,780
need to come down here and do is fill

155
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,940
these holes up with some silicone keep

156
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,640
any critters and stuff from getting in

157
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:36,590
there and then as soon as I get a break

158
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:38,600
in the clouds for a minute I can go up

159
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:41,630
up there and after a few minutes and we

160
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,120
should be hearing water pumping into the

161
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:45,950
upper cistern with this new submersible

162
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,730
pump so I'm not gonna have any issues

163
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:51,050
with priming anymore so I after all the

164
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,300
iterations are the pumps and stuff that

165
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:56,170
I've used this little orange one that

166
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,650
comes up is like a solar well pump

167
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,230
because we're not

168
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,880
pressurizing a tank up top it goes right

169
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,160
it just drops into the tank from the

170
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,680
techs right into the inlet hole on the

171
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,880
side of the tank that's why you can

172
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,380
actually pump that far because it's uh

173
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,560
it says it'll actually pump a hundred

174
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:15,050
feet of head up there we're going 50

175
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,210
foot this way and we're not pressurizing

176
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:18,980
so yeah I've actually had this pump

177
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:21,980
running the I had the other pump running

178
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:24,260
at the pond and it pumped from the pond

179
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:28,270
all the way to the top of the hill so I

180
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:30,800
know it works already we just need to

181
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:32,030
I'm just glad this is done I just don't

182
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,040
have to mess with this thing freezing

183
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,630
any if any more except these connections

184
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,520
here and if these still have an issue

185
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:41,510
freezing I'll have to insulate them more

186
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,890
and figure out something a better

187
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:47,710
solution to just put more insulation

188
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:47,710
around these outlet pipes all right

189
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,620
okay I don't think I've shown the whole

190
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:18,089
system together in one video for quite

191
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,850
some time I should in the in the

192
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:24,930
beginning when I was building it so you

193
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:30,750
can see our setup over here now who's

194
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:33,920
got our overflow down here returning

195
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,920
back to the stream

196
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:45,700
here's our overflow this is going down

197
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:45,700
to our pumping valve and stuff

198
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:51,440
here's your wires coming in to the edge

199
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:55,130
of the box coming up and around into

200
00:13:51,440 --> 00:14:02,080
their lids on and this is being

201
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:02,080
gravity-fed all the way back over there

202
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:14,720
let me show you my Buried amplifier wire

203
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:18,770
which is 10 gauge wire all the way back

204
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:24,470
here 100 feet of it I'll put a link for

205
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:30,890
that in here as well and I did red and

206
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:34,340
black wire the red has turned clear and

207
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:38,180
the black stayed black down here so this

208
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:43,400
is your positive this is your negative

209
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:47,420
and these are your oh gosh I figure out

210
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:50,510
what these MC no what are they these

211
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:57,260
come off the solar panels so here's the

212
00:14:50,510 --> 00:15:02,270
rating on the solar panel itself so

213
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:04,580
windy nation this is the ones I used

214
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:06,260
here I'll put a link in the description

215
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,620
if they're still available or something

216
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,620
comparable

217
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:23,910
and then basically I built a frame had a

218
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:28,939
I believe I did a 35 degree now a 33

219
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:33,089
degree angle and then I wired them in

220
00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:34,470
parallel so you got 12 volts with lots

221
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:37,410
of the amperage I could actually wire

222
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,999
them in series now give me 24 volts and

223
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,699
I might check that out and see if that

224
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:45,149
might work better but let's walk over

225
00:15:41,699 --> 00:16:00,779
and see how the spring is doing I know

226
00:15:45,149 --> 00:16:01,860
my battery's running low yeah it's

227
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:02,420
working pretty good so here's my

228
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,670
overflow

229
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,670
[Applause]

230
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:12,250
my overflow

231
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:17,280
[Applause]

232
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:17,280
and you can see we're not having

233
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:28,120
very little leakage right there where we

234
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:30,850
did all the all the work before this is

235
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:34,600
something off right off the top that's

236
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:36,130
coming off the other edge and then this

237
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:41,070
one is coming off in between the rocks

238
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:44,910
here got our main cutoff right there

239
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,910
looks like this is failed

240
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:51,630
so that'll have computer plates at some

241
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:54,510
point we got this one here oh look keep

242
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:55,910
a little pecs connector handy and let's

243
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:59,940
see what's in here

244
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:03,930
not bad bad at all

245
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:08,699
hip lova what did Roly Polys let's get

246
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:15,750
rid of those let's release this flush

247
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:18,920
everything out stop it and I just try to

248
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:21,560
cover it up keep the sunlight off of it

249
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:27,990
help keep it from getting algae too soon

250
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:33,210
as you can see this follows the path

251
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:38,850
here all the way down to the lower

252
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:41,190
cistern and then this is our this area

253
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,100
stays full pretty much all the time if

254
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:46,770
you had to you could drink it through a

255
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:48,300
special filtration system we've got one

256
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,510
here that we can actually test out and

257
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,510
try

258
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:56,490
I'll show you that a little bit later

259
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:56,490
when we get to little bit warmer

260
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:01,490
[Applause]

261
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:04,630
so peaceful back here

262
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,630
[Applause]

263
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,260
so thanks for joining me on my trip

264
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:10,260
today

265
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:16,700
off-grid homesteading signing off

266
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,490
