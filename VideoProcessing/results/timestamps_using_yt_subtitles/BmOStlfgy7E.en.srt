1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
folks how we doing you know I got some

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,160
good news today all right and we're

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,259
going to do a video that we've done

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,320
before but just the current version of

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,660
it all right the 2023 Edition and I say

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,519
it's good news because a lot of folks

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,619
are sending me emails inquiries messages

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,000
whatever it is what should I get on my

9
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:19,619
new tractor what options should I

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,180
consider which new tractor should I get

11
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,740
comparisons this that the other thing

12
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,180
right which is great and the reason I

13
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,920
say that is because you know you always

14
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,840
get Doom and Gloom in the media right

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,820
the sky is falling it's easy to fall

16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,619
into that trap of you know we're heading

17
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,719
to a recession and and this that the

18
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,460
other thing but the reality is is that

19
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,899
there's still strong demand and it's not

20
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,760
demand like there was when it was

21
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,739
through the roof that was unsustainable

22
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,300
for the last couple of years but as a

23
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,219
business owner myself

24
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,540
I want to see what is actually happening

25
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:47,520
not just what I'm being told is

26
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,440
happening out in some little Fairytale

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,579
Land and so the reality is a lot of

28
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,360
folks are out shopping for tractors

29
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:53,520
still

30
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,899
um and even in the Auto industry right

31
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,000
and part of this is probably due to

32
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,879
backups at other points in production

33
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,160
but Ford set a record smashed it sold

34
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,780
almost 100 000 Super Duties

35
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,640
it's either October November I think it

36
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,280
was November they set that record almost

37
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,420
a hundred thousand Super Duties in one

38
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,619
month

39
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,939
those things are like I don't know

40
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,619
what's an average price tag on a Super

41
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,180
Duty 70 grand

42
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,799
a lot of them go for more than that so

43
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,360
that's pretty crazy anyway so what I

44
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,100
want to talk about today and

45
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,479
and give you guys perspective all you

46
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,920
folks out there shopping for a new

47
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,720
tractor maybe it's going to be your

48
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,060
first tractor maybe you've already had a

49
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,040
tractor it's time to upgrade but I had

50
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,200
two more emails just yesterday or the

51
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,420
day before that were the same thing one

52
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,960
was going to buy a brand new tractor he

53
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,640
was decided between the 4066 and a

54
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,040
50-65e or four Series in a 5 series he

55
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,000
settled on the 4066 wanted to know what

56
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,100
he should get on it when he's building

57
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,619
that out new the other gentleman was

58
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,840
upgrading he had a 30 33r wanted to

59
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,579
upgrade to a 4 Series uh his local

60
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,700
dealer that he was working with had a

61
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,979
40-44r and a 4052r some differences

62
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,920
there but the same price point almost

63
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:01,860
older the 4052 was older 200 hours the

64
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,600
4044 was a 2022 in like 20 hours or

65
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,820
something but the same price and so

66
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,280
really this conversation applies to new

67
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,619
or used but the idea behind it is

68
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,239
getting a tractor or purchasing it set

69
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,739
up the way that you want and a lot of us

70
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,959
don't because we don't know any better

71
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:18,060
and there are solutions you can get

72
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,379
afterwards that will set it up the way

73
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,660
that you want but they can cost more

74
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:23,280
money we do have partners that you can

75
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,780
save money buying through as well and so

76
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,819
really this applies to new or used

77
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,440
tractors you just want to have it set up

78
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,700
the right way and in a sense that's

79
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,959
really why we had the summit tractor

80
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,099
here behind us so I'll tell you some

81
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,959
more about that too as we go through

82
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:37,620
this but this applies to Kubota John

83
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:40,140
Deere Mahindra coyote LS whatever brand

84
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,819
you're shopping the same Common Sense

85
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,959
approach applies all right so for some

86
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,879
of you folks out there that you've seen

87
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,980
these videos before

88
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,200
let me know do you agree with what I

89
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,060
said did you follow the advice did you

90
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,099
go a different direction what worked for

91
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,420
you if there's something I don't mention

92
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,980
today that you think's worth getting

93
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,239
point it out because that's important

94
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,140
information for folks to know all right

95
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:00,000
so we'll start at the front of the

96
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,620
tractor move our way back and so we're

97
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,120
going to start out with the front end

98
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,580
loader all right right up here the

99
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,920
business end and you've seen the

100
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,080
interchangeability forks a pusher a

101
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,120
bucket a grapple a bale spear

102
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,319
probably other tools as well there are

103
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,780
other tools I just can't think of them

104
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:18,000
you need to have a quick attached system

105
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,500
and be that the John Deere quick attach

106
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,940
which is only going to be on a John

107
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,220
Deere tractor or they call it hook and

108
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,959
pin as well everybody else will have a

109
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,220
skid steer quick attach two levers that

110
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,659
you can pull and release your bucket

111
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,860
there's going to be some funky systems

112
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:33,300
out there too Yanmar and some of the

113
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,459
certain series of Yanmar have their own

114
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,540
specialized quick attach we don't sell

115
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:37,980
anything that's the end mark quick

116
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,420
attach out of the gate we can special

117
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,459
order it and we're talking about maybe

118
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,680
having a stump bucket version that is

119
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,299
Yanmar quick attach but just get a skid

120
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,680
steer quick attached just just get a

121
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:48,000
skid through a quick attach just like

122
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,739
the summit has on it you'll be good to

123
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,599
go okay just moving just behind it

124
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,040
you're going to see a couple of outlets

125
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,260
right there those are going to be third

126
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,120
function or diverter outlets and they're

127
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,280
going to be positioned up front because

128
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,680
they're going to connect to a grapple or

129
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,180
an angling a hydraulic angling snow plow

130
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,040
and you're going to need that third

131
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,200
function to operate those kinds of tools

132
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,480
and so the summit tractor does come

133
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,760
standard with that third function up

134
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,959
front but most companies out there do

135
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,360
not there's going to be a couple here

136
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,919
and there but most manufacturers don't

137
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,260
so you're going to have to add that on

138
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:21,780
take a look for the option it's not

139
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,160
uncommon for it to be 1500 or 2000

140
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,540
you'll find a dealer here and there

141
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,580
that'll be a bit less than that as well

142
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,620
if you need to get an aftermarket

143
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,500
solution go to Summit Hydraulics website

144
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,759
you can get a DIY solution

145
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,259
do-it-yourself at home it's going to be

146
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,419
like a fraction of the cost you can save

147
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:38,220
five percent with code GWT okay so one

148
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,199
more item on the loader all right so

149
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,960
this version here is a self-leveling

150
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:45,479
loader or a mechanical self-leveling

151
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,580
loader an MSL mechanical self leveling

152
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,040
is what that means and so as you raise

153
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,479
up and down like if you have pallet

154
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,759
Forks the best example right if you want

155
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,259
to lift a pallet up you want to keep

156
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,300
that level the whole time no matter how

157
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,880
high or low you're raising it and the

158
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,620
self leveling option helps do that it

159
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,020
just the extra brackets and the magic

160
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,120
and the geometry out here gets that done

161
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,560
it is an extra cost you know there's

162
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,660
some other benefits to that as well if

163
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,520
you're using a a pusher or a bucket for

164
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,199
example 2 and you want to keep that that

165
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,340
level all the time and you're raising

166
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,660
your loader up and down you don't have

167
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,220
to worry about the curl roll function

168
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,560
just up and down will help keep it level

169
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,020
two now I can make a case either way you

170
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,419
know on getting a non-self leveling or a

171
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,160
mechanical self-leveling loader there's

172
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,840
benefits to both and there's times that

173
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,580
I I'm happy to have it there's times

174
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,139
that I'm not I've had a lot of tractors

175
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,780
without it and it's the same thing right

176
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:36,000
it's it's a nice to have feature maybe

177
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,440
that's going to be dependent on what

178
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,600
your primary use is or your primary

179
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,220
function but either way it's a nice

180
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,600
option to have it is standard on the

181
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,880
summit tractor included in the base

182
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,380
price something minor and actually is

183
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,479
really not common on open station

184
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,580
tractors I don't know if it's available

185
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,100
from any manufacturer on an open station

186
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,320
tractor beside Summit but thinking more

187
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,900
along the lines of cab tractors because

188
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,580
um that seems to be what most folks are

189
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,500
emailed me about lately are going to be

190
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,000
mirrors on your calves all right and and

191
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,320
I don't think that those are standard

192
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,400
I'm sure there's some companies out

193
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,020
there that do have them standard but

194
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,400
make sure you ask the question uh

195
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,139
because it is annoying like I just

196
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,840
actually even I bought a Polaris Ranger

197
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:17,520
recently and my last

198
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,780
two utvs both had mirrors outside and it

199
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,220
must not have been an option because I

200
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,020
pretty much checked every option when I

201
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,940
was buying this thing and I don't have

202
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,680
mirrors on there and it annoys the heck

203
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,180
out of me every day so same concept with

204
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,199
the tractor especially a cab tractor

205
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,479
make sure you're getting the mirrors

206
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:32,639
added on I used to buy and sell a lot of

207
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,440
used tractors and and particular the cab

208
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,940
tractors I had many of them came in

209
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,800
without mirrors on there maybe they just

210
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,419
broke off but I'm thinking they're not

211
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,220
standard now the seat is an important

212
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:43,380
one you want a nice seat there's certain

213
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,680
series of tractors out there the John

214
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:49,620
Deere 3E series the John Deere 4M series

215
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,819
the Kubota standard L series for example

216
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,220
those are all

217
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,900
pretty basic tractor seats not a lot of

218
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,759
good suspension in there so some of the

219
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,520
more premium series attractors will have

220
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:00,539
a very nice suspension seat on there and

221
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,400
that's what's going to be included on

222
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:03,900
the summit tractor there's an upgrade

223
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,340
even from that on a lot of machines

224
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,919
which is going to be an air ride seat

225
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:09,660
and years ago my opinion has changed on

226
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,940
this I used to not think it was worth

227
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:13,800
the investment in that because it's not

228
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,940
a cheap upgrade I feel like it's a

229
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,979
thousand dollars or more to be honest

230
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,440
with you it's really expensive but

231
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:22,259
boy the more time I spend on tractors

232
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,240
the older I get the more I value comfort

233
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,460
and so that's where a really nice seat

234
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,080
and suspension comes into play and so if

235
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,819
you can get that upgrade I would

236
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,199
seriously consider it because you got to

237
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:32,699
remember you're hopefully not buying

238
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,680
this tractor just for right now but for

239
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,660
years down the road as well and it's

240
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,580
going to cost you more no doubt to

241
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,500
upgrade down the road than it is to just

242
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,199
do it right now okay a couple of points

243
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:46,080
to make down here and we talked about

244
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,479
this recently as well on a l6060 that my

245
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,340
buddy down the road is buying I love

246
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,800
these tires I absolutely love the

247
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:55,380
Goodyear Titan R14 tires I put them on

248
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,919
my John Deere 4 Series which has the

249
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:01,080
same tire size as the Kubota l6060 so if

250
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,120
your tractor dealer won't do it see if

251
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,520
they'll work with a local Tire Shop and

252
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,639
Swap those out for you you know I have

253
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,080
swapped out tires buying trucks from car

254
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,580
dealers even if they didn't carry those

255
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,960
tires or work with that brand it depends

256
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,160
on your dealer some dealer is going to

257
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,479
be better to work with than others

258
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,919
that's just the bricks of the game so

259
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,960
the Goodyear R14 is going to be a

260
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,479
available pretty much on on this size

261
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,800
machine here and on up the Carlisle

262
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:25,199
versaturf is what you're going to see on

263
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,800
the subcompact tractors your 1025rs your

264
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,240
Kubota BX a typical size is a 26 12 12

265
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,139
on the rears no matter which version

266
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,700
you're looking at they're going to be

267
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:34,260
taking the best of three different tread

268
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,599
patterns you're going to take the R1 AG

269
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,279
Tire like the old school Farm tires that

270
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,080
have the big V tread on there you're

271
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:42,020
going to take the R3 Turf Tire which is

272
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,459
obviously for Turf in a very

273
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,320
non-aggressive pattern and then the R4

274
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:47,880
industrial which is a thick bar Tire

275
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,899
it's the most common one that you see

276
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,000
out there in the tractor world today

277
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:53,399
kind of integrates all those together

278
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,860
and just makes a very good Traction Tire

279
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,540
for all different kinds of conditions so

280
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,519
if you're in mud if you're in snow if

281
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,140
you're on your lawn it's not going to

282
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,180
damage the lawn unless you're

283
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,500
doing something goofy to it you know

284
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,180
you're going to have the best chance for

285
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,040
Traction in those off-road conditions

286
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,959
and nasty conditions as well tires are

287
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,160
something you do not want to overlook

288
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,839
you really want to give it a lot of

289
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,980
thought and be a stickler about the

290
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:15,540
pattern that you want to get because

291
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,640
they're going to be very expensive to

292
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,339
change out later on and if you go with

293
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,459
the R1 AG tire for example if you want

294
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,600
to switch to an R14 or do an R4 down the

295
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:26,459
road you're likely going to have to

296
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,740
replace the wheels as well and so it

297
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:29,760
becomes even more expensive to do so and

298
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,500
the same thing can be said if you start

299
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,640
out with turfs on some tractors you're

300
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,220
going to have to get different Wheels to

301
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,620
go to the R14 or the R4 or anything else

302
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,180
so anyway these have been out for a

303
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,740
couple years now I think and so there's

304
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,839
a lot of reviews out there on them so

305
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,760
check the forums read tractor by net

306
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,680
make a post on Green Tractor Taco

307
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,300
whatever it is and get feedback on there

308
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,800
what other people are thinking you're

309
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:51,420
going to have folks always that say well

310
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,160
I don't know my whatever pattern works

311
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,140
great for me but it's a big investment

312
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,700
so just do your research all right so of

313
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,500
course you're not going to see the rim

314
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,080
guard liquid ballast or beet juice

315
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,240
inside these tires but this is a credit

316
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,620
critical ballast weight component and I

317
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,779
think something that virtually everybody

318
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,360
should get unless there's a real reason

319
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:11,339
not to have it tractors in general are

320
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,720
Tippy front to back okay so if you're

321
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:15,420
lifting a heavy load with your front end

322
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,860
loader the back end just normally does

323
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,920
not have enough weight so you need to

324
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,019
add more weight onto it a significant

325
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,180
amount a thousand pounds or more even

326
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:25,740
for a little compact tractor so if

327
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,140
you're new to our Channel I am a big

328
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,459
proponent of tractor safety I'd feel

329
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,320
guilty otherwise if I didn't preach

330
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:33,720
about it so I want you guys to be safe

331
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,000
out there get liquid ballast inside your

332
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,580
tires a great option to consider and

333
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,019
pretty much pretty much every tractor

334
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,940
dealer out there is going to offer some

335
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:43,860
form of liquid bells to put inside there

336
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,360
right up front so and some won't sell

337
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,680
without it all right some are not even

338
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,360
going to allow a tractor to go out their

339
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,100
door without liquid ballast in their

340
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,779
tires it's not going to help keep your

341
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,980
tractor planted to the ground but if

342
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,240
your tires are on the ground then you

343
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,320
have better traction right and you're

344
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,300
going to have better loader performance

345
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,160
so it's just a good thing all around add

346
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:00,899
more Bell switch to the back side to the

347
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,820
three-point hits when you can

348
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,079
wheel weights if you need to so the

349
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,720
summit tractor is going to be one of

350
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,700
those companies that comes standard with

351
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,079
rim guard inside the tires and we are

352
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,660
actually sponsored by rim guard that's

353
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,920
how serious I take tractor safety I want

354
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,060
everybody to know about it you know I

355
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,019
was just telling Chris I don't know how

356
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,060
the heck

357
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:20,399
there's a lot of dirt on this blower but

358
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,959
uh and I don't think I

359
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,220
I got it marked pretty good it must have

360
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,899
been dirt that's on the driveway but

361
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,820
it's all melting off now it's it's

362
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:29,700
supposed to be 50 degrees today

363
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,500
and uh middle of winter and go figure so

364
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,620
anyway next point

365
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,180
rear remotes all right so if you can get

366
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,800
every single remote you can that's what

367
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,959
I would do if you're if you're spending

368
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,300
50 60 70 grand on a tractor like a 4

369
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:44,040
series tractor costs these days then pay

370
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,720
the couple extra Grand or whatever it is

371
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,060
and get all the rear remotes on it that

372
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,320
you can get the the third function the

373
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,060
fourth function the fifth function the

374
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,680
power beyond just have it you're going

375
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,360
to be grateful at some point down the

376
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,279
road because a lot of the attachments

377
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,899
that you can get for it are going to

378
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,760
require extra Hydraulics or if you want

379
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,140
to get a top and a tilt kit that's two

380
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,000
hydraulic circuits right there I mean

381
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,860
they just add up very quickly

382
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,440
and I highly doubt you're going to

383
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,600
regret it so really quick what a rear

384
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,360
remote is this is a rear remote and this

385
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,519
is not two okay this is not two rear

386
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,100
remote this is one you have to have flow

387
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,620
that goes both ways hydraulic flow goes

388
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,000
in and out all right so if you have

389
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,440
you know I'll say this is a hydraulic

390
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,060
Chute rotation on this blower and you

391
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,560
push a lever that's up here on the

392
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:28,440
tractor you push the lever one way and

393
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,640
it sends a hydraulic fluid through all

394
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,440
the circuitry and everything and it

395
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,760
rotates the Chute One Way well hey guess

396
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,320
what now I want to rotate it back the

397
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,700
other way you pull the lever back the

398
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,500
other way and the flow is going to go

399
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:39,120
the opposite direction so that's one

400
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,920
circuit there that's tied up for that

401
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,019
hydraulic function so that's going to be

402
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,700
separate from the function that you have

403
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,440
up front as well all right so there's

404
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,000
that separate grapple function that's up

405
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,380
front sometimes called a third function

406
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,120
you're going to have your rear remote

407
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:52,079
now you're going to have mid remotes as

408
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,760
well you're going to have two of them

409
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,260
there in the mid remote switch kind of

410
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,959
think of that as the one and the two

411
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,820
scvs or selective control valves and so

412
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,800
two of those Outlets which is one remote

413
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:04,019
controls up and down on your front end

414
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,760
loader so you can't sacrifice that the

415
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:07,860
other two outlets which is the second

416
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,420
remote control the curl roll function of

417
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,860
your bucket and so that's why you need

418
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,600
something in addition up front to run

419
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,579
the grapple to open and close the jaws

420
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,500
of the grapple you still want to rock

421
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,820
and curl the grapple whether it's open

422
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,560
or closed so you need to have two

423
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,120
functions to open and close it and Rock

424
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,380
I can curl and then if you want to raise

425
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,120
and lower we're going to give it pinched

426
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,320
down and rock back that's the third

427
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,820
function there so you have to have those

428
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,560
three functions that all work in unison

429
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:31,019
up front you know and I would say

430
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,760
something like rear emotes gets easier

431
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,959
to justify with the more expensive of a

432
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,940
tractor that you're looking at now

433
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:38,100
probably the granddaddy of them all as

434
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,680
far as options go is going to be a

435
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,079
factory cab and so to me a factory cab

436
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,940
is one that it comes delivered to you

437
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:46,560
from the factory with the cab on it all

438
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,600
right and and it's going to have air

439
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,279
conditioning and heat it's going to be

440
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,160
just integrated right into the structure

441
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:54,720
the the the wraps bar is taken off and

442
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,519
the cab becomes your rollover protection

443
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,560
structure that's on there

444
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,019
that's something you cannot add on after

445
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,660
the fact and and yes Curtis does have a

446
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:06,300
cab an aftermarket cab with heat and air

447
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:08,040
that you can add to the Kubota BX line I

448
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,240
think it is but that's that's really

449
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,459
about the only thing and it's not going

450
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,279
to have the fit and finish unfortunately

451
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:16,500
like a true Factory cab is where it's

452
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:18,600
just it's like

453
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,839
structurally sound it doesn't rattle it

454
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,100
doesn't have that reverberation that

455
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,320
Echo chamber kind of feeling inside

456
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:27,800
there either it's just a really nice cab

457
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:31,800
but you're gonna paint

458
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:33,180
June hey hey

459
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,660
that's enough

460
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,660
hey

461
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,079
no thank you and I was reminded of that

462
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,600
wonderful convenience just recently when

463
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:48,420
I was blowing in a blizzard using this

464
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,920
snowblower right here and I um well I

465
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,839
was covered in snow by the end all right

466
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,940
it was like minus 11 wind chill the snow

467
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,380
was blowing all over the place and if

468
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,760
Summit had they're coming out with it

469
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,040
they're coming out with a factory cat

470
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,839
version but if they had the cat version

471
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,820
then you can sure bet I would have been

472
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,920
inside it but I wanted to give this

473
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,839
machine a shot using the snow blower and

474
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:08,880
see how it did and it worked well

475
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,920
but man it's hard to beat a cab not just

476
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,300
in the wintertime right for the the snow

477
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,040
and the cold and the wind and everything

478
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,540
else and just having that heat in there

479
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,820
but the same can be said for the

480
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,199
summertime with dust you know for for

481
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,240
allergies

482
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,820
um for bees and other bugs and stuff you

483
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,320
might get into that just sting you for

484
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:26,699
even the sun beating down on you it's

485
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,740
just nice to have the air conditioning

486
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:30,000
and be out of that nasty stuff that's

487
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,860
out there when you're brush hogging or

488
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,860
doing anything else so again one of the

489
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,480
main reasons that I chose to even

490
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,459
feature the summit tractor on my channel

491
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,620
is because of the good value that it is

492
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:42,660
and a lot of these options with other

493
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,459
manufacturers are standard on the summit

494
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,560
tractors the skid steer quick attach is

495
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:49,079
standard the third function is standard

496
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,660
the self-leveling loader is standard the

497
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:53,699
R14 tires are standard the rim guard is

498
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,440
standard the mirrors are standard the

499
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:57,060
rear remote is standard but no matter

500
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,500
what tractor you get make sure you have

501
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,420
it set up the right way don't have any

502
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,920
regrets so that's thousands of dollars

503
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,420
that come standard that are not going to

504
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,860
be an up charge compared to many other

505
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,660
brands out there so I thought it'd be a

506
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,399
good time to address summit's rollout

507
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,380
plan and you can get more information on

508
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,180
their website too but a lot of folks are

509
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:13,980
frustrated that they can't get a summit

510
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,320
tractor in their area or there's not a

511
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,180
servicing dealership OR technician in

512
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,800
their area right now and that is on

513
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:22,339
purpose all right this is a controlled

514
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,839
rollout where the Summit is

515
00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:27,000
released and opened up and a certain

516
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:29,339
small segment right now to prove out

517
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,860
there all the Kinks in their system all

518
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:33,600
right and so they're to that point where

519
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,880
they're getting ready for that stage two

520
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,620
of the rollout and again you can look on

521
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,759
their website and see all the the

522
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,040
retailers where you're going to be able

523
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,440
to buy this either now or soon you know

524
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,480
coming spring of 2023 gonna be another

525
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,100
launch phase of this which is great and

526
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,959
they're going to have not only just the

527
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,100
retailers where you can buy the tractor

528
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,180
but they're also going to have the

529
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,100
locations on where you can have it

530
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,300
serviced too because that's the idea is

531
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,620
they don't want to sell these tractors

532
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,720
and just have them for sale all over the

533
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,759
country if they aren't yet set up and so

534
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,440
they're going through they've hired all

535
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,820
sorts of technicians they've trained

536
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,860
them they're to that point for the

537
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,919
distribution to scale that up and so

538
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:10,199
while frustration is never a good thing

539
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,280
um to me I I kind of view it as a good

540
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,839
thing just because there's a lot of

541
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,600
demand for the tractor out there so

542
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:16,740
that's a reassuring feeling to know but
