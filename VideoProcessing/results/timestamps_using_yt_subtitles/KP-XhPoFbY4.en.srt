00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,080
Today I want to share with you how I

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,800
hash 200 chicks in a month as a small

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,440
scale farmer and I hope this video will

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,160
encourage someone out there who is just

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,960
about to lose hope. I'm Esa and the

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,920
channel name is Esafam and I'm from

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,439
Kenya, East Africa. Continue supporting

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:30,439
this channel and you'll be blessed.

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,040
Now this is my cook and a small scale

10
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,200
farmer. As you can see these are my

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,040
laying

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,280
hands. They are here and some of them

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,440
are there

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:46,000
up. These are the chickens that I use to

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:49,680
produce my eggs so that I can incubate

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:55,160
them and sell my chicks.

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:59,920
As you can see, they're not so many,

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:03,600
but they are enough for my incubator and

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:07,119
they are enough for my sheep. There are

20
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:13,320
several types of improved Kenya breeds.

21
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:16,799
We have like, ho, sasso and we have

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,840
raina and also we have curry. But for me

23
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:25,280
here, I have chickens. These are the

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,280
chickens that give me my eggs that I

25
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,479
incubate. I hatch over 200 sheets per

26
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,400
month and that is a good number

27
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,640
considering that I am just a small scale

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:43,600
farmer. And when I'm not hatching,

29
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:46,960
sometimes I can sell the eggs to the the

30
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,759
people who want to hatch.

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,320
Now, this is where I brewed my chicks.

32
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,960
And now, I want to take you through the

33
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,759
process of

34
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,320
incubation. How I start, how I place my

35
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,960
eggs in the

36
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:06,840
incubator. So, welcome as I show you the

37
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,160
whole process until day 21 when the

38
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,160
chicks are

39
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,160
hashed. Welcome.

40
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,720
I first start by collecting my eggs and

41
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,879
storing them well until they are enough

42
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,959
for my

43
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:28,480
incubator. And I incubate eggs that are

44
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,120
not more than 7 days for a good hatching

45
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,440
because more than 7 days their hatching

46
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:41,000
ability is low. That is why I prefer

47
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,000
eggs that are not more than 7 days.

48
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,120
After now collecting enough eggs for

49
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:53,040
incubation, now I select uh the good

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,599
ones like eggs with no cracks. I select

51
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:00,080
also broken

52
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:02,720
eggs and I I try to wipe the dirt ones

53
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,760
with a piece of clo and also look for

54
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,400
medium-sized eggs because sometimes

55
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,480
large eggs can not be cannot hatch

56
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:16,800
because most of the times it has a

57
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,519
double yolk and it cannot hatch. Also I

58
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,480
check whether it

59
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:27,480
has one side with a sharp pointed head

60
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:31,840
because the loud eggs they also don't

61
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,799
hatch. So you have to select that that

62
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,920
so that you get a good percentage of

63
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,440
chicks when they

64
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:44,959
hatch. After now I'm satisfied with my

65
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:48,680
eggs. I put them in my incubator.

66
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:52,480
My in cubet holds to 56

67
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:54,920
eggs. So you have to arrange them

68
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,680
uh pointing one

69
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:02,720
side like the way I'm doing

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,239
here. You have to make them uh to to

71
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,640
arrange them to point to one

72
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:11,640
side so that they can be able to hatch

73
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,640
well.

74
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,880
That is what I

75
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:22,720
do. I have an incubator with four

76
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,680
compartments. So I arrange them the way

77
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,320
they are. The same thing I'm arranging

78
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,440
here is what I'm going to do to the

79
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:36,639
other H compartments so that the eggs

80
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:41,040
can h face on one side.

81
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,919
You should not put h like some of them

82
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,080
are facing the the other side other

83
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:51,040
other eggs are facing the other side. So

84
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,199
they should face one side so that they

85
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,160
can hatch and you should keep you should

86
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,440
put only the ones that are going to be

87
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:05,440
enough in your incubator so that to give

88
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:09,240
space for turning the eggs.

89
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:13,280
Connect the wire to the motor and this

90
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:16,000
wire is the one that help to roll the

91
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,520
egg to turn the eggs. Then after you

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,919
have finished, make sure that you close

93
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,000
your incubator tightly so that the

94
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:28,560
temperatures and humidity escaped at the

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,440
right way. If you don't close your

96
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,960
incubator well, the problem might occur

97
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,639
during the incubation period period and

98
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:43,600
you won't get good number of

99
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:43,600
shakes. So be careful and close

100
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,720
tightly. Then you turn the upper cover

101
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,520
that has insulator that help the

102
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,840
incubtor to restore heat. In case of

103
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,639
blackout, the incubtor will still have

104
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,400
heat. Now you switch on your

105
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:04,919
incubtor and you need to set your

106
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,960
humidity and temperature as per your

107
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:13,280
incubtor. Now like this one, the first

108
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:16,120
day the temperature should be 38° C and

109
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,840
relative humidity

110
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:21,800
60%. From day 7 to 12, the temperature

111
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:27,639
should be 37.8°.

112
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:31,600
28° C and relative humidity

113
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,639
55%. Day 13 to 18 the temperature should

114
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:38,759
be

115
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:42,319
37.6° C and humidity should be

116
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:44,280
60 and 19 days after the temperature

117
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,560
should be

118
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:53,560
37.2° C and the relative humidity should

119
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:56,319
be 65. But all this depends with your

120
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,199
incubator. From day seven, this is the

121
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,520
time you need to do canding. And this is

122
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,919
checking whether the eggs has started

123
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:07,360
developing a

124
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:11,039
neo. And at this time, from day one to

125
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,599
day 18, the eggs will turn. But from day

126
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,960
19, remove your eggs from the rollers

127
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:20,080
and put them on the hatching trays. And

128
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:23,120
on day 21, hatching will start. and

129
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,120
you'll get your

130
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:30,080
cheeks. Now, this is how the incubtor

131
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,560
looks like when it is fully connected.

132
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,960
And you need to keep checking the

133
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,759
humidity and temperature according to

134
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:41,039
the days. And if the humidity is low,

135
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:44,800
you need to add water. And I add water

136
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,360
on the holes below to regulate the

137
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,400
temperature and humidity.

138
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,280
This is uh there is a way of measuring

139
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,639
water depending on the advice you get

140
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:01,080
from where you get your

141
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:05,000
incubtor. Uh this incubator is AC and

142
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:10,599
DC. Uh and that means it can use either

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:14,680
electricity or it can use solar

144
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:17,440
system. After 21 days, the the eggs are

145
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:20,599
hatched and you remove the chicks from

146
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:24,560
the incubator and transfer them to the

147
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:28,560
brooder where you keep them uh and brood

148
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:32,159
your cheeks with enough warmth and water

149
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,959
and also feeds for at least a month.

150
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:40,680
Then you can remove them and keep them

151
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,680
somewhere else to get enough space.

152
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,600
Sheets are so delicate and should be

153
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:49,279
handled with great care and especially

154
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:53,600
you supply them with enough heat. So in

155
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:57,279
a buda you should have a eat sauce. You

156
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,720
als you you can also use bulbs bros or

157
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,120
depending on your

158
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:06,000
choice. If I manage to sell my sheets at

159
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,560
day old they are more profitable. So

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
customers place orders and I hash for

161
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,360
them and I find this a good idea because

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,360
the expenses are

163
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,080
minimal. We have come to the end of our
