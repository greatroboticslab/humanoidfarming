00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,440
thanks for stopping over at lumni Acres

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,240
a guide to Modern homesteading

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,760
self-sufficiency and freedom in today's

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,040
video we're going to talk about the

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,440
seven Essentials you need for starting

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,559
and raising happy healthy chicks the

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,080
number one thing you're going to need

8
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:18,840
for keeping your spouse happy when

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,240
raising your chicks in your basement or

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,000
your house is the mother hen you heard

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,599
me right this is the mother hen it's

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,519
just a cardboard box but it's important

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,599
so when you're raising chicks ducks or

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,239
turkeys in your house at night they

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,640
chirp and they make a lot of noise when

16
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,879
you want to go to bed so you take your

17
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,920
mother hen you put it over the chicks

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,120
and they're quiet as can be they'll

19
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,760
sleep through the night nice and sound

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,760
they don't make a peep until morning

21
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,280
comes and you take the box off and they

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,559
and they see it's morning time you might

23
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,600
be thinking it's kind of cruel to put a

24
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,640
cardboard box over your chicks but in

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,399
nature what do they do the mother hen

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,719
sits on the chick so this is more of a

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,359
comfort to them and quiets them and

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,280
makes them FAL happier so trust me it's

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,240
kind of like swaddling a baby you wrap a

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,000
baby up nice and tight and it likes it

31
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,240
it's like being in the womb so the

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,159
mother hen cardboard box is the same

33
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,240
thing to the baby chicks don't forget

34
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,159
it then you're going to need some kind

35
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,439
of waterer you got a big Bell one like

36
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:24,280
this or you got a little one a lot of

37
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:28,119
these depend on how many chicks you're

38
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,439
doing if you're only doing five to 15

39
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,680
that's big enough if you're doing 25

40
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:33,600
this is big enough to start out but once

41
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,079
they get bigger they're going to be

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,560
drinking more water so you got to get a

43
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:41,439
bigger gallon water we put a little bit

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,600
of apple cider vinegar in our chicken

45
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,520
water to start and it just helps build

46
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,479
up their immunity then you're also going

47
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:51,320
to need feed we use organic chick

48
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,000
stutter non-medicated that's totally up

49
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,320
to you something you need to do research

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,880
on for yourself if you want to do

51
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,079
organic nonorganic non GMO and if you

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,759
want medicated non-medicated we don't

53
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,399
use medicated we've never had an issue

54
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,680
not using medicated but I know some

55
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:10,479
people feel one way or another so that's

56
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,120
fine that's your call it's your family

57
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,280
it's your chickens it's their your eggs

58
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,640
it's their eggs you're going to be

59
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,319
eating and it's the meat that you'll be

60
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,680
eating so it's totally your decision

61
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,840
then you're going to want some different

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,840
feeders this one again is a little bit

63
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,080
bigger so if you have 25 more chicks you

64
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,319
don't want the bigger one you can just

65
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:39,959
have the little on fill up the Mason jar

66
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:43,400
you can buy the plastic cup that goes on

67
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:45,400
it you fill it up with feed we just use

68
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,319
a Mason JY you fill it up with feed

69
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:51,040
screw it on and then dump it

70
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,760
over they all work really good the next

71
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,560
thing you're going to need is you're

72
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,080
going to need a heat Source when we

73
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,080
raised our chickens last year we didn't

74
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,280
need a a heat light we just kept the

75
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,400
chicken pan right near the woods stove

76
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,920
and that kept them more than warm enough

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,560
throughout the whole growing season till

78
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,239
they were able to go outside we never

79
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,840
once Ed the heat light if you are going

80
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,040
to use a heat light make sure you got

81
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,640
the right the proper light keep the cage

82
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,480
on so it doesn't get too close and start

83
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:18,879
a fire I'll I'll give you an up close

84
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,480
but we use a ceramic heat bulb when we

85
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,360
need it or you can get an infrared one I

86
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,239
don't like they say not to use the white

87
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,000
cuz it blinds the chicks the red ones I

88
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,760
personally don't like looking at a red

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,519
light it drives me bonkers

90
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,680
so do I want my chicks to have to look

91
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,760
at a red light all the time I wouldn't

92
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,159
want it so I'm not going to make my

93
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,760
chicks do it I got the ceramic heat Bal

94
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:43,200
another preference it's totally up to

95
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,239
you that's why I don't use the red one

96
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,760
I'm going to leave a link in the

97
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,239
description below for Amazon that shows

98
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,680
all the items that we have here and you

99
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,319
can purchase them through the link and

100
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,840
the best part is when you buy all the

101
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:56,959
stuff from Amazon they'll throw in the

102
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,079
mother hand for free

103
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,000
woohoo sorry for all the noise in the

104
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,560
background it's 50° out today all the

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,519
snow is melting and that noise you're

106
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,360
hearing is the Brook running but it's

107
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:09,599
not quite Springtime here yet but it's

108
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,720
getting close to the time where we're

109
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,159
going to start thinking about getting

110
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,599
some more chicks here so that's what

111
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:16,840
made me think about making the video

112
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:18,560
today so another thing you're going to

113
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,440
need is you're going to need a pen to

114
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,440
raise them in and depending on how many

115
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,400
chicks you plan on Staring at once

116
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,680
depends on how big of a pen you need to

117
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,639
raise them we got this water tro that we

118
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,960
use so we're doing like 25 birds or more

119
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,400
once they get big enough we'll stick

120
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:37,039
them in

121
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,960
here most of the time we just use pine

122
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:42,440
shavings for beded you can use newspaper

123
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,919
that works really good shredded paper

124
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,680
really whatever you have if you can get

125
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,680
shredded paper easy or if you got a

126
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,280
shredder use your own paper save some

127
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,919
money and then compost it afterwards

128
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,759
we're only raising a few chicks at a

129
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,759
time or a couple of

130
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,280
ducks I just grabbed this old dog pannel

131
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,720
we have

132
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,720
set it

133
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,280
up and use this then you got the

134
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,759
problem then you have the problem it's

135
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,880
opened on the

136
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:19,800
sides then if you leave the sides open

137
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,440
the chicks just push all their bedding

138
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,440
out so one little trick I

139
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,720
do I just RI the cardboard the length I

140
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,160
need it

141
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,479
and zip tie

142
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,000
it up on three sides I leave the front
