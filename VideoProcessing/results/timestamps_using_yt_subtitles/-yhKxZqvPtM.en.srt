1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,200
hey everybody rob greenfield here and

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,639
today i'm going to talk to you about the

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,719
survival garden what i mean by that is a

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,200
garden where you don't have to go to the

5
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:15,440
grocery stores or other restaurants and

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,520
you can live off of this it can produce

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,320
your calories it can produce your

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,600
nutrients and at the very least it can

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,160
get you through

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,160
weeks or months of not having to go to

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,810
the grocery store so this

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:35,440
is the survival garden

13
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:38,160
[Music]

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,040
okay so why would i be the one to talk

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,920
to you about the survival garden well

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,879
i recently finished a year-long project

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,719
of growing and foraging 100 of my food

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,800
so for one year

19
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,680
every single thing that i ate either

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,239
came from either came from my gardens or

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,879
that i foraged from the wild down to the

22
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:02,320
salt the oil all my calories my

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:05,040
nutrients my protein my fat you name it

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,119
so i have quite a bit of experience and

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,119
this survival garden that i'm going to

26
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,680
be talking about today is specifically

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,920
going to be for where i did this project

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,720
which is central florida so this

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,799
survival garden is more for a warmer

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,799
climate but there's a lot that you'll be

31
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,520
able to learn from this video no matter

32
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,080
where you are and most importantly

33
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,720
wherever you are you can grow an

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,759
incredible amount of food it's just a

35
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,320
matter of adapting to the correct plants

36
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,960
that are designed to not just survive

37
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,119
but thrive in your area

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,720
so i'm going to start off right away

39
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,200
with calories

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,320
number one i'm going to share sweet

41
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,399
potatoes sweet potatoes are a truly

42
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,079
amazing crop a lot of us know sweet

43
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,560
potatoes for the the potato itself

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,680
but what a lot of people don't realize

45
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,960
is that the greens are edible as well

46
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,079
between the nutritious greens and the

47
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,479
calorie dense tubers they're one of the

48
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,160
most important crops that can be grown

49
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,280
as far as putting out an incredible

50
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,080
amount of calories and nutrients

51
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,800
i

52
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,040
probably grew 600 pounds of sweet

53
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,599
potatoes in my year of growing and

54
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,319
foraging all my food and i'm just blown

55
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,480
away at how much you can grow now a lot

56
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,800
of people imagine these little orange

57
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,200
ones at the grocery store but they come

58
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,800
in all shapes and sizes i've seen sweet

59
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,800
potatoes that are up to 13 pounds

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,400
and i've been blown away at how much

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,879
sweet potatoes you can grow in a

62
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,879
relatively small amount of space in a

63
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,959
standard front yard

64
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,519
it's possible to grow all of your

65
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,640
calories let me say that again it is

66
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,640
possible in a standard front yard to

67
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,800
grow all the calories you need with

68
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,599
different tuber crops

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,120
so

70
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:59,599
the second one that i'm going to talk

71
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,120
about is called cassava or yucca

72
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,519
and for those of you who still haven't

73
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,640
heard either of those words it is what

74
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,599
tapioca is made out of so this is the

75
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,239
true survival food over a billion people

76
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,760
around the world depend on it for their

77
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,879
very survival

78
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,480
it's twice as calorie dense as sweet

79
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,080
potatoes at about 700 calories per pound

80
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,120
is what i've read

81
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,200
so it is truly truly calorie dense a

82
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,920
couple pounds of this per day

83
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,319
meets your calorie needs that said it

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,280
doesn't have a lot of nutrients but

85
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,840
we'll get into the nutrient crops soon

86
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,480
so the beautiful thing about

87
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,799
cassava is you literally just take a

88
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,760
stick of it a branch you take that

89
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,000
branch you stick it into the ground

90
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,760
come back 12 months later and you've got

91
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,239
yourself a whole

92
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,159
cassava tree or bush or whatever you

93
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,120
want to call it with the tuber under the

94
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,000
ground

95
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,519
you don't plant it like a potato

96
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,480
you plant it with

97
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,799
with a little cutting basically

98
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,319
and you can actually eat the leaves as

99
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,879
well now cassava or yucca has

100
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,879
cyanide in it but a lot of foods have

101
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,360
cyanide in it and it's just a matter of

102
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,000
cooking it the right way again a billion

103
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,840
people live on this around the world so

104
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,120
you just have to cook it

105
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:27,280
so that's yucca or cassava one plant can

106
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,639
put out 10 20 pounds of tubers from one

107
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,800
plant

108
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,960
and the average one that i've gotten in

109
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,840
central florida is probably around five

110
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,080
to ten pounds of tubers so

111
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,960
that is cassava or yucca that's number

112
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,400
two number three is another really

113
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,600
really great tuber another calorie dense

114
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,880
crop and that is yams the genus and

115
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,440
species

116
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,240
that i've worked with is

117
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,880
diascoria a lotta if that's how you

118
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,919
pronounce it and in florida this has

119
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,080
actually become invasive it is made out

120
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,440
of cultivation i believe it's originally

121
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,000
from asia

122
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,800
possibly africa too

123
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,400
and it's a commonly grown crop for many

124
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,960
people around the world

125
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,039
now when i say yam

126
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,280
a lot of people think of the

127
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,800
per of the sorry the

128
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,280
the orange ones that you get at the

129
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,479
grocery store which we call sweet

130
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,800
potatoes and yams interchangeably no a

131
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,199
yam the largest one that i've ever

132
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,800
harvested was 150

133
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,720
pounds imagine

134
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,639
i weigh about 150 155 pounds

135
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,160
the one i harvested the biggest one was

136
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,960
157

137
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,080
pounds so the size of me they get

138
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,240
massive

139
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,160
an average one might be 10 20 30 pounds

140
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,080
is not abnormal

141
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,479
and the beautiful thing about all three

142
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,280
of these first crops is that most of

143
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,440
them you can largely set it set them and

144
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,120
forget them especially

145
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,720
yucca and cassava those are drought

146
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,759
tolerant they don't need a lot of

147
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,639
nutrients and 12 months later you come

148
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,319
back and you can have a whole survival

149
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:16,080
garden you can do your fence around your

150
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,759
property all with yucca and yams and

151
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,840
just have a

152
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,520
living

153
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,840
fence of

154
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,240
serious calories to be able to come back

155
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,120
to when it's needed or

156
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,160
just when it's desired but back to the

157
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,160
big yam the average one 10 20 30 pounds

158
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,360
they're delicious

159
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,199
i actually prefer them over potatoes

160
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,240
and they are a

161
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,240
vining species

162
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,280
not an edible leaf

163
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,520
unlike the yucca and the sweet potato

164
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,479
both of those have edible leaves

165
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,039
but uh this is a just another beautiful

166
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:57,759
calorie crop now another calorie crop

167
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,000
that i want to mention is potatoes the

168
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,039
crops that i'm talking about are a

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,639
little bit more for the warmer climates

170
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,960
although sweet potato is something

171
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,319
that's grown throughout

172
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,039
but potatoes are a standard that can be

173
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,039
grown all across many climates it's not

174
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,400
one that i have a lot of experience with

175
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,039
i have grown it

176
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,199
in florida but that is a really

177
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,840
wonderful crop that you can grow in huge

178
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,000
volumes as your calorie so those are

179
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,400
four calorie crops and the next one i

180
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,479
want to get into is indeed a calorie but

181
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,319
it's also a delicious fruit and a

182
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,199
favorite food of many people around the

183
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,160
world and that is bananas and i'm also

184
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,199
going to talk about plantains bananas

185
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,240
are a true survival food you can take

186
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,840
one bananas by the way they you can't

187
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,160
you don't plant them from seeds you

188
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,280
plant them from a pup which is basically

189
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,319
a small plant how bananas work is they

190
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,599
send up

191
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,319
uh babies or pups um little shoots out

192
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,720
the sides and you can get if you have a

193
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,720
if there's a huge stand of bananas you

194
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,599
can just dig one of those up with part

195
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,759
of the corn plant it in a few years and

196
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,759
in a few years time you can have a whole

197
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,360
stand of bananas

198
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,520
so bananas in

199
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,879
central florida where i did my year for

200
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,720
example

201
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,479
within about 12 months they can be

202
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,800
starting to produce within a few years

203
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,120
you can be talking about huge quantities

204
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,360
of bananas and plantains

205
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,280
now bananas can be eaten

206
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,160
green

207
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,000
fried for example or you can wait until

208
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,279
they're ripe and you can eat them as a

209
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,360
delicious banana you can also actually

210
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:42,880
dehydrate the skin and the banana whole

211
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,040
and dehydrate it and then blend it to

212
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,240
make a flower and then of course

213
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,720
plantains are a staple of many many many

214
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,399
people all over the world those can be

215
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,040
eaten

216
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,440
ripe as a as a delicious

217
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,480
sweeter flavor or they can be eaten

218
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,399
savory when they are still green

219
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,720
so that is the banana

220
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,080
you can grow

221
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,920
hundreds and hundreds of pounds of

222
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,880
bananas you can start it with something

223
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,080
that you can get for 10 or 20 dollars or

224
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,240
for free

225
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,320
the next one that i want to go into is

226
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:21,200
papaya and papaya is extremely versatile

227
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,279
papaya is a tree but it's not your

228
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,320
typical tree they will last generally

229
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,720
about

230
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,480
at maximum seven years

231
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,120
three to five years might be pretty

232
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,519
normal and they're a very soft tree you

233
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,680
could basically push them over you can

234
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,720
you can cut down the papaya tree just

235
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,800
with the

236
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,240
one swipe

237
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,040
of a machete

238
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,600
but the fruit is a beautiful fruit and

239
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,839
it's very versatile so of course you can

240
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,880
wait until it's ripe and

241
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,920
you can

242
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,120
then it's in a nice sweet orange

243
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,600
or you can eat it while it's green more

244
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,600
as a vegetable and i make sort of like a

245
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,120
sauerkraut with it

246
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,959
a papaya kraut by fermenting it and then

247
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,800
people all over the world use it green

248
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,839
as a vegetable

249
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,120
whether pickled or sauteed or

250
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,760
raw

251
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,800
what's commonly known is thai green

252
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,399
papaya salad for example and i love to

253
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,399
make a coconut curry out of my green

254
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,440
papayas

255
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:28,560
if you're dealing with wasps a pest that

256
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,399
often comes for the papayas then the

257
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,399
best thing to do is not wait for them to

258
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,800
get ripe and eat them green

259
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,040
so this is a great staple crop not as

260
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,000
calorie dense as the earlier calories

261
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,519
calories i mentioned but very filling

262
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,640
and very

263
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,200
much has calories to it now in a colder

264
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:50,320
climate something that actually somewhat

265
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,959
resembles in my mind the papaya

266
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:56,000
is the zucchini

267
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,160
zucchini in a colder climate is a true

268
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,240
survival crop i hear stories all the

269
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,839
time about people saying that in the

270
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,160
northern climates

271
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,760
they have so many zucchinis that they

272
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,600
have to put them on their neighbors

273
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,200
doors to try to get rid of them but

274
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,720
their neighbors hide from them because

275
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:14,160
they don't want them because they have

276
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,440
so many and the reason i'm i'm it

277
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,000
reminds me

278
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,880
of papayas because they can grow very

279
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,120
large and in extreme abundance and they

280
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,399
and they can be cooked in a in a similar

281
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,120
manner

282
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,600
and they don't again have an incredible

283
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,079
amount of calories but they have a large

284
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,600
amount of sustenance and can really fill

285
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:38,720
you up so that's the papaya and for some

286
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,279
people the zucchini and speaking of

287
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:43,760
zucchini what i have to mention for the

288
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,720
survival garden that i'm talking about

289
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:48,640
is

290
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:51,760
a heat loving a heat tolerant squash and

291
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,320
for me that is the seminal pumpkin

292
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,959
it's amazing what you can do with one

293
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,040
seed most people with their pumpkins and

294
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,040
with their squash when they buy them at

295
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,880
the grocery store what do they do they

296
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,959
take those seeds out and they throw them

297
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,560
in the garbage at the very least you

298
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,760
could compost them but what you can

299
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,680
actually do

300
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,360
is plant them especially if they're a

301
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,720
local variety

302
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,600
when i had dinner with a friend i had

303
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,720
i took home the pumpkin seeds from

304
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,639
seminal pumpkins and from two pumpkins

305
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,839
the seeds of that turned into hundreds

306
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,200
of pumpkins

307
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:29,600
many many many meals to come the seminal

308
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,000
pumpkin is my favorite pumpkin

309
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,240
personally my favorite squash wherever

310
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,519
you are your survival garden can

311
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,920
definitely include squashes

312
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,560
the next thing that i want to move on to

313
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,959
is talking about a little bit of protein

314
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,639
and for me one of my favorite sources in

315
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:52,079
the garden is pigeon pea now pigeon pea

316
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,600
is a perennial crop it's not a bean that

317
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,600
has to be planted

318
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,560
year after year

319
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,279
it's actually a tree that will continue

320
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,480
to put out pigeon peas

321
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,440
and sometimes multiple times per year

322
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,000
and even throughout the year they're a

323
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,240
truly delicious they're they're called

324
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,720
gandules they're very popular in puerto

325
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,120
rico and other parts of the caribbean

326
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,560
other parts of latin america as well and

327
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,480
they are truly truly delicious i've

328
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,639
eaten

329
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,560
a large amount of them and have never

330
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,480
once got sick from them at all and in

331
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,000
fact my friend and i actually even made

332
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,920
tempeh from them

333
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,959
so there's a lot that they can be done

334
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,600
that can be done with them so that is

335
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:40,240
pigeon peas and along those lines the

336
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,600
next one i want to talk about is ground

337
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,560
cover

338
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,639
beans or peas and for me my favorite one

339
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,399
is the southern peas now there's many

340
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,959
types of southern peas you've probably

341
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,839
heard of black eyed peas for example

342
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,519
there's many different types of these

343
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,199
and i don't know the names of all of

344
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,399
them but we're talking about spreading

345
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,880
the seed

346
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,399
on the ground it creates a wonderful

347
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,440
ground cover

348
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:09,199
and it produces a lot of healthy food it

349
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,839
can also be used as a cover crop and as

350
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:15,120
a nitrogen fixer to add nitrogen to your

351
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:18,880
to your garden now these can be in fresh

352
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,720
or they can be left to dry on the vines

353
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,959
harvested once they're dry and they can

354
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,360
be stored and the same goes for the

355
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,800
pigeon peas as well so talking about

356
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,680
survival

357
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,079
these are foods that when dried you can

358
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,639
have these lasting in your pantry for

359
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,600
years and that's an important part about

360
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,000
this is storage now in the

361
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,480
warmer climates like florida for example

362
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,040
you can grow food year around

363
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,519
in the northern climates the key to

364
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,399
success with the survival garden

365
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:53,279
is producing as much food as you can

366
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,240
during that window of time that you have

367
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,839
and then preserving it for the fall now

368
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,000
for all the people out there who are

369
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,040
saying oh you can only do this in

370
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,560
florida

371
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:07,040
i have to say these most extreme

372
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,240
abundance that i've ever seen was in the

373
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,240
fall

374
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,279
in places like northern wisconsin where

375
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,079
i'm from

376
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:16,639
the abundance of nuts and

377
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,600
different fruits like apples and plums

378
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,160
and pears and berries is on it's

379
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,680
incredible so much more than i've than

380
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,760
i've ever seen

381
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,120
in some warmer climates so you just have

382
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,160
to work with your area so those are a

383
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,040
few

384
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,399
examples of protein we've covered

385
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,959
calories

386
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,959
we've covered some protein

387
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,759
and now i want to get into some of the

388
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,399
very nutrient dense foods

389
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,639
and the really good news is that a lot

390
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,440
of these nutrient-dense foods whether

391
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,120
you want to be

392
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,279
self-sufficient and being able to exist

393
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,399
without a grocery store or restaurant at

394
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,399
all

395
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,399
these nutrient dense foods are a

396
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,560
no-brainer for everyone because they

397
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,040
take very little work

398
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,639
they can save a lot of money they're

399
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,079
some of the healthiest foods out there

400
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,839
that you can eat

401
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,680
and environmentally they're one of the

402
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,839
most logical things to grow at home

403
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,079
because shipping greens

404
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,600
is one of the least efficient things

405
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,920
that we can ship

406
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,199
so i'm going to talk about perennial

407
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,880
greens

408
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,759
and the first one that i'm going to talk

409
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,759
about is moringa now moringa is also

410
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,040
called the vitamin tree or the tree of

411
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,959
life and it is truly the tree of life

412
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,160
it's one of the most nutrient dense

413
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,279
plants on earth supposedly it's about 20

414
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,160
percent

415
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,639
protein by weight as well so a lot of

416
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,320
greens can have a lot of greens and

417
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,800
vegetables actually do have a lot of

418
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,959
protein in them as well

419
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,199
moringa is a perennial you can start it

420
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,519
either from seed or you can take a

421
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:55,040
cutting stick it in the ground and have

422
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:58,079
a moringa tree you can make

423
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,639
a wall around your property with moringa

424
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,839
you can dry moringa leaves turn it into

425
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,039
a powder and you have your own

426
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,760
multi-vitamin that you can travel with

427
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:11,039
and it's also a really great crop that

428
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,439
you can trade you can trade others this

429
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,839
this nutrient-dense powder that you make

430
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,439
for other things that you need or you

431
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,120
can actually make a little business out

432
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,280
of it and sell it

433
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,919
the next green that i want to talk about

434
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,240
is katuk katuka is another perennial

435
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,039
green and by perennial what i mean is

436
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,640
you plant it and it produces year after

437
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,720
year after year

438
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,000
up in a northern climate a beautiful

439
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,720
perennial is rhubarb an average rhubarb

440
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,840
plant can last for 25 years imagine you

441
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,679
plant it in 25 years every spring it

442
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,400
just keeps coming back

443
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,720
annuals you plant once for example

444
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,520
carrots and then when you pull it you

445
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,240
eat it and it's dead and then in between

446
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,320
perennials and annuals is self-seeding

447
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,160
annuals and these are ones that you let

448
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,160
go to seed and they keep spreading their

449
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,640
seed and they just keep coming back once

450
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,640
you got them going you've got them going

451
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,360
so in the survival garden i highly

452
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,720
recommend working with perennials and

453
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:13,360
self seating annuals as much as possible

454
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,640
so i mentioned katuk and the next one

455
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,240
that i want to

456
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,720
talk about is chaya chaya is an ancient

457
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,600
food it's been eaten for thousands of

458
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,400
years um i don't remember if it's the

459
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,360
the mayans or the aztecs or possibly

460
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,360
both

461
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,559
that have had it as a staple part of

462
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,919
their diet

463
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,799
it is

464
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,760
also called tree spinach

465
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:40,000
and very calorie dense this one also has

466
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,320
to be cooked because it has cyanide in

467
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,360
it just like i mentioned with the

468
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,200
cassava or the yucca but again

469
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,160
it's just a matter of preparing food

470
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,919
right

471
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,919
all things have to be prepared right

472
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,679
whether it's coffee or chocolate or the

473
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,880
way you're producing your

474
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,400
your your beverages like beer and wine

475
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,160
you'll once you start to connect with

476
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,120
your food your food you see that there

477
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,080
is a process a way of doing things

478
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:08,160
but chaya is a beautiful one this is one

479
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,480
where you can literally just take a

480
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,760
stick of it put it in the ground

481
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,520
and after you have a few trees of chaya

482
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,080
you can be spreading chaya to your

483
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,320
entire neighborhood

484
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,120
another one that's very drought tolerant

485
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,640
and with the survival garden the key is

486
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,720
planting things

487
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,720
that are very

488
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,559
very tough that don't need to be

489
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,039
consistently watered that don't need a

490
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,559
lot of nutrients that don't have too

491
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:39,600
many pests and all of these things apply

492
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:41,600
generally to perennials over annuals so

493
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,760
the survival garden is one that you can

494
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,160
walk away from and for three months

495
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,960
later you come back and your food isn't

496
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,919
gone you have more food than when you

497
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,200
left

498
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,600
so that is chaya the next thing i want

499
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,120
to get into is another greens and that

500
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,200
is perennial spinaches so there's all

501
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,039
sorts of perennial spinaches there's

502
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,240
brazilian spinach and new zealand

503
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:09,360
spinach okinawa spinach longevity

504
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,039
spinach just to name a few malabar

505
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,840
spinach is another one

506
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,880
there's probably a good dozen or so that

507
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,120
are grown in the area where i have done

508
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,880
most of my growing and again these are

509
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,039
perennials that you can plant once and

510
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,480
they can keep on coming back and coming

511
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:30,640
back so with those perennial spinaches

512
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,760
and those and the chaya the cassava fl

513
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,799
leaves

514
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,880
the

515
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:38,640
katuk and the moringa that right there

516
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,720
is quite a bit of diversity in itself so

517
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,039
there is a saying and that is let thy

518
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,720
food be thy medicine and let thy

519
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,799
medicine be thy food now in 2020 that is

520
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,760
let your food be your medicine and let

521
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,400
your medicine be your food pretty basic

522
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,720
now the beautiful thing is that yes our

523
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,640
food is our medicine

524
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,120
but there are some acts and some

525
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,120
especially medicinal plants that we can

526
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,840
grow to really

527
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,760
give ourselves that that important

528
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,000
immune boost and to really just take

529
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:13,120
care of ourselves i'm talking about

530
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,280
holistic medicine holistic health care

531
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,480
taking into account everything that

532
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,559
we're doing the our food our water the

533
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,480
way we move our body the way we live our

534
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,039
life the way we live our lives but we

535
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,039
can grow a lot of our own medicine

536
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:30,640
the number one that i recommend in this

537
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:32,799
survival garden is turmeric and ginger

538
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,120
turmeric you take those little rhizomes

539
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,280
you stick them in the ground and

540
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,360
seven nine months later you'll have a

541
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,600
lot more tumeric most of my friends

542
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,200
gardens who have tumeric they have more

543
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,720
than they can deal with

544
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,120
ginger

545
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,039
is it takes a little bit longer it takes

546
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:52,320
more like i think about a year and a

547
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:55,120
half i've successfully grown ginger

548
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,480
but it takes longer to get it

549
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:02,000
to be a large amount and to to get a lot

550
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,840
to harvest but very very easy to grow so

551
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,440
turmeric and ginger

552
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,320
very easy to grow

553
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,520
and

554
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,760
very very important medicines there's

555
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,880
many different medicines one that i

556
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,720
recommend growing is elderberry and

557
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,559
along with honey that you can get you

558
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,400
from your bees you can make elderberry

559
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,039
syrup and this is one of them one of the

560
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:27,200
most incredible natural medicines that

561
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:29,919
prevents cold and flu i like to take a

562
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,440
spoonful of my elderberry syrup every

563
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,440
single day it's one of my favorite

564
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,760
things and it's also an extremely

565
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,240
delicious treat

566
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,880
so i've covered calories i've covered

567
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,840
some protein and i've covered greens as

568
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:46,799
nutrients those three things right there

569
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,360
can take care of a massive

570
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,440
massive amount of your entire

571
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,240
needs

572
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,480
you could probably live just off of that

573
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,280
but there's no need to because there's

574
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,960
such an abundance of other foods i'm

575
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,039
going to name a few other things right

576
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,280
now that are really easy and important

577
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,919
to have as a part of this garden that

578
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,159
would be peppers i grew serrano peppers

579
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,880
starting from one seed from a pepper

580
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,200
from my friend's garden i for a year and

581
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,840
a half had a serrano pepper plant that

582
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,600
put out well over a thousand peppers

583
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,440
wherever you are there are peppers that

584
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,799
will survive and

585
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,240
thrive

586
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:30,240
peppers are a great part of any garden

587
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,440
and then herbs herbs to add flavor to

588
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,919
your food

589
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,640
living off of your garden does not in

590
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,880
any way mean not eating delicious

591
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,520
delicious food and in fact it's often

592
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,120
far more delicious so some of the

593
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,679
absolute survival herbs that i've grown

594
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:51,279
that would be cuban oregano grows like

595
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,440
crazy it's a huge oregano leaf

596
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:56,559
then there's lots of other ones

597
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,799
african blue basil grows into shrubs

598
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,279
brings in an incredible amount of bees

599
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,200
and pollinators so important to have

600
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:06,000
different plants that can bring in

601
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,320
pollinators into your garden

602
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,520
and herbs are one of the easiest things

603
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:14,799
to grow you have cilantro and basil and

604
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:17,039
dill just to name a few herbs are a very

605
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,360
easy beginner plant too if you're just

606
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,520
getting started herbs are a really great

607
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,360
place to start i'm going to mention just

608
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,039
two more even though there's so many

609
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:28,640
more plants that i would love to talk

610
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,400
about but a truly amazing one is daikon

611
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,360
radish we're talking about a radish that

612
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,760
can get

613
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,840
this big that can become self-seeding

614
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,600
that's coming back that creates a great

615
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,440
ground cover that can be chopped and

616
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,919
dropped and

617
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,480
you can you can ferment this and make a

618
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,480
wonderful

619
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,559
radish kraut or mix it in with with your

620
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,679
different krauts it is a

621
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,760
it's delicious it adds a lot of value to

622
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,840
meals and you can just produce

623
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,159
incredible amount of quantities with it

624
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,279
that's the daikon radish wherever you

625
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,279
are

626
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,279
radishes can be a part of your game and

627
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,840
radishes are one of the fastest foods to

628
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:10,159
grow you can get them in about 30 days

629
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,360
now a garden could be complete without

630
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,080
tomatoes but tomatoes add such an

631
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,480
incredible value to life where i

632
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,200
did my survival garden that would be the

633
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,679
everglades tomato in really hot climates

634
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,520
it's often the very small tomatoes that

635
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,080
you want to work with not the really big

636
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,159
ones but in northern climates you can

637
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,000
produce so much tomatoes that you could

638
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,720
not possibly

639
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,200
eat them so tomatoes are just a

640
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,520
beautiful beautiful thing to have in the

641
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,080
garden and then one last thing that i'm

642
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,640
going to mention and that is garlic or

643
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,240
onions really adds an incredible amount

644
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,240
of flavor garlic is also a great

645
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,520
antimicrobial and antibacterial a really

646
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,720
important one for fighting off

647
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,080
sicknesses

648
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,799
in central florida my big ones would be

649
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,880
garlic chives and then society garlic

650
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,480
these are perennials that do really well

651
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,120
i also grew

652
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,679
garlic that's harder in the southern

653
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,000
climates but i did it successfully but

654
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,360
in the northern climates garlic is an

655
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,159
easy one

656
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,919
so

657
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:19,360
that is my survival garden i've covered

658
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,520
your calories your protein your greens

659
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,320
there are more things than that however

660
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,000
this if you have just this going and you

661
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,200
work with the perennials over the

662
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,279
annuals we're talking about almost never

663
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,120
having to take a trip to the grocery

664
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,600
store this is

665
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,799

668
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,600
have some that are specifically focused

669
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,679
on colder climates so make sure you come

670
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,640
