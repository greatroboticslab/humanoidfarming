5
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,880
frustrated with things and you don't

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,559

tire

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,400
and the tire

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,960
is O look at

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,840

no not alive okay that's

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,920
good it might be some murder hornet in

27
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:33,560
here somewhere I don't know but this is

28
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:38,159
a where's the size yeah size is right

29
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:41,000
there 13.6 by 28 tire and a rim that

30
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,320
goes all the way around I have to pop it

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,119
off because you look around here there's

32
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,920
some rot but if you

33
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:54,159
look where is it

34
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:57,880
here there's a hole and this hole has

35
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,840
rubbed the tube so I need

36
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,280
to push this back

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,240
get the tube out replace it and then

38
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,799
over the top of this wherever it's sharp

39
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,520
I need to do something to make sure it's

40
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,760
not sharp it doesn't actually have to be

41
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,680
sealed it just has to be not

42
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,519
sharp so that's what we're going to work

43
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:22,080
on today I have tried removing the

44
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:23,280
bolts and then I was thinking like okay

45
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,239
I remove the bolts and then I take it

46
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,160
off the rim but I'm like what in the

47
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:30,000
hell I don't

48
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,800
know you see people online beating on

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
these with sledgehammers as hard as I

50
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,440
can but

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,680
uh I found something online it's an

52
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,319
Amazon product so we'll see if it works

53
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,720
it's supposed to be able to take these

54
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,959
off the

55
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,599
rim and I don't have to do a lot of

56
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,959
taking off the rim kind of thing I just

57
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,720
have to get

58
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:53,720
it somewhat off the

59
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,000
rim just the front part really so I can

60
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,800
reach in here so

61
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,920
it is currently jacked up or at least on

62
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,440
jack stands and a block of wood under

63
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,040
there so I got to raise it up some more

64
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,519
cuz it has sunk into the ground so we're

65
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,599
going to raise it up get this wheel so

66
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,239
it

67
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:18,760
spins use the magic tool to try to pop

68
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,280
this out and if we get past that then

69
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,200
we're going to start fixing it and

70
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,879
putting it back together

71
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,879
so let's try that

72
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:35,280
all right this is the thing I bought and

73
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,400
yes I bought it from the warehouse cuz

74
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,400
that's where I buy almost

75
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:48,480
everything I need to open it up and see

76
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,480
what size wrench I need for this

77
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,480
all

78
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:17,040
right these are the directions they have

79
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,040
a big caution on it I wonder what it

80
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,079
says this is the

81
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:28,320
thing all I have is a silver socket that

82
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,600
size and

83
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,120
have a uh

84
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,680
impact socket I'm going to be putting an

85
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,560
impact on it so we'll see how that goes

86
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,560
now we got to Jack this

87
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:47,280
up I jacked it up from here before this

88
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,280
is the bucket

89
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,240
this up again

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
fire Jack from

91
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:49,440
neighbor I'm guess say 4,000 lb this is

92
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,440
half of it

93
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:06,560
off the

94
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,000
ground up

95
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:25,080
here I'll find some other jack stands

96
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,080
for that see the right place

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:36,389

loose

103
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:19,520
okay so the next step is up here I have

104
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,520
to remove the Val stem from the

105
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,919
tube

106
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,000
because yeah there's a hole in the in

107
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,400
tube but it is a slow leak and you can't

108
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,360
have any back pressure on you when

109
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,489
you're doing this

this there's a oldie but a probably not

115
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:52,800

00:08:51,680 --> 00:09:00,320
okay there are ways tighten up on this

124
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,320
one should pull it in further

125
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,360

off look how much was inside there

208
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:50,240
all parts of the rim that's all got to

209
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:55,760
be cleaned

210
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,760
out this has got three holes in

211
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,000
it that's take the rest of this off and

212
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,320
who knows I might find some

213
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,679
more wire brush this

214
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,360
up try to treat

215
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:12,919
it paint

216
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,520
it might be another hole under

217
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:17,360
there I'm going to do all that

218
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,600
offline and we show you what we're going

219
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:26,320
to do about these CU right here is where

220
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,320
it bolts through and two broke

221
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:37,600
so as you can tell here I've given it

222
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:41,200
the old Earl shy

223
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:44,000
Rehabilitation I got three

224
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,679
holes I got a little hole there I don't

225
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,679

226
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,679
it right

227
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,679
there

228
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:59,679
so I cleaned it as best as I could wash

229
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,880
it with some solvent

230
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,120
painted it with a

231
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:07,960
brown uh rust Rusty primer painted it

232
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,440
with a white primer and painted with

233
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:12,720
orange now it's painted with orange and

234
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,279
it's all chers you know it's got to be

235
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,720
good that's all it

236
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:20,039
needs I have

237
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:25,279
then my house and

238
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:25,279
got Gorilla Tape weather patch

239
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:36,799
this stuff is sticky and why I'm using

240
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:38,840
this is not the seal Air at all it's

241
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,640
just to keep water from getting back and

242
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,520
rusting this out some more as much as

243
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:47,640
possible this stuff is sticky

244
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:52,480
sticky right's a

245
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,480
chunk let's use this one here

246
00:24:53,060 --> 00:25:06,470
[Applause]

247
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,559
over this

248
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:22,760
hole okay so we got

249
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:25,279
this we got this I have to try to hold

250
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,279
that down

251
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:32,039
somehow so I think I'm just going to go

252
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:32,039
find some duck tape tape the

253
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,240
edges once the tube's in here this

254
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,039
certainly isn't going to

255
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,480
move I just when I put the tube in the

256
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:56,080
tire in and all that I got to keep this

257
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,080
down where it belongs

258
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:06,600
well I out a battery in the

259
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,600
phone

260
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:15,720
so don't know where you left

261
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:18,279
off but what I did was I put down some

262
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:21,720
gorilla seal tape to make sure that the

263
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:24,279
holes don't leak water back up laay down

264
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:28,080
a piece of sheet

265
00:26:24,279 --> 00:26:30,360
aluminum and tape that down to make sure

266
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,080
that the tube doesn't buol through and

267
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:36,240
now I have to create a new

268
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,240
pole for the valve stem to come

269
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,159
out now we're going to get Russell on

270
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,720
one side

271
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,720
side of the tire

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:04,919

278
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:04,919
tube has to go

279
00:28:06,039 --> 00:28:11,679

pinched

283
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,960
W looks like I was able to stretch it

284
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,960
around there

285
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,440
now

286
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:07,000

288
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,720
sure it's laying

289
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,080
correctly okay now it's got a little bit

290
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,080
of a shape

291
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,600

truck it's got a lock on

298
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,919

[Music]

300
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,720

out well

304
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,639

it well that's going to be the end of

306
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,000
the day it's getting late

anyway uh so this has 7 and 12 lbs of

308
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,440
air in it come back in a couple days and

309
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,880
check it make sure it's okay uh you know

310
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,960
if not then I got to take it all apart

311
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,480
again fix the tube uh I found in the

312
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,240
other side it's still full of calcium

313
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:31,399
chloride so I can't really check that

314
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:33,919
one to compare it so that's happening

315
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:36,679
anyway thanks for watching give me a

316
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,000

317
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:40,720
if you have any questions because I

318
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,480

321
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:48,880
this tire on you kind of watched some of

322
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,480
it but it was

323
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,960
problem

324
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,960
um take a look at what the patches look

325
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,960
like

326
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,519
the one on the

327
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:12,480
old behind there is the other one

328
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,039
so that Gorilla Tape is sticking out

329
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,559
there and I'm thinking about I might put

330
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:19,159
some epoxy on the top just to fill it in

331
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,639
and protect it a little more but that's

332
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:23,440
it for

333
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:25,200
