1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,120
hi I'm John duet with the North Dakota

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,160
State University extension service I'm

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,120
an area livestock specialist and I'm

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,199
pleased to welcome you to our program on

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,160
background and Cavs in

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,800
2015 each fall our Ranchers have to make

7
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,279
some production and marketing plans and

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,119
typically about half of them we their

9
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,199
Cales and feed them for a period of time

10
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:30,439
to heavier weights which we call

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,120
backgrounding the fundamentals factors

12
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,079
which go into the profitability of this

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,760
uh Enterprise vary quite a bit from year

14
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:38,800
to year we've had recent years of

15
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,480
extremely high grain prices we've had

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,719
years of rising rapidly Rising cattle

17
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,480
prices during this backgrounding phase

18
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:49,879
but today 2015 we're faced with fairly

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,160
cheap abundant feed and a cattle market

20
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:54,879
which has been on the downslide so I

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,600
think to get things started here and

22
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,320
getting a little insight into the

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,039
economics and what the potential is for

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,039
backgrounding this year I'm going to ask

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,320
a few questions of our livestock

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,840
marketing Economist Tim Petri who's

27
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,680
stationed at the NDSU campus in Fargo so

28
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,159
Tim I guess you know this Market's

29
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,520
really been moving a lot mostly down

30
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:19,080
what are your price expectations for the

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,320
550 lb kind of vaccinated calf coming

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,680
off the cow going into the market today

33
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,600
yeah sure I agree that we really have

34
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,759
had a volatile Market with last year

35
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,320
record high increases and then the last

36
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,159
couple of months we've had a big

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,200
downtrend uh Main causes for the decline

38
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,280
being a contra seasonal downward fed

39
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,040
cattle market caused by many factors

40
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,759
including a backlog of heavy cattle and

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,320
record weights also record high pork

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,880
production you're going to hear record a

43
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,399
lot today record high pork and poultry

44
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:52,240
production and a stagnant export market

45
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:55,079
so uh yeah price expectations is a very

46
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,920
good question uh somewhat difficult to

47
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,039
answer probably due to the wide ranging

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,600
prices for the same weight and greater C

49
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:05,399
at the same Market uh again due to many

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,039
factors such as are they weaned or

51
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:12,040
unweaned uh or preconditioned do they

52
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,000
have health programs and so on so uh I

53
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:17,879
expect another 20 to $30 range like kind

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,959
of happened last year and in prices at

55
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:25,040
the same Caves at the same market and so

56
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,000
uh as we can see in the chart we have a

57
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,840
more normal seasonal pattern this year

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,360
with declining prices in the second half

59
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,160
compared to last year when they went up

60
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,640
every year so keep that in mind um we

61
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:40,400
are expecting calf prices to be about 25

62
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,680
to 30 Cent per lower than last year so

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,800
for example a 550 steer last year that

64
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,760
brought 280 is closer to $200 even to

65
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:50,640
210 this year of course every Market has

66
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,840
good news and bad news for those selling

67
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,319
caves the bad news is we're below last

68
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,200
year and probably below earlier

69
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:59,159
expectations of a few months ago but the

70
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,640
good news is we still have the second

71
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,480
highest price prices ever but for those

72
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,720
buying Cales it's still going to mean

73
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,319
that they're going to have to come up

74
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,560
with a lot of money I think we'll sell a

75
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:13,319
lot of steer Cavs in that 195 to 210

76
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,640
area and again like always heers are

77
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,200
really discounted this time of the year

78
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:22,640
$20 or for the lower end even more so uh

79
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,480
that puts them in about 175 to

80
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,159
190 sometimes we see some preferences

81
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,920
for the real light C especially when we

82
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,799
have a good winter wheat crop down south

83
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,200
and they need some great in animals I

84
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,760
would think with the price of wheat this

85
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,400
year not looking too optimistic there'd

86
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,480
be some interest in grazing what do we

87
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,239
see on the slide on the weight classes

88
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,840
between lights and Heavies okay yeah

89
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,959
well we really haven't had a good test

90
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,720
to light caves yet because we have such

91
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,439
good conditions out in North Dakota and

92
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,879
there hasn't been much weaning or light

93
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:52,840
caves brought to Market uh but for sure

94
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:54,599
the price slide is a lot less than it

95
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,920
has been the last couple of years there

96
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:00,599
are several reasons for that um most of

97
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,879
the calves coming to market now are not

98
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,680
weaned or preconditioned and our balling

99
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,680
calves that's typical of an early Market

100
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,879
again not many being sold you mentioned

101
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,000
winter wheat and that is the big one uh

102
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,120
winter wheat planting is way behind

103
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,199
schedule particularly in Texas and

104
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,040
Oklahoma and it's dry down there and so

105
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,120
that market has not materialized yet

106
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,440
with the weather pattern where we they

107
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,400
are expecting rain and we hope that we

108
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,680
get it but so far that is not

109
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,000
materialized and and so uh the market is

110
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,560
really encouraging producers to wean and

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,120
precondition Cales looking at the charts

112
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,639
for instance for last week uh average

113
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:48,520
550 steers were about 205 but the 750 to

114
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:51,800
eights were only $10 behind at 195 so uh

115
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,479
last year the market was $40 differ so

116
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,120
we need that winter wheat crop to really

117
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:58,759
materialize to to get any spark in those

118
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,280
lighter calves well you you've given us

119
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,080
a pretty good indication where she's

120
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,560
trading in this early market and also

121
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:07,199
said they were're kind of seasonally

122
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,120
normal starting to slide down as the the

123
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,400
runs of Cavs come to town can we expect

124
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,479
some uh when we could hit a seasonal low

125
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,639
and when can we expect some recovery or

126
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,240
is this all guessing game well that's a

127
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,600
good question and yeah Cals do usually

128
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,720
reach a seasonal low in November when

129
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,160
all the cattle come off of pastures and

130
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,479
the big runs hit the market as the chart

131
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,039
shows the market is already declined

132
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,199
since August about 20 to 25% so the big

133
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:36,080
seasonal decline is behind us in fact

134
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,880
it's one of the largest in history

135
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,919
declines here in the last couple months

136
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,600
so um some weakness still may occur

137
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:46,039
especially in those unweaned calves

138
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,840
without a health program or uh you know

139
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:53,319
that are the less optimistic calves

140
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:55,160
there but uh uh and you know there's a

141
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,240
lot of volatility and certainty in the

142
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,919
market which causes buyers to be a

143
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,560
little bit more reluctant on those uh

144
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,639
calves that don't have a health program

145
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,960
and so on but if we can get some rain in

146
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,840
the winter wheat belt and get some

147
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,960
seasonal strength back in the feeder in

148
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,639
the FED cattle market that is which is

149
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,400
possible that would support prices uh

150
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,639
however we're not going to go back to

151
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,240
last year's prices for sure and

152
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,720
cyclically we are on the downtrend so we

153
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,960
need to keep that in mind well we know

154
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,479
backgrounding works really well when

155
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,199
you're in a rising market because then

156
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,479
the price cattle get more valuable every

157
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,560
day you got them and you feed them and

158
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,840
take care of them uh big question now is

159
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,919
what are these six s 800 pound feeders

160
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:36,960
going to be worth come January February

161
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,280
March because if we had a good idea on

162
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,240
that then we'd kind of know how this is

163
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,960
going to pan out yeah that's always the

164
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,880
$64 question and while calf prices tend

165
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,240
to increase after the first of the year

166
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,800
the heavier weights often do decline

167
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,960
after the first of the year would be a

168
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,199
normal seasonal pattern however the

169
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,720
range in prices for those heavier weight

170
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,280
cattle do narrow because they have been

171
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,960
weaned they have had a health program

172
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,319
and so on uh January to March feeder

173
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,800
cattle futures are trading below cash

174
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,680
prices now in fact just a couple of

175
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,520
weeks ago they were a lot lower they've

176
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,879
rebounded $10 to2 so we've got January

177
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,080
Futures in at about 180 now and the

178
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:19,840
March Futures in a little dollar or so

179
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,120
lower than that um still below the CME

180
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,080
cash settlement price which is all 650

181
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:28,199
to 850 Cavs so the Futures is still

182
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,960
discounted to the current cash market so

183
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,479
I think uh as a first step we do have to

184
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,240
look at the Futures Market as a Target

185
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:36,960
uh hopefully we can get some strength as

186
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,680
I mentioned before back in that fed

187
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,240
cattle market and we can do better than

188
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,440
that but also keep in mind that there's

189
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,400
always risk in a volatile market so

190
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,199
producers need to ke keep that in mind

191
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,280
as

192
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,120
well well we got a little idea where the

193
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,360
cattle are trading where they might be

194
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,599
going using the Futures a bit of a guide

195
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,520
feed is fairly cheap interest is kind of

196
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:01,599
low fuel cost is down quite a bit what

197
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,400
would be your cost of gain Target for

198
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,400
Cavs doing that two to two and a half a

199
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,680
day in a backgrounding program yeah okay

200
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,919
feed prices do vary quite a bit across

201
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,240
the state and we do have a wide variety

202
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,720
of feed stuffs and speakers later are

203
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,039
going to discuss some of those uh it

204
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,280
even depends on if you're selling corn

205
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,879
to the elevator versus buying corn there

206
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,240
might be a 30 Cent difference there so

207
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:26,639
that obviously affects our uh bottom

208
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,280
line but you know I think now we should

209
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,319
look at the low 50s for a cost of gain

210
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,919
some certainly with lower feed costs and

211
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:35,560
lot costs and so on will do it in the

212
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:38,560
40s a few might even be up in the 60s

213
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:40,800
but let's shoot for those lower $50

214
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,560
range is a good starting point well that

215
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,320
is kind of with those kind of cost of

216
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:48,560
gain projections and uh kind of our uh

217
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,560
slide on the weight classes narrowing up

218
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,920
this year when you put it all together

219
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,240
what's the budget show there a little

220
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,440
room here to make some money background

221
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,640
and gavs yeah absolutely on my website I

222
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,000
have an Excel spreadsheet that producers

223
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,000
can use plugin their own information

224
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,519
there's also a calf web break even

225
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,480
budget there so in the example you see

226
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:11,880
on the screen now I just brought in a

227
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,720
550 weight calf at $25 and then a 750

228
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,959
calf out at

229
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:22,800
$175 and January March whatever you want

230
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:26,120
to use I have a 2 and 3/4 pound of gain

231
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,440
uh corn at $3 again corn is kind of all

232
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,600
over the board my example shows about a

233
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,760
$50 per head return and interestingly

234
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,440
enough I went back to last year at this

235
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,240
time when calf prices were a lot higher

236
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:43,360
280 Cavs we're projecting 230 out came

237
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,120
out to $50 last year at this time so the

238
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,480
market does try to I think encourage

239
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:51,519
some backgrounding and and some return

240
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,760
there and very similar to last year but

241
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,000
you know it looks like we can background

242
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,640
calves as we all know however there are

243
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
many factors that affect calf prices and

244
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,800
there is risk and we've seen that in the

245
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,920
last couple years but that's how it

246
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,200
looks right now well thank you Tim for

247
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,720
sharing those uh insights into the

248
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,279
economics maybe backgrounding this year

249
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,720
is there anything else you want to pass

250
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:15,839
along as we close well uh you know uh

251
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,279
again going back to that wide range in

252
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,880
calf prices uh if you look at the bottom

253
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,720
level and and add value to some calves

254
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:27,000
that helps heers are always discounted

255
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,480
this time of the year and uh sometimes

256
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,600
are really a nice Market class to

257
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,920
background because every 50 pounds we

258
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,720
gain prices on steer Cav so uh you know

259
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,480
just uh look for some of the best

260
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,440
opportunities there for making some

261
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,440
money thanks
