  "text": "[Music] hello everybody uh Dylan here and uh with Nathan SCH sales reps here with green cover talking a little bit about uh when is the best time to start planting our spring mixes I know everybody's getting itchy to to get into the ground whether that be moisture whether that be it seems like Springs here um so just kind of want to discuss with you guys what our approach is um to to going about that so Nathan what you know when a customer asks you hey I'm ready to plant you know when when's the ideal time what do you kind of generally recommend yeah so this is definitely a really common question right now you know the main thing is soil temperature for germination and then air temperature uh to avoid any winter kill so most of your cool Sean species are going to germinate around 40 degrees and so as long as our our longterm average and our current soil temperatures are at that 42 sorry that 40 degrees um and that's probably that probably needs to be taken at uh a 2in soil depth and early in the morning um if if we're at that point and then we we just need to be past any concern of a hard freeze you know cool season species can tolerate some Frost it's when you get those hard freezes down in the 20s that we're going to start seeing some winter kill um of course there are a lot of other factors that go into uh you know when is the time to plant so maybe you want to get into the weeds a little bit more on those yeah so I definitely agree with with those parameters we cannot physically be out there measuring the soil temp you know so you know any any kind of you know any kind of thermometer works that has any kind of probe so even just a you know just any kind of like a food thermometer Works to to measure those those temperatures um I I usually refer to greencast um and with greencast you can put your ZIP code in there you can see roughly current soil temperatures you can see five and 10 year average so I kind of combined the two the three of those um you know to get to that 40\u00b0 temp and then I also kind of incorporate the the 10day forecast for the ambient temp to see okay do we have any hard freezes you know coming up or what do the what do the 10day for what do the 10day forecast look like um and you know that that freezing temp you know really kind of coincides with it I believe it has to be around you know 4 hours at that temperature you know kind of that's when you start to get um that's when you start to get those those killing frosts for some of those cool season um species so uh you know keeping that in mind um another another thing you can do if you have if you're planting just something simple like peas and oats planting it a little bit deeper um it can you can get it in the ground while you have moisture get it sprouted and it's going to stay in the ground a little bit longer so we can maybe avoid if there are some of those hard freezes here you know in the next couple weeks um but that that at least allows you to to get it in get it up and and hopefully get a good good Forge going with some more moisture but those are really the parameters I try to try to stick to and yeah it's the biggest thing is going out there and measuring it yourself too to get good good hard data on on your area yeah because there's G be a lot of factors that affect that soil temp you know how biologically active soils are what sort what's our residue situation what's our moisture situation so yeah tools like that greencast website are great for getting ideas um but the results are going to vary on the farm so and I definitely agree with that thought of hey I have a really nice planting window right now we plant now plant a little deeper like those oats and peas those cereals that can go a little deeper and then we'll delay that emergence you know by a couple weeks um it'll be a couple weeks before those plants are up where they're actually susceptible to being um damaged and so that's how we can kind of take advantage of early Springs like what we seem to be having this year um and and get our seeds in the ground so you know it can be as simple as comp or as complicated as we want it to be but at the end of the day 40\u00b0 soil temps and past the hard freezes and and we should be good to go",
