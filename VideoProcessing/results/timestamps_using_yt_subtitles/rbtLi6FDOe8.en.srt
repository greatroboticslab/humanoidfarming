00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
ICRISAT DigitalGreen KSDA

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Coconut planting method

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Namaste my dear farmer friends.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
My name is Basavaraj.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I work with Icrisat
company as a researcher.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Our farmers grow a lot, but
while growing coconuts

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
if they want to know how to do so

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
they would need information.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We will talk to the
Horticultural department

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
about how to plant saplings

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
from their researcher

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Please take full advantage of this.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Sir, Namaste.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Namaste. My name is Basavaraj.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I work with Icrisat company as a researcher

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We want to teach our farmers

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
on how to plant coconut saplings

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
My name is Dr. M. Prashant

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I work as a sapling
researcher and look after

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
farm management. Yes, Mr Basavaraj

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
A lot of farmers are coming and

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
we tell them to change their

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
planting methods.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
A lot of farmers

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
hesitate to implement our method.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
They doubt it. One doubt is that

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
we tell them to make a 3 feet deep

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
3 feet wide and 3 feet long ditch.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And we tell them to plant it.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We tell the farmers this.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Farmers doubt this because

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
the saplings will be of this size.

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So they think- why should they make

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
such a big ditch and plant it.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
This is their doubt. Can you show us a

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
demo on how plan the sapling?

38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Okay Mr. Basavaraj, like you said,

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I will show them

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
how to plant, measure

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and mix it.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
And how to plant it, support it and

43
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
fasten it, I will show you the demo

44
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Come let us go see the demo

45
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
One meter means 3.3 feet

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
3.3 feet depth, width and length

47
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Mr. Basavaraj

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I will show you how to plant saplings

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You should pay a lot of attention

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and understand it, so now

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You have to make a ditch like this

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
which measures 3 feet in depth, width and

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
3 feet length

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
After making the ditch

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
it is very important to
know how to fill it up

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
To fill this ditch

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
the soil that was removed is here

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Along with it you have to mix sand

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
with sand you have to mix manure

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
mix it in a 1:1:1 ratio

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
which means 1 part sand

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
1 part manure and

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
1 part red soil or excavated soil

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
you have to mix all these
three and fill the ditch

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Once you have filled the ditch if possible

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
you can make a waterway

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
we have to give water route

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
once it is closed and watered the soil

69
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
goes down by one or two inches

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Why do we add sand?

71
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We add sand because

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
coconuts attract

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
white ants

74
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
White ants will eat the sapling

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and kill it, since there is manure

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
we have to add

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
sand, red soil

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and Dimet to stop white ants

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We use Dimet for white ants

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This how you fill

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
the ditch

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and prepare it

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Mr. Basavaraj, as you can see

84
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
we have filled the ditch with equal

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
amounts of sand, manure and soil

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
After it is levelled like this

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
we will tie ropes like this

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
while plating

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
we tie ropes, when they are tied

90
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
we get the pit’s centre point

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
So we tie a rope like this

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
on both sides

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
then you get the center point

94
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
and mark it.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Now we will remove soil with a spade

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
After removing the soil

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
not too deep

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
people have misunderstood

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
that we will plant it 3 feet under

100
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
it is a misunderstanding,
everyone says that

101
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and then add Dimet or Foret into the ditch

102
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
to avoid white ants

103
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
it has to be mixed like this

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
2 spoons are enough? Yes it is enough

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Can you smell it now? Yes

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You will get a foul smell
and insects stay away

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
While planting this, you
have to keep in mind that

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You will have to plant it

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
usually like this

110
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
1 inch above the coconut

111
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
If you add more than this

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
the sapling will get disease

113
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
because mud will enter

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
this part

115
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
To avoid this

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
and prevent this

117
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
we will plant it in the centre

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and fill the soil one
inch above the coconut

119
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
After planting it like this

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
then

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
you can see the leaves are like fans

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
when it is windy

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
they move

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
to avoid this we will

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
plant a stick next to it

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and compact the surrounding

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
with your feet and

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If you have drip system, you can install it

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
If not, you have to

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
pour water from the top

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The plant will settle well

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
after it is set

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
we will tie

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
it to the stick

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
This will avoid

136
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
falling from wind

137
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
and setting of the roots

138
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
After watering it what to do next?

139
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No, nothign else, If you want to you can

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
add more soil here

141
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and level and compact it with your feet

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
If you compact it the plant will not shake

143
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
and will grow properly

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You have ties the plant to the stick

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes it is very important

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Once it is planted

147
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
the coconut will be inside

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
we have to keep pushing it below

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
also not to let the mud get in here

150
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
but dont push it too deep

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
like the proverb

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
“Walk straight like a coconut tree”

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
so we make a 3 by 3 by 3 ditch

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and we have filled it with

155
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
soil, manure and sand and planted it

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Notice that that we have made PP on these

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
because of this

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
and the leaves being like a fan

159
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
it moves when there is wind

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
When it moves so much

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
the roots wont set well

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
and the plant may die

163
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
to avoid that we have this stick here

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
and tied the leaves to it

165
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
and also the steam

166
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
whne you tie it

167
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
this plant wont move in the wind

168
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
and no other problem will occur

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
and it will have good roots

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
and will grow properly

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What is the distance between

172
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
the saplings? Length and breath?

173
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
can you explain it in detail

174
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
If you want to make a coconut grove

175
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
then you will have to 7.5 meters

176
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
between saplings and rows

177
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
that is if you want to make a coconut grove

178
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
some farmer wants to

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
grow crops with coconuts

180
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
we have to increase the distance

181
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
between saplings and rows

182
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Here we have left 7.5 meters

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
between saplings and rows

184
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Only to make a coconut grove? Yes

185
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
So according we have planted it

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
With this spacing how many

187
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
can we plant in an acre? If we have a

188
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
distance of 7.5 meters then

189
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
in 1 hectare we can have 177 trees

190
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
which is in 2.5 acres

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
So for 1 acer

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
if you do it the old way

193
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
they will have 30 feet distance

194
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
if you do it like that then

195
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
in 1 acer you can have 40 trees

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
and in 1 hectare you can have 120 trees

197
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
so when you plant like this

198
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
you can have 177 trees which is more

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
trees in a particular area

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
and we will get more profit

201
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Mr. Basavaraj, even if you want to plant

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
on the main farm area we have to

203
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
follow a certain procedure.

204
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Because, if we do not follow it properly

205
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
the rows will not be aligned

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
They will not be straight

207
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
and when the distance is not equal

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
the farm will look bad

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
because of the planting methods

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
To avoid this, we should first make a baseline

211
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
From the boundary of the property

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
you have to leave 7.5 metres

213
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
How much distance? 7.5 meters

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
and then make the baseline

215
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
after making the line

216
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You should make markers at both the ends

217
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
of the baseline and attach thread

218
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
it will come out straight

219
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Once this is done we

220
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
have to make another baseline like this

221
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
once this is done measure

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
the angle at this corner

223
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
and they should be right angle

224
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
with the help of tape

225
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
then what ever you will plant

226
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
it will be at a distance of 7.5 meters

227
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
and then the rows will look aligned

228
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
from all directions

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
even diagonally they look aligned

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
If you see it straight or cross

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
or from any corner they will look aligned

232
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You can notice that in this farm

233
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
at our main farm you can see it

234
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
from here you have mark 7.5 meters

235
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
and here on this row

236
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We mark 7.5 meters and

237
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
will tie a rope

238
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
and mark 7.5 meters here as well

239
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and place stick here

240
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The place where the stick is will be the

241
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
centre of the pit and dig it

242
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
centre the sticks and dig the pit

243
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
yes dig the pit

244
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
After making the pits

245
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
next we should mix

246
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
in equal quantities manure, soil and sand

247
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
and fill the pit

248
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
So if we plan the

249
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
pits and fill it

250
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
and then plant

251
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
here you can see North to south

252
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
the rows are straight, also form the sides

253
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
rows look straight

254
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and also from east to west the

255
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
rows look straight

256
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So when we plan like this

257
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
we can have a planned farm

258
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
and we can provide nutrition and minerals

259
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
equally to all the pants

260
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and the plants will grow
well and more output

261
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Up until now, you have taught

262
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
our farmer friends

263
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
how to plant coconut saplings

264
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
to dig a pit

265
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We thank Prashant Sir and

266
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and the horticulture research centre

267
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
the staff and the staff here

268
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
on behalf of us and all the farmers

269
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I thank you again. Namaste.

270
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Similarly I would like to say that

271
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Because of your department,
the farmers are able to

272
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
share this research with
them and inform them

273
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
about how to plant the saplings.

274
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Through us, you are able
to show the farmers

275
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I would like to thank you and your team

276
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
on behalf of us and our research

277
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I thank you very much.

278
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Summary questions: 1. How big should
the pit be to plant a coconut sapling?

279
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,927
2. What are the materials
to be filled in the pit?

280
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:29,024
3. How much distance should be
there between the saplings?
