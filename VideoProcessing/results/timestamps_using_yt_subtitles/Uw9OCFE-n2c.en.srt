1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,640
how will the future of farming look like

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,680
as we near the close of 2023 the fields

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,719
of Agriculture and Technology continue

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,840
to intersect in increasingly innovative

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,799
ways transforming the way we grow and

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,240
harvest our food one of the most

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,000
groundbreaking developments in this

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,480
sphere is the rise of high-tech green

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,480
houses a revolution that's changing the

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,960
game for Farmers around the world

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,679
consider Japan where an aging Workforce

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,679
and declining population have

13
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,960
significantly impacted the agriculture

14
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:33,800
industry over the past decade the number

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,600
of agricultural workers in Japan has

16
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:40,800
dropped by over 20% with nearly 70% of

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,719
the remaining workers aged 65 or older

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,320
in response private companies and local

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,760
governments are now partnering to

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,760
develop smart farming Technologies with

21
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:52,280
5G playing a crucial role in this new

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,000
era of farming 5G powered robots and

23
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,399
remote monitoring systems are making

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,359
farming easier and more efficient these

25
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,000
Technologies allow experts to support

26
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:04,080
Farmers remotely reduce labor shortages

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,040
and improve profitability 5G enables

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,360
real-time transmission of large amounts

29
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,560
of data allowing Farmers to monitor

30
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,200
crops receive assistance and ensure

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,119
safety the goal is to leverage real-time

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,119
data for advanced software systems like

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,000
Ai and machine learning to provide

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,759
recommendations moving across the

35
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,560
Pacific to Morehead Kentucky we find app

37
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,439
valued at over a billion dollar this

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,119
high-tech Greenhouse has just shipped

39
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,040
its first first harvest of organic

40

tomatoes on the vine to early investors

41
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,000
and retailers including Martha Stewart

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,960
and Walmart app Harvest uses 90% less

43
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,960
water than traditional farming and has

44
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,799
plans to open two more green houses in

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,320
the coming year the company aims to

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,680
build 15 green houses in the next 5

47
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,200
years revitalizing Appalachia through

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,280
high-tech farming indoor farming and

49
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,439
food Tech have raised over a billion

50
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,159
dollars in the past 5 months alone

51
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:00,759
indicating a strong interest and

52
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,640
investment in the future of farming

53
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:04,320
with the rise of high-tech green houses

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,520
we're witnessing a shift in the

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,399
agriculture industry moving away from

56
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,160
traditional farming methods towards more

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,440
sustainable and efficient practices in

58
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,519
conclusion the emergence of high-tech

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,480
green houses represents a significant

60
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,840
Leap Forward in the farming industry by

61
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,840
harnessing the power of technology these

62
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,120
green houses are not only increasing

63
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,599
efficiency and productivity but also

64
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,360
Paving the way for a more sustainable

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,000
future it's clear that the future of

66
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,640
farming lies in the adoption and further

67
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,239
development of these Innovative

68
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,000
Technologies and the potential impact of

69
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,840
these high-tech green houses is

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,599
immense as we move forward let us keep

71
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,840
our eyes on this exciting Frontier for

72
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,840
the future of farming is here and now
