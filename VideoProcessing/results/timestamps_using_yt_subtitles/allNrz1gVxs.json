  "text": "hi I'm farmer Brad and I'm in the high tunnel the next step install some irrigation now I already had this header pipe it's a lay flat pipe of two inches in diameter and what I'm gonna do is right behind here is where the water tower is gonna be so the water tower will gravity feed down here but I want to leave this door open so I can drop my tractor up and down so what I'm gonna do is run this two-inch pipe all the way down to the end of the high tunnel I'll do a 90 and then I'll run three-quarter inch hose across the end and then that will end up feeding the drip tape now I want to bring to your attention company name dripworks they specialize in irrigation drip tapes small and large and they were kind enough to donate 500 feet of three-quarter inch poly pipe and that will run from the ramp pump through the water tower they also include a medium-sized irrigation system for a high tunnel that I'll be using in the next couple videos but today's goal is getting this hooked up to the garden hose initially and then eventually this two-inch will connect to the water tower this will at least get the irrigation system up and running and then I'll take you along for the rest of things so make sure to check out dripworks com for all of your irrigation needs and definitely want to thank them for their sponsorship of these irrigation videos so without further ado I'll go ahead and start the process okay so the first thing I'll do is I'll put this 90 degree on and what eventually this will happen is it will go vertical up to the water tower but at least for now I'll just run a short little section of hose and then I'll be able to connect connect it on to here I'll just cut a section here then sure to put on one of those clamps if it is a really snug fit you can take a torch and heat it up to stretch it I'll cut another little section here and then lastly another hose clamp and put this right here okay so I'm gonna tighten up this hose clamp [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] okay so that's on there I'll go ahead and hook up the garden hose so I'm using the same garden hose adapter they used for the automatic chicken water buckets and just does a safety measure I'll put teflon tape on this part so then I'll take my channel locks channel locks and hang it up as tight as I can okay I'm gonna move this back into position we'd be up against there now let's go to the other end so I'm gonna find a spot over here probably like right about there to tie this in before I got any further I wanted to go over the medium-sized irrigation system for high tunnel so it includes I think a hundred feet of half-inch poly pipe and this is what I'll use to feed the drip tape well it has a filter here it has where you can splice into here to run the drip tape it has spikes for keeping the irrigation in place see oh these are for tying off the ends of the drip tape so you can terminate them by just flipping them over in half and then these are little plastic pieces that slide over the end and then here are some pressure regulators to decrease the pressure from pressure regulator down to 10 psi so you don't over blow your system there's a little puncture tool or puncturing the holes in this to connect these little parts and then there's also some repair kits where if there's a hole you can cut the leaking area and then splice the two parts together so that's pretty much what is included in the system they also which I'm really excited about this drip works provide me with a Bluetooth hose end irrigation controller so this you'll be able to control via bluetooth set the schedules as long as you're within range of Bluetooth so that will be really awesome so then I can set timing for watering and the such so unfortunately I don't have another clamp so I'm just going to try to terminate this by doing the pullback method and some Gorilla Tape wait these arrow there is back there we go so that should terminate that [Music] where that will do the trick for that now here I'm going to unscrew this and have it go from three-quarter inch down to half an inch okay so now I'm going to heat this up a little bit light it on there [Music] and then I'll do the same thing up here [Music] okay okay so I'm gonna connect this first over here okay keep this up okay that's tight I'll go ahead and take one of these too I'll keep it straight [Music] okay so determine and eat this end what I'll do is I'll cut this off and I'll flip it back so because this hose is pretty tight I'm going to just use this clamp here to [Music] [Applause] this is where the video is gonna have to end I wasn't able to get any further because there was a storm coming in so look forward to irrigation part 2 in an upcoming video thanks for watching",
