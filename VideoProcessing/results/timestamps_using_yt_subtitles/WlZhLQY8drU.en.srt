00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,199
hello viewers welcome to elim TV a

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,800
station where you watch learn and also

3
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,560
interact your tutor is Mr an agriculture

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:33,000
teacher in today's lesson we in form one

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:36,559
lesson 24 topic Crop Production one it

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,239
deals with land preparation subtopic

7
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,120
importance of land

8
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,160
preparation on to the lesson objectives

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,360
by the end of this lesson you should be

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,920
able to number one explain the various

11
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,399
tools and equipment used during land

12
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,559
clearing then number two State the

13
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:00,000
various methods of land uh clearing

14
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,680
terms used we have land preparation and

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,960
and what is land preparation these are

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:09,759
the various activities that are carried

17
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:13,119
out in the farm to prepare the land or

18
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:15,640
to make the land suitable for planting

19
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,479
or the land to to be ready to receive

20
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,000
the planting material then we have the

21
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,040
land the some of the activities which

22
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,720
are carried out we have during pre land

23
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,479
preparation the first one we have land

24
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:35,399
clearing and this refer to the cutting

25
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:38,240
down all the vegetation uh cover on a

26
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,840
particular piece of land then we have

27
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:44,079
the primary cultivation and secondary

28
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:48,880
cultivation primary cultivation refer to

29
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:53,040
the initial opening of land in a virgin

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:57,719
land or uh the the the initial opening

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:00,320
of land uh following uh land uh clearing

32
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:05,000
then we have secondary cultivation it

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:08,039
entails uh the process of U hallowing or

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,759
uh seed bed refinement whereby the

35
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,640
farmer normally uh goes back to the

36
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:16,000
field after carrying out primary

37
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,680
cultivation and breaks down the large

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,480
soil cloths into small pieces so that

39
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,519
you can establish a fine H til which

40
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,720
will promote uniform germination and

41
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:32,920
also uniform depth of uh planting then

42
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,840
uh we have the methods of land clearing

43
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:39,120
the first method you uh you we have the

44
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,080
tree Fairing and during tree fairing you

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,680
can use various method uh for those

46
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:50,200
people who uh have doing land clearing

47
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:54,159
on large scale they can uh uh uh cut

48
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:58,000
down the trees using the bulldozer and

49
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:01,159
that is a a a machine uh which is uh

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,280
well displayed there and and you can as

51
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:08,040
well as use for the small scale Farmers

52
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,519
they can use an ax to cut down or to

53
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,720
during tree failing and also you can use

54
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:17,799
a power so or electric so whenever it

55
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,319
comes to tree faing as the method of

56
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,080
land clearing then we have the second

57
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:26,599
method we have burning method but this

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:29,080
method is not advisable why uh because

59
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:31,720
it will end up lowering the soil

60
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:36,000
fertility because the high temperature

61
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:38,120
which is induced it will cause the soil

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,159
microorganism which are very very

63
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:44,959
beneficial uh uh to the plant also to

64
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,239
die due to high temperature so it is

65
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,879
very very uh it is not advisable for you

66
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,159
to use this method then we have uh the

67
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,760
slashing method as you can see it is

68
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,680
well Illustrated here you can use a

69
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,680
slasher also you can use a panga when it

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,599
comes to uh

71
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:07,599
slashing of the vegetation cover then we

72
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:09,920
have the fourth method is chemical

73
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,799
method in chemical method we normally

74
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:17,160
use the chemicals that are sprayed in

75
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:20,079
the farm in order to mitigate the pro

76
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,199
the problem of the vegetation cover and

77
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:27,080
therefore all the vegetation cover will

78
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,280
be will die at the end as a result of

79
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,240
being affected by the chemicals which

80
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,240
are normally used what are the factors

81
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,240
that necessitate land clearing one

82
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,360
whenever you are uh you you are

83
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,000
preparing a virging land remember

84
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,360
virging land is the one which has never

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,560
been ctiv has never been cultivated

86
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,960
before and therefore it is bushing and

87
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,240
therefore you have to carry out land

88
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:56,600
clearing then the second one previous

89
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,919
crop uh if the previous crop was a stamp

90
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,160
was made up of some stamps and therefore

91
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,479
the the the it we necessitate land

92
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:07,479
clearing for example maze if uh the

93
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,919
previous crop of maze uh you should

94
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:14,160
carry out land clearing in order to pave

95
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:17,560
way for the subsequent operations such

96
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,240
as primary and secondary cultivation

97
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,680
before planting is done then we have

98
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,600
interval between primary and secondary

99
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,120
cultivation some Farmers normally carry

100
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,160
out primary cultivation then there is a

101
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,840
very big gap in between the primary the

102
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,160
time when the primary is done and the

103
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,560
secondary done it means that there is

104
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,680
the growth of the crop of the weeds

105
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,199
again in the field and therefore it

106
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,120
necessitate for land clearing to be done

107
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,720
and also where the land has left follow

108
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,600
has been left follow for a long period

109
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,240
of time if the land is left

110
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,319
uncultivated condition in uncultivated

111
00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,440
condition for a period of 2 years uh it

112
00:05:57,319 --> 00:06:03,960
necessitate uh land clearing uh to be

113
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,840
done first before the other subsequent

114
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:10,160
operation to be exercised then we have

115
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:11,960
tools which are used or the machine the

116
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,160
tools equipment or machine which are

117
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,199
used during land clearing we have a

118
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,680
slush you can use aanga you can use a

119
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,680
matchet you can use buza and also you

120
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,960
can use a power so what are the reasons

121
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,120
for land clearing number one to kill the

122
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:33,960
wind and number two to reclaim the land

123
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:36,520
this is to make uh uh land useful the

124
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,680
land which was not useful after you

125
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,960
carry out land clearly it becomes useful

126
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,280
then to facilitate finally it is to

127
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,599
facilitate easier carrying out of

128
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,400
subsequent operation such as primary

129
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:53,720
cultivation and secondary cultivation we

130
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:57,000
have come to the ends of today lesson

131
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:59,840
and the questions uh which I'm going to

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,680
uh assign you is there inform of

133
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,199
assignment the first question is list

134
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,280
any four types of tools and equipment or

135
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,400
machine used during land clearing then

136
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,319
the second question State any three

137
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,440
reasons for carrying out land clearing

138
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:19,240
then number three mention any three

139
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,879
methods of land uh clearing then for

140
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,759
reference you can refer from the
