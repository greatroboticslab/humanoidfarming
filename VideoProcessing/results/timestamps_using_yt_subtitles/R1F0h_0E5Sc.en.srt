00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,640
my name is Bill ringland I'm a

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,080
operational member of agrain agre grain

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,480
is a family run business that's been in

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:25,320
operation for over 30 years now uh we're

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:29,000
based in Narine but have recently uh

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:31,759
opened a receival site in Canal a few

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,920
things it's obviously a huge drawing

9
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:37,600
area for for grain in New South Wales a

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,960
huge opportunity for us to take the next

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,160
step as a business and also service an

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,920
area that had been crying out for

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,520
someone else to step into the to the

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,000
area another strong advantage to the

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,039
area and us being here is the diversity

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,320
in the soil soil types um you know from

17
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:00,480
walgate through to gagen Bone there's

18
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,559
some um you know varying ranges of uh

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,040
soil typee Black soil typee red soil

20
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:07,759
type which um obviously accommodate

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,000
different crop types so that gives us a

22
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,600
um commodity diversity I suppose which

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,960
is important for us as a business we've

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,280
just had uh Western Australian based

25
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:23,520
company take a major shareholding in our

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:26,720
business so Plum grve coming into uh a

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,920
shareholding in agrain means that we

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,640
have uh an additional Capital EXP

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,439
expenditure to be able to spend on

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,079
facilities like the one in canul um to

31
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,680
try and service the grow a bit better

32
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,880
the train that's coming today uh it's

33
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,240
heading to Port botney from there it'll

34
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,320
go to multiple destinations all around

35
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,520
the world a lot into southeast Asia uh

36
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,479
China and some chickpeas into India

37
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,759
we're heading into our third Harvest

38
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,399
since being in canul and um a big

39
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,960
positive for us is the way that the

40
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,119
local Growers have embraced uh us being

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,520
here um we're here for the long term and

42
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,840
look to become a part of the

43
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:11,720
community from a tonage point of view

44
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:14,560
historically the canul and wget area

45
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:17,800
been upwards of 3 or 400,000 tons of

46
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,400
wheight um and on top of that there's

47
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,560
there's obviously chickpeas and barley

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,160
and canola as well depending on what

49
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,160
rotations people are running so it's um

50
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,440
it's a huge opportunity and a huge

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,040
capture area for us

52
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,160
it's potentially a almost a $20 a ton

53
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:40,319
Freight Advantage having someone like us

54
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,400
here for them um as a especially with

55
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,800
the pulses instead of going to somewhere

56
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,040
like narab or dbo they've got the option

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,599
to come here and we're essentially a a

58
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,560
step forward in their supply chain which

59
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:54,599
is a huge Advantage for them I think in

60
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,080
essence we're a storage and Export

61
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:59,360
facility so during Harvest a grower has

62
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,920
the opportunity to either Warehouse

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,280
grain with with us uh we can purchase it

64
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,080
off them directly or we'll do contracts

65
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,879
with them for a forward sale our

66
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,640
capacity for storage is around 100,000

67
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:15,159
tons and with Plum Grove coming on board

68
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,280
we're looking to uh through a number of

69
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:24,959
stages expand that to hopefully around

70
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,959
200,000 tons in the next 18 or 24 months

71
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:33,119
