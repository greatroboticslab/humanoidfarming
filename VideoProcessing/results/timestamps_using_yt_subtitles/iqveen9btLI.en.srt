2
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:31,640
the landscape of the Upper Midwest has

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,320
has become one of the most productive

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,600
agricultural regions of North America

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,239
fields of corn and soybeans reach to the

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,719
Horizon in every

7
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,000
direction this land though has spawned

8
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:47,000
another kind of product completely

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,719
unintended but no less profound the

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,680
runoff from these agricultural

11
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,320
operations compromises the water quality

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,600
both locally and farther down the

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,120
Mississippi drainage all the way to the

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,359
Gulf of Mexico in fact this region is a

15
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,920
major contributor to the zone of hypoxia

16
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,680
in the Gulf where excess pollutants wipe

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,360
out marine

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,920
life the area of concern is the region

19
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,799
of Northwestern Iowa and Southwestern

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,960
Minnesota today the plow dominates a

21
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,320
landscape where once the grass has stood

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,360
well over a person's head and Buffalo

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,200
roamed freely very few wetlands and

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,640
Native prairies remain on the land to

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,680
filter the water and slow the pulse of

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,640
runoff in addition the mass conversion

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,920
of the the Prairie Wetlands ecosystem to

28
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:36,159
intensive farming has threatened many

29
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,520
species of migratory birds and

30
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,680
butterflies these species often Nest

31
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,000
here or use the area during their cross

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,399
hemisphere migration

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,479
routes through adapted farming and

34
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,240
conservation practices there are

35
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:51,960
increasing points of Hope new data

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,240
suggests that the level of nitrates in

37
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,600
the water has been declining in recent

38
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,079
years the key is to look at current

39
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:03,280
practices with an eye toward historical

40
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:03,280
conditions and practical conservation

41
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,640
strategies around 12,000 years ago when

42
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,160
the first humans appeared in North

43
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,920
America the Upper Midwest was mostly a

44
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,800
glacial landscape when the glaciers last

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,959
receded they left behind a fertile soil

46
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,440
glacial lakes and Wetland depressions

47
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,400
called Prairie potholes the effects of

48
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,599
the last glacial event are still being

49
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,400
felt on the

50
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:30,920
land we're in the prairie pad hole reg

51
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,959
region which is mainly Glacial Hill um

52
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,280
placed here pretty much the topography

53
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,760
and everything you see is placed here

54
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,720
pretty much by glacials um coming over

55
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,920
the land and then receding especially

56
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,159
the receding part where they gouged the

57
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,159
landscape and and made deposit deposits

58
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,640
in different

59
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:51,879
areas this is an open landscape uh

60
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,760
dominated by grasses and and wetlands

61
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:57,680
glaciers came through this area and dug

62
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:01,000
out these depressions uh the climate uh

63
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,879
has provided the moisture necessary to

64
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,959
maintain U the vegetation the grassland

65
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:09,200
vegetation and the wetlands um

66
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,840
interacting with with the climate and

67
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,680
the physical factors uh

68
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,080
glaciations uh our disturbances such as

69
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,640
grazing and uh and fire which have

70
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,920
maintained um the Upland system in a

71
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,000
very early successional

72
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,799
stage we're at kind of a major boundary

73
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,519
in Southwestern Minnesota we're sitting

74
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,360
on the Marine of the last Glacier that

75
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,720
came into this region and a marine is a

76
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,879
linear Ridge of Hills this one Trends

77
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:40,239
northwest southeast and to the east of

78
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:43,120
this line is a landscape that is very

79
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,519
young geologically it's um the drainages

80
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,920
haven't been integrated yet you have

81
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,360
Rolling Hills a lot of wetlands Lakes

82
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,000
sloos to the west of this Ridge is a

83
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,280
much much older glacial landscape the

84
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,560
difference in ag is 14,000 years to the

85
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,200
east 400 to 600,000 years to the West so

86
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,720
there has been a lot more time for the

87
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,200
drainage system to develop west of here

88
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,879
this difference in age of the two

89
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,239
Landscapes on either side of this Ridge

90
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:08,840
has to be appreciated when you're

91
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,760
talking about Land Management because on

92
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,959
the West Side you have this well

93
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,920
integrated drainage system every single

94
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,359
low spot on the land surface has been

95
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,560
drained has been reached by headward

96
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,000
erosion of a stream of some size and so

97
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,479
the whole landscape is connected with

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,639
the dend dritic drainage way on the east

99
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,919
side of this line nothing is connected

100
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,199
yet this landscape is poorly drained and

101
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:33,639
it will become drained in the long run

102
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,479
and so there is going to be the creation

103
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,759
and erosion of streams and that's a hard

104
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,120
thing for people who are managing the

105
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,919
land to appreciate they want it to kind

106
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,960
of lakes to stay looking like the Lakes

107
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:44,919
they always have been they're reluctant

108
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,440
to see Lakes fill in become marshes and

109
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:48,919
shallow water environments but that is

110
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,960
going to be the natural progression of

111
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:53,039
this

112
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,960
landscape the biggest change we see now

113
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,320
that the state is fighting and doesn't

114
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,039
understand is the Min Minnesota River

115
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,520
was deeply downcut during glaciation

116
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,360
10,000 years ago all its tributary

117
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,880
streams which reach into this area are

118
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,199
still adjusting to that down cutting

119
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,080
event and so they had waterfalls

120
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,039
initially created at the at their

121
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,800
Junction with the Minnesota and those

122
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,240
waterfalls or Nick points are migrating

123
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,039
upstream and in some cases are only 5 to

124
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,479
10 miles from where they join the

125
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,280
Minnesota River so you have these deeply

126
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:24,840
ins sized drainage ways that meet with

127
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,960
kind of a sluggish looking Upland stream

128
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:28,600
well eventually that gradient that that

129
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,319
step in the gradient is not going to

130
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,560
persist for the long run it's going to

131
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,720
be evened out and so there's a lot of

132
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,440
erosion there's a lot of gullying um

133
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,039
banks are caving into the river there's

134
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,080
High sediment load in the Minnesota and

135
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:44,919
its tributaries and a lot of that is

136
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,960
natural um farmers do contribute some of

137
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:50,880
it when they ditch and tile but the bulk

138
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,440
of it is a is a naturally vent and it's

139
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,080
something that is still adjusting after

140
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,840
10,000 years when the first Europeans

141
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,840
viewed this area in the late 1600s they

142
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,160
found the land covered with a waving sea

143
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,880
of Tall Grass Prairie roaming herds of

144
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,319
bison and migrating tribes of Plains

145
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,700
Indians those Native Americans left

146
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:12,759
subtle yet lasting marks upon the

147
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,919
[Music]

148
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:18,199
land after the Civil War agricultural

149
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,520
production hit full stride here and

150
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:23,240
within 100 years came to almost

151
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,680
completely dominate the landscape most

152
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,599
of the wetlands were actually drained at

153
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,039
about the turn of the century maybe up

154
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:33,080
to about 1920 the mid or so people had

155
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,039
to realize that Iowa and much of the mid

156
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,840
Upper Midwest here the prair pothole

157
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,199
region PE people had a difficult time

158
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,479
even living in this area because of

159
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,039
water they had trouble even getting

160
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:46,400
around in Iowa we had probably about 2

161
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:49,240
and A2 million Acres of wetlands that

162
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,000
disappeared because of drainage

163
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,800
so

164
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,720
people

165
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,080
historically didn't like wetlands and a

166
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,160
lot of people still don't like them

167
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,759
today because were a real problem with

168
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,039
people making a living off the land when

169
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,599
they had to farm

170
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:08,560
it

171
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,800
and the people's attitudes I think have

172
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,759
changed somewhat because they realize a

173
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,720
lot more now what the values and

174
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,840
functions of wetlands today producers

175
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,520
and land managers here are starting to

176
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,319
look for ways some of that original

177
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,879
ecosystem might regain function the

178
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:28,479
focus is on a few small patches set

179
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,120
within the agricultural landscape one

180
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,319
may still find a small remnant of

181
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,479
prairie or wetland in original condition

182
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,360
these areas serve as models and Seed

183
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:42,120
sources for restoration work elsewhere

184
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:45,159
generally down here over 90% of the

185
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,639
original wetlands have been drained and

186
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:51,280
are now uh used for

187
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:55,319
farmland for the Tallgrass Prairie I've

188
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,159
heard uh various percentages but

189
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:01,520
generally it's well less than 1% of the

190
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:04,639
original Tallgrass Prairie Still Remains

191
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:08,639
and I've heard as low as you know a

192
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:12,000
tenth of a percent so depending on what

193
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:15,639
area you're looking at Tall Grass PR is

194
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,280
very rare we do have some Tall Grass PR

195
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,919
behind me we have some on uh some of our

196
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,039
other waterfall production areas and we

197
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:30,039
use that as this seed source uh in order

198
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:32,479
to start planting uh those types of

199
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:34,760
plants in our new areas so this is a

200
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,760
Skipper and this is one of the species

201
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,959
of insects that we use to talk about the

202
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,800
quality or the health of a prairie the

203
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,839
Skippers are incredibly specific because

204
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:47,240
they're they're lay they lay their eggs

205
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:50,279
on grasses and um despite the fact that

206
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,800
it's not very showy of a species uh they

207
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,800
really do tell us quite a bit about the

208
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,680
quality of the Prairie this Prairie is

209
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,560
also a very valuable resource because

210
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,839
when you look at Iowa and the changes in

211
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,279
the landscape that have happened over

212
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,120
the past couple hundred years uh Iowa

213
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,240
used to be predominantly covered by

214
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,079
wetlands and prairies and now we have

215
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,839
less than 1% of the Prairie uh covering

216
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:12,480
the landscape that we had 200 years ago

217
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:14,240
so this is an incredibly valuable

218
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,680
resource this this site because of the

219
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,079
genetic diversity uh and the species

220
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,279
diversity of plants as well as other

221
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:22,279
organisms that live here like

222
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,680
insects one of the other important

223
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,760
aspects of this Prairie particularly is

224
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,480
that it shows quite a diversity of

225
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,279
microhabitat TS we have the Uplands here

226
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:37,079
we also have lower Wetland areas there's

227
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:38,560
a a high diversity of topography and the

228
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:40,399
different vegetation communities that

229
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,680
are associated with that so it's

230
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,680
important when we think about Landscapes

231
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,880
and we think about areas to either

232
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,600
restore or preserve it's important to

233
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,279
think about getting the whole complement

234
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,600
of these different kinds of habitat

235
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,399
types and in many cases there are plants

236
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,720
that are tightly associated with for

237
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,519
example the lowlands like the wetlands

238
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,200
uh and there are many other species of

239
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:01,519
animals wildlife that are associated

240
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,680
with each of these different micro

241
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:07,440
habitats so this 160 Acres on kalor

242
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,800
Prairie uh is especially important

243
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,560
because it has this diversity of

244
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,560
different habitat

245
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,839
types well first of our our farming

246
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,399
operation is a corn soybean operation so

247
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,360
it it has to be economically profitable

248
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,959
uh our whole family is

249
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,040
conservation-minded so that part is is

250
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:28,560
pretty pretty easy to work with the

251
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,480
family on um but it has to be

252
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,279
economically viable for our total

253
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,800
operation before we can do

254
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,959
them uh my parents were older and of

255
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,519
course uh participated in a lot of the

256
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,000
drainage of the farm and when we stop a

257
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,480
tile and and that type of thing it has

258
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,079
to be something that works with the

259
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,920
total picture of the farm that's kind of

260
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:51,480
how we look at it uh big picture-wise

261
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,240
we're actually in the De Moine River on

262
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,519
the that Watershed just a few miles

263
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,040
north of us we go into the Blue Earth

264
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,040
river system which goes north into the

265
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,800
Mississippi and uh through the Minnesota

266
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,480
River

267
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,399
so we're kind of on a tabletop there but

268
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,639
even our small Watershed we I don't know

269
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:06,920
that I want to eat the fish out of our

270
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:09,240
River when I when I see what comes down

271
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,200
it one of the concerns that I've had is

272
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,600
watching the scour erosion on this River

273
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,880
and watch the channel change and and uh

274
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,560
in my lifetime we've owned this

275
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:21,279
particular farm for 34

276
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:23,760
years uh there's been a terrific amount

277
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:27,639
of tile Upstream increase it's about a

278
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,480
30 m Watershed and uh the velocity and

279
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:31,639
the speed the water comes down to us now

280
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,160
is greatly enhanced so we're seeing more

281
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:35,200
scour erosion on the on the banks and

282
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,279
that's one of the things that I'd like

283
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,680
to see kind of slow down and it by

284
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:42,760
establishing the grasses on these Bank

285
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,040
edges is really really working in the

286
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,480
right direction in this immediate part

287
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,000
of the of the uh Great Plains the

288
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,720
northern Tallgrass per Eco region I

289
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,800
think that we are something like

290
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:00,560
97% uh privately owned this landscape is

291
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,639
97% privately owned and and something

292
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,920
like

293
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:08,880
85% engaged in cultivated

294
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:12,760
agriculture so any sort of public policy

295
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:16,160
that has intentions of improving water

296
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:20,000
quality or bird nesting success I think

297
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,560
has to has to include uh the land that

298
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,279
is privately

299
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,720
owned one of the most ambitious programs

300
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:29,680
that work here focuses on establishing

301
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,519
conservation practices on private land

302
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,600
the Minnesota conservation Reserve

303
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,839
enhancement program or Crap seeks to

304
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,360
place 100,000 acres of marginal cropland

305
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,760
in a conservation easement one of the

306
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,720
most significant issues that we've been

307
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,160
working on over the last several years

308
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,480
is is trying to clean up the Minnesota

309
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,680
River it's one of the most polluted

310
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:55,360
rivers in uh United States it's in a

311
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:58,480
primarily dominated agricultural

312
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,480
landscape it uh runs from the Western

313
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,320
edges of Minnesota actually into South

314
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,320
Dakota all the way into the uh

315
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,880
Minneapolis St Paul area where it joins

316
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,920
the Mississippi River it's one of the

317
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:13,240
principal it is the primary tributary to

318
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:15,480
the Mississippi River and it's sought to

319
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,720
be the number one pollutant to the

320
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:21,760
Mississippi River uh in the state of

321
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,600
Minnesota of course from Minnesota's uh

322
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,000
agricultural landscape the Minnesota

323
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,320
River probably is made up of all or

324
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,040
parts of 37 counties it's roughly a

325
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,839
watershed of 10 10 and a half million

326
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,680
acres of land in this particular River's

327
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,680
Watershed and roughly 10 million Acres

328
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,240
of that land is under intense

329
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,920
agricultural uh cropping so it's an

330
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,399
extremely intensified agricultural it

331
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:47,240
certainly includes probably uh the most

332
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,440
significant cropping areas in the state

333
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,480
of Minnesota are found in this this

334
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,880
particular Watershed certainly we can't

335
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,240
turn the clock back to prior to to

336
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,279
European settlement we know agriculture

337
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,120
is critical to the state of Minnesota is

338
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:02,519
trying to find that balance between

339
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,360
conservation and agriculture use and we

340
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,600
think crep has been a great great

341
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,320
selling tool for the state of Minnesota

342
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,920
uh particularly in trying to achieve

343
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:15,120
very significant benefits to the

344
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:17,399
Minnesota River Wetland Restorations are

345
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,560
the types of eligible crop lands that we

346
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:22,079
are trying to enroll in this program and

347
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,320
and the reason for that of course these

348
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,320
are the lands that uh if we can get them

349
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,120
out of crop production we can get a

350
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,320
conservation practice on those uh

351
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,399
parcels and protect our future resources

352
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,120
from uh you know reducing soil and water

353
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,600
erosion sedimentation nutrient loading

354
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,199
into the Minnesota River and also be

355
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,759
looking at improving and enhancing fish

356
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:46,360
and wildlife habitat you know one of the

357
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,680
reasons that we're here of course is

358
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,839
trying to enhance our Water Resources as

359
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,959
well as our Fish and Wildlife Resources

360
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,480
with within Minnesota and in order to do

361
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,680
that we have to look at trying to

362
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,800
improve and enhance the Watershed in the

363
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,040
Minnesota river which then subsequently

364
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,880
will benefit the Mississippi River and

365
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,920
on down the river down to the Gulf of

366
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,880
Mexico and and uh issues related to

367
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:14,199
hypoxia as an example at the mouth of

368
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:16,680
the Mississippi in the Gulf of Mexico

369
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:17,920
lies an area known as The Dead Zone or

370
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,079
the zone of

371
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,639
hypoxia here excess nutrient runoff and

372
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:26,959
pollution from up River have created an

373
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:29,639
oxygen deprived body of water no marine

374
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,839
life can exist here in improving water

375
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:34,680
quality in the Upper Midwest can help

376
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,279
alleviate The Dead

377
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,240
Zone additional connections extend

378
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,600
across the hemisphere Minnesota and Iowa

379
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,399
form critical links in a migratory chain

380
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,040
for countless bird species some of the

381
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:50,480
species Nest here some use the area to

382
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,040
reproduce others continue their journey

383
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,440
through here to the Arctic and then back

384
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,639
into South America when you look at this

385
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,000
landscape I think one of the key things

386
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:02,720
that are gained not only by the producer

387
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:06,440
but by myself being a taxpayer and all

388
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,000
the other taxpayers is the fact that um

389
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,160
this system that you see impacts people

390
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,399
further further down the river I always

391
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,759
think of the um my parents that live on

392
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,440
the Mississippi that's where I grew up

393
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:20,920
um this if I had more knowledge of this

394
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,279
at the time when I was growing up as a

395
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,560
kid I would understand better the

396
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:26,560
landscape but this thing has an impact

397
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,519
on that Mississippi River it has an

398
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,560
impact of uh further down when you get

399
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:34,959
to the G of Mexico removal of

400
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,959
nutrients um maintaining the flash flood

401
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,440
system that sponge effect the wildlife

402
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:43,720
habitat benefit on the migratory species

403
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:46,279
are all just a benefit to everybody in

404
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:50,519
the community as well as farther down

405
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:52,399
the Watershed Community for me um in my

406
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,399
present position as a wildlife biologist

407
00:16:52,399 --> 00:17:00,120
for

408
00:16:53,399 --> 00:17:03,519
nrcs uh all of this uh is uh connect it

409
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,280
uh from you know from the headwaters um

410
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,039
from the potholes the management of

411
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:11,319
Uplands uh through the uh flood plane uh

412
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,319
repairing systems to the coastal marshes

413
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:17,439
all of this is is connected so these

414
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,640
areas get used by a a wide assortment of

415
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,280
wildlife uh some of which stay around um

416
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,959
for extended periods and rear their

417
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,520
they're young either on the wetlands or

418
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:32,240
in adjacent areas others which uh only

419
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:36,200
occup these habitats very very uh

420
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,280
temporarily uh in route to uh breeding

421
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,679
areas uh

422
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:46,039
elsewhere uh this time of year you see

423
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:48,679
um use by uh transient Birds um that you

424
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:51,799
know may have bread up in the Arctic and

425
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:55,640
um such as Shorebirds and you know you

426
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:58,320
see the mud flats out here which uh uh

427
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,880
provide them access uh vegetation free

428
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,919
access to to feed on the invertebrates

429
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,000
that are in the in the shallow uh wat

430
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,080
which uh would allow them to complete

431
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,919
their migration down to the gulf uh and

432
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,320
eventually down down to South America

433
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,080
when we bought it it was all grassland

434
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,440
since then we've put the basins on it

435
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:22,240
that are that are here today gradually

436
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:26,159
over a period of time my wife Jean and I

437
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,919
are are very much interested in in uh in

438
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:30,880
Wetlands for a number of reasons for the

439
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,159
the wildlife of course comes with it

440
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,360
once you put the once you put the water

441
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:38,120
in the in the Wetland you have the the

442
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,720
the wild life following and the the

443
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,720
natural vegetation that comes along it

444
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,000
is extremely advantageous to to not only

445
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,559
the immediate neighbors but the the long

446
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,440
range Downstream neighbors are

447
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:53,559
benefiting from this too because of the

448
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:56,400
filtration effect of the uh of the

449
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:59,120
vegetation and the the mere existence of

450
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,400
the Wetland uh between here and

451
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,720
downstream at some point the prie

452
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:08,960
pothole region in the Upper Midwest in

453
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,400
Canada is the most productive area in

454
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,640
North America for producing waterfall

455
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:17,480
ducks and geese the birds that are going

456
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:20,640
to stay here locally for waterfall are

457
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:25,240
primarily malards blueing

458
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:28,159
teal U shovelers Gad walls many of the

459
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,520
uh other uh waterfall that migrate

460
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:32,679
through here

461
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,960
the uh buffalo head a lot of the diving

462
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:36,679
ducks

463
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,720
scalp canvas back redhe heads they'll go

464
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:43,799
farther north and and nest in in some of

465
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:46,679
those uh prey Wetlands farther north

466
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:49,360
Iowa has currently has some hot spots as

467
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:53,200
far as nitrate contribution to that

468
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:56,200
whole hypoxia problem and and uh part of

469
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,760
our uh solution to that problem is to be

470
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:02,360
able to position our wetland

471
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,840
Restorations within a wated or a large

472
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:08,080
landscape and position them to the point

473
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:11,960
where we get the maximum uh filtration

474
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:14,760
value out of our Wetlands uh Wetlands

475
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,760
placed in a watershed anywhere are good

476
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,240
but if we can strategically place those

477
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:22,440
wetlands in a position where they do the

478
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,840
greatest benefit um everybody comes out

479
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,400
ahead up here in the Upper Midwest one

480
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,679
of the big issues that's come up over

481
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,280
the last few years is the hypoxia issue

482
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,840
and that's mainly uh having to do with

483
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,080
nitrogen U extra nitrogen that's in the

484
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:38,120
system of the uh Minnesota River and in

485
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,640
the Mississippi of course they dumps

486
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,919
into the

487
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:45,600
Delta and anytime we can with our

488
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:47,760
buffers and with our filter strips up in

489
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,039
the Upper Midwest we definitely can have

490
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,159
an impact on removal of some of that

491
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:55,120
nitrogen before it becomes a problem in

492
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:58,960
our streams while I'm sitting in the

493
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,880
tractor cab planting on ridges or or

494
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,600
cultivating or

495
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:10,400
harvesting I often think of myself as

496
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:13,640
being uh just one farmer within a wated

497
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,640
or within a Flyway or within the

498
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:20,240
northern Tall Grass per Eco region and I

499
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:22,720
try to think of my role I I love of

500
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,240
course as all farmers do to think of big

501
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,600
yields it's just great fun to get big

502
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,960
yields and that is what really matters

503
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,720
to my success but I

504
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,880
also

505
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,880
uh get some sort of reward from feeling

506
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,279
that the birds that are making their way

507
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,760
from from in some cases golden Plover

508
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:46,080
they passed through usually while we're

509
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:48,320
planting corn and they I think that

510
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,279
they've been in

511
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:54,080
Argentina and I think that they're

512
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:58,600
headed for the very very

513
00:21:54,080 --> 00:22:01,159
northernmost parts of North America and

514
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:03,480
I think of their trip when I'm moving

515
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:05,640
really slowly across the field in in the

516
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,159
tractor and and I'm fascinated and I

517
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:13,840
want really want to do what I can to

518
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:16,880
make their trip as as easy as

519
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,679
possible I like the idea of of giving

520
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,200
the really delicate and fine-tuned

521
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,240
attention to what I'm doing on this Farm

522
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,360
to so that that so that that golden

523
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,320
Plover finds what it needs on its way

524
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:33,039
through but then I also want to be part

525
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:35,320
of a network of information and research

526
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,039
so that I can learn whether or not what

527
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,440
I'm doing is creating any sort of

528
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:42,360
advantage to the to the entire Flyway or

529
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,919
the entire Watershed I would like to

530
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:49,320
believe I would like to know that that

531
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:52,520
this Farm is not contributing to the

532
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,000
zone of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico

533
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,600
farming with the mind on the larger

534
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,320
ecological issues leads to new practices

535
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,360
on the land small changes and tillage

536
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,520
methods and timing can have a great

537
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:07,240
effect on the landscape's overall health

538
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:11,440
this Farm wouldn't be recognizable from

539
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:13,840
the road passing by as being different

540
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,000
in any way to an untrained eye from

541
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,720
other Farms but there are a number

542
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,240
of changes and practices that I've

543
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,240
implemented to try to create benefits

544
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,799
for water quality and Wildlife I've

545
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,080
manipulated and tweaked the cropping

546
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:33,679
system a little to try to make room for

547
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:38,480
bird nesting success small mammals and

548
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:40,799
and our greater diversity of of of Flora

549
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:45,000
and Fauna to exist while at the same

550
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,760
time hoping to achieve maximum yields

551
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,960
maximum economic

552
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:53,120
yields I'm really enjoying in my

553
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:55,840
professional life trying to design a

554
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,480
corn and soybean cropping system that

555
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:03,520
facilitates bird nesting success

556
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:06,679
we can use these implements to get 170

557
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:09,520
Bushell per acre corn yields while at

558
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:12,720
the same time leaving a 45-day no

559
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,559
re-entry interval in our cropping system

560
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,840
to allow ground nesting Birds to rear

561
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:20,559
Broods of young in our Ridge till

562
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,480
cropping system the practices of the

563
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:27,279
past of broadcast applications of

564
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,679
fertilizers and herbicides are almost a

565
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:34,880
part of the past we have applier

566
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:37,480
fertilizers in a band 7 in deep and in a

567
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,559
very stable form so that the fertilizer

568
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:44,080
that we apply is used by the crops that

569
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:48,679
we grow and doesn't end up as pollution

570
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:52,880
in in uh surface water flow leaving the

571
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:57,399
farm we apply our nitrogen our our

572
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,360
nitrogen fertilizer at at uh uh the

573
00:24:57,399 --> 00:25:02,000
point in time when the corn needs it the

574
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,799
most with with this rrop cultivator we

575
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,080
just make a few littleit uh

576
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:10,640
modifications to it and we band our

577
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:14,960
fertilizer in typically in late May and

578
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:17,080
we do nitrate nitrogen soil testing

579
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,320
before making our fertilizer

580
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:22,080
recommendations so that we are pretty

581
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,000
assured that we're not applying more

582
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:28,840
than we need and that combined with the

583
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,640
leaving the the fields un un tilled in

584
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:35,120
the fall and hopefully including the the

585
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,559
understory crops we're really hoping to

586
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,200
keep all of our our fertilizers right

587
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:44,120
here on the farm since we've changed

588
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:48,399
cropping systems and since the arrival

589
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:52,360
of some new technologies that allow for

590
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:54,480
the that allow us to leave this large uh

591
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,360
no re-entry interval in our cropping

592
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:01,559
system it allow us to

593
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:03,559
leave un touched uh uh residue corn corn

594
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:06,520
and bean stocks through the winter where

595
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:09,760
we're finding that Upland sandpipers

596
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:13,600
regularly nest and rear Broods right in

597
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:15,640
our crop fields and I find this really

598
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,360
really exciting and really

599
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,480
rewarding other rewards come when agency

600
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:22,799
managers link up concerned producers

601
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,080
with appropriate government programs

602
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,840
such as the Wetland Reserve program and

603
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:29,919
the Minnesota KB when land is set aside

604
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,159
through these programs the ecologic

605
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,000
function may be managed using some basic

606
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,440
conservation strategies by restoring or

607
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,600
preserving prairies and wetlands and by

608
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,039
establishing riparian buffers or filter

609
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,559
strips one of the things that we're

610
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,000
trying to think about when we look at

611
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,919
these prairies is how in a fragmented

612
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,760
landscape how can we reconnect the

613
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:51,120
pieces how can we uh make this a better

614
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,240
landscape for the species that we're

615
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,360
trying to preserve in the Prairies and

616
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,760
one way of doing that could potentially

617
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,120
be uh by adding reconstructed prairies

618
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:03,760
another way of uh putting this landscape

619
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,679
back together could be by creating

620
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,880
buffer systems that would connect these

621
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,559
prairies the site that we're looking at

622
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:13,480
here now is a is a glacial glacial

623
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,880
Remnant uh this is a a prairie that was

624
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,600
U never been had never been cropped in

625
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,159
this case this land owner hadn't done

626
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,840
anything to the land and so we're able

627
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,240
to come in do some burning on it uh we

628
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,240
broke the tile lines uh The Nature

629
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,640
Conservancy actually owns the fee title

630
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,559
on this now and we have the the easement

631
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,200
permanent easement on it and so we're in

632
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:36,520
a process of um of restoring the

633
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,120
ecosystem for this particular site as

634
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,519
far as connectivity goes of this site

635
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,880
with other sites if we're talking about

636
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:46,080
a larger area we address it here in Iowa

637
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,679
a couple of different ways in specific

638
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,880
programs like the wetlands Reserve

639
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,880
program and those and related easement

640
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:56,200
programs we add extra points in for

641
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,200
sites that are that are in proximity uh

642
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,240
either they get the most points of their

643
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,320
touching an application is touching an

644
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,320
established site like this or it's

645
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,360
within a mile or two miles those types

646
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,720
of things and we try to bring try to

647
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,480
bring those groups of easements together

648
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,519
because we can get a a more valuable

649
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:15,919
package for for wildlife and for water

650
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,679
quality and all those types of things if

651
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,840
there is a segment and it's all in one

652
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,720
land we would try to try to get a a

653
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,519
buffer strip between this site for

654
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,120
example and a and another one that's

655
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,279
maybe a quarter mile away we would try

656
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,720
to try to get that person in maybe in a

657
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,399
CRP buffer strip and plant that down to

658
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,480
Native grasses and Forbes and so it

659
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:36,360
becomes this this uh passageway this

660
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,039
buffer between this site and another

661
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,360
site maybe there's another land owner

662
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:41,840
that has a has a representative site too

663
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,600
and and try to connect them all together

664
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,440
so becomes a very connective ecosystem

665
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,840
although it's segmented in smaller

666
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,440
pieces than what it was naturally these

667
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,399
alleys that are wide enough so that

668
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,760
they're just not a carnivore trap but so

669
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:58,760
that their their their uh Wildlife can

670
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:02,240
actually uh can actually produce in

671
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:04,760
there and can actually U pass through

672
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:09,000
and safely uh we would try to get those

673
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:13,760
done to have a have a good um connected

674
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,919
um Wildlife Area the way we see Wetlands

675
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,600
at the planning phase and all the way

676
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,720
through it is that they're just one of

677
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,399
the opportunities that we can use to get

678
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,679
conservation on the land early on when

679
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:28,640
we do our preliminary planning for these

680
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,159
projects we rank them for water quality

681
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,159
for restorability for cost of

682
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:38,080
restoration and in this case U this

683
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:41,480
Wetland set in a position where it

684
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:45,640
created a string of wetlands U over 30

685
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:48,640
mil long where it fit into that chain

686
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,840
and U created a situation where you

687
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,919
cannot drive more than two miles in this

688
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,600
chain North and South in the potholes

689
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:58,880
without uh coming upon another restored

690
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:01,120
Wetland or a or a prairie system

691
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,519
so we use that as the ranking we

692
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:06,399
emphasize that and we also emphasize the

693
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:09,279
fact that that we took Approximately 80%

694
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,320
of the drainage area in this particular

695
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:15,080
area and filtered it through this

696
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:17,440
Wetland so it had some big water quality

697
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,120
benefits these conservation buffers that

698
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,760
we have out here today the riparian

699
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,840
forest buffers that are planted uh here

700
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,679
in the river bottoms of in the flood

701
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:30,679
zone areas and we're hopefully creating

702
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,080
a practice here that will be absorbing

703
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:34,960
nutrients that are moving underground in

704
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:36,720
in the crop Fields here where we pick up

705
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,559
a lot of nitrates that are picked up off

706
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,480
the corn fields and and come through the

707
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:44,279
underground streams we're also creating

708
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:48,240
a lot of wildlife habitat down here and

709
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:50,159
these are very fast growing species and

710
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,320
and we're going to create some habitat

711
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,559
that uh for the

712
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,600
Wildlife the forest buffered uh trees

713
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:00,639
are going to be creating shade habitat

714
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,760
over the stream for the Fisheries here

715
00:31:00,639 --> 00:31:04,760
in in the southwest Minnesota Tall Grass

716
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,639
Prairie particularly uh for instance the

717
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:09,480
northern pike which is considered to be

718
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:11,480
a lake species in a lot of cases in most

719
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,679
cases in Minnesota but they are known to

720
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:16,159
migrate up in these streams at certain

721
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,840
times of the year uh anytime you can

722
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,279
create your Banks a little bit more

723
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,200
stable but also create some shade over

724
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:25,000
in pockets and pools you just create a

725
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,279
little bit more uh fish fish habitat for

726
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,159
those migratory species where we're

727
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:31,440
located here with this riparian Forest

728
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:33,240
buffer is situated at the bottom of a

729
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,960
landscape that's kind of steep for years

730
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,519
it had had been tilled some uh it's

731
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,760
protecting what used to be a feed lot up

732
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:42,840
there that's uh could have had runoff

733
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:45,399
coming through we're protecting that you

734
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,360
got a corn crop that's being raised down

735
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:49,320
here and of course in this part of the

736
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,559
country it takes a lot of nutrients

737
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,880
particularly nitrogen to raise that crop

738
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:56,000
of corn and and and with the intense

739
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,200
rainstorms we get we get can get some

740
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,559
leeching down into the roots zone so uh

741
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,320
that's going to be moving towards the

742
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,080
stream which is only a couple hundred

743
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,880
feet away and so anytime we can absorb

744
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:09,080
any of that nutrients through a crop

745
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,880
like the crop of grass that's located in

746
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:13,600
in the buffer here it's going to be

747
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,799
absorbing that out and taking that out

748
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,679
of the

749
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,679
system land owners and land managers in

750
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,639
the Upper Midwest are faced with

751
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,039
challenges both social and economic in

752
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:27,159
addition the byproducts of an otherwise

753
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,360
successful farming operation are

754
00:32:27,159 --> 00:32:31,840
threatening the ology of the entire

755
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,240
Basin through appropriate conservation

756
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,200
and farming practices however some

757
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,600
solutions are being applied to this

758
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,039
complex problem as nrcs employees we

759
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,679
don't make the decisions for the

760
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:47,679
landowner our responsibility is to

761
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:49,919
provide to that landowner Alternatives

762
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,200
resource alternatives for for those

763
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,919
acres and then if there's programs

764
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,840
available whether it's USDA programs

765
00:32:54,919 --> 00:32:59,919
whether it's uh um interior programs or

766
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,440
or local uh Soil and Water Conservation

767
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:05,200
District programs uh those types of

768
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:08,720
things lay those programs out so land

769
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,720
owners can can fit the the right

770
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,960
decisions with a program to help them

771
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,760
Implement those those decisions but as

772
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,320
far as us making decisions we don't we

773
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,720
provide alternatives to the land owner

774
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,679
land owners that make the decision when

775
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,799
you look at conservation planning on

776
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:28,880
this site you may come out and see your

777
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:32,120
eyes may focus on a basin per se but

778
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:35,760
when you can look beyond the Basin and

779
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:39,480
into the perspective of what the system

780
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,880
is requiring do we need a filter system

781
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:45,720
to help keep sediment and nutrient load

782
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:49,000
out of uh water flow can we do that not

783
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,799
only with one landowner but with several

784
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,360
and when you look at uh a basin per se

785
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:55,399
like this the question would be is what

786
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,399
is on the other side of the fence what's

787
00:33:55,399 --> 00:34:00,399
on the other side of the hill and how

788
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:02,840
does it connect with one another and can

789
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,840
you as a conservation planner make that

790
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:09,240
connection happen by providing um

791
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:11,599
information assistance opportunities for

792
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,280
land owners to get together and complete

793
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,879
conservation practices that not only

794
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,919
function on their land but also work

795
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:21,159
within the entire system as we work with

796
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:23,159
one landowner then that information can

797
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:26,079
go to another land owner as we work in a

798
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:28,399
neighborhood in a in a group setting and

799
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,040
and collectively then these these good

800
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:34,240
decisions result in the resulting in

801
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:38,000
multiple Acres large blocks of Acres

802
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,000
being treated properly

803
00:34:42,870 --> 00:35:01,609
