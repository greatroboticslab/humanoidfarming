1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,440
what we have here is an area that's

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:17,400
that's representative of the the higher

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,480
areas of the fields the areas that were

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,119
that were well drained so this probably

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,880
represents 50 to 60% of the

6
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,920
field the the drainage was good the

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,920
access to oxygen for the developing seed

8
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,440
has been good it's germinated quickly

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,719
and strongly it's got uh a green shoot

10
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,640
very quickly and its third Leaf is

11
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:43,239
already appearing this is

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:46,000
uh wet direct seeding as it should be

13
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:49,000
done these plants are

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,320
happy now what we have here is an area

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,239
that's representative of uh the

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,719
intermediate Zone shall I say when we

17
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,520
seated it was too wet it was a little

18
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,039
bit too wet and gradually during the

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,600
week it gradually dried out but it was

20
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,280
still wetter than we'd like it to be and

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,840
you can see the seedlings are much

22
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:09,479
smaller they've had to fight for

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,200
survival for much of the week but they

24
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,759
are establishing and they'll be okay

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,040
even though they're slow The

26
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:19,920
Establishment density is lower but

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:24,200
overall it's an acceptable

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,439
result so the seedlings were

29
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,960
unhappy but now they're

30
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:32,399
okay what we have here is an area

31
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,280
representative are of complete

32
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:39,079
failure the area areas like this maybe

33
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,600
five somewhere between 5 and 10% of the

34
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:44,119
field stayed wet all week they've only

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,560
just become

36
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,640
dry uh that was too long for the rice

37
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,560
plants so here we have an area that's

38
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,280
completely devoid of rice seedlings all

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,280
the rice seeds have

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,680
died so what we have is an even field a

41
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,799
non-uniform field the drier areas have

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,239
grown really well the intermediate areas

43
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,280
have grown okay they'll be okay but the

44
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,080
wetter

45
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,920
areas uh have been complete failures so

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,120
5 to 10% of the field we're going to

47
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,160
recede to give it that second chance

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,959
true uh being seed almost a week later

49
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,120
will mean it matures a little later but

50
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,319
rice does have a habit of catching up by

51
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,200
the time you get to flowering and

52
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,120
harvest so I'm not that concerned

53
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,440
I think in hindsight we were seduced by

54
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:37,480
technology we looked to the laser

55
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,000
leveling laser guided laser equipment

56
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,000
when in hindsight I think the small

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,360
equipment the the equipment invented

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,560
here in the Philippines would have given

59
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,840
us a More Level field so um don't always

60
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:53,480
assume the high-tech path is the most

61
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,400
effective one so we're recating small

62
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,159
areas just the wetter areas the the

63
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,840
drier areas where the rice is okay that

64
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:03,040
soil is now too dry it won't seed

65
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,920
successfully the rice Roots won't

66
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,720
penetrate the soil so there's no point

67
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,159
putting seed there anyway we're focusing

68
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,480
purely on those small very wet areas

69
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:13,480
with no rice in them at all
