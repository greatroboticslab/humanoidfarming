2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,719
one of my favorite plants to complement

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,519
the gardener Peppers peppers come in

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,799
lots of different shapes and sizes they

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:16,480
certainly come in lots of flavors and

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,400
there should be a pepper that just about

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,480
anyone can use and like Peppers do well

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,720
in a high organic matter soil and they

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,199
love full sun they have to be planted

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,880
after the last frost but they do survive

11
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,439
pretty well in cooler weather and then

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,199
when they really start growing is when

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,840
it really gets warmed up they tolerate

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,000
heat better than almost all of our

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,640
garden vegetables they like warm

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,399
temperatures enough that they do really

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,559
well in in hoop houses green houses and

18
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:42,559
that type of situation where we're

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,120
adding heat there's hot peppers there's

20
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,680
mild Peppers you can eat them like an

21
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,559
apple and then there's some that boy you

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,120
don't want to eat plain peppers are

23
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:51,039
wonderful to use in your garden to

24
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,039
complement your other vegetables they

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,160
grow really well and they do well in

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,199
most Gardens they have all types of uses

27
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,879
in the kitchen you can take the hot

28
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,359
peppers the smaller peppers and just pop

29
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,960
them in a Ziploc bag put them in the

30
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,799
freezer you've got them all all winter

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,320
long to use the bigger sweet peppers we

32
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,439
can dice them up put them in an old

33
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,920
style ice cube tray with water freeze

34
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,600
them and then pop them in a Ziploc bag

35
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,680
anytime you're going to make fresh salsa

36
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,080
or soups just take them out and put them

37
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,439
in what you want to use of course the

38
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,840
best way to eat a pepper is to eat the

39
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,280
sweet ones like an apple All Summer Long

40
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,759
warm off the vine this is Hudson Hill

41
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,880
with the University of voling extension

42
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,880
you're watching from the ground

43
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,909
up
