determined that water has always been a

matter of fundamental importance for the

been common concerns throughout history

therefore it is not strange that there

19
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,900
has always been a great interest in

is evident today due to water pollution

a geographical space like the Canary

34
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,020

change the landscape of the islands

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,259
Islands were forced to put in practice

different strategies to circumvent

all this has been a long journey

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,420
which has gone from the use of water

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,280
that ran along the surface
