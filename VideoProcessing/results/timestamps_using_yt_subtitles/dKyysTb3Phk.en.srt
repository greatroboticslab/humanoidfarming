2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,000
initially

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,559
people thought that disability is a

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,920
curse but i have changed the

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,920
perception of the community

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,160
and now they're accepting that

7
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,160
examinations

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,880
are our only few challenge work instead

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,080
i know i work differently so i do my

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,160
things differently

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,160
but i am a person like any other person

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,399
my dad used to tell me to do farming but

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,360
i was not interested i thought it was

14
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,480
very dirty

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,719
that's why i did i.t so i wanted to do

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,879
anything to do technology and computers

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,559
behind the desktop and studying other

18
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,840
things

19
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,719
now my it background assists me a lot

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,760
because i learn

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,640
online i market my produce

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,239
technology has come to change what my

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,400
dad used to do

24
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,479
and i can change family water whatever

25
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,799
i'm doing here i can sell it online

26
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:09,520
instead of now taking my vegetables to

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,600
the market

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,280
they are collected from home you get

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,400
your money quietly

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,280
with no disturbance and

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,119
you can go somewhere with a girl the

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,479
purpose you know that's why you find me

33
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,880
having these pigs

34
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,680
feeding them like my babies you know you

35
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,920
must love

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,880
whatever you do once you change the

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,560
mindset and

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,240
and you know you love whatever you're

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,240
doing you achieve a lot

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,560
young people believe that naropa is the

41
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,759
only place where you can

42
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,720
make money or you can get employed i

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,280
take advantage of being next to nairobi

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,479
because

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,040
most people in nairobi feed from here

46
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,280
that was also another reason why i

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,520
tended to do family

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,320
for the youth now they should also know

49
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,880
that

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,280
ugly business is also an employment if

51
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,920
you exist where we're in agribusiness

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,479
you can get as much as you would wish to

53
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,880
get

54
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,620
so you should come over and join me

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:20,409
during farming
