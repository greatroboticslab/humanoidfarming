2
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,280
hello ladies from thailand today today's

3
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,200
video is going to be an unboxing

4
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,879
unboxing of a couple of solar-powered

5
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,280
devices

6
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,120
i'm convinced that solar power is the

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,960
way to go now i've tried a few things

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,239
with regard to solar

9
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,480
and i think that the small items are

10
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,120
probably the way to go so today i'm

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,440
gonna unbox two items that i think it'll

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,440
be very useful in the future

13
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,159
and the first one is let's have a look

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,479
i ordered these from lazada and they

15
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,880
came today very very fast

16
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,000
only three days for delivery

17
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,920
now

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,680
i've already done a few

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,680
solar things i've got solar-powered

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,200
light flood lights

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,920
around the house

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,000
and they'll last for 10 or 12 hours i'm

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,560
very very impressed for the price of

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,560
what they are

25
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,799
and this

26
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,799
is

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,400
obviously a solar panel

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,119
and a light fitting

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,799
comes with the remote control as well

30
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,620
[Applause]

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,159
so this is the light fitting

32
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,280
that i've got and the reason why i

33
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,000
bought this

34
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,000
is because

35
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,000
you can easily change the batteries in

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,360
these now there's pictures here of the

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,799
flood lights that i've put around the

38
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,479
house they're a little bit more

39
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,840
difficult to change the batteries once

40
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,680
they need to be

41
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,520
changed because eventually the batteries

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,720
will stop recharging and you need to

43
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,080
replace them

44
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,800
so i'm going to do

45
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,040
a breakdown of this and see what how it

46
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,560
works and how it fits together

47
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,440
and um

48
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,480
i think you'll be impressed

49
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,200
and the battery is already in there so

50
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,200
we'll have a lot

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,280
for being able to replace the battery

52
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,519
once it's it's worn out and it's past

53
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,519
its usefulness

54
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,760
[Applause]

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,360
i was hitting safety in there so

56
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,920
as far as being able to get access to

57
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,159
the battery and replace it

58
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,080
it's also simple very very simple for

59
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,959
diy installation and that's all i'm

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,560
dealing with is diy installation and

61
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,680
those people that can actually do it

62
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,920
themselves

63
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,120
so i'll put it back together now and

64
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,519
we'll

65
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,120
see it when it's working

66
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,560
two screws that's all it takes to be

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,560
able to put it back together again

68
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,560
plastic housing so waterproof and a

69
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,360
remote control

70
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,360
which

71
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,000
helps everything along

72
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,640
so i'm sort of impressed it's

73
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,760
it's a cheap light fitting

74
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,480
but we'll get some ideas to how good it

75
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,319
is

76
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,560
once we plug it in

77
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,640
so

78
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,200
the solar panel

79
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,640
which charges it up

80
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,120
well again

81
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,360
i intend to extend

82
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,360
the

83
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,400
sort of paddle lead because it's never

84
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,400
long enough to be able to

85
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,120
to put it where you need to put it to be

86
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,080
able to put the light up

87
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,519
and

88
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,920
i'm going to use these lights for

89
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,280
outside that's what i'm intending to use

90
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,920
them for so

91
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,239
we'll be able to put these onto the roof

92
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,599
or in some position where

93
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,000
it will

94
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,000
be able to charge everything up so the

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,919
lead really isn't that long maybe it's a

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,959
couple of meters long so what we're

97
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,800
going to do

98
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,720
i'm going to put it in the sun

99
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,000
for now

100
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,080
and then

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,960
see how it charges up and see how good

102
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,960
it charges it up

103
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,040
because as it comes now it's probably

104
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,040
uncharged

105
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,919
so let's put this in the sun and see

106
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,919
what we can do with it

107
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,240
so let's put the light in this sun

108
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,160
see if we can get it charged up

109
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,600
so

110
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,600
hopefully that should charge that up

111
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,199
okay that's the first one

112
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,160
unboxing done of what it is

113
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,160
the light fit in

114
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,759
some batteries some screws some raw

115
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,360
plugs

116
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,320
i say we'll deal with that when we come

117
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,320
to fit it up

118
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,360
i don't really know where i'm gonna put

119
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,680
it yet but

120
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,880
it will go somewhere

121
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,560
and the second thing that i've got

122
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,320
um now we use this particular item all

123
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,160
the time in the house

124
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,680
we have air conditioning but my wife

125
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,479
doesn't like air conditioning so i

126
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,479
let bought show you

127
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,919
in the box well packed

128
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,360
and

129
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,360
so let's see what we've got

130
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,960
it is a

131
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,479
[Applause]

132
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,479
solar powered

133
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,800
fan

134
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,639
as i said this comes with

135
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,800
it's a 16 inch

136
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,080
fan which is what this the same size

137
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,319
that we use already but electric

138
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,319
and

139
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,560
the idea is with this is to see how

140
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,520
much the battery lasts for for

141
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,039
because we use the fan nearly all day

142
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,840
and we certainly use the fan on the

143
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,520
nighttime in the bedroom

144
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,840
so we're going to see

145
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,440
how long it lasts for even if we just be

146
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,600
able to use it during the day it's some

147
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,919
sort of saving of electricity

148
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,120
now that's the size of the panel

149
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,039
to charge the battery that comes with it

150
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,919
now i'll leave some prices as to what i

151
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,759
paid

152
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,520
for these towards the end of the video

153
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,599
so you can see exactly how much i

154
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,639
appeared for these things

155
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:57,639
and there's a 16 inch

156
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,639
fan

157
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,759
so here we go we're going to put it all

158
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,599
together

159
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,960
now the idea is this is because i like

160
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,319
playing around with the electrics and

161
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,680
things like that

162
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,520
is that

163
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,040
if this

164
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,280
sort of

165
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,440
[Music]

166
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,360
brakes with the with the

167
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,800
i don't expect it to last very long

168
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,639
because it wasn't expensive

169
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,440
but the idea is

170
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,840
if the controls break

171
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,319
we

172
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,400
have 12 volt fan which can be controlled

173
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,800
by the solar panels i've got now i've

174
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,080
got some bigger solar panels

175
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,080
now

176
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,840
for those people who watched my programs

177
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,120
before with regard to solar i had an

178
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,280
inverter which was

179
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,120
linked up to the to the grid system but

180
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,080
unfortunately the gardener came around

181
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,639
one day

182
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,879
and the pebble dashed the

183
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,560
the panel and and smashed all the glass

184
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,120
on top of the solar panel

185
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,919
and also there was a lightning storm and

186
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,720
i think that blew up the diodes within

187
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,080
the

188
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,479
inverter

189
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,479
so it wasn't worth replacing the

190
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,440
inverter but i'm still a fan of solar

191
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,800
panels and solar power is why i bought

192
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,080
this because i want to see if this gives

193
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,080
a return

194
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,400
a quicker return than

195
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,680
buying another solar panel and inverter

196
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,530
so i'm going to put all this lot

197
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:44,220
together

198
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:44,540
[Music]

199
00:08:44,220 --> 00:09:23,669
[Applause]

200
00:08:44,540 --> 00:09:23,669
[Music]

201
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,880
so let's go and plug it in and see what

202
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,880
it does

203
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,560
see if we can get it charged up

204
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,240
so again just got a phone charger

205
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,240
dc

206
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,240
charger

207
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,880
so let's go and see what it does

208
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,360
and let's do the same with

209
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,360
the fan

210
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,440
put that in the sun and let's see if we

211
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,440
can

212
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,560
charge later's working

213
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,399
it's working

214
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,320
from the sun

215
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,079
it's been a week now since i bought this

216
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,480
this solar panel

217
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,560
and light fitting and what do i think of

218
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,839
it

219
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,760
if you watch this video here you'll

220
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,839
actually see how easy it was to fit to

221
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,399
the roof without actually not fussing in

222
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,320
it to the the tiles on the roof

223
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,279
it's easy to do took less than 10

224
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,000
minutes to do and the results

225
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,320
i'm not overly impressed now this light

226
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,640
here only lasts for babies eight hours

227
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,600
when it's fully charged up as these ones

228
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,200
here last for the full 12 hours or so it

229
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,720
might have something to do with the size

230
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,480
of the battery i don't really know but

231
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,480
they give an impressive light out for

232
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,640
the eight hours that the

233
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,800
that they're lit for but

234
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,959
i'd want them to be up for 10 or 12

235
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,040
hours it gets dark here in thailand

236
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,480
about six o'clock in the evening and it

237
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,480
gets late again six o'clock in the

238
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,399
morning so they need to be on for at

239
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,760
least 12 hours for my

240
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,480
um

241
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,480
likability of it but eight hours it's

242
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,600
better than nothing at all isn't it i

243
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,800
suppose and it's free so eight hours

244
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,720
it's not too bad for the price uh 450

245
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,760
baht i think there were so less than 10

246
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,320
pounds

247
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,519
and it's free once it done so it's not

248
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,600
too bad

249
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,880
so what about this the fan the solar

250
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,880
panel fan

251
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,200
now again if you look at the box here it

252
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,720
says three hours on fast speed um now

253
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,399
again i've had it a week and i've had

254
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,399
the solar panel going out in the

255
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,720
sunshine for

256
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,880
all day and it's fully charged up with

257
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,920
the solar panel the best i can get out

258
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,880
of it is two hours i can get three hours

259
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,959
if the solar panel is in the sun

260
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,880
whilst it's being operated during the

261
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,279
day so with the battery and the solar

262
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,040
panel you can get three hours but it

263
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,680
doesn't say that the instructions are

264
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,760
any of the literature that comes with it

265
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,200
so again a little bit disappointing on

266
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,399
the evening time that's what we're going

267
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,040
to use it for

268
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,720
two hours at the very very most and

269
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,360
again on the box it says up to eight

270
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,560
hours on on slow speed

271
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,639
now

272
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,000
impossible doesn't give you the full

273
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,519
eight hours so

274
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,360
again a little bit disappointing with

275
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,200
that but for a thousand or just over a

276
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,800
thousand baht what could you expect

277
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,720
maybe as if i put a little bit bigger

278
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,120
battery in it but i've got other ideas

279
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,360
out how i can adapt this fan so it can

280
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,399
be used with my bigger solar panels but

281
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,639
this is all

282
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,240
in the future with regard to solar

283
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:58,800
panels i'm a big fan of solar power and

284
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:01,200
i will make the solar power work in this

285
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,880
house whilst i'm here so from this

286
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,880
retired and living the dream in thailand

287
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,880
until the next video bye for now
