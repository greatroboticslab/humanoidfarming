1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:04,730
this sample query shows how to select

2
00:00:02,989 --> 00:00:06,980
different time windows for different

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:09,440
layers okay so in this specific example

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:12,200
we're going to look at agricultural data

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,710
for the Midwestern u.s. specifically

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:18,230
we're going to compare the crop planting

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,240
information together with some weather

8
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:23,930
information okay so let's get started

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:29,600
initially we create a new query we

10
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:31,850
select from survey right here the 250

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,989
meter resolution crop planting map so

12
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:36,500
this from the US Department of

13
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:39,350
Agriculture and from the weather

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:44,149
category we select prison historical

15
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:50,809
data and let's pick the daily maximum

16
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:53,300
temperature for example okay so now when

17
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:55,930
it comes to where the prison data is

18
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,160
only available for the continental US

19
00:00:55,930 --> 00:01:00,800
therefore you see here the contiguous US

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,219
has been highlighted already for us now

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,340
we can zoom in maybe a bit

22
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:09,990
and select a rectangle somewhere here in

23
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,990
the Midwest like this

24
00:01:10,909 --> 00:01:16,219
to the where we take this option off we

25
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:17,810
can see now we can allow to choose

26
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:20,299
different time windows for these layers

27
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,780
okay so for the crop type that simply

28
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:25,579
pick January 1st 2017 and for the

29
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:30,560
maximum temperature let's pick something

30
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:34,219
like June 2017 okay so the idea would be

31
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,569
roughly speaking that from the crop type

32
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,579
one knows what has been planted there

33
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:39,319
and then one might won't be interested

34
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:43,219
in the temperature to see you know all

35
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:44,780
these crops could possibly elope so

36
00:01:43,219 --> 00:01:47,709
let's pick next we don't do any

37
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,709
aggregation for this

38
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:58,520
give this name and submit it so this is

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,350
very straightforward to give an idea

40
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:02,420
what the result looks like we ran this

41
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,939
query previously so let's click on this

42
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:07,270
here

43
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:08,649
see indeed we have the crop layer note

44
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,230
that the crop type is categorically

45
00:02:08,649 --> 00:02:12,760
encoded the codes pretty much correspond

46
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:15,640
to these numbers you see with this color

47
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,680
scheme they're gonna say no point you

48
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:22,989
can basically see the value here and

49
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,840
these numerical codes are consistent

50
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:27,760
with USDA codes okay so similarly we

51
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,069
could of course select our temperature

52
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,220
which we have you know picked here and

53
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:35,950
again is like now click on a single

54
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,870
point we also get the complete time

55
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:41,670
series at this point at the same time

56
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:43,690
you can launch an animation for this and

57
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:47,880
see how the temperature devolve

58
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,880
de-evolve during the month of June
