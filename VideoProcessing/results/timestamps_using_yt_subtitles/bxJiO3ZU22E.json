  "text": "[Music] winter brings its challenges for horse owners from freezing temperatures to managing icy conditions whether you're new to horse care or looking for a refresher I'll walk you through the best practices for keeping your horse safe warm and healthy this season so let's dive in so let's start with blanketing Basics blanketing can feel overwhelming but it doesn't have to be horses naturally grow with thick winter coat that acts as an insulator by trapping air but some horses may need extra help so here's what you need to consider when to blanket if your horse is clipped underweight elderly or struggles to maintain body heat blanketing is a must but if they're healthy well fed and grow a full winter coat they probably don't need one choosing the right blanket there are three main M types lightweight sheets for mild cold medium weight for jelly weather and heavyweight blankets for frigid temperatures proper fit ensure the blanket doesn't rub or restrict movement it should sit snugly but not tight around the chest and belly always check straps daily to avoid dangerous snags and the other things you need to check every day sometimes multiple times a day whether you know temperature changes was it really cold in the morning and so you had the sheet and then a heavy winter blanket on and then a turnout rug and now your horse is outside and it's 45\u00b0 like you you need to be able to monitor these things and make the blanket switches when need be because not being able to do that not monitoring every couple of hours you you could you know create conditions uh for your horse that are not good you know like sores uh excessive sweating and then it gets cooler later on now they're sweaty and wet and then it cools down and now they're freezing so there's so many things you have to consider when it comes to blanketing I'm lucky Dakota grows a polar bar coat in the winter time what I do for him is I Curry him almost daily I will curry him to make sure that there's no hair sticking together that it's standing up and so that you know when it's really frigid cold and windy he just turns his butt to the to the wind and continues to munch on his hay now we're going to jump into managing frozen water oh boy not fun one of the worst parts of winter in in my humble opinion but access to Fresh unfrozen water is a non-negotiable for horses even in the dead of winter dehydration is a silent threat and definitely can increase the risk of cic so here's some tips to manage water during freezing temperatures invest in heated water options heated buckets and trough deicers are like saers make sure they're properly grounded to prevent shocks I don't use them inside the barn of course Dakota would only come into the barn if it was terribly horrible horrible out meaning like sleet and combined with the frigid temperatures um what or or if he weren't feeling well then he would come into the barn but I would use an insulated bucket before I would use one of those heated flat-sided buckets buets because they're dangerous and many of barn fire have occurred because of those those buckets so I don't use heated buckets in the barn however I have invested in the big they look like muck buckets but they're heated um those work really well consistently I've had a lot of issues with the drop in heaters not being grounded properly and and the problem guys is within the heater itself you can have everything set up properly grounding rods Outlets that are grounded the whole nine yards but you could have a faulty heater my suggestion to you is to wherever it is that you're purchasing go to a a you know store like Tractor Supply or whatever I'm not promoting any one of those but go there in person bring a voltage meter with you and right in front of the cashier before you pay for that check it many of them are being bought and they're defective and they're shocking your horses once you shock your horse when they're trying to get a drink of water then you really increase the risk of dehydration and impaction colic because they're going to be terrified to drink from that bucket again okay so again I have found those big not big troughs but they look they're the size of a muck bucket um that are heated have worked consistently the best haven't found any shock issues and again but make sure that your Outlets are grounded and you got to check them you know how you check them barefooted and you stick your hand in there yep rather you than a $10,000 $20,000 colic surgery right okay here's some DIY hacks for icef free water if heated options are not feasible try insulating your buckets with foam or wrapping them with a heat retaining cover I've seen people build like a box for a stock tank and then putting a layer a thick layer of straw under the stock tank and around it and setting the stock tank in there that will help insulate it get it off the [Music] ground oh add a floating ball that can help delay freezing the other thing we used to do was we had um big aquarium bubblers that we put in our in our troughs and those worked really well kind of like Pond bubblers right you ever see they do that for the Wildlife on backyard big ponds and they have this you know they have a fountain or they've got bubblers going works you got to make frequent ice checks guys you got to break and remove the ice multiple times a day if necessary just make sure you always have a rubber Mallet or a crowbar to help make it a little easier and you want to encourage hydration so you might have to add some electrolytes or a small handful of salt to your horse's feed to encourage drinking I do give Dakota Himalayan salt in each one of you know twice a day just a little but enough and they they they drink adequate amounts you can soak your hay or warm the water slightly which helps too too can also help during cold snaps now what I love about those heaters I mentioned the ones that we use outside the heated muck buckets is what they look like is they do keep the water at a really comfortable temperature so it does encourage a lot more uh ingestion of water hydration is just as crucial in Winter as in summer so you need to keep a close eye on your horse's water intake okay if you have multiple people like we do that are rotating bar chores and feedings we always before we leave we inform everybody else that this is how much water was ingested like it was down to a quarter of a bucket or trough I topped it off on and on and on and on and on so we keep each other in the loop about forage intake feed intake and especially water intake all right speaking of food we need to touch on feeding for warmth because horses are natural foragers and digestion generates heat making proper feeding a Cornerstone of winter care is imperative so here's what we need to focus on forage forage forage on cold days you got to give your horses extra hay it's their main heat source and it keeps their digestive system working properly obviously you're going to monitor body condition you need to check your horse's weight regularly so that's where like having your horse under a blanket all the time and if you're not pulling those blankets and sheets and all that and getting a look at your body your horse's body condition you might miss something okay you need to use a weight tape or even just feeling along the ribs to make sure they're not losing condition winter supplements consider adding some fat sources like rice brand or flax seed for the extra calories if your horse is struggling to maintain weight and of course a favorite warm Mash treats offering warm beet pulp or soaked ha cubes can provide hydration and comfort on cold days just make sure it's not too hot every bite counts in Winter plan your horses's diet to keep them warm and healthy now we're going to talk about turnout and safe turnout turnout is absolutely vital for a horse's mental and physical health even in winter but icy conditions absolutely can turn playtime into a hazard so the number one thing you want to start with is you have to prepare your Paddock clear the walkways in hight traffic areas of any snow and ice or you know most of it you can add sand or gravel or even a non-toxic deicing agent for better traction snowball hoof care snow can compact into hard walls under their Hooves and it can cause a lot of discomfort guys you want to apply a non-toxic hoof oil or spray to prevent buildup or even hoof boots if necessary monitor the weather extreme cold wind or free freezing rain May warrant keeping them in the barn but they still need to get daily exercise let's not forget about the buddy system horses stay a lot warmer and happier when they can interact with their herd mates so group turnout is ideal when it's safe you need to balance safety with the benefits of fresh air and movement to keep your horse happy and how about grooming and hoof care winter coats are nature's blanket but regular grooming is still essential it's about more than just appearances grooming is your chance to check for issues and I do that's why I do that every single day with Dakota I'm checking his feet I'm checking his legs for any inflammation I'm checking for boo boos I mean everything you want to focus on hygiene because mud wet and moisture can cause a lot of skin problems like rain rot use a curry comb and a stiff brush to clean their coats thoroughly like often don't forget about hoof maintenance pick those hoofs daily to remove mud snow or ice and keep an eye out for thrush or cracks caused by wet and freezing conditions shedding tools oh these are my favorite for clipped horses consider using fleece or wool coolers after exercise to Wick moisture and prevent chills I like the shedding tools and I do use them because most of them will separate the hair and get it to stand up too um and also when I see the shedding begin and that let's face it that can start in late February early March it's indicative of warmer weather to come and you know not for nothing but your grooming routine it's a great way to bond with your horse and ensure that they're ready for any kind of weather you know I love my time spent brushing Dakota and I know he enjoys it as well you need to monitor for health you got to do a visual because winter can amplify existing health concerns especially for older horses or those with special needs you should be proactive about their health and you can use these tips to do so regular vet checks ensure your horse is up to date on vaccines and deworming as winter can still bring parasites and respiratory problems Dental Care horses with dental problems can struggle to chew hay now you need to look for that right if you start seeing qubing which is where they've been chewing and chewing on hay and then they spit it out and you find these Globs of wet or in the winter Frozen chunks balls of chewed forage that they didn't swallow that's telling you there's there's some dental issues and you need to because they need that forage guys you need to make sure there's nothing going on in that mouth that their teeth are able to chew if you have to start feeding soaked hay pellets to add extra forage then that's what you need to do you know and our elderly citizen um chewing can become an issue so we have to make sure we're we're looking for these signs and and taking care of them schedule that Dental flow if needed we're going to look at body condition scoring so again run your hands along their ribs the back the hips every week to monitor their weight early prevention is key and again we're going to go back to this blank blet checkups remove those blankets every day inspect the skin and coat for rubs Source or even injuries you just don't know prevention and early intervention are your best allies in Winter horse care you know winter can be an absolutely beautiful time to enjoy with your horse but it does take preparation and care and by following these tips you will keep your horse healthy happy and thriving no matter how cold it gets gee whiz yesterday was single digits we still had fun yes I was like totally you know I had the ball of clava on I was layered but I was comfortable so I got to still enjoy my my baby while I was feeding all the horses and doing the chores and it was awesome well all right that's that guys if you found the video helpful please like comment and subscribe for more equestrian content I really enjoy making this content for you I am six decades as a horse
