1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
foreign

2
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:18,300
water scarity water accounting is a

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,060
critical approach to set the information

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,760
basis to achieve safe and sustainable

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,920
water use effective water accounting

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,140
allows Water Resource managers and

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,359
Farmers to determine the impacts of

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:32,220
their strategies and practices and track

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,980
the effects of changes

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:37,260
to summarize the ability to effectively

11
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,420
account for water use is essential in

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,059
helping water authorities and Farmers

13
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,219
Drive Improvement and become aligned

14
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,800
with external stakeholders expectations

15
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,440
as well as their own efforts to advance

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,420
sustainable Water Management especially

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,420
underwater scarity scenarios

18
00:00:53,579 --> 00:01:01,020
we talk about water accounting

19
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:04,680
and we ask ourselves why that is

20
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:08,240
important and we ask ourselves that

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,640
question at many different skates

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,659
at the basing scale at the Irrigation

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:18,299
District scale at the farm scale and we

24
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:22,380
are not always aware of the importance

25
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:26,220
of knowing the water that we use we

26
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:29,340
consume and we return to the system to

27
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:32,100
the hydrological system we are not aware

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,000
of the of the importance of each level

29
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,700
so each

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,460
responsible of water management at a

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,820
giving scale

32
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:48,299
has the need of knowing the water that

33
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:52,920
is used for different reasons

34
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:56,759
one because it it cost money

35
00:01:52,920 --> 00:02:00,180
pumping transporting water is costly

36
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,880
second because we deal with a Water

37
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:07,259
Resource that is limited

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,440
and third because by not doing a good

39
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:13,020
use of water we can damage the

40
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,239
environment where the irrigation

41
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,459
activity takes place

42
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,060
so a

43
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:24,360
now we have to understand

44
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:27,060
in the water accounting process the

45
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,879
principle of the water balance

46
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,580
in the water balance we distinguish

47
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:35,700
different components we have our

48
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,920
resource the water that we are applying

49
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,920
to the field and now we are going to

50
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,459
focus on the field scale

51
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:48,060
once it is on the field that water

52
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:52,080
store for for a given time in the soil

53
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:55,200
to be consumed by the plant but not all

54
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,200
the water that is applied is consumed by

55
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,680
the plant part of that water is lost

56
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,200
through the evapotranspiration process

57
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,500
or it can return back to the

58
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,319
hydrological system by Deep percolation

59
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,879
or Surface drainage

60
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,980
so

61
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:18,000
how can we

62
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:22,200
evaluate these different components some

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,099
of them are easy or relatively easy to

64
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,700
measure

65
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:30,000
others can be estimated with good

66
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:33,060
accuracy others are really difficult to

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,080
measure or estimate so we make use of

68
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:40,220
the water balance to compute our

69
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,860
accounting and we obtain those

70
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,440
components as the residual of the water

71
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,959
balance that's why the water balance

72
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,260
equation is is so important everybody

73
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,959
has heard about different methods of

74
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:58,019
estimating evapotranspiration

75
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,299
we are aware about the damage that we

76
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,120
can cause with

77
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:07,680
drainage water and deep percolation of

78
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:12,299
water if it is loaded with agrochemicals

79
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:15,720
that's very difficult to to evaluate and

80
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,160
what we do can do is to measure the

81
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,720
applied water

82
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:25,560
and for that we have to consider how the

83
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:28,440
water gets to the to the fill and the

84
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,080
irrigation method that we are using in

85
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,840
general it's easier to measure the

86
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:38,280
applied water if it comes through a

87
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,220
pressurized pipe then we have very

88
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,020
standard methods

89
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,500
based on on a propeller a current meter

90
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,680
or ultrasonic

91
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:52,320
principles or the um

92
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:56,340
magnetic flow meters that can be

93
00:04:52,320 --> 00:05:00,540
installed at the a pipe in a proper

94
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:05,400
position and we can obtain the flow rate

95
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:08,040
of the cumulative applied water that's

96
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,080
not difficult anymore

97
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:17,120
um it is being implemented in most

98
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:20,639
modernized irrigation districts in many

99
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,720
Mediterranean countries maybe the

100
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:28,259
difficulty comes when we apply the water

101
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:32,699
using surface method again that is more

102
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:35,400
complicated but the principles came from

103
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:40,800
the old days when the Hydraulics were

104
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:44,580
developed and now we can combine the

105
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:48,680
classic Hydraulics with water level

106
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:53,220
sensors that can be used in a continuous

107
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:57,240
Way recording those water levels and

108
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:59,660
give us for those flumes or Weirs that

109
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,539
are installed in the open channels

110
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:08,759
measurements of flow rate but also the

111
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:12,120
water that has gone through that device

112
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:14,940
in a given in given time so there is no

113
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,419
excuse for not measuring the plate water

114
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:22,199
even when we have open channels although

115
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:23,340
we have to recognize that that is more

116
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:25,500
difficult

117
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,419
as we've seen there are several options

118
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,940
at different scales to account for water

119
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:32,039
given its relevance more effort should

120
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,139
be made by the different stakeholders to

121
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:36,600
establish a proper water accounting

122
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:39,000
system adapted to the local conditions

123
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,590
that allow making informed decisions

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,790
under water scarity situations

125
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:45,790
