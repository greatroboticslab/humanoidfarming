is a grant project and um those

32
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,920

of finish up the information you know to

34
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,560
for research uh for the grant and she's

35
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,439
also going to be picking people at

36
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,479
random to win prizes for those that

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,840

inspections and now I'll pass it along

71
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,440
to today's two speakers go ahead guys

72
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,920
all right well I'll take it from here

73
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,920
thank you Scott nice

74
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,800
introduction and I just really

75
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,480
appreciate all that he did to get us up

76
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,800
here technologically um I as he

77
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,080
mentioned we'll be co-presenting with

78
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:01,280
David and we're happy to bring you

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,040
today's topic which is is being ready

80
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,799
for food safety inspections and

81
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,400
Audits and we are going to elaborate

82
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:13,239
today on really two different categories

83
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,400
of these types of inspections and audits

84
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:18,959
the government does have their say in

85
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,879
how we produce food as we would provide

86
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,200
it for others not necessarily in your

87
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,879
own kitchen this is more of a a

88
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,440
commercial standpoint you're making

89
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:30,640
whether it's at the farmers market

90
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,840
making jelly or even producing apples to

91
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,879
sell to somebody and the other aspect of

92
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,519
inspection could be driven from private

93
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:44,120
sector uh that could even be something

94
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:46,920
related to um you know you as as a

95
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,680
consumer might drive a certain standard

96
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,400
that you'll be looking for in the food

97
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,560
that you would purchase for consumption

98
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,000
okay so moving on past the two subjects

99
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,920
here unless David has anything to chime

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,879
in

101
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,360
we'll move on to his notes Here in

102
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:04,360
background

103
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:11,760
thoughts okay David are you with

104
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,919
us I'm with you I had muted my button

105
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,960
sorry apologize all right the food

106
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:24,560
industry is more complicated than we may

107
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:29,199
realize the food laws in the United

108
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:33,240
States extend back to roughly 11 years

109
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:36,440
maybe even beyond that but over time as

110
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:41,360
issues have Arisen in our food industry

111
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:44,280
uh our laws have been expanded and I

112
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:47,039
think it's an accident but when you look

113
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,560
at the laws that we have for our food

114
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:53,400
industry I categorize them into five

115
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,400
sectors there's the laws that apply to

116
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,360
your input suppliers people that are

117
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,240
providing medic medicines for livestock

118
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,759
for example a second sector is the

119
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,199
agricultural producer the people with

120
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:11,800
the uh Orchard of trees the uh grain

121
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,880
Growers the livestock producers the

122
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,080
third sector would then be the food

123
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,560
processing where we take those EG

124
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,400
Commodities process them into food

125
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,919
products number four it becomes the

126
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,639
retail and the food service it's our

127
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,120
grocery stores as well as our

128
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,280
restaurants our cafeterias at our

129
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,080
institutions and then number five of

130
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,319
course is what we're all try striving to

131
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,759
serve and those are the consumers and

132
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,720
you look at the US laws and they really

133
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,880
do seem to fit into these five

134
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,160
categories again I don't think anybody

135
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,759
intended to be that way it just seems to

136
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,319
be the way it has evolved over the past

137
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,080
Century today we're going to primarily

138
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:55,080
focus on what are some of the rules for

139
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,479
those of us who are agricultural

140
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,319
producers for those of us who are food

141
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:03,199
processors for those of us who are

142
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:04,960
involved D in uh food retail sales and

143
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,440
many of the businesses in the food

144
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,720
industry fit into one of those

145
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,120
categories I'm a farmer so I'm in the

146
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,720
category of agricultural producer or I'm

147
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,280
a food manufacturer I'm a food processor

148
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,199
or I operate a grocery store uh I'm in

149
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,199
the retail sector but we also have

150
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,319
businesses and perhaps this is the type

151
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,759
of business that many of us are thinking

152
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,599
about this afternoon and that's a a

153
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,800
business that fits into several of these

154
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:34,000
sectors I might be raising the fruit on

155
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,800
my track of land I process that fruit

156
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,639
into a well keep it simple into a jam

157
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,319
and then I sell that jam or that jelly

158
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,000
at the retail sector so I find myself

159
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:49,120
with my simple business in all three of

160
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,520
these key sectors rather than just one

161
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,880
of these sectors So today we're going to

162
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,440
find ourselves trying to understand each

163
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,199
of these sectors at least a little bit

164
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,599
uh but I want you to have these three in

165
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:03,599
mind as we go forward

166
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,240
today we also have government

167
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,440
requirements whether it's federal

168
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,599
government requirements state government

169
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,680
requirements local government

170
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,960
requirements obviously government

171
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,720
requirements if we're subject to these

172
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:28,000
rules we must meet them we have no

173
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,960
choice there is also in the private

174
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,639
sector where businesses within the food

175
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,319
industry are documenting their

176
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,199
expectations they're formalizing their

177
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:43,240
expectations for the other food business

178
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,599
if I'm going to buy your food product

179
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,560
and use it in my food business and

180
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,120
whatever it is that I'm manufacturing

181
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,199
for the

182
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:55,199
consumer I expect you to meet certain

183
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:57,319
standards and to have some uniformity

184
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,479
among these standards try to make it a

185
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:02,759
little simpler for the industry the

186
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:04,840
industry is developing collaboratively

187
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:06,879
developing standards that we're going to

188
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,720
refer to today as private sector

189
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:14,319
standards or perhaps as food industry

190
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:17,879
standards so as a operator of even a

191
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,000
small firm I may find myself thinking

192
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:22,400
about the several different sectors of

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
the food industry in which I'm operating

194
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,879
I may find myself having to think about

195
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,400
the government regulations as well as

196
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:33,599
the private sector standards as we look

197
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,839
at those in this hour we're going to

198
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,880
find that there's some similarities

199
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,760
among the government

200
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,120
regulations and the industry standards

201
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,399
we're also going to see that there's

202
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,399
some

203
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,600
differences just a little graph then

204
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,480
that I use to try to organize my own

205
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,440
thinking we have the three sectors we

206
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,279
have the different uh levels of

207
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,839
expectations the the federal government

208
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:09,279
for example USDA and the FDA are the two

209
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:13,760
a are two of the agencies that uh have

210
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:16,160
lead responsibility for the food

211
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,839
industry what does the federal

212
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,040
government expect of our agricultural

213
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:26,200
producers it's often referred to as good

214
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:28,320
agricultural practices or Gap and here

215
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,760
we're going to see that in the past

216
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,200
several years it's especially in the

217
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,120
most recent year there are regulations

218
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:40,399
now that the

219
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:42,760
FDA needs to enforce for those Farm

220
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,959
operations that are producing fruits and

221
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,480
vegetables for example for The Fresh

222
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,440
Market what are those good agricultural

223
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,839
practices that I have to use in my

224
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,839
farming operation likewise the USDA and

225
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:58,160
FDA have regulations for the food

226
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,959
processors often those are referred to

227
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,680
as good Manufacturing practices or

228
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,519
sometimes they're referred to as

229
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:08,120
ssops standard sanitary operating

230
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,800
practices or procedures and then of

231
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,000
course there's the one that many of us

232
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:15,360
have heard about the hup the hazard

233
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,200
analysis and the preventive controls the

234
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,480
really isn't that much Federal

235
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,079
Regulation of retail and Food Service

236
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,600
we're going to find instead that the

237
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,560
retail and food service is primarily at

238
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,680
the state level so we move down one of

239
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,680
the roads in this graphic we for example

240
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,360
have the north Cota Department of Health

241
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,800
which has Authority and responsibility

242
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,320
for food processing within the state so

243
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,800
this is in collaboration with the

244
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,519
federal agencies but it also has then

245
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:48,839
the responsibility for the retail and

246
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:51,600
Food Service sectors the municipalities

247
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,160
the counties likewise have

248
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,120
responsibilities and they are combined

249
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,959
in with what I call the state and local

250
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,839
uh government regulations then we get

251
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:05,920
again to that private sector where the

252
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:09,079
Private Industry is setting forth

253
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,440
standards and we want to make sure that

254
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:13,760
those standards are being met those

255
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,920
private standards are being met with an

256
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,720
audit and certification process so just

257
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:22,399
a graphic to try to illustrate the

258
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,560
variety of topics that we're going to be

259
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:29,560
touching on this

260
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:31,079
afternoon yes and um just to add to it

261
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:33,399
saying we are going to elaborate a

262
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:36,200
little bit on the private sector and

263
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:38,320
what that means to you um but without

264
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,360
getting too overwhelmed on whoa what is

265
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,800
all this and what do I need to follow

266
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,880
we're gonna we're going to lay it out

267
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,240
for you so if you think about right now

268
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:49,399
in your mind what type of product you

269
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,560
produce we will get to it so in this

270
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,560
case let's say that you produce uh

271
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,440
apples for a farmers's market you're

272
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:59,839
likely going to fall under the Gap

273
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:03,040
agricultural producers sector and and if

274
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,639
you are processing anything we like to

275
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,800
use that example of maybe jelly or I I

276
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,720
saw canned goods last year you're under

277
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,519
the food processing sector couple of

278
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:15,120
examples okay we'll skip to the next

279
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:17,079
slide okay and

280
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,680
so again we're going to elaborate a

281
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:21,120
little bit about the private sector and

282
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,240
I'm G to I'm going to read the quote

283
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,240
here that we have the private sector

284
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:27,519
standards often take the form of

285
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:30,199
contracts and basically what these

286
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,279
contracts are saying is I'm not going to

287
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:35,040
purchase your product unless you can

288
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:38,320
document that your product is safe and

289
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,399
meets specific standards and sometimes

290
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:44,199
these buyers I'm thinking of a couple

291
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,680
examples Sam's Club Costco they have

292
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:51,480
different standards than uh maybe

293
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:54,920
Walmart might but every nearly every uh

294
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,760
retailer has some type of standard and

295
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,839
that's what we mean by private sector

296
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,680
standards that they require before

297
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:04,040
they're going to buy your product before

298
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,480
you as a consumer can even buy um so

299
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,360
we're we're saying to ourselves well

300
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,240
whose standards do we need to follow is

301
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,279
it the government is it private sector

302
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,959
well let's see here let's let's get into

303
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:17,160
it so we have a couple

304
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,600
enforcers we're going to break it down

305
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,680
between and really our answer to that

306
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,680
question that I left you rhetorically

307
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,560
here just a second ago was you may want

308
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:30,160
to consider both standards and sometimes

309
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,240
you have to what we have to follow is

310
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,360
the government and of course the

311
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,240
government enforces its regulations

312
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,800
we're going to give you a few examples

313
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,040
later on uh they do this through

314
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,839
inspection and so I have a couple

315
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,360
Graphics up here USDA uh and I heard

316
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,199
this quote from the grocery

317
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:54,040
manufacturers Association about five

318
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:58,040
years ago the GMA indicates that about

319
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:01,720
85% of what you are consuming is SDA

320
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:07,639
inspected from a federal standpoint now

321
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:09,120
and about 15% might be USDA okay so USDA

322
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:12,720
inspect anything

323
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,199
organic most all meat products that are

324
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:18,279
sold across the state border uh there's

325
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:21,959
a couple Exceptions there and uh eggs

326
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:24,440
within the shell you'll see that there's

327
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:27,440
an example of a mark of inspection here

328
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,000
that the USDA inspector that you can see

329
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,120
the plant number 38 they leave their

330
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,600
mark behind and you know that inspectors

331
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,360
were there the entire time that they

332
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,639
were

333
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:40,800
producing uh so the government is one

334
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:43,519
enforcer and the the other enforcer is

335
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:46,040
above and beyond the government and

336
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:48,720
these are the companies that say hey we

337
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:51,199
have a certain set of standards that

338
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,720
we're going to require sometimes above

339
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:57,360
and beyond federal or state or even your

340
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:00,759
Farmers Market inspections and that

341
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,839
leader is gfsi Global food safety

342
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:06,079
initiative and these are leaders across

343
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,680
industry and

344
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,680
Academia government organizations they

345
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:14,639
get together and they make sure that

346
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,279
there's a benchmark meaning that they're

347
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:20,320
kind of harmonizing an approach to

348
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,480
managing food safety across the industry

349
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,440
okay so we really have both standards

350
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,720
here and we're going to break down the

351
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:32,360
differences in a little

352
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,360
bit okay so David government

353
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:39,720
inspections okay so I'll take this here

354
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,839
in the beginning but we have meat and

355
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,839
poultry processing which is and I

356
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,160
mentioned it earlier we saw an example

357
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,319
of the mark of

358
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,079
inspection when when you're producing

359
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:51,279
meat and some of you might be on the

360
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:53,199
call that you know you you bring uh

361
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,160
grassfed beef or something too I know

362
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,360
here in bismar we have a great producer

363
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,040
brings grass-fed beef and many other

364
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:02,000
different types of red meat to our local

365
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:04,560
farmers market and they're very popular

366
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,519
um well they are typically locally

367
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,600
inspected but if they were to transport

368
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:10,399
across state lines they may need to be

369
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,720
USDA inspected and they actually might

370
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,880
be I I shouldn't quote exactly USDA is a

371
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,800
continuous inspection so if you're if

372
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,480
you're creating cuts of meat or

373
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,759
slaughtering from the hours of 7: am to

374
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,600
700 PM you're going to have an inspector

375
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,480
there the entire time so they can mark

376
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,720
that

377
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,839
inspection um we also have food

378
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,680
processing which is again regular

379
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,519
inspections by FDA and state this could

380
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,800
also be locally through your county

381
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:42,399
depending on what your setup is and this

382
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:45,399
actually is the majority and FDA doesn't

383
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,279
necessarily have a set particular time

384
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,880
they're not here 247 like USDA would be

385
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:52,279
in your facility I should say um they

386
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,240
are

387
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:57,440
really typically an annual basis okay

388
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,759
but you never know when they're going to

389
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,639
come so you always have to be operating

390
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,959
up to

391
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:07,120
standard and then you have your retail

392
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:09,360
and Food Services sectors where there

393
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,439
are regular inspections by state and

394
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,280
local and typically here's the neat

395
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,839
thing the results are usually posted

396
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,319
online and so when I go into uh sixth

397
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,439
grade sax classes or even ninth grade

398
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:24,199
High School uh I I pop these so that

399
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,919
they can see what's going on and they

400
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:29,280
feel kind of

401
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,559
empowered okay skipping on here David

402
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,559
are you

403
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:47,160
back well I tell you what I'm I I'll

404
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:49,400
take this and continue ongoing um so the

405
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,679
the examples that we're we're just

406
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,360
giving you a highlight here in this

407
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,320
slide this is kind of a boring slide but

408
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,000
honestly if we're going to tell you that

409
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,840
we have some examples of government

410
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,559
regulations and then what we're going to

411
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,000
do is we're going to pair up the

412
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:03,520
government regulations to the

413
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:06,280
differences in private sector why are we

414
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,360
giving you these examples we want you to

415
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,159
be empowered through your small business

416
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,200
and we're really targeting here anybody

417
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,960
that's producing especially for your

418
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:17,240
local markets your farmers markets to

419
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,080
come up with a food safety plan because

420
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,200
at some point this is going to apply to

421
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:26,039
you whether your Market has local

422
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:29,320
inspectors now or not they likely will

423
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:31,960
in the future we we want you to

424
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,200
maintain uh a certain level of safety

425
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,039
there we're going to discuss the

426
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,200
similarities and differences as we get

427
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,200
on uh to the next few slides

428
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,039
here okay so David here has a

429
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,799
slide okay so David is just commenting

430
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,240
in the bottom that we cannnot I I don't

431
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,600
don't believe that we can hear him so

432
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:07,360
I'm going to take the the hup uh food

433
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:10,400
processing regulation here that he's got

434
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,400
now whenever you see a

435
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,240
regulation uh from a federal standpoint

436
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,480
you're going to see typically it's title

437
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,200
21 now this is 21 which usually relates

438
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,760
to

439
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,200
FDA and then you have the Cod of reg

440
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,760
regulation so it's kind of like a

441
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:32,600
chapter 117 David was telling me earlier

442
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,080
that this 117 is new within a year

443
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,039
relative to the food safety

444
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,120
modernization act

445
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:43,080
feasa and so we have a written risk

446
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:45,000
control plan this is a food safety plan

447
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:48,720
with many different elements and you

448
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,559
know hup is actually now required across

449
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,159
all federal plants it it wasn't for a

450
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:56,760
very long time but what has the beauty

451
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:58,679
of hup even though it seems somewhat

452
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:00,760
mundane okay we've got to do all this

453
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,159
paperwor we have to make sure make sure

454
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,240
that we're demonstrating that we're

455
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,559
producing

456
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,320
safely you not only need to produce

457
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:09,559
safely but you have to demonstrate it on

458
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,600
paper well this is

459
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:15,679
preventing the onset of foodborn illness

460
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:17,280
that's the big thing here um it's and

461
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,080
this is especially important when you're

462
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,000
producing for consumers not just

463
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,559
somebody at home at your own dinner

464
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,400
table so we have you have you're

465
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,440
required to enhance it uh identify the

466
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,760
risks it could be

467
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:36,520
that you use a um let's say you're

468
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:39,159
making ground beef or um let's say that

469
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,880
you you you know there's a lot of metal

470
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:43,159
and one of your conveyor belts as you

471
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,960
wash your fresh produce from your

472
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:49,840
Farmers Market there might be a risk of

473
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:52,240
metal within your product so you are at

474
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,679
a point in which you you have to make

475
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,159
sure that you're mitigating that risk

476
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,240
that would be an example so there's a

477
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:01,640
few different types of risks we we have

478
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,799
physical we have chemical and then we

479
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,159
have biological which would be your

480
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:10,120
microorganisms again the the gist that

481
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:13,000
you need to know is that hup is required

482
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:15,400
by the government and if you don't have

483
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,440
a requirement now and you're producing

484
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,640
food to sell you may very well soon have

485
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:23,240
this requirement and it looks like David

486
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,480
might be back up and running here

487
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:29,200
soon we have hey wonderful to have you

488
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,080
we just get looked at slide number 17

489
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,679
David welcome back can you hear me this

490
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,200
time yeah we sure can thank you I'm

491
00:21:34,679 --> 00:21:39,720
embarrassed that uh it didn't work out I

492
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,919
apologize and thank you for continuing

493
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,640
with the

494
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,080
comments

495
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,159
uh we just briefed over a little bit

496
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,000
about hup and and the necessity and

497
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:55,240
we're back on this slide okay number 16

498
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:57,159
or number 17 17 17 so do we need to go

499
00:21:55,240 --> 00:22:00,559
forward

500
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:03,559
one more okay I think we explain cup

501
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,559
unless you need to

502
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:11,919
collaborate no I don't think I need to

503
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:14,840
uh expand on your discussion of hup we

504
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,840
can go on to the next

505
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,919
slide as we indicated we have the

506
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,600
processing

507
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:27,520
sector that is subject to hup the

508
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,880
federal government is primarily

509
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,520
responsible for the food processing

510
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,760
sector when it comes to the

511
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:39,679
retail and the food service sector most

512
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:41,960
of the regulatory responsibility lies

513
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:45,840
with our state and local

514
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:49,240
governments the task of developing

515
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,720
detailed regulations for each of the 50

516
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,799
states that becomes quite a challenge

517
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,240
you think about Minnesota having to

518
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:57,600
develop such a set of Standards Montana

519
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,520
having to develop such a set of

520
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,960
Standards North Dakota having developed

521
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:05,360
such a set of Standards so instead over

522
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,000
the past several decades the states

523
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,039
working with the Food and Drug

524
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,080
Administration have come up with

525
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:15,480
standards that are suggested that are

526
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,679
recommended to all of the state and

527
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,720
local governments so that way if the

528
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,120
state and local government wants to

529
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,640
adopt these detailed regulations so they

530
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:28,559
oversee the retail and Food Service

531
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,320
sectors of the industry they don't need

532
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,000
need they as the local governments they

533
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:36,159
as the state governments don't need to

534
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,960
start from Ground Zero they have a food

535
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:43,559
code to consider so the FDA working with

536
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:46,880
others has a food code that is suggested

537
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:49,559
to the state and local governments and

538
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,240
what do we have on this very busy slide

539
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:54,960
is simply some of the topics that are

540
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,039
included in the food code but it shows

541
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,640
the range of issues that we're always

542
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:05,679
thinking about in the food industry the

543
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:07,960
food retail the Food Service uh sectors

544
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:11,120
the management the Personnel are the

545
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,640
managers of the companies buying into

546
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,600
these responsibilities and making sure

547
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,559
that the firm is meeting these

548
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,000
expectations are the people who are

549
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:23,080
working in this firm even if it's only a

550
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,880
couple of individuals do they understand

551
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,679
the standards that they must function by

552
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,279
do they understand the practices that

553
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:32,919
they might must use for themselves

554
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:35,159
chapter three then is the food how do we

555
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:37,679
handle the food how do we make sure that

556
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:40,279
this food is being stored and handled

557
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,760
safely uh how do we make sure that the

558
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:46,279
food is being separated from or kept

559
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:48,320
separate from non-food products uh

560
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:51,039
number five the equipment or excuse me

561
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,080
chapter four the equipment the utensils

562
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:56,080
the Linens that we might use at our food

563
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,679
service uh

564
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:01,559
restaurant details

565
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:04,399
reminders as to what we need to do

566
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:07,080
within our business to have the safe

567
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:09,799
food product water plumbing and waste

568
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:13,760
disposal the physical facilities the

569
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:17,480
building itself is it clean is it is it

570
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,360
easy to be kept clean do we have the

571
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,039
proper lights do we have the proper

572
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,559
ventilation are we keeping the rodents

573
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:28,840
and others um undesirables outside of

574
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:31,200
the facilities these details are

575
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,880
addressed in the food code again the

576
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,679
food code developed by the FDA in

577
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,200
collaboration with others offered to the

578
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:40,880
state and local governments so that the

579
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,720
the state and local governments have a

580
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,360
solid foundation on which to develop or

581
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,039
in which to adopt regulations without

582
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,559
having to begin with a clean slate

583
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,880
instead they have solid suggestion

584
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:56,600
chapter number seven the poisonous and

585
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,520
toxic materials need to keep that

586
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,559
separate from the food want to keep that

587
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,960
separate from the food and then chapter

588
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,120
eight in the food code talks about the

589
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,960
compliance and the enforcement the

590
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:11,279
inspections and uh what is expected of

591
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:14,640
the firms so just a quick introduction

592
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,720
to the food code uh the topics at the

593
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,159
range of topics that are addressed in

594
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:22,360
the food code and that these are

595
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,440
suggestions for the state and local

596
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,880
governments to consider right and David

597
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,919
if I could give an example on that last

598
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,200
slide

599
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,200
now when you're talking about the food

600
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,120
code here's an example of when I've

601
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,320
encountered it from an audit standpoint

602
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,279
and Scott mentioned when I was first

603
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,760
introduced I was the food safety and

604
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:44,039
Technical Services director at

605
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,480
Cloverdale foods which is housed in

606
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:49,880
Mandan North Dakota over here near

607
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:52,279
bismar and we had an inspector that came

608
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:55,039
in at least once a year what sometimes

609
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:58,240
twice a year and they would audit us to

610
00:26:55,039 --> 00:27:00,320
this food code at our retail store which

611
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,520
which is called The Country Store they

612
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,200
originally came up with this idea well

613
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:08,279
hey we have some Oddball packages of hot

614
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,080
dogs that we produced or maybe a hammer

615
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:12,960
two and we don't have enough at the end

616
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,799
of the run to put it in an entire box

617
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,080
but we want to make a couple bucks on

618
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,919
this perfectly good product well they

619
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:22,240
came up with this retail point so if we

620
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,039
were to Define retail and food service

621
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,520
for those of you who don't know exactly

622
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:28,679
what we're talking about that grocery

623
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,679
store that Country Store turned into a

624
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:34,320
retail point in addition to that they

625
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,679
said hey let's make some good sentes so

626
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,440
that because they're pretty far west of

627
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:40,039
town and there's not a lot of restaurant

628
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,720
options and they wanted people to get

629
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:45,279
back to their shift on time they came up

630
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,840
with a food service Point as well in

631
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,039
other words they were the last step

632
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,760
before consumers eat the product think

633
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:54,159
Deli now they they started making ham

634
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,919
sandwiches and things of this nature and

635
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,519
then they were turned they turned around

636
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,720
and became as well a food Serv service

637
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:03,039
venue so this food code is what they

638
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,559
were audited for so when we're going

639
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,360
through these standards think about how

640
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,120
it applies to your

641
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,519
business just a brief example a little

642
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,720
more detail on the Food Code we just

643
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:17,440
chose the inspection and the uh

644
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:20,840
correction of violations if there are

645
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,559
any just chose that as a topic to expand

646
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:26,039
on again the food code talks about the

647
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:28,559
frequency of the inspections this is

648
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:32,399
going to vary from state to state even

649
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:36,120
though uh the food code is suggested for

650
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:39,360
the entire nation uh annually and maybe

651
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:43,039
at least once every two years depends on

652
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,640
how the uh State or the local government

653
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:49,000
feels they are capable of conducting

654
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:52,679
these inspections uh the access to the

655
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,559
facility that certainly is expected that

656
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:57,519
one would be

657
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,640
uh uh one would be available for the

658
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,880
inspector

659
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,440
to look at your business to be able to

660
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,720
make sure that you are in compliance as

661
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:11,640
the inspection is completed the

662
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:14,120
inspector provides a report to the uh

663
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,480
firm as well as we've already been

664
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:18,320
indicated and report to the public as to

665
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,559
what was found if there were any

666
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,760
violations and

667
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,240
uh sometimes those even show up in the

668
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:27,200
newspaper if there's an imminent health

669
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,919
hazard something that catches the

670
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,000
inspector's atten that is very serious

671
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,360
uh there's authority to begin shutting

672
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,440
down the business until that type of a

673
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:40,679
serious health hazard is corrected uh so

674
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,679
these are just some of the type of

675
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:45,080
topics that are included in the food

676
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:46,279
code that a person would want to have

677
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,000
some

678
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:51,200
familiarity uh it you're not going to

679
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,480
study these documents necessarily in

680
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,640
extensive detail uh because they are uh

681
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,279
considerable amount of information in

682
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,559
them but you certainly want to have

683
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,039
yourself familiar with them and as you

684
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:06,399
identify the portions of these

685
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:08,559
regulations these government standards

686
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,440
that apply to your business yes you will

687
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:14,679
need to study those in

688
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,440
detail okay

689
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:20,200
right that's exactly right so now we've

690
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,159
we've elaborated a little bit on the

691
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,960
government requirements we talked about

692
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:29,279
hup earlier um we we kind of breezed

693
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:31,919
over a little bit about uh FD a as well

694
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,760
as USDA that has the hup inspections we

695
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,640
talked about the food code which

696
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,600
primarily relates to retail and food

697
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,600
service now we talked a little bit

698
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,000
earlier about the private sector we're

699
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,519
going to elaborate here a little bit uh

700
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,519
consumer and industry-driven

701
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:52,080
auditing again is above and beyond the

702
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:54,519
governmental inspections and you might

703
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,919
ask yourself whoa this is getting why

704
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,679
how does this apply to me this is

705
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:02,559
getting a little uh you know

706
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:04,960
globally here now this is above my level

707
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,960
but we want you to be aware of it

708
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,080
because the important thing here is that

709
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:14,080
consumers have a a very influential

710
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,159
drive here in the food safety sector uh

711
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,480
in

712
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:19,760
Industry consumers want to know what's

713
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:23,200
in their food and that really does

714
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,639
translate to a small kitchen oriented

715
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,000
business as it pertains to the farmers

716
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:31,919
market we want you to be familiar with

717
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,960
with uh gfsi and they're recognized

718
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,399
they're called schemes okay so

719
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:41,760
there's these are the various different

720
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:44,720
schemes and what we mean by that is uh

721
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,760
that let me just Define gfsi let me take

722
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,360
a step back I I kind of introduced it

723
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:52,720
earlier but gfsi is industry driven and

724
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:55,360
it provides guidance on Food Safety

725
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,679
Management Systems along the entire

726
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,559
supply chain so thank seed you know Farm

727
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:03,000
to tables okay and then and on our next

728
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:05,360
slide here we'll elaborate a little bit

729
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,880
about the different sectors of the

730
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,679
schemes um but really what this gfsi

731
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,480
represents it's an organization it

732
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,799
represents the leading food safety

733
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,639
experts whether they work in the retail

734
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:20,760
area manufacturing food service

735
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:23,600
companies this also includes government

736
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,559
as well as Academia NDSU extension as an

737
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,159
example uh so many different

738
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:31,799
organizations they meet across the globe

739
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:36,200
and they promote a benchmark standard so

740
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:40,080
that anybody that is sqf recognized or

741
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,360
fssc22000 or there's a brrc global

742
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,200
standard picture there in front of you

743
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:48,760
anybody that has one of these

744
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,600
certifications is above and beyond their

745
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:55,440
peers and you know that if I'm producing

746
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,919
a hot dog in India with sqf

747
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,559
certification it's going to be to the

748
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:02,760
highest food safety standard that it

749
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:05,519
would be here in the United States um

750
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,440
this especially applies Global Gap

751
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,240
specializes specifically in the

752
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:12,519
agricultural side of things so the

753
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:17,960
growing side of things so if you find a

754
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:20,440
producer of wheat or um you know tail or

755
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:22,039
you know think where we get during you

756
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,559
know up here in North Dakota it's cold

757
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:28,279
and we can't get fresh produce year

758
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:30,480
round well this if you you know as a

759
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:32,799
consumer as well as somebody who might

760
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,120
have a small business this is something

761
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,159
that pertains to you I know that these

762
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,080
are the recognized standards and they're

763
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:41,919
as good as I can get here in the United

764
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:44,960
States if they apply to the the same

765
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,840
certification so that's an introduction

766
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,240
to the various different types of

767
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,600
schemes and they're across a few

768
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,600
different let's skip to the next slide

769
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:57,279
now across a few different sectors so

770
00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:00,159
the bubbles in blue there on the right

771
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:01,679
hand side of the of the screen it breaks

772
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,480
it down into the different types of

773
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:07,119
businesses that might apply to these

774
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,480
standards we have the agricultural

775
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:11,079
production okay David what's an example

776
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,520
of a product there do you think that

777
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:16,240
would apply to our Farmers Market

778
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,560
certainly would look at our fresh fresh

779
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,760
fruits and

780
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:21,879
vegetables uh that those are being

781
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,560
produced and then made available

782
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:24,560
directly to the

783
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,200
consumers yes absolutely and then also I

784
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:32,119
know once in a while we'll get those

785
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,480
beef fed or those grass-fed beef uh

786
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:37,200
producers or your pork producers that

787
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,679
could also be food processing now when

788
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,639
we talk processing that's anything that

789
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:45,119
alters it from its original state that

790
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:47,720
could be smoking of meat uh mixing

791
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,639
salting uh chopping grinding you know

792
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:53,159
the government does Define processing uh

793
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,359
but this could be that you folks who are

794
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:57,320
making we have a wonderful producer of

795
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,040
sourdough bread here at our Farmers

796
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,760
Market bismar that SAR bread I mean I

797
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,720
try to stock up during the summer so

798
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,800
that would be a processing example uh we

799
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,560
also have the the standard applies of

800
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,800
retail and food service and there's also

801
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,640
a sector in there for under retail and

802
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,839
food service for if you're just housing

803
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,000
product there is a standard to make sure

804
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:19,800
that you're doing it right you're

805
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,040
keeping it temperature controlled if it

806
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,440
applies and all kinds of things so these

807
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:25,599
are the different standards and these

808
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,760
are broken into the categories farming

809
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,520
of animals of fish of plants grains and

810
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,800
pulses is a separate

811
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:35,920
one uh all kinds of things all the way

812
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,720
down to uh production of seed that's

813
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,440
very

814
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,240
important production of food packaging

815
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,040
so the people who are making the

816
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,240
Plastics make sure that the polymers

817
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,280
don't leak into our food these are some

818
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:52,880
examples okay how are these Audits and

819
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:57,240
certifications handled um if if I want

820
00:35:52,880 --> 00:36:00,760
to be certified uh do I need to apply to

821
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,280
one of these schemes and then if I am

822
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:06,200
part of one of these schemes how do the

823
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:09,079
people who operate the schemes monitor

824
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,079
my actual

825
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,640
activities do you want to answer that

826
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:16,200
one well that's a great

827
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,280
question yeah that's a great question

828
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:21,839
and really what they do is you have at

829
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:24,880
least an annual audit and what they do

830
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:28,280
is they typically can go through and

831
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,680
we'll talk about this later your record

832
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,720
your paperwork from the entire last year

833
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:35,040
that they were there typically they'll

834
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:37,640
go through the last 90 days of

835
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,880
documentation so an example would be we

836
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,920
talked a little bit earlier about uh

837
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:45,160
laundering and Pest Control uh they

838
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:47,920
would look at the last 90 days of

839
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:50,800
Records to make sure that any of the

840
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,760
smoks or lab coats that we used were

841
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,920
washed in a with a chemical that

842
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,400
would verify that no microorganisms were

843
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,200
able to live whether it was a high

844
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,319
enough temperature or a chemical that

845
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:05,480
killed it so when you're producing jelly

846
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:08,079
in your kitchen you want to make sure

847
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,200
and have clean overgarments or

848
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:13,319
protective gear when when you're doing

849
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:15,440
your processing you know so that is it's

850
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:17,839
by way of audits I hope answer the

851
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,280
question does anyone have any questions

852
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:23,640
right there is honey considered

853
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,240
processed I see we have a

854
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,680
question that's a good question I I'm

855
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,760
going to start out with the answer and

856
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,359
David could probably uh continue it

857
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,640
depends is the answer and I will say

858
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,119
that some honey you can you hear of the

859
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:43,720
term raw honey okay

860
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:45,440
is uh typically filtered and that would

861
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:48,599
not be considered a process because it

862
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,800
would still be at same state um honey in

863
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,280
the past and I don't have the numbers in

864
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,520
front of me and I don't want to scare

865
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,520
anybody but has been associated with one

866
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:02,240
particular microbe that lives in an an

867
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,480
anerobic environments so no air there um

868
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,200
and so usually when you get honey

869
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,599
especially from the store there has been

870
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,880
through the hasset plan that we

871
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:12,680
mentioned earlier a critical step to

872
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,119
make sure that that bug has been

873
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:17,760
eradicated and usually that's a heated

874
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,560
step so it it Heats it now some people

875
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:22,240
believe that it gets rid of some of the

876
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:26,680
natural entities that are within the

877
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:28,760
honey when it's uh heated heating is a

878
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,240
process so the majority of what you get

879
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:33,040
at your retail point is heated people

880
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,839
come to a farmers's market sometimes to

881
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,319
get the raw honey but then you need to

882
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:39,240
know the risk there that you know there

883
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:41,319
there is a slight very slight

884
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,000
possibility you would have a microbe

885
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:45,319
there oh I have not David I don't know

886
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,599
if you want to elaborate other questions

887
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:50,040
please yeah please be sure to send them

888
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:53,040
out what we want to do now for the next

889
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,880
few moments is just to make a comparison

890
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,079
between the FDA regulations and some of

891
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:01,400
the private sector standards and we've

892
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,480
just chosen uh for the purpose of our

893
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,079
discussion this afternoon some good

894
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,319
agricultural practices and remember good

895
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,000
agricultural practices means that we're

896
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:12,440
talking about what's going on on the

897
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,400
farm or what's going on in the vineyard

898
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:18,040
or the Orchard and you look at the FDA

899
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,280
regulations as was introduced earlier

900
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:23,240
this afternoon when you see part 112

901
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,280
that particular regulation is less than

902
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:29,720
a year old but here are some of the

903
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:32,119
topics that the FDA Reg Ates uh in terms

904
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,079
of what's going on on our farm operation

905
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,520
the qualification of the Personnel the

906
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:38,920
training of the Personnel their hygiene

907
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:40,920
practices the health of the Personnel we

908
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,200
don't want an ill individual handling

909
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,319
our food while it's being processed

910
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,040
agricultural water is the water uh such

911
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:50,800
that it's not going to add contaminants

912
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:54,920
to our uh agricultural commodity or to

913
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:58,720
our food what type of biological

914
00:39:54,920 --> 00:40:01,560
uh items are we are we adding to our

915
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,720
soils are we properly composting the

916
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,480
waste materials that we might be wanting

917
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:07,720
to use in our soils how about the

918
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,319
presence of animals and so forth so we

919
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:13,440
see a list of topics that these are some

920
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:15,680
of the uh details that the FDA addresses

921
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,760
with good agricultural practices now

922
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,319
let's look at the private sector we

923
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,640
chose sqf just as an example and sqf

924
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:26,839
they address what are the requirements

925
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,440
for the site where we are handling this

926
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:30,960
fresh fruit fruits and vegetables on the

927
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,640
farm how are we handling the product

928
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,720
how's it being stored again the personal

929
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,000
hygiene and Welfare what are the

930
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:40,200
practices of packaging the Water

931
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,800
Management the soil management the

932
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:47,280
harvesting practices by go we begin to

933
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,680
recognize the government regulations and

934
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,119
the private sector standards they are

935
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,680
addressing many of the same concerns

936
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:57,440
they're not identical but there certain

937
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:00,000
certainly are commonalities so we going

938
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,680
to go into a little more detail and

939
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,680
again we've just Chosen One FDA

940
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:08,240
regulation to illustrate here are some

941
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,520
of the expectations that the federal

942
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,400
government has in the United States if

943
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:15,040
you're dealing with products that are

944
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,760
being produced on the farm being handled

945
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:20,240
and prepared so that they can go

946
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,880
directly to The Fresh Market uh this is

947
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,280
what we need to be thinking about we

948
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,680
need to be thinking about the equipment

949
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,960
the knives the implements the mechanical

950
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:31,680
Harvesters the cooling equipment the

951
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,839
belts the conveyors on which the food is

952
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,920
passing as we are handling it and

953
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:39,520
getting it ready so here are just some

954
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:43,800
of the details in this type of a

955
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:46,440
regulation are these items up to

956
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,960
standards in terms of making sure we

957
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,040
minimize the risk of contaminating the

958
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,839
food looking a little further into that

959
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,560
FDA regulation are you using equipment

960
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:58,800
and tools that are of design and built

961
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,960
in a way that they're easily clean

962
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,520
because we certainly don't want to have

963
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,880
an item that we can't get clean and

964
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:09,119
therefore we risk contamination as we

965
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:11,880
continue to use it are is the facility

966
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:14,400
clean is it easy to clean the facility

967
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,079
is the product being stored and

968
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,119
maintained in a way that uh again

969
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:22,440
minimizes the risk we continue one step

970
00:42:20,119 --> 00:42:24,520
further and we look at this regulation

971
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:27,240
in a little more detail and this is just

972
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:30,280
one of multiple regulations but here

973
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,319
again uh how is the equipment built is

974
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,400
it built in such a way that the the

975
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:38,359
scenes where the pieces of metal come

976
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:42,359
together uh are easy to clean and we're

977
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:45,160
we're hopefully uh able to keep the uh

978
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:47,480
equipment free of contaminants are we

979
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:50,240
inspecting this equipment to make sure

980
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,400
that it's clean are we maintaining the

981
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,000
equipment so that it doesn't get damaged

982
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,520
and therefore become a a point of risk

983
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,720
in our business are we uh using it in

984
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,400
the proper way are we sanitizing it

985
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,760
properly uh the equipment the tractors

986
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,359
the forklifts the other vehicles the

987
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,839
containers in which the foods are being

988
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:16,400
set are these being used in such a way

989
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:18,440
that we are reasonably reducing the risk

990
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,720
uh that are foreseeable within our

991
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:25,680
business operation so here is a very

992
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:29,119
quick and dirty example of a Federal

993
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,599
Regulation and now let's take a look at

994
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,200
what are some of those fundamental

995
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:34,200
requirements from the private

996
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:40,800
sector okay right and so then we move

997
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:44,319
into we're still using our example of

998
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:47,160
sqf and uh we you know I'm going to

999
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:50,359
start pointing out the similarities now

1000
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:52,319
sqf breaks it into modules okay and it

1001
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:54,720
doesn't matter what type of business

1002
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:57,599
what type of product you're producing

1003
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:01,640
everybody in sqf has to follow module

1004
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:05,200
two so you know that if whether it's uh

1005
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:07,920
canned good or if it's h

1006
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,160
shrimp the premises the building and all

1007
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,440
the equipment just like the FDA

1008
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:15,400
regulation indicated needs to be done uh

1009
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,079
you know basically handled in a safe

1010
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:22,240
manner in order to produce the delivery

1011
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:24,559
of safe food so um next in in the code

1012
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,800
we have the supplier then needs to

1013
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:30,960
follow whatever module is relative

1014
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,359
whether it's module 3 to 15 relative to

1015
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,680
the type of food product they're

1016
00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:37,960
producing so for those of you on the

1017
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:39,640
next slide now in module 7 who are

1018
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:41,520
producing the fresh fruits and

1019
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:44,599
vegetables which is the majority of our

1020
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,400
Market farmers markets uh you want to

1021
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:49,640
make sure that you're following these

1022
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:52,760
things okay so your Machinery especially

1023
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:55,040
your conveyors uh your harvesting and

1024
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,160
processing rigs are of sound

1025
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:59,160
construction then they'll break it down

1026
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,079
a little bit further the contact

1027
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,680
surfaces of the conveyors which is why I

1028
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:05,359
said especially uh harvesting and

1029
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,720
processing rigs shall be designed and

1030
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:10,240
constructed and and you can read here an

1031
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,920
an efficient way of handling the product

1032
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,960
so that any surfaces that directly and

1033
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:17,760
this goes across the board any surfaces

1034
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:21,200
that directly hit the consumable portion

1035
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:24,079
of the food contact or food surfaces so

1036
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,960
we call it direct contact is is cleaned

1037
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,920
and handled in a way that will mitigate

1038
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,400
food faes

1039
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:36,240
risk so you know the example I can give

1040
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,280
here when when I think of knives totes

1041
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,599
um trays I appreciate that they're

1042
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,319
actually giving some examples the FDA

1043
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:45,520
example gave a couple of the same

1044
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:47,839
examples so really this is this is

1045
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,440
benchmarking the standard and you might

1046
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:52,079
say well why the

1047
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,920
similarities okay well it looks like

1048
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:57,200
you're not really going above and beyond

1049
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:58,800
with sqf beyond what the regulation

1050
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,119
requires because remember this is

1051
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:06,640
industry driven well the the novelty

1052
00:46:02,119 --> 00:46:09,920
here with the private sector AIT is that

1053
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:12,400
you're benchmarked across the globe okay

1054
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,359
so you're able to export and import and

1055
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,640
all of a sudden you have more

1056
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:19,119
opportunity to make more money okay the

1057
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,839
bigger your Market is so again that's

1058
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:24,280
why we're here there are some

1059
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:27,119
similarities the novelty in our country

1060
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:28,960
is that our government requires things

1061
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,599
to be very similar so you don't have to

1062
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,559
come up with two sets of Standards so

1063
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,520
for the most part our message is as

1064
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:39,480
you're creating standards for your

1065
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:42,559
farmers market and producing safe

1066
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:44,760
product this is a start looking at these

1067
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:47,000
examples that we've given you here the

1068
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:49,960
knives um the containers that you're

1069
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,599
using so uh let me skip to the next

1070
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,200
slide and continue this is the last

1071
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:57,480
slide of examples here the water tanks

1072
00:46:54,200 --> 00:47:00,440
are sufficient um clean at the right

1073
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,960
frequency so maybe it's a monthly maybe

1074
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,880
you can demonstrate that they're not

1075
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,880
dirty within the month so a month is

1076
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,079
long enough and you can do that by you

1077
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:12,359
know plating the microorganisms whatever

1078
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:14,760
your um you know setup is you can you

1079
00:47:12,359 --> 00:47:17,400
can show in your kitchen that there just

1080
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:20,280
isn't any obvious signs of grime until

1081
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,280
you know you know for two weeks and then

1082
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:26,000
that's what your cleanliness frequency

1083
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:29,839
is you get to set that up uh one more

1084
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:33,000
example here I am typically the one who

1085
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:36,160
goes out to our 4 camp in Washburn to

1086
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:38,280
set up our kitchen last year was a huge

1087
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,400
year for us as a lot of you might know

1088
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:45,079
with the grant uh at the new building we

1089
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:48,000
also and I I credit the director Brad

1090
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:49,960
for ensuring and sticking to his guns on

1091
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,920
making sure that the knives and the

1092
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:55,480
totes and all the different plates that

1093
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:58,160
are used out there are commercially

1094
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,400
certified I'm bringing this example up

1095
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:02,119
because it pertains to well you're

1096
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,040
thinking about starting a business where

1097
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:08,000
you make jelly for the farmers market

1098
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:11,359
and jam and preserves well what kind of

1099
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,079
equipment should you buy the auditor his

1100
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:16,119
name is Anton here in Burley County and

1101
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,760
the City of bismar he's with the

1102
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:20,599
Environmental Health Department they're

1103
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,440
located at the Public Health Building he

1104
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:24,640
is the one who and his team and he

1105
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:27,000
typically goes around and Audits and the

1106
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,400
first thing that he'll look for is

1107
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:33,240
certified commercially

1108
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:36,520
represented forks and knives and and you

1109
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:39,599
know metal mixing bowls he knows that if

1110
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,800
he sees these commercially stamped uh

1111
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:45,000
knives and forks and Cutlery that he

1112
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:47,200
knows you know what you're doing and I'm

1113
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:50,960
not endorsing any one particular product

1114
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:54,000
brand but NSF is an example of one of

1115
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:58,160
those commercially uh recognized and

1116
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,359
certified um cutlery uh manufacturers is

1117
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:03,040
what I'm trying to say and so if you see

1118
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:04,960
NSF on your forks when you're out at the

1119
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,200
I just ate at a steakhouse here on

1120
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,799
Sunday and I saw that NSF was stamped in

1121
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,040
their Forks so you can start looking for

1122
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:14,920
that I would spend a little extra money

1123
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:17,280
on the commercially commercial kitchen

1124
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:20,160
recognized equipment if if you're

1125
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:23,200
starting from scratch okay uh so this is

1126
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,880
an example of uh you know how you you

1127
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,319
have to have a way to clean it but you

1128
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:29,400
can start out with the right stuff okay

1129
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:30,599
so moving on here David I'll pass it you

1130
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,000
to interiew our discussion this

1131
00:49:30,599 --> 00:49:34,920
afternoon has been talking about what's

1132
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:37,400
going on on the farm what's going on in

1133
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:39,760
the processing facility what occurs in

1134
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:42,960
the retail the previous example the

1135
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:45,359
several slides were in uh detailed

1136
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,079
example of what goes on in the farm the

1137
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:49,119
next several slides and we'll go through

1138
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:50,960
these quickly because of the interest of

1139
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,520
time but now we're going to be looking

1140
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:56,760
at a quick comparison between government

1141
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,839
regulations and private sector standards

1142
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:01,319
when it comes to that food processing

1143
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:04,880
facility those good manufacturing

1144
00:50:01,319 --> 00:50:07,760
practices the gmps here we look at again

1145
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:10,440
the broad topics that the FDA addresses

1146
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:12,720
in its regulations the plant is the

1147
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:14,880
facility the building itself the

1148
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:17,359
sanitation practices that we're using in

1149
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,400
the operation the again the equipment

1150
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:21,599
the utensils that are being used during

1151
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:24,240
the manufacturing process what is the

1152
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:26,920
actual manufacturing process and how are

1153
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,799
we controlling the process to minimiz

1154
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,720
the risk how's the food being uh

1155
00:50:28,799 --> 00:50:34,240
warehouse and stored uh what do we do if

1156
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:36,359
there are some uh problems now we look

1157
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,760
at the private sector what does a

1158
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:40,520
private sector uh concern itself with

1159
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:43,079
and those standards again I would

1160
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:45,319
suggest they begin to look this similar

1161
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:48,280
what are the requirements for the site

1162
00:50:45,319 --> 00:50:50,319
and are these is the site being approved

1163
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,880
according to these private sector

1164
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:54,440
standards the construction and the

1165
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:57,520
control of handling the product storing

1166
00:50:54,440 --> 00:51:00,200
the product the Personnel hygiene and

1167
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,520
their welfare the Personnel processing

1168
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:05,359
practices the importance of training the

1169
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:07,640
Personnel the water the ice the air that

1170
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:10,200
comes in contact with the food while the

1171
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:12,440
food is being processed the storage

1172
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,119
Transportation separating the function

1173
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:16,760
of where we're cleaning the raw

1174
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:19,280
materials from where we're packaging the

1175
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,559
final materials let's not have those

1176
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:23,359
occurring in the same space so that we

1177
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:25,520
minimize the risk of

1178
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:27,200
cross-contamination waste disposal and

1179
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:30,400
then how are you maintaining the

1180
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:32,640
exterior of your facility so we look at

1181
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,440
the government regulations we look at

1182
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:39,280
the private sector standards and again

1183
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:42,040
we see similarities just some very brief

1184
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,599
examples uh the sanitary operations

1185
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:46,880
these are details of what the FDA

1186
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:49,440
requires when it comes to processing the

1187
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,240
food how do we assure that we have a

1188
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,119
sanitary operation the general

1189
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,680
maintenance of the building are the

1190
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,720
substances being clean and sanitized

1191
00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:01,400
where are we store ing the toxic

1192
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:03,599
materials uh what's necessary for actual

1193
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,359
testing of the product to make sure that

1194
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:09,280
our product is safe continuing with this

1195
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:11,680
example the control of the pests that we

1196
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:14,920
know that the rodents the insects and so

1197
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:17,720
forth are not uh gaining access to the

1198
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:20,760
food why it's being processed the food

1199
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:23,160
contact surfaces are sanitized and that

1200
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,400
they're meeting the sanitation standards

1201
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:27,680
while the food is being processed in

1202
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,680
whatever the manufacturing practices

1203
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:33,559
that we're using in our business and con

1204
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:36,400
then the sanitation of even nonf food

1205
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:39,559
contact Services surfaces we want to

1206
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,440
make sure that we are not contaminating

1207
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:43,760
the product so after we look at the

1208
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,599
Federal Regulations very quickly now

1209
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,559
let's take a quick look at the uh

1210
00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:51,799
private sector standards are they

1211
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,799
similar or are there some

1212
00:52:52,119 --> 00:52:58,119
differences right and the answer to that

1213
00:52:54,839 --> 00:53:01,640
really is they're very similar in in um

1214
00:52:58,119 --> 00:53:03,920
the US here and so what they do here

1215
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,599
with the sqs standard is they get a

1216
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:09,000
little bit more particular and they

1217
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:12,480
start naming like in the 11 to

1218
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:15,200
12.2 you'll see benches tables conveyors

1219
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:17,760
mixers mincers they they actually

1220
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:20,640
include a few examples for you which

1221
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:24,720
helps when you're creating your plan um

1222
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:27,960
but the the big message here is that

1223
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:30,720
they are pressing how often how often

1224
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:32,599
you're or really not how often it's that

1225
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:34,680
you need to clean the equipment that

1226
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:37,200
you're producing what I'm trying to say

1227
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:40,839
is that it's still your business you get

1228
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:43,880
to decide how you're doing it so like I

1229
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:45,640
said how often you get to decide but the

1230
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:48,720
thing is is that you've got to stick to

1231
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:51,599
it because this is what you have to do

1232
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:55,559
okay so you you get a little leway there

1233
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:57,400
we're saying well um you as you go

1234
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:59,839
through the me methods of cleaning and

1235
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:01,960
handling food processing equipment you

1236
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:03,680
need to consider what is to be cleaned

1237
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:06,400
how it's to be cleaned when it's to be

1238
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:08,760
cleaned they're not telling you exactly

1239
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,359
the details of how it needs to be in

1240
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,799
your business because you might have

1241
00:54:10,359 --> 00:54:15,599
extenuating circumstances but this is

1242
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:18,640
what needs to be done okay very very

1243
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:21,960
similar to regulation and again this is

1244
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:25,599
for anything being processed in this

1245
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:29,000
example okay um one example I can give

1246
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:31,160
you is in the 13.6 detergents and

1247
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,400
sanitizers well they're saying you've

1248
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:35,640
got to use some type of detergent

1249
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:38,160
remember gets rid of the oilbased food

1250
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:39,799
food uh bofilm so any food products that

1251
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,040
are on there but the sanitizer is what's

1252
00:54:39,799 --> 00:54:44,280
going to kill the microorganisms the

1253
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:47,480
detergent doesn't necessarily eradicate

1254
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:49,480
the the microorganisms and so if you're

1255
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,400
thinking about your own food processing

1256
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:53,480
bench in your kitchen when you're

1257
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:56,920
producing maybe your souro bread or

1258
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:59,520
something um are you using a sanitizer

1259
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:03,520
and a detergent and and and really it

1260
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:06,400
should go s detergent rinse sanitizer

1261
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:08,839
and don't rinse and an example that I

1262
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:11,160
can give you you know as you can see

1263
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:13,319
here the module nor did the regulation

1264
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:15,000
say you've got to be using bleach or

1265
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:17,640
you've got to be using quinary and

1266
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:20,200
pneumonia or ammonia it won't say what

1267
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,720
you have to do exactly how you have to

1268
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:24,559
do it but it'll say you've got to be

1269
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:26,359
clean an example of a sanitizer that you

1270
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:28,359
can mix up and you should do it fresh

1271
00:55:26,359 --> 00:55:31,599
each time you're going to use it is a

1272
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:33,640
gallon of Bach to a table I'm sorry a

1273
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:36,240
gallon of water that's important other

1274
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,319
way around a gallon of water to a

1275
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,880
tablespoon of bleach and that's

1276
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:44,079
considered a food contact surface safe

1277
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:45,680
parts per million for a sanitizer it

1278
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:49,559
will kill the bugs you don't have to

1279
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:51,240
rinse it off okay so let's uh let's go

1280
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:53,039
just a couple more slides here we're

1281
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:55,680
right on time hopefully we get a couple

1282
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:58,480
we often have heard farmers in the past

1283
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:01,240
20 years say I spend more time at my

1284
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:03,640
desk than I do on my tractor or working

1285
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:06,200
with my livestock that might be true for

1286
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,559
our small food firms as well we're going

1287
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:11,000
to feel like there's a point that I'm

1288
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:13,200
spending more time at the uh computer

1289
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,960
than I'm doing uh that I'm spending in

1290
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,440
the orchard or that I'm spending with

1291
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,640
the product but it is so important as

1292
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,880
already been described this afternoon we

1293
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:24,599
need to document how this business is

1294
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:26,760
being operated but also as stated

1295
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:30,119
earlier this afternoon before we even

1296
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:33,520
start the operation we need a document

1297
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:36,839
in which we describe how we intend to

1298
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:38,920
operate the business we need that plan

1299
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:41,559
as to how we're going to operate to

1300
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:44,960
minimize these risks then we need to

1301
00:56:41,559 --> 00:56:47,520
keep records uh as the business is

1302
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:49,280
actually being conducted this is how we

1303
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,680
harvested this is how we handled the

1304
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,079
food so that we minimize the risk this

1305
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,240
is how we processed it this is how we

1306
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,520
kept it warm to the necessary

1307
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:03,079
temperatures or this how we kept it cool

1308
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:06,160
to the required uh temperature again so

1309
00:57:03,079 --> 00:57:08,160
we end up having the documents as to our

1310
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,920
planning and then the documents as to

1311
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:13,240
how we keep records this is important

1312
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:15,599
and hopefully we've emphasize this

1313
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:17,079
throughout the afternoon that the

1314
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,039
government inspectors are going to be

1315
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:21,440
looking for these records as well as

1316
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:23,200
looking at your facilities the private

1317
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,280
sector Auditors are going to be looking

1318
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,760
for these records as well as taking a

1319
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:30,799
look at these at your facilities and I

1320
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:33,599
would add if you end up ever end up with

1321
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:35,760
that ill consumer hopefully you never do

1322
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,799
but if you end up with that ill consumer

1323
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:40,280
and that consumer gets a lawyer and

1324
00:57:37,799 --> 00:57:42,920
comes to you and says your product was

1325
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,440
unsafe that lawyer is going to be

1326
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,520
looking at your documents as well and

1327
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,839
you're going to want to have those

1328
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,760
documents in place for the inspector

1329
00:57:48,839 --> 00:57:51,640
you're going to want to have those

1330
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:53,039
documents in place for the Auditors

1331
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:55,079
you're going to want to have those in

1332
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:58,559
documents in place to prove to the

1333
00:57:55,079 --> 00:58:00,559
lawyers prove to the court that you uh

1334
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:04,240
handled the food safety and you were not

1335
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,240
the cause of this person's

1336
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:09,240
illness that's right I we can't

1337
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:11,280
elaborate enough on this slide to keep

1338
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:13,839
your records and you might say well what

1339
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,520
kind of Records do I need I mean go back

1340
00:58:13,839 --> 00:58:18,200
up and look at the different examples

1341
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:20,920
that we gave you and you can start

1342
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,920
establishing little programs little

1343
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:25,400
prerequisite programs we call them you

1344
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:28,119
know pest control program you might Set

1345
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:29,680
uh traps or even have fly bait traps and

1346
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:31,680
you check them once a month that would

1347
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:34,119
be a record that you would keep you may

1348
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:37,079
keep that you started your production at

1349
00:58:34,119 --> 00:58:40,400
88 a.m. and you sanitized all of the Sur

1350
00:58:37,079 --> 00:58:42,359
food contact surfaces with uh your 200

1351
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:44,319
parts per million bleach solution I gave

1352
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:46,720
you that would be an example of a record

1353
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:48,880
you would start so we can't we can't

1354
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:53,000
stress the last slide this afternoon

1355
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:55,520
then is to say okay does my firm need to

1356
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,839
comply with all of these standards and

1357
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:00,160
the answer

1358
00:58:56,839 --> 00:59:03,559
some of our small firms no you don't but

1359
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:06,720
on the other hand the consumers are

1360
00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:09,920
beginning to expect the food industry to

1361
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:13,280
meet these standards even if you are not

1362
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:15,880
legally required by regulation to meet

1363
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:19,319
all these standards at this time I would

1364
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:22,880
suggest if you look to the Future begin

1365
00:59:19,319 --> 00:59:25,520
to uh take the time become familiar with

1366
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,640
these standards begin to adopt these

1367
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:30,440
standards in your practice in your

1368
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:33,640
business because at some point they will

1369
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,640
be upon all of

1370
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:42,240
us that's exactly right um you know

1371
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:45,520
anybody who is producing food for other

1372
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:48,200
people especially for profit at some

1373
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:51,359
point you are going to have some type of

1374
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:54,240
audit or requirements uh from a food

1375
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:57,319
safety inspection standard that that

1376
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:59,400
you'll have to undergo your business

1377
00:59:57,319 --> 01:00:01,680
so maybe not every one of these

1378
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:04,160
regulations applies but but the the

1379
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:06,960
standards are there that you should us

1380
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:08,720
