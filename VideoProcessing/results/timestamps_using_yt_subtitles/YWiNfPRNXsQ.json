  "text": "do you need to buy a used tractor hey I'm Mark Hall with Alabama Cooperative Extension system a lot of people are just getting started maybe getting started as an organic farmer or you've got land that you need to keep bush hog and you're paying somebody to Bush Hog and you wonder would it be cheaper to buy a tractor in a bush hog we're going to talk with Wayne Green who's a farmer in Lauderdale County and uh he's bought and sold equipment over the years and he's going to tell us about buying a lowcost tractor we're not talking about a gently used tractor we're talking about a tractor uh a low dollar tractor at a get started tractor just a maybe a limited use tractor why you tell us about buying a tractor what do you need to think about what do you need to look for and buying a used tractor you know I have Farmers that has five acres and some has 10 and some of them has 100 acres what size tractor they need what horsepower what's the most economical forum and uh so I try to help them with that uh this is a uh 30004 tractor which I'd recommend for somebody had 5 or 10 acres uh maybe you know to do a little tillage work or maybe uh bushhoging or stuff like that with it's a it's a real nice tractor what I usually look at when I buy a tractor I usually want to check the engine oil in it and see if the engine oil is good and clean in it and then I I try to check the tires and make sure the tires are very expensive now and see if the tires are good on it then I try to check the uh the steering on it make sure the steering is tied on it check your hydraulic lift I tried to see if it'll raise up and how fast it'll come up and uh check the PTO which is the pair takeoff that turns a bush hog if you're going to do any bush hogging with it what what is clean oil in a tractor this is the oil in this tractor if you notice here in the sun see how bright this oil is how pretty and bright it is put it on your finger it's got a pretty bright color so that tells me the oil in this engine you know is real clean yeah and you you can also tell by oil if you see a lot of flakes in it a lot of real shiny stuff like glitter yeah that means you've got an engine problem yeah if it's real black and dark the tractor has not been taken care of you know and you can always hold it out in the sun you know and and that all that light will show you what condition you're oil is in uh would there be anything else in the oil that you'd look for water or is is anything like that in issue usually if it's got water in your oil it's going to have a creamy milky type color so I would you know I would look for that too if it's got a creamy milky color it's got water in it okay if you see something green on the ground it's it's leaking antifreeze um and that can be very expensive if you got a radiator problem uh and you know your engine uh if you got most time if you say oil dripping you got a problem most older tractors 20 to 25 years old you going to have some oil seepage I mean you going to see a few light spots of oil as long as this just not dripping at a steady Pace you know it's not going to hurt anything and come up here and tell us a little bit about tires and what you look for on tires yes the tires on this tractor they're they're worn down they're probably about 30% and they've got a few dry cracks in them and things but on a small tractor like this it's not a lot of weight so most of the time this tire would probably last four or five years anyway so I wouldn't on the small tractor tires is probably not as important as they are on a bigger tractor with a lot of weight to them when is it too much play in your steering well when you you can always turn your steering wheel and before your Wheels start moving I mean you look at your two front wheels and before they start moving see how much if you turn your steering wheel like 3 to 4 Ines before your wheels move you know you got a lot of wear in your front end so that's going to have to be fixed it uh this tractor somebody has added the power steering to it and I would recommend if if you're buying a used tractor uh power steering is real good on one I mean you can make it without it but it makes it a lot easier you know to maneuver around with power steering four-wheel drive versus two wheel drive is that is that an issue it I you know I would recommend you know for most 5 to 10 acre Farmers I would recommend just a two wheel drive unless you got a front end loader on it then the four-wheel drive is does a lot better with the front end loader uh the Hydraulics with all tractors even a 35 horsepower tractor now would have hydraulics the majority of tractors do have hydraulics now um you hardly ever see a tractor now with hydraul without hydraulic system on it how how do you check what would a firsttime buyer how would they check to see if your Hydraulics are good would you look for a leak or the lift or talk to me a little bit yes I mean you can always let your tractor set and um set when your tractors running and see if it's any oil leaking out from under hydraulic oil and also your lift when you um pull your lever up or your lift to go up I mean the lift should go up pretty fast if it goes up real slow more than likely you got problems this is a lift system on this Traer um which you would use on a bushog uh see how fast this lifp goes up on this tractor it only takes like 10 to 15 seconds that tells me the Hydraulics are in real good condition on this tractor if you pull this lever and it takes like a minute for it to go up you got hydraulic problems which can be very expensive okay uh talk to me about the PTO yes checking your PTO on the tractor you need to to when you put your lever in into PTO you need to make sure the PTO starts turning immediately if it don't you probably got a problem or if the PTO will not shut off when you put the lever in the opposition you've got a problem so either one of those you know tells you you got a problem with your PTO if it comes on real fast and it stops good you know you're good this is a 540 shaft the 540 shaft has six splines around it like this it'll be six of them your 1,000 RPM shaft has 21 splines so uh that's the way you can tell the difference between the 540 and a th000 RPM shave is the splines on the shave one has six the other one has 21 if you're biner tractor and you have a cutter with a 540 shaft PTO shaft in your bush hog or bush hog cutter and you buy a tractor with a th000 RPM shaft that cutter will not work on this tractor you will uh you will either have to buy another cutter or buy another tractor and um and vice versa so you need to when you're buying a tractor you need to buy something you know that matches your cutter or buy a cutter that matches your tractor a what size bush hog would that pull I recommend a 5 foot for this this particular it's about a 35 or 6 horsepower tractor a 5ft bushog or Cutter does real good on this tractor at what point Acres wise would most people need to step up and get a bigger tractor a bigger bush hog well I think if you get up into maybe 20 or 25 or 30 Acres you know I would look at going like a 50 horse P tractor and may be getting a six foot cutter and um and if you got you know 30 or 40 acres I would probably try to go to a 50 or 60 horsepower tractor and get a seven or eight foot cutter so it's just according to how much time you want to spend out there using a cutter now this would be like if somebody had 100 acres they needed to keep bush hog yes this would be a pretty good tractor it would what what would you look for on a bigger tractor that you wouldn't what what what would be the issues specific to a higher horsepower tractor basically the same thing applies to a big tractor that does a small tractor you look under it for oil leaks and uh course this tractor uh it has a on it and I would always get in there and make sure the air conditioner works properly on it this tractor here um it comes with a with two PTO Shades in it so you can use uh two different uh implements on it this is a th000 RPM shave which is a 21 spline this is a 540 shaft with a six spline which gives you an option over the other tractor you can use uh either one on it so you don't have to worry about that this tractor has got hydraulic dual hydraulic vials uh like you can put a front end loader on this tractor and you already got your vial set up on it uh like pulling a big hay roller most people's got a 15t backwing cutter that they use with this type tractor uh it's a real good bush hog tractor it's it keeps you clean uh inside uh you don't have to worry about eating dust all day long and it's also cool in today's market you can spend from a range of maybe $3500 to $110,000 on a on a good Ed tractor it's really according them uh if you want a a tractor like this 3000 or you want a cow tractor with air on it you know uh you can it's a variety of tractors out there in this range and I tell people all time you buy a good used tractor 10 years from now it'll make you money because they go up every year because the new ones go up every year so they won't lose any money you can always turn around and resell it if you'll just take care of it Wayne thank you so much for that good advice and hopefully that'll help you in deciding whether you want to buy a used tractor or how to buy a good used tractor",
