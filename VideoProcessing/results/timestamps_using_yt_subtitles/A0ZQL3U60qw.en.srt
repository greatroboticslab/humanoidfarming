1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:07,729
bluetongue virus is transmitted to its

2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:11,900
ruminant host almost entirely by biting

3
00:00:07,729 --> 00:00:15,019
midges which we call curly coils so this

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:17,510
means it's a non contagious disease so

5
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:20,660
if you have an infected sheep which

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:25,220
shows clinical signs of blue tongue the

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:27,380
sheep next to it will not be infected by

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,259
the virus directly by passing on from

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:34,180
one sheep to the other the virus can

10
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:37,790
only transmit if the biological vector

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:41,680
Coleco despite images is around so the

12
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:44,329
virus and replicates in the insect and

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,059
eventually after a certain time period

14
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:49,820
it will reach the saliva gland and once

15
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:53,840
it has reached the saliva gland the next

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:57,170
time this now infected meat feeds on an

17
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,239
uninfected suitable mammalian host so in

18
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:03,220
the case of gluten again romulans sheep

19
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:06,740
cattle it can then transmit the virus

20
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,960
during that blood meal back into the

21
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:12,320
mammalian host and then the virus starts

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,310
its replication cycle in this host again

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,560
and this is a really intriguing

24
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:21,770
relationship because it doesn't function

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,960
as a mere needle transmission at all

26
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:27,500
there's more and more research for

27
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:30,260
examples that the saliva has a very

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:33,950
active role potentially in pathogen

29
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:37,010
transmission because these insects have

30
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:39,230
to salivate to stop blood correlation

31
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:41,060
and immune responses because if so

32
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,480
therefore live is come up surgical

33
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:46,010
active it could contains anticoagulants

34
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,340
because if they otherwise would try to

35
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:52,250
feed the blood would immediately clot

36
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,710
and then you can't take it up but by

37
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:56,690
having these bioactive molecules in

38
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:58,640
their saliva they can prevent this blood

39
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:01,520
clotting and they are able to take up a

40
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,220
blood meal because there it is a non

41
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,479
contagious transmission classical

42
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:10,610
methods we use like preventing contact

43
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:13,280
restricting animal movement although

44
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,310
they are still necessary they have a far

45
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,280
less in

46
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,620
act on a vector borne disease animal

47
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,440
movements are important to not dislocate

48
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,050
the virus throughout an entire country

49
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,490
so of course if you move the animal from

50
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,700
southern England to northern England you

51
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:33,120
could almost create a second outbreak

52
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:35,670
however on a local scale once the local

53
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,730
insect population is infected they will

54
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,040
say they will not stop you can restrict

55
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,830
herbs you can say excuse me you are now

56
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,489
on little interest rate so even if you

57
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:51,239
don't if you do have enemy movement

58
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:53,820
controls the moment that virus is in the

59
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,310
local insect population you have lost it

60
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:59,160
because it will still be able to be

61
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:03,930
transmitted those insects will still fly

62
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:06,810
and infect neighboring farms so this is

63
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,870
one of the challenges of dealing with a

64
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,930
vector borne transmitted pathogen and

65
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:15,150
this is why if your free country and

66
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,550
your fearing the incursion of a vector

67
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,410
borne disease it is so important to

68
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:23,459
catch it early because what you're

69
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:26,310
trying to do is find it and remove those

70
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:29,579
animals or or at least get them out of

71
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:32,640
being exposed to so many biting insects

72
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:34,769
before the local insect population is

73
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,380
completely infected the program

74
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:40,730
Institute has an insect er II where we

75
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,950
breed several insect species so

76
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:46,440
mosquitoes and some biting sized Moxa's

77
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:49,350
cats it runs and also Coulee coitus

78
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,079
biting images in our blue tongue

79
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,090
research which is mainly gluten

80
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,970
pathogenesis research or transmission

81
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:00,750
research or immune response and vaccine

82
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:04,320
research we do the vast majority of our

83
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:06,989
work with those mammalian hosts which

84
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:10,100
are really in which I in nature infected

85
00:04:06,989 --> 00:04:14,030
and affected by this virus so we use

86
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:16,799
sheep goat and cattle because if you

87
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:20,910
carry out research in something as

88
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,039
complex as pathogenesis so where is this

89
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,789
virus going and how is it causing

90
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:27,960
disease or something like the immune

91
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:31,350
response which

92
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,350
is very species specific we fear that it

93
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:37,590
is an incredibly advantage to actually

94
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:41,310
be able to use the host which is

95
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:44,880
affected by this disease we would obtain

96
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:48,810
our study animals like sheep or goats or

97
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,840
cattle from a commercial farm these are

98
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,460
normal and farm animals and at the

99
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,910
moment they come into our isolation

100
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,580
units they are incredibly monitored so

101
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:02,250
depending on which type of study we do

102
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,009
we would treat them we would give them

103
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:07,830
painkillers the one questions which is

104
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:10,530
often raised when we talk about our work

105
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:13,710
and describe our work is could we do our

106
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:16,349
research without using animals so we do

107
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:20,150
a lot of work with primary cell cultures

108
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:23,820
where we just get blood or samples from

109
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:27,330
animals which which are put down any way

110
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:32,000
to establish primary cells to establish

111
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:34,979
organ cultures and we carry out

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,699
infection studies of these cells we even

113
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:40,770
we have a project where we also assess

114
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:43,320
the response of these cells to insect

115
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:45,000
saliva to already get an idea what is

116
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,710
going on what kind of cytokines are

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,960
being made how do they respond is

118
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,120
different when the virus is only says

119
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,460
with and without meat saliva so we have

120
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,389
developed a method to collect Mitch

121
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:59,759
saliva or making them making them spit

122
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:02,509
into a fill time we can wash off the

123
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:07,409
saliva so we have a really active

124
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:11,840
project to get our research to a level

125
00:06:07,409 --> 00:06:15,570
as high as we can by not using animals

126
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,219
but there's only so fast we can go when

127
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,860
it comes to big questions like

128
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:23,250
transmission when it comes to big

129
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:25,710
question like is this vaccine safe is

130
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:28,979
this vaccine efficient how does the

131
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:31,380
enemy respond upon challenge we cannot

132
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:35,130
carry out this work without the use of

133
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:38,460
life and animals the vertebrate immune

134
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:40,000
system is way too complex that we could

135
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:44,590
ever

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,230
hope to replicate that fully in their

137
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:50,110
modern systems there's always going to

138
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:52,390
be a step where we need the animal

139
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,060
research because I just if you just

140
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:58,270
think of how for example an insect borne

141
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:00,610
virus is transmitted with insect blood

142
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,860
feeding in the skin the skin is one of

143
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,660
our is the biggest organ we have and is

144
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,460
one of the complicated the most

145
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:08,740
complicated organ we have and then you

146
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:11,140
have blood vessels bringing all these

147
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:15,190
cells and responding and then it gets

148
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:18,430
distributed to the entire body this

149
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:21,430
level of complexity would almost be

150
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:24,730
impossible to create in an artificial

151
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:28,450
situation and of all you can take it so

152
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:31,180
far and reduce the numbers which is the

153
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,790
alternative goal there will always be

154
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:37,840
questions where we need the whole

155
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:41,740
organism so currently the work we do on

156
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:45,220
gluten virus we use about twenty to

157
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:47,620
thirty animals a year occasionally when

158
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,750
there is an outbreak of bruton virus for

159
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,970
example in in a country where this has

160
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:55,300
never been or there is a strain which is

161
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:57,729
emerging which we don't know then there

162
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:00,430
is the potential to do like an emergency

163
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:03,900
study to be able to characterize the

164
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:06,610
pathogenesis of this virus and to foster

165
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,650
vaccine development for this particular

166
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,330
strength

167
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:13,510
there are several vaccines against

168
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:16,180
bluetongue virus and to understand why

169
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,790
we are still concerned about developing

170
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:22,270
other vaccines for gluten virus we need

171
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:25,630
to look a bit at this virus so the virus

172
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:28,030
has 27 serotypes so far we have

173
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:31,330
discovered at the moment but they keep

174
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:34,320
finding more and the problem we have is

175
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:37,780
it the protection or the immune response

176
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,839
upon either infection or vaccination is

177
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:43,419
serotype specific so what that means is

178
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:46,240
if you wax in it against the pt8 you're

179
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:48,350
cheap and your cow is only protected

180
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,770
against bt8

181
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:55,610
it is still susceptible to 26 other

182
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:59,140
gluten strengths so the vaccines which

183
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:03,530
are available are in Northern Europe

184
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:06,350
inactivated vaccines that is they're

185
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:08,180
safe and they are efficient and they

186
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:11,630
have been used successfully to for

187
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:16,880
example eradicate bluetongue virus 8

188
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:19,850
from the UK a few years ago but they are

189
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,610
only there monotypic so they will only

190
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:25,670
protect against the stream hence they

191
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:28,880
are fine in a situation where you combat

192
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:30,590
a single stream incursion it gets more

193
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,000
problematic when you're in a country

194
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:35,840
which has said those dreams of

195
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,240
bluetongue virus circling one big area

196
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:40,640
for the research is to try to find out

197
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,850
how can we get across ferrotype

198
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:46,370
protective vaccine because in countries

199
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:49,430
like India where bluetongue virus still

200
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:51,560
has a big impact on subsistence farmers

201
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:56,090
especially in the south they have 10 15

202
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:59,650
20 strains of operatin virus circling so

203
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:04,280
a lot of endemic countries use and

204
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:06,530
modified lights attenuated vaccines so

205
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,840
they have several strains of life virus

206
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:10,340
however it has been shown that they can

207
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,040
reach levels which makes them

208
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:16,510
transmissible so midges can actually

209
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,930
pick up the vaccine strain and then

210
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:23,030
testing some of them in British breeds

211
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:24,830
they also induce clinical signs so while

212
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,170
some indigenous breeds have clearly

213
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:30,890
avoid stress disease and do not get sick

214
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:33,350
to these vaccines anymore we did not use

215
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:35,210
them in northern Europe because we could

216
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,190
show that to certain preparations they

217
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:41,240
would still induce clinical disease in

218
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:44,270
in the country so then when we test for

219
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:46,040
antibodies we don't know does this

220
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:47,990
animal have antibodies because it got

221
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,410
vaccinated or does this animal have

222
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,790
antibodies because it was infected at

223
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:56,540
one point during their life so that

224
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:58,970
makes control very difficult and then

225
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,700
another area with inactivated vaccines

226
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:06,460
is although if they are applied

227
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:08,170
well in time their protect against the

228
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,050
challenge of the virus the immune

229
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:13,780
response is relatively slow so an animal

230
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,940
is protected or she probably after 3-4

231
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:19,150
weeks castle at the moment need to

232
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:23,440
dosages so that would mean probably six

233
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:25,630
weeks until they are protected so if you

234
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,000
think of an emergency vaccination where

235
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:30,010
the virus is already active you could

236
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,380
find yourself in a situation where that

237
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:34,930
induction of immune response isn't quick

238
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,840
enough developing better vaccine which

239
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:41,460
might be quicker might again shorten

240
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:44,230
that risk if you need to use a vaccine

241
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:48,370
preparation as an emergency response so

242
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:51,250
these are all drivers for improving the

243
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:54,430
vaccine although in a in a one strain

244
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:57,070
outbreak situation and applied well

245
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:59,620
before the virus really gets going the

246
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:02,800
current inactivated vaccine available

247
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:06,100
for gluten will protect your enemies and

248
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:10,690
and is a good is a good way of

249
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:12,610
protecting your enemies another very

250
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:15,760
important component of this virus which

251
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:20,770
is crucial to understand is that it is

252
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:24,840
segmented so its genome is arranged in

253
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:28,240
segments and what that means is if two

254
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:31,270
strains of bluetongue infect oneself

255
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:35,620
they can swap things a bit like

256
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:39,190
influenza okay so we create this virus

257
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:44,050
not only creates variation by mutation

258
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:47,200
it creates variation by changing genome

259
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:49,000
segments which we call reassortant the

260
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,270
immune response to this virus is

261
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,030
monotypic so it is specifically to the

262
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:58,480
zero type other characteristics however

263
00:12:55,030 --> 00:13:02,140
our strain specific so we can have a

264
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,830
mild or moderate or virulent strain of

265
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:09,550
for example bt v1 so when we have a new

266
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:12,010
outbreak we buy serotypes have no clue

267
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,630
what this strain is going to do just

268
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:15,670
because it's a Vth strain

269
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:18,160
does not mean it will be a very long

270
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:20,050
string we have to monitor we have to see

271
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,210
and sometimes we even have to do an

272
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:24,040
element experiment to understand which

273
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:26,410
what kind of strain are we dealing with

274
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,810
is this a virulent strain it is a male

275
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,390
stream how quickly do we need to get a

276
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:35,620
vaccine out or if this is a mud stream

277
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:38,260
can we let this go and this can

278
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:42,220
obviously change very very quickly with

279
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:45,040
reassortant so you could have a mild

280
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,760
beat anyone strain circling and a

281
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,520
virulent

282
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,280
Vth strange circling and then they

283
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:54,420
infect the same enemy and suddenly they

284
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,890
swap this genome segment which is

285
00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:00,790
responsible for the serotypes let's say

286
00:13:56,890 --> 00:14:02,920
BT one but then the virulence is on

287
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:05,800
other segments and suddenly you have a

288
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:09,130
new btv one because your BT v8 strain

289
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,500
has now got that segment from BT one but

290
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:15,340
it has remained all the virulence of the

291
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:18,520
other segments which inside really maked

292
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:21,640
BT v8 but on the outside it has now

293
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:24,160
become meet anyone however it still does

294
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,560
mutate and it does mutate in this

295
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,840
segment this segment tool which encodes

296
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,450
for the outer coat protein which defines

297
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:35,710
the zero type and this is why we have 27

298
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:38,890
zero times but the strain landscape is

299
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:41,500
far more complex because it can chop and

300
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:45,210
change all the other segments and

301
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:48,430
therefore render a vaccination campaign

302
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:50,880
useless within the exchange of one

303
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,880
genomes

304
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:59,829
you
