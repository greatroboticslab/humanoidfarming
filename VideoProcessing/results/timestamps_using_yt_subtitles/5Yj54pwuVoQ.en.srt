1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,240
what is a tractor PTO we're going to

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,080
tell you all about it today as always

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,160
we're sponsored by Bora wheel spacers

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,519
they are made in America have a lifetime

5
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,000
warranty if your tractor feels Tippy

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,559
side to side especially if you have a

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,200
cab on it then adding a set of wheel

8
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,559
spacers can make a big difference get

9
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,160
more information on them at the link

10
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:18,880
down below all right so this button

11
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,119
right here yellow button sometimes is

12
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,760
something you push but in this situation

13
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,920
here you're going to pull on it that is

14
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,279
your PTO knob it's going to engage and

15
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,400
turn on the PTO if your tractor is on so

16
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,800
let's define a PTO what that stands for

17
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,800
is a power

18
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,239
takeoff I can see where they're going

19
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,040
with it so basically what that means is

20
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,160
you're going to have a an output shaft

21
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,600
either underneath here on a mid PTO or a

22
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,120
rear PTO a set of splines and so when

23
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,480
you tie in a PTO shaft on an attachment

24
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,640
to it it's then going to provide Power

25
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,800
so it's taking off power uh from the

26
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,440
main shaft here and so I think maybe

27
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,559
that's why they call it a power takeoff

28
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,680
but I didn't come up with it so we're

29
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,760
going to roll with it all right so

30
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,800
diving a little deeper into how a PTO

31
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,640
works and what it's all about you can

32
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,199
compare it to a Bel drive system or to a

33
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,040
hydraulic motor there's other ways to

34
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,439
power attachments that might be on a

35
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,119
piece of equipment many simplistic or

36
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,640
more basic lawn mowers for example are

37
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,720
going to have belt drive mowers on there

38
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,320
so that's a different way to power an

39
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,520
attachment like a lawn mower and that's

40
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,280
typically going to be a cheaper way to

41
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,080
go about it now on the flip side one of

42
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,240
the more expensive ways to power an

43
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,759
attachment is going to be like what you

44
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,479
see on my skid steer if I want to drive

45
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,159
a multure head or a brush hog on my skid

46
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:28,960
steer that's all going to be using

47
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,439
hydraulic power hydraulic pumps and

48
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,200
motors and those are very expensive

49
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,040
going to really raise the cost off

50
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,560
typically you see that on more like

51
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,720
construction equipment not really on

52
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,040
tractors and not on lawn mes either so

53
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,000
you have different options with belt

54
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,960
driven PTO driven and hydraulic motor

55
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,719
driven the commonality is that with any

56
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,600
of those systems you need an engine to

57
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,799
initiate that power all right and so

58
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,000
that's where in the PTO system it's all

59
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,520
coming from Power generated off of the

60
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,840
engine it starts here it works its way

61
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,640
back through an output shaft in a way

62
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,600
similar to the PTO shaft that drives the

63
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,000
back to the transaxle all right now in

64
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,320
simplistic terms there's just a lot of

65
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,479
gearing in here to get to the right

66
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,119
ratios the right speeds and then that

67
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,360
ties into a small output shaft for the

68
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,720
mid PTO and then also a larger output

69
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,239
shaft for the rear PTO now I'm not a

70
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,280
super technical guy so we're not going

71
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,920
to get into all the details but it is a

72
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:22,440
Marvel of engineering if you think about

73
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,040
it because the output shaft for the PTO

74
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,680
on the backside so your rear PTO is

75
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,239
going to be a standardized 540 RPMs for

76
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,519
all of you subcompact and compact

77
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:34,400
tractor owners now for your mid PTO it's

78
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,120
typically going to be around 2100 RPMs

79
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,599
that will vary a little bit from

80
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,040
manufacturer to manufacturer like a

81
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,720
johnar versus Kabota versus Mahindra

82
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,879
that kind of thing but the thing with

83
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,440
mid PTO is that typically those are

84
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,159
going to be for your belly mowers all

85
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,360
right and so belly mowers are very

86
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,959
specific to a tractor brand and a

87
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,720
tractor model you can't just go buy a

88
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,640
generic belly mower and slap it on any

89
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,480
old tractor that's going to be specific

90
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,840
from the manufacturer whereas on a

91
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,280
three-point hitch there's a slew just a

92
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,800
whole world of attachment Brands and

93
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,400
manufacturers and companies out there

94
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,360
that you can get and since the

95
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,400
three-point hitch and the PTO are all

96
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,159
standardized back here you have a lot of

97
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,560
options now sometimes I don't want to

98
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,920
confuse you too much but you are going

99
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:17,080
to hear the term front PTO so we have

100
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,440
rear PTO the 540 we talked about mid PTO

101
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,239
the 2100 RPM give or take that we talked

102
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,840
about and then this front PTO now I know

103
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,799
there's always exceptions to the rule

104
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,480
but I can't think of any right now and

105
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:31,239
typically when you have a front PTO it's

106
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,159
actually a kit that runs off of the mid

107
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:34,680
PTO all right and a really good example

108
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,640
for this is if you get a front mounted

109
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,080
snowblower so you can get a 47 or a 54in

110
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,360
front mount blower for the John Deere

111
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,920
1025r So when you buy that kit from your

112
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,159
dealer and again just like that belly

113
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,959
mower the front blowers are typically

114
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:49,319
very specific to the model of tractor uh

115
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:51,599
to the brand of tractor that kind of

116
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:53,319
thing you can't grab a a front mounted

117
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,480
snowblower from cabota and put it on a

118
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:57,319
John Deere without having some major

119
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,120
fabrication skills so when you get that

120
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:00,519
blower you get a whole kit for it all

121
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,680
right you get a Qui kits you get these

122
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,439
other brackets that mount on there uh

123
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,439
reverse override sensors some other

124
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:07,959
little adapters and things like that and

125
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:10,120
then the important thing is you get a

126
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:12,079
long PTO shaft that's going to mount

127
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,959
into a carrier bearing up here but

128
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,840
connect back to the same spot that your

129
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:18,120
mid-mount mower your belly mower would

130
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,720
connect to so you're technically running

131
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,560
it off of the mid PTO and driving your

132
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,600
front snowblower so from what I know

133
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,199
about PTO shafts is that when tractors

134
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,919
were really designed to be used on farms

135
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,199
you know Farmers aren't the the rich

136
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,240
folk in the world right so they wanted

137
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,080
to have a good reliable solution that

138
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,520
was pretty well foolproof robust easy to

139
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,800
use just didn't break down right so I

140
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,199
think those reasons are why you still

141
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,880
see PTO shafts on tractors today because

142
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,960
they're just they're simple to use

143
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,199
they're really reliable they're really

144
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,600
strong you seldom have an issue with it

145
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,199
if you do it's relegated to a couple of

146
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,800
specific models that maybe were known to

147
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,199
be problematic or it could be something

148
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,919
like a selenoid issue which is going to

149
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,520
be one of the more common problems with

150
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,919
the PTO if you have a selenoid that's

151
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,240
not clicking and and working and

152
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:04,080
functioning like it should to activate

153
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,680
or turn it off that kind of thing but

154
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,400
seldom seldom are you going to have an

155
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,840
issue with the PTO itself hey now I know

156
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,680
a lot of you are going to struggle with

157
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,800
connecting to your PTO shaft on your

158
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,520
tractor so we made a whole video All

159
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,639
About tips to help make that process

160
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,840
easier I'd encourage you to check it out

161
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,720
there's also going to be a product you

162
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,440
can get to make that connection process

163
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,720
easier you're staring at it right here

164
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,199
it's the PTO link by tractor PTO

165
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:28,960
link.com you go to their website to buy

166
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:31,160
it use code GWT to save 5% off of your

167
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,240
order but this is going to move that

168
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,240
connection point out further to a more

169
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,919
accessible location on your tractor

170
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,240
going to take a lot of pain out of the

171
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,600
process this is a maiden America company

172
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,440
all right so a high quality this is all

173
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,280
machined all around here very high

174
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,919
quality solution you can save some money

175
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,919
again with code GWT so really one of the

176
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,319
big things that sets this system apart

177
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,199
from the others that are out there is it

178
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,120
doesn't require any tools to install it

179
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,919
all right so John Deere has a system

180
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,919
where you actually have to take off you

181
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,840
have to take apart the ujin on your your

182
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,520
attachments and replace it with this

183
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,600
system there's another system out there

184
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,080
that does require tools to install this

185
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,400
is really easy guys it really is you

186
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,440
just line this side up with your PTO

187
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,240
splines you pop it

188
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,919
on just like a regular attachment and

189
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,400
then it's there in place good to go that

190
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:20,759
was one-handed by the way if you didn't

191
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,800
notice this one here same thing on your

192
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,520
attachment you just hold it up twist it

193
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,080
in there pull the collar back on your

194
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,400
attachment I am using two hands but

195
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,880
that's it all right pop it in there and

196
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,599
you're good to go so for ease of

197
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,120
illustration I'm holding it here showing

198
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:36,759
you but this is the tractor side that's

199
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,120
going to be on there this is the

200
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,960
attachment side all right so your normal

201
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,919
PTO splines you have six different

202
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,360
splines that you have to line up with

203
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:46,599
very little play in between there it's

204
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,000
got to be exactly right so you're taking

205
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:50,440
it down to only four points to line up

206
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,440
so it just makes a little easier and

207
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,759
they're going to have a little bit more

208
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,919
play in it so you just have to line them

209
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,080
up just somewhat just kind of match it

210
00:06:54,919 --> 00:06:59,000
up they're going to have some play they

211
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,720
lock into place and you can see this is

212
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,599
just a spring loaded pin all right so

213
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,479
that pops into place as well helps lock

214
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:06,560
it there and then they do include one

215
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,039
extra retainer pin that this is going to

216
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,199
be the attachment side all right you'll

217
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,879
just pop it through I think right here

218
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,639
yep get that through you're locked in

219
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:17,440
place you're good to go again visit

220
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,440
tractor PTO link.com save 5% with code

221
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,360
GWT all right so that gives you a pretty

222
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,039
good General understanding of what a PTO

223
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,440
is all about but there's still a few

224
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,400
critical things to know to make sure

225
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,919
that you're using it the right way so

226
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,520
the first thing to know is what your PTI

227
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,120
horsepower is all right and so you

228
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,759
generally think of your engine

229
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,039
horsepower whether that's your car your

230
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,759
boat your tractor you're thinking of

231
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:40,000
just the engine horsepower but as you

232
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,400
take the power from the engine and drive

233
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,400
it all the way through the system out to

234
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,479
the output shafts on the PTO whether

235
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,400
it's the the rear or the mid you're

236
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:49,720
losing some power it's not 100%

237
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,080
efficiency for example just nominal

238
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,400
numbers you have 25 horsepower at the

239
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,080
engine on this tractor but the PTO

240
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,479
horsepower at the output there is going

241
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,560
to be 18 so you're losing 7 horsepower

242
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,080
25 to 18 and on smaller tractors it's a

243
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,039
smaller difference right but if you go

244
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,319
to a 60 horsepower or a 70 horsepower

245
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,800
tractor or something larger well on a 60

246
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:11,720
horsepower you may only have 48 you know

247
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,800
or 50 horsepower at the PTO so you're

248
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,560
going to lose 10 or 12 horsepower that

249
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,680
way and not to muddy the waters too much

250
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,840
but there is going to be a difference

251
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,240
between hydrostatic machines and Gear

252
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,360
Drive machines you're going to lose more

253
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,639
horsepower with a hydro machine because

254
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,720
part of that power is going to the

255
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,280
hydrostatic system whereas a Gear Drive

256
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,319
is just a more simplistic drive system

257
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,680
all around and so your losses at the

258
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,599
rear PTO aren't as significant right

259
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,440
here you have a PTO driven snowblower on

260
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,800
the back of our tractor so that PTO

261
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,320
shaft is driving the augur that as

262
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,159
you're moving forward this is a pull

263
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,959
type snowblower so as you move forward

264
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,040
this augur spins around because it's

265
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:47,920
being powered by the PTO shaft it

266
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,640
collects that snow and drives it up

267
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,720
through the shoe and and shoots it out

268
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,040
so you need to be able to size your

269
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,680
attachment to the amount of PTO

270
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,000
horsepower that you have all right so

271
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,240
other things come into play as well you

272
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,040
have to have a three-point hitch system

273
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,680
that is strong enough to lift up the

274
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,120
attachment as well but any good

275
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,519
manufacturer is going to have that

276
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,920
information available all right so

277
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,440
they're going to offer this snowblower

278
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:14,120
and 54 you know 60 incremental segments

279
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,800
all the way up to probably 7 8T wide

280
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,839
okay and so all those different sizes of

281
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,920
attachments are going to have a

282
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,680
different range of PTO horsepower that

283
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,839
they can work with all right so maybe

284
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,560
it's 18 horsepower up to 30 horsepower

285
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,040
and for a bigger one maybe it's 40

286
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,640
horsepower minimum up to 100 horsepower

287
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,920
maximum so for that range or sometimes

288
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,920
you may only see a minimum or only a

289
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,480
maximum if the gearbox is not going to

290
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,279
be affected by anything else but many

291
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,440
attachments like a brush hog for example

292
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,160
are going to have a gearbox on them and

293
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,120
we just talked about the dirt dog uh

294
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,880
brush Hogs recently and they have a 60

295
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,200
horsepower rated gearbox so that means

296
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,480
at the PTO they're rated to be used on a

297
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,920
machine with up to 60 horsepower coming

298
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,560
out of there all right now to get you in

299
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,399
the right ballpark take a look at this

300
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,680
setup here so it's typically not always

301
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,600
but typically going to work out that a P

302
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,680
driven three-point attachment is going

303
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,399
to match up with the width or be really

304
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,519
darn close to the width of your tractor

305
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,800
and that's the case here our tractor is

306
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,560
uh 48 in wide we have a 54in wide

307
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,519
snowblower so it hangs out 3 in wider on

308
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,240
either side and this is a great fit for

309
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,000
this machine so if you are completely

310
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,079
lost with what size attachment to get

311
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,920
measure the width of your tractor and

312
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:24,680
then find an attachment that's roughly

313
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,959
the same size and then at that point you

314
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,000
can kind of drill down deeper if you

315
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,000
need to look at the PTO ratings see if

316
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,600
it's going to match up with what you

317
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,160
need or if you need to go a size down or

318
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,959
a size larger all right and while I've

319
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,480
got your attention just a few quick tips

320
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,160
and pointers so pay attention if you

321
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,360
don't know much about PTO shafts but

322
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,399
there's a lot of parts of the system

323
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,040
that are actually there to protect you

324
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,880
okay but number one is often times

325
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,880
depending on your tractor if you hop off

326
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,800
the tractor seat with the PTO engag it's

327
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,399
going to kill the tractor and that's a

328
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,120
safety mechanism so that you're not

329
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:52,440
driving a belly mower you know all

330
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,320
across the lawn into the house into

331
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,720
Landscaping into whatever else it is

332
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,720
that it's not supposed to be so that's

333
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,160
safety item number one now right in this

334
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,760
area there's three more safety features

335
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,480
as well number one on the tractor you're

336
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,079
going to have this shroud that goes up

337
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,800
and down you can lift it up to help make

338
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:08,720
it easier to connect to your attachment

339
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,279
and then you're going to have this

340
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,800
plastic cover that goes over top it's

341
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,639
free floating like this all right

342
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,720
because this is not or you don't want it

343
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,800
to spin with the actual steel shaft

344
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,200
that's inside of it there so and to help

345
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,519
prevent that from spinning at a certain

346
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,079
point you can see these chains all right

347
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:26,079
so these chains are meant to hold the

348
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,880
shaft in place at a certain point it

349
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,800
won't spin any further once it gets

350
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,519
there and so this one we actually broke

351
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,160
off um sometime recently I don't know

352
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,120
when exactly but that's part of the

353
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,959
downside of these chains is they are

354
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,279
kind of flimsy and they will break and

355
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:41,040
so often times you're going to see it

356
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,399
like this where this is free spinning so

357
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,880
the thing is you don't ever want to get

358
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,160
tangled up down here in fact there's

359
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,800
this nasty looking picture uh of this

360
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,160
guy completely wrapped around his PTO

361
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,279
shaft all right so uh that's the idea

362
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,639
Safety First we've done a lot of videos

363
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:55,800
on on tractor safety PTO safety so make

364
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,680
sure you check those out and watch them

365
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,120
too all right so PTO shafts are going to

366
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,800
be a two-part unit so you have an inner

367
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,320
and an outer uh section that slide over

368
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,839
top of one another and it's going to be

369
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,639
at its shortest point when it's

370
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,399
perfectly level all right so anytime

371
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,160
it's moving up above that or down below

372
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,360
that it needs to lengthen out and if it

373
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,880
was one piece well you'd be ripping

374
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,639
something apart and so that's why you

375
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,000
have to have it slide over top of one

376
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,760
another and you don't want to cut the

377
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,399
shaft too long or Too Short if it's too

378
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,360
short you potentially risk that shaft

379
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,839
completely coming apart and if it's too

380
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,160
long once you get to your shortest setup

381
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,199
so as you go from a little bit longer

382
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,480
like it's sitting on the ground right

383
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:34,040
now as you raise that up it's going to

384
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,600
get a little bit shorter and if you had

385
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,800
it cut too long it could potentially

386
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,880
bind up and if it's operating really

387
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,600
wreak havoc and if it's even if it's off

388
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,240
it can still bend that PTO shaft a

389
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,000
little bit so there's a sweet spot

390
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,360
reference the manual that comes with

391
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,120
whatever attachment is that you get

392
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,800
there's a lot of information online

393
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,120
these things are easy to cut down to you

394
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,959
can cut it down with a hacksaw or a saww

395
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,440
very easy to do just follow those

396
00:12:53,959 --> 00:12:56,560
instructions and you'll be good to go

397
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,440
well that's going to wrap it up for us

398
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,920

399
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,000
