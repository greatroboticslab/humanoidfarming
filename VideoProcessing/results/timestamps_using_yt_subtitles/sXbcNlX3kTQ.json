  "text": "hi i'm wayne this is emily and we're just going to show you how to milk a cow we've been out here about seven years and we're really bad when we started we're not experts so i'd love it if you know more than us you could put in the comments some tips on how to milk but basically we're gonna give it a go we've got some green clover here because she loves that as a treat and a bit of loosen for after we're finished so we'll give her a little treat before she starts just to make sure she comes up and is ready for the milking so we don't have to go and get her hello jet fighter how are you today hey how are you i just put this rope around her neck as a way of saying boy sit swampy sit phoebe not good having the dogs too close swampy back go back sit good boy sit so this rope is just the way of saying to her when you got this rope around your neck stands still don't move i'm trying to train her can you move back a bit lauren because she's interested in you that's better beautiful what's this camera you you like the camera do you jet fighter so the first little bit's just relaxing us so give a little scratch and um rub down with a brush but the dogs got our brush a couple of days ago so we don't have it and you you want a milk or holder you hold it today in the past i've tied this to a star post and that keeps her still but i'm trying to train jet fighter to stand still with no post so that we can just milk her without tying her up so she hasn't learned it yet but that's the aim when you're giving her a rub down it's good to give her a rub under her tummy and down near her utter just so that she starts getting used to it so she had her first car just there about two weeks ago so she hasn't been milked before two weeks so she's still learning when you first start to milk her um don't just go and grab the teeth because i think they're a little bit ticklish so if i just go and grab the teeth from nowhere oh she's not going to do it she might kick so don't just do that sort of work your way around make it feel comfortable and then down to it is a better way when you're starting we don't let her eat at all from the grass while we're melting just as a way of um so she doesn't move around and she loves a big scratch around her ears and on a hairy bit all this is just part of relaxing ara and if she gets the point of chewing a cud she's really relaxed that's good okay jet fighter i'm gonna milk you now thank you so first thing is this is fairly warm water actually this is a bit too warm today just gonna wipe her uttering teeth clean thank you jet fighter this is just in case there's any dirt she's been sleeping on it oh hey that fighter see how she flicked me before she kicks with her foot that's just the flicks the way of saying hey i don't like that i've got to listen to her tail flicks see how there's just a bit of a bit of gut comes off there i like to give it a good a good clean because we don't pass dry some milk we just drink it raw so you want this all nice and clean so no hit bits of hair and things fall in great good girl next thing so dry it off draw my hands it's with another old nappy good girl jet fighter right now people use various things on the teats to moisturize them we use some coconut oil so the coconut oil has been sitting in the hot water that that melts it and i just put a bit on each teat so coconut oil is also a mild antifungal antibacterial kind of thing so it does stop infections a little bit so it's really good also the first thing and i do it now before i get the bucket is that first bit of milk in each tea you just squirt out onto the ground because if there are any bits of bacteria or yucky sitting in the end of the teat you don't want that in your milk so a couple of squirts from each tape i'm a bit of a i like to do this too i do a couple of squirts in the bucket give it a little rinse out don't have to do that this bucket's been sterilized with boiling water and then we start milking so bucket there what she may do is try and put this foot forward and if she does it'll kick that bucket so i'm ready to grab the bucket and hold her foot if she does do that and emily's gonna sing because she loves singing all the cows love singing and they relax more so you're gonna sing there emily beautiful and so there's two ways of milking one is you grab the top and then squeeze it out like you grab the top and then squeeze it out like that but i the other way is just stripping it and because her teeth are short i think stripping's better so so what you don't want is the milk from here getting pushed back up into the udder so the worst thing is just squeezing it because if you squeeze it you might be actually pushing the milk up way through a one-way valve and plus if there's any bacteria in the right in the end of the teat you might be pushing that up into the really clean udder so you always go down that's why when you're starting stripping it's almost impossible to go backwards when you're stripping whereas if you're doing this way if you ex if you haven't gripped it hard enough there and then you squeeze this one it might squeeze it back up so if you're starting the stripping is good as i'm starting i'm just like i'll do the front two teats i'll try the back teeth there and the other back teeth right so i'm feeling that these front two feel fairly empty so they're the ones the calf probably drank off this back one's really full so i'm going to make sure that i'm always milking from that back one because it's going to right and then you just milk how's she going up there emily she's chewing a card not yet but she's um getting there some little tips i think they like it with if you go in with your head like this and just rest on them don't know why i find the most comfortable way to sit is just crouching like this actually but some people like a stool um a little craft over there having a nibble on the listen oh the teats don't all squirt down so if i just squirt this one it sort of goes back so that means i have to sort of point it down so if i pull it this way it'll point down this this teat it does pretty right direction this back teeth it's going to squirt way out there so i have to pull it this way as i'm milking so that it goes into the bucket so you just sort of if the teeth are squirting that way you milk it this way see so the bottom's facing the right way you work that out now if you have little tips for me i'd love it because we've only learnt out of books and from youtube so uh so there you go i'm jet fighter this is lovely today hello how you doing how are you today jet fighter this is lovely milk she's staying pretty still today sometimes you can feel her weight shift forward which means she's going to take a step which isn't good and you've got to sort of be ready to move the bucket see that there how i had to move the bucket away and keep her leg back no jet fighter that's not very nice okay no kicking please when she does kick i try and go back to milking in exactly the same way that i was on the same teats just so that she learns if she kicks she doesn't get any change otherwise she'll get trained to kick to teach me to move so whatever i was doing when she kicked unless it was particularly hurting her i'd go straight back to doing it what's that flip about so see the milk there that's about oh what are you doing there jet fighter no clicking please about a quarter of a bucket so far so we're a quarter of the way through so so that's there you go emily um so hey jet fighter was that about jet fighter it's not very good thank you i've had a few squirts here where i've got milk on my finger like that see what i hold your finger up if your fingers down you get milk on it now because i've got milk on it some of the oils wiped off it's actually getting a bit dry up here so i'm gonna put a bit more oil on hello getting a bit more oil um this teat's got a bit of a cut on the exact other side of it so when you've got a cut you sort of got to try and get it so that you're not squeezing on the cut what's happening jet fighter oh she's interested in the bucket back please leg back come on hey good girl you don't go wandering off like that you got a bit of a boogie in your nose today so this hey [Music] so so oh [Music] me um good morning [Music] head back emily thank you just hold her head we're basically trying to train her to sit there patiently and not eat and not move so the reason we have two people is because um she's only been milking two weeks so she's not trained i would like to get to the point where i come down and milk her without emily or emily milton without me and she just stands there don't know if that'll work but so so so what's that about i don't know thank you so so mmm so so so so emily foreign [Music] my there's only two warning kicks there and then [Music] this front teeth it's just about running out very central see how it's getting thinner so that others nearly empty there it's got none left see that so you're good it's good to strip it dry like that so that well it's not so important when there's a calf on but especially if there's no calf and you want to get them all dry like that so there's no milk left so that there's less chance of mastitis that other front ones nearly finished too yeah it's finished so that one's finished not much there if you rub that other you might get a little bit more milk down not much great now it's just the back two oh that was flickers because i'm back on this sore one with the cut on it now this is just milking this back one only one left so we finished um [Music] hey we're nearly finished but not quite thanks jet fighter she's ready to go nearly finished their jet fighter oh this one's got a cut on it can you see there yeah yeah calf cutter so i want to make sure that i do empty this one out because i've found that if there is one that's gonna good they're all finished now all empty great there we go a nice big bucket of milk put our coconut milk away now i like to put that away before the dogs get it okay good girl thank you for your milk today that's got a little bit of dolomite and mineral mix in there i think it has sulfur selenium magnesium zinc bloody black just a really basic trace mineral mix to make sure she gets what she needs okay there you go beautiful milk to have iced coffees and yogurt and cream and coffee and thank you jet fighter good job good job good girl hey yeah you're a good girl thank you for your milk today don't forget if you've got any tips on what we're doing wrong and how we could make the milking better give us a little comment",
