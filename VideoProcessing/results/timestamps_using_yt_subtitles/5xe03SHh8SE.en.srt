1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,200
i'm chantal i'm a retired physician

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,200
and i'm a moon gardener

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,000
[Music]

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,759
luna gardening is something that's been

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,320
going on for centuries

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,440
farmers have developed it but it's

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,039
become more of a

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:24,880
quote-unquote science i started planting

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:28,400
according to the lunar cycles

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:32,000
i have found that by putting it into

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,160
practice things grow much faster

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,920
than they would otherwise and i think

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,480
what it's got to do

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,520
is that to do with putting yourself in

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,879
sync

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,079
with the rhythms of the seasons and the

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,800
rhythms of the earth

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,360
and the rhythms of planting and i think

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,160
that

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,800
when you put yourself in sync with the

21
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:56,559
seasons when you're in touch with nature

22
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,280
you feel different you are more grounded

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,640
it's a different feeling and i think

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,479
that that's what

25
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,439
permeates this garden as a result of the

26
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,760
fact that

27
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,040
this garden is on a street corner

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,840
there's a lot

29
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,400
of foot traffic around it i don't have a

30
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,320
fence

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,640
so it doesn't make any sense for me to

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,240
try to keep things to myself

33
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,479
so it was almost out of necessity

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,520
that i created a garden that's open to

35
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,000
the community

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,680
this just happens to be where i can

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,720
garden so i'm gardening

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,280
out front that necessity

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,520
pulled me out of myself it pulled me out

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,960
of my depression it put me back in touch

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,439
with the community

42
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,479
and now a lot of different things have

43
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,280
grown out of it

44
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,240
i put out this little stand which has

45
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,439
become

46
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,680
an exchange when i have excess produce i

47
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,000
put it in there people can pick it up

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,040
when people have excess stuff from the

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,799
neighborhood

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,560
they'll come in they'll put it there and

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,000
you know it's just a really nice way for

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,100
people to share

53
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,160
what they've got

54
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,160
[Music]

55
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,200
started the garden on this little plot

56
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,039
right here which is about i think

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,840
10 by 20 feet and that was the very

58
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,080
first

59
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,280
garden everything else when i started

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,440
gardening

61
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,760
was lawn except for just a little border

62
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,879
over here and when i first started

63
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,080
gardening

64
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,440
it was not really in my mind to do

65
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,760
anything other than

66
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,680
just to plant a few flowers and to have

67
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,760
a pretty garden

68
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:38,800
but the real urge to garden

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,000
and this particular garden

70
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:45,519
came about after i got really sick

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,879
i hurt my back and had a couple of

72
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:52,160
spine operations and

73
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,599
the recovery was very very difficult and

74
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,560
long i was on a lot of medication became

75
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,760
very very depressed

76
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,159
and just found really

77
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,200
a very hard time motivating myself to do

78
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,480
anything

79
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,480
i had so much pain i couldn't stand for

80
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,239
very long to do anything inside the

81
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,720
house it was hard to imagine that i

82
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,720
could even

83
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:21,599
do anything outside but i had this

84
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,640
urge it was like a

85
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,360
elemental force that said come and do

86
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,879
this

87
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,000
you can do this i didn't listen at first

88
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,560
because it seemed

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,680
impossible when i couldn't stand up to

90
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,720
cook a meal

91
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,519
how was i gonna you know come out and

92
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,599
build a garden but that voice wouldn't

93
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,040
stop it just said yeah you can do this

94
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,799
you can just come out and garden one day

95
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,080
i remember that i had this little stool

96
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,480
that rolled around and i put

97
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,360
on my back brace and i slipped an ice

98
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,959
pack in

99
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,200
in the back here and i came out and

100
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,560
before i knew it i had cleared up the

101
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,519
space

102
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,840
and within a few days i had actually i

103
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,360
planted my very first garden and i got

104
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,080
enough vegetables

105
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,599
out of that very first garden to share

106
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,199
with a lot of people

107
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:21,359
and that's what got me going

108
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,919
this part is the herb garden and

109
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,440
i always tell my students if you're

110
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,000
going to have an herb garden you must

111
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,479
put it

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,360
really really close to the to your front

113
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,520
door

114
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,360
it has to be just within a few steps so

115
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,320
that when you want something

116
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,360
you can walk out clip it and walk back

117
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,840
inside so i've got parsley oregano

118
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,040
all of my culinary herbs but i also grow

119
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,240
some medicinal herbs i've got lemon balm

120
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:52,720
i've got lemon verbena

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,080
feverfew and i like to make my own soaps

122
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,440
and i make my own

123
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,199
creams and lotions so i use the herbs

124
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,840
and the flowers from the garden to

125
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,039
infuse

126
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,039
oils and then from those oils i make

127
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,120
the different products and i use there's

128
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,320
a that's pretty much what we use for the

129
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,400
whole family

130
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,360
i make enough so that i can ship out to

131
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,919
the whole to

132
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,840
to my family at christmas time and

133
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,759
that's my christmas gifts

134
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,759
lavender is one of my favorite plants

135
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,680
it's one of my favorite scents

136
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,000
i think it's really calming if you've

137
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,000
got any kind of anxiety you want to have

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,039
lavender growing in your garden and

139
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,880
certainly

140
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,199
as a stress believer it's just a

141
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,600
wonderful scent

142
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,400
this is french lavender and i propagated

143
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,240
it and

144
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,639
grew a whole hedge out of that one plant

145
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,000
it's one of the things i taught during

146
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,440
the class

147
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,479
i specifically created a path

148
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,039
from one side to the other to encourage

149
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,840
people

150
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,520
to come through the garden and to wander

151
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,560
and to cut through

152
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,319
and to sit down if they wish i have

153
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:05,120
a lot of fruit trees growing this is my

154
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:07,360
guava tree and you can see some guavas

155
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,720
we'll have gonna be making guava jelly

156
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,199
this year

157
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:16,720
this is a satsuma tangerine

158
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:20,160
that's a mango tree right there

159
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,479
gave some beautiful mangoes and

160
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,560
there's a cherry moya tree a couple of

161
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,720
pear trees

162
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,280
and plum and nectarine

163
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,639
i've always got kale growing and i like

164
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,800
to keep the kale right

165
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,639
in front because i encourage people to

166
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,600
pick it themselves and the kids love to

167
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,319
come by

168
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,039
and pull the kale and just chew on it

169
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,720
this is my

170
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:47,120
vegetable exchange stand

171
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,759
people will bring things that they have

172
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,440
extras of and whenever i have any extras

173
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,759
i'll put it in there

174
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,800
and whatever is there the the

175
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,000
neighborhood

176
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:00,160
partakes i have a few more beans growing

177
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
so this was loaded up with beans you can

178
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,680
see they're really drying up and i've

179
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,720
left them on the on the vine

180
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,440
to dry up because i want the seeds

181
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,160
for next year so i don't have to go and

182
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,919
buy any more seeds i just collect the

183
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,919
dry seed pods yeah you wait till they're

184
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:23,440
completely dry

185
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,840
and then i will use those seeds for my

186
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,919
next year's crop

187
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,039
happy and that little thing that little

188
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,080
pole

191
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,039
blue jay and he comes and eats the

192
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,479
peanuts but he stays around and eats the

193
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,479
bugs too

194
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,800
so i encourage him to visit the garden

195
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:48,080
because that's my pest control

196
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,759
i've got bird feeders hanging all

197
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,479
through the garden

198
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,639
for that's for the same reason because

199
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,120
you bring the birds to your garden

200
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,960
they will help you out by eating eating

201
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,639
the insects

202
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,360
today with the children of the

203
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,479
neighborhood we planted the box

204
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,759
and this is our winter vegetable box so

205
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,840
we planted

206
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,240
kale lettuce

207
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,680
broccoli onions

208
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,560
there's cauliflower and there are

209
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,400
flowers growing to attract beneficial

210
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,599
insects all throughout the bugs

211
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,240
at the bottom it's full of logs so it's

212
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,120
called a hugel culture

213
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,320
because it's very expensive to fill a

214
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,039
box with

215
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,120
a lot of soil and you can get away by

216
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,839
putting a bunch of

217
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,479
twigs and grasses and everything at the

218
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,039
bottom

219
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,040
yeah put about four inches of soil and

220
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,480
that's all you need to grow

221
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,160
and as things go along the branches will

222
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,880
decompose and actually

223
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,240
rot and turn into soil so that's what's

224
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,880
going on with this box

225
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,640
we planted a bunch of trees along the

226
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,279
parkway now that we have

227
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,560
gotten permission to grow food on the

228
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,720
parkways

229
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,680
so i've got citrus growing on the

230
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,560
parkway

231
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,519
the the outside of the garden is not

232
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,880
irrigated

233
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,440
at all and only depends on

234
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,640
whether i water it or or the weather

235
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,480
waters it

236
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,640
and that's because it's meant to be a

237
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,480
permaculture garden so it should not

238
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,120
really depend

239
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,480
on watering it's it's hard to maintain

240
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,519
at first

241
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,600
but once you get it going you just have

242
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,360
absolutely no worries it just keeps

243
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,399
itself going so

244
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,640
um it may not be

245
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,880
obvious to put roses but roses are

246
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,440
actually really hardy

247
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,760
they are drought tolerant and they will

248
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,440
reward you with the profusion of flowers

249
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:53,519
whenever it starts to rain again so

250
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,360
i find them good plants to intersperse

251
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,680
these are my favorite roses and i plant

252
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,800
roses in remembrance of people

253
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,079
so you know when i

254
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,920
lose a friend or a family

255
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:10,160
relative i will plant a rose bush

256
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,079
in so there's a roseburg this is my

257
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,839
aunt's rose bush

258
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:19,360
she likes yellow roses and there's one

259
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:22,640
planted for my mother

260
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,440
so yeah this is my way of keeping their

261
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,440
memory alive

262
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,880
i have one more plant that in terms of

263
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,959
memory and keeping things alive is

264
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,000
really important to me that i'd like to

265
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,560
show you

266
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,160
so it's up over here and it's right by

267
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,880
my door

268
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,720
it's not a very showy plant at all it

269
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,839
doesn't look

270
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:50,079
fabulous but it

271
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:53,839
means a lot okay so this aloe plant

272
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:56,160
was given to me as a gift from a family

273
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,079
that has preserved it since the middle

274
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,279
passage

275
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,680
this particular plant made it

276
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,480
through the middle passage was smuggled

277
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,000
aboard ship

278
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,959
by a slave it was grown

279
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,240
in the fields of america that family

280
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,160
escaped to freedom

281
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,760
to canada they took the plant with them

282
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,920
and grew it over there

283
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,680
some of them came back to the united

284
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,839
states they came to maryland they

285
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,959
brought the plant to maryland

286
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,519
and some of them moved to not too far

287
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,480
from here

288
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,440
a few blocks away from here and i was

289
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,120
lucky enough

290
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,399
to get a piece of it we don't have very

291
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,839
many things to connect

292
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:41,839
us to our past there's a big block

293
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,560
that's you know been taken away from us

294
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:46,000
and

295
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,640
to have anything that you can touch

296
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,680
that carries the memory of your

297
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,880
ancestors

298
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,760
be there not even blood related

299
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,519
to me is this is my talisman it's it's

300
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,279
amazing to have this

301
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:06,240
it's just amazing i take my inspirations

302
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:09,519
from some people that i really admire

303
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,639
vandana shiva is one of my heroes

304
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,680
she started the seed saving movement in

305
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,279
northern india

306
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,240
after the epidemic of pharma suicides up

307
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,440
there

308
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:26,399
and she has been a real force

309
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:30,399
against monsanto she established

310
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:34,399
an organization that has

311
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:38,639
really revitalized seed saving

312
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:42,399
and heirloom seeds in india and

313
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:45,519
really it's an amazing woman

314
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,880
so she's one of my uh inspirations she

315
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,079
says that to

316
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:53,519
to garden to produce your own food

317
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:56,240
is a revolutionary act because right now

318
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,240
we are so

319
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,800
enslaved by

320
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,160
our systems our food production systems

321
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,079
the way that

322
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:11,839
they've been set up um there's very

323
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:14,959
there's not enough response

324
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,399
to demand and our food

325
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,639
you know is shipped from all over the

326
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,320
place so all

327
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,399
you don't know what's on it you don't

328
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,880
know what pesticides are on it

329
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,120
what preservatives half the time it's

330
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,839
been picked before it's ripe and it's

331
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,360
been

332
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:34,480
you know subjected to gas

333
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:38,240
in order to ripen it artificially

334
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:43,040
it's not real nutritious food

335
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:46,079
and it's really really important i think

336
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,880
to everyone to get their hands in the

337
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,120
dirt

338
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,199
and to get back to growing something

339
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,240
whatever it is on your balcony wherever

340
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,120
you can find

341
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,079
some open space a little bit of sunshine

342
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,839
grow something

343
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:03,839
it'll make you better it'll make your

344
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,839
life better

345
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:17,350
