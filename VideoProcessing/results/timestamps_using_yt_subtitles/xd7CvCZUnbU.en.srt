1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,000
South Dakota's educational effort to

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:09,160
raise awareness about the importance of

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,400
soil Health continues the USDA natural

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:13,200
resources conservation service entered

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,320
into a Cooperative agreement with the

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,560
South Dakota noil Association and igro

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,480
South Dakota State University extension

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,279
for delivering these seminars with the

9
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,359
latest soil health and productivity

10
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,359
technology to South Dakota farmers and

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
Ranchers

12
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:37,600
okay well our next presenter Dr Cheryl

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,079
ree was raised on a farm near Hancock

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,800
Minnesota she received her undergrad and

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,480
master's degrees at the University of

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,960
Minnesota and her PhD in Agronomy from

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,000
SSU Cheryl currently teaches soil

18
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,039
science and Agronomy production courses

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,920
and advises undergraduate and graduate

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,840
Agronomy students at southa State

21
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,160
University and her topic today is going

22
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,680
to be salien in sodic soils

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,680
understanding the difference and manag

24
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,600
solutions everybody hear

25
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,720
me hey thank you for um inviting me to

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,000
speak in Mitchell here today my topic is

27
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,840
going to be a little bit different from

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,240
a lot of the other topics on the agenda

29
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,280
you're going to hear a lot about cover

30
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,439
crop from Dr Peter seon and D Wayne

31
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,920
other people are going to speak but

32
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,280
today I'm going to talk about something

33
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,240
a little bit different I'm going to talk

34
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,320
about s and soda soil management right

35
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,479
so how many people have problem with

36
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,720
solve here okay okay so I see a lot of

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,040
people have Sol okay so

38
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,560
and we've done a lot of work on this

39
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,439
we've done work

40
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:51,640
here we've done some

41
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,640
work by and I'm going to CL

42
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,920
here so here's my outline I'm going to

43
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,880
talk a little bit about the caus of the

44
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,880
problem I'm going to also talk about

45
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,039
testing for Sol what should you look for

46
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,479
in a soil test I'm going to talk about

47
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,360
sampling for a little bit about how deep

48
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,879
should you go what do you need to look

49
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,160
for there and then I'm going talk about

50
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,599
some management that we have and of

51
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,720
course it's going to involve some cover

52
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:18,200
CS it's also going to involve PL C Sy as

53
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,239
well too so I have quite a few slides

54
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,800
here um I know we're running ahead of

55
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,400
time I won't take more time if you guys

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,920
Ruth how do you guys want to do question

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,920
do you just a little

58
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,319
B is that better is that better no you

59
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,120
can hear me now yeah now can hear me

60
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,599
okay so Ruth how do you want to handle

61
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,200
questions at the end or did you want

62
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,760
people have questions what during when

63
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,680
I'm speaking whatever is more

64
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,400
comfortable for you you want okay I

65
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,680
teach uh the college so I'm used to

66
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,599
getting questions so if you have

67
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,760
questions if you really want to if you

68
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,120
see something on the slide just let me

69
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,920
uh know I'll try to watch the audience

70
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,560
here um so let's get going here okay so

71
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,720
salt problems we have a lot of salt

72
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,480
problems and they seem to be getting

73
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,040
worse every year

74
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,400
uh especially you know these spots they

75
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,400
in a field they start out small and then

76
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,599
each year they grow a little bit bigger

77
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,879
right and so what's going on there so

78
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,280
we've had a lot of changes in the

79
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,400
climate since the mid 80s I mean um from

80
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,599
North Dakota you guys haven't seen the

81
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,400
rain your father probably didn't see the

82
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,440
rain that you guys have seen in the last

83
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,560
say 15 years you're kind of up in that

84
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,920
Northeastern you know South Dakota area

85
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,000
by wave where we've had all this rain a

86
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,439
lot more rain Okay so we've had a lot

87
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,879
more rain these last few years

88
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:35,519
um we also in the 70s and stuff ' 80s we

89
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:37,239
did corn and soybeans we did a lot of

90
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,519
tillage all right we did a lot of

91
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:42,519
tillage there uh tillage is going to

92
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,000
destroy our soil structure right so

93
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,159
we're doing with the tillage we're doing

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,080
something bad for the soil we're

95
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,280
destroying the what you've seen with

96
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,519
your water and everything we're

97
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,319
destroying that soil structure that

98
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,599
allows water to go down into that soil

99
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:55,319
profile all right the other problem is

100
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,000
that we have Sals that are indigenous to

101
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,640
this area okay when it wasn't wet when

102
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,560
we weren't tilling okay those salts were

103
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,760
down in the soil profile but they

104
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,159
weren't coming up uh the salts have

105
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,120
always been deeper in the soil profile

106
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:12,640
okay so here let's just take a look at

107
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,280
South Dakota right here a very good

108
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,880
pointer okay so here's South Dakota

109
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,479
right here all right here's where you

110
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,160
guys are up by Lisbon up there in North

111
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:24,400
Dakota we're all underlaying there by

112
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,080
what we call the pure Shale all right

113
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,120
and there's different formations

114
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,320
underneath here the very top one is

115
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,440
called the Bearpaw shale it's the upper

116
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,199
deposit of the pure Shale so we have

117
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,800
this Shale here that's below the

118
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,800
majority of our state okay

119
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,680
here that to

120
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:44,759
go supposed to come out there there we

121
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,080
go okay so here we look in the Upper

122
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,199
Midwest right up in here all right so

123
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,120
this is a precipitation map right here

124
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,120
so here's South Dakota right here here's

125
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,479
North Dakota we can see that and then

126
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,960
you look at your decades here if we look

127
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,120
up here in the ' 80s and the '90s

128
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,840
we've had just a massive increase in

129
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:08,240
precipitation okay so what have we done

130
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,479
we changed our our cropping system from

131
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,120
typically it would have been you know

132
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:15,000
something like wheat uh you know grazing

133
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,600
phow we've done a lot more tillage and

134
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,479
we've added you know corn and soybeans

135
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,680
in there okay corn being a short or

136
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,560
soybeans being a short season

137
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,600
cop sorry here right here okay so here's

138
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,639
the pure shell this is in spank Colony

139
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,080
right here so this is a geologic map

140
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,840
right here and this is spin County up by

141
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,080
Redfield South Dakota what they did here

142
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,319
is they came through here and they did

143
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,800
some sampling this is done with the uh

144
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,520
South Dakota Geological Service and they

145
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:50,840
came through here and they sampled

146
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:53,520
across the county site one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

147
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,039
9 10 and so what they did is they did

148
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,280
some deep sampling here and what they

149
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:04,280
did is at each of these sites one 2 3 4

150
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,720
5 5 6 7 8 9 10 there were what what type

151
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,759
of formations do we have underneath

152
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,639
there all right so that red line right

153
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:14,199
down here the KP is the pure

154
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,599
Shale and if you look along the left

155
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:19,759
hand side here it says elevation and

156
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:21,800
feet above mean sea level and here's the

157
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,560
ground surface right up

158
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,120
here so you can see right up here on a

159
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,960
lot of this just across this one

160
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,880
transect here in spank County you have a

161
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,039
lot of that pure shell that's close to

162
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,759
the surface well those salts are all in

163
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,720
that pure Shale that's where they are

164
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,560
those salts are indigenous in that pure

165
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,840
shell okay and so what we do here is um

166
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,199
seasonal use of the Tall Grass Prairie

167
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,599
water was greater that and corn and

168
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,960
especially soybeans and wheat rotation

169
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:52,919
okay we also had very very deep roots

170
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,400
with these prairie grasses that remove

171
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:56,240
the water from deeper in the soil

172
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,720
profile and I'll show you that here at

173
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,039
the end how those uh perennial grasses

174
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,840
really can pump that that water out so

175
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:06,199
here's what's happened basically we've

176
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,560
had this abundance of precipitation the

177
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,120
'90s through the

178
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,199
2000 we have those salts that are

179
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,360
indigenous down there okay they're not

180
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,000
very far down what we do is in in soil

181
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,319
and when I teach my soil science classes

182
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,080
we call this capillary rise all right so

183
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,199
lots of soil science terms here for you

184
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,160
guys today because I teach soil science

185
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,960
all right so capillary rise right here

186
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,080
what happens is is that groundwater

187
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,520
comes up it dissolves those salts from

188
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,400
that Old pure shell the calcium the

189
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:39,960
Magnesium the gypsum the sodium salts

190
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,160
that are there it dissolves those salts

191
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,360
from that pure shell and then what

192
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,000
happens is based upon what your soil

193
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,440
texture Is So based upon if you have a

194
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,039
silk a silty LOM soil if you have a

195
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,159
silty LOM soil those salts become

196
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,240
dissolved in that water down there from

197
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:59,440
that groundwater and now they start

198
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,520
creeping up due to capillary rise it's

199
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,400
kind of like if you look at like a

200
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,680
really thin tube or if you look like

201
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,280
look at a um a thermometer and it has

202
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,759
water in there you'll see that it has a

203
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,720
meniscus in there so it's climbing up in

204
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,120
the soil because it would rather be more

205
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,199
attracted to the soil uh above the

206
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,280
surface that's in the groundwater so

207
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,039
capillary rise occurs it comes up

208
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,479
against ravity okay depends upon your

209
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:28,080
text depends up on your texture and your

210
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:30,560
soil Pro and your and your paracity so a

211
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,080
soil that has a lot of play in it okay

212
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,519
you're not going to get water creeping

213
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,000
up as much a sandy soil you're not going

214
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:39,039
to get water creeping up okay it's in

215
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,399
these intermediate textured soils like

216
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,320
these silt LOM and these types of soils

217
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,959
where we see that water start to creep

218
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,080
up the waterers the salts are dissolved

219
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:51,240
in there the water comes to the Surface

220
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,320
starts to warm up in the spring the

221
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:57,120
water evaporates where are the

222
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,399
salts where they're on your Fields right

223
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,360
they're right on your fields and that's

224
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,000
how they get there okay so that's a

225
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,440
little bit of a background about how

226
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
these areas develop okay so now that we

227
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,320
know how they develop what can we do to

228
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,880
manage them how do we figure out what do

229
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,760
we have okay so now what we have to talk

230
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,720
about is the type of salts that we have

231
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,959
all right we have calcium magnesium

232
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:22,160
salts and we have sodium salts all right

233
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,320
so with the Sodium salts sodium means

234
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,440
just like your table salt sodium all

235
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,200
right what that means we call that a

236
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,440
sodic soil and we call that a sodic soil

237
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,760
we have the problem that plants will not

238
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,920
grow and the soil is dispersed so

239
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,440
dispersed means that you don't have that

240
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,360
nice soil structure out there you walk

241
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,600
out there and it looks like pavement

242
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,320
okay there's no the the the the the the

243
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,640
the agnet stability is not there all

244
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,760
right so that's what it looks like this

245
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:55,040
is a field up by Pon so you get a

246
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,200
rainfall or something like that and you

247
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,480
get this you get this it'll it'll start

248
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,440
drying out this has a high clay t some

249
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,640
of this does on the surface and

250
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,120
nothing's going to move through here it

251
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,680
looks just like caves right plants will

252
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,880
not grow in the soil as dispersed okay

253
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,880
with uh staline soil you have calcium

254
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,040
and magnesium now you have plants that

255
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,120
well you're enj plant problems but

256
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,680
usually in a saline uh situation with

257
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,160
calcium and magnesium salt usually your

258
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,640
water will move through that area Okay

259
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,440
so if you have an area out in the field

260
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,480
where you don't have any water moving

261
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,160
through it and nothing's growing there

262
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,120
if it looks like concrete then you might

263
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,880
want to look at testing for sodium all

264
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,880
right saline uh problems typically we do

265
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,120
have some structure there the problem is

266
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,680
here is that no matter if it's a saline

267
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,279
or sodic soil problem we have a high

268
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,040
water table this is up by pant South

269
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,920
Dakota here in we did some Field Days up

270
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,560
by pure Pont we done some soil pits here

271
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,839
this is a has a buried soil horizon but

272
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,560
down right in here is about 6t feet down

273
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,440
and we have water down here you can see

274
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,480
how white that surface is there on that

275
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,839
on those salts right there so that's

276
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,880
where the that's where the problem comes

277
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,560
from so what type of salts do we usually

278
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,519
have here in South Dakota we have

279
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,040
typically a lot of our salts are sodium

280
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,399
uh uh sodium sulfate and depending on

281
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,920
where you are you may have some gyps up

282
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:23,920
we also have lime too as well okay but

283
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,240
typically we're not when we look at the

284
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,519
solubility here right there we're not as

285
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:33,440
worried lime is usually not not a a salt

286
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:35,959
problem because of the low solubility so

287
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,600
what does solubility mean solubility

288
00:11:35,959 --> 00:11:41,560
means how much of that salt will

289
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,000
dissolve in water okay so what is the

290
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,639
solubility of that salt the salts that

291
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,240
are really soluble are the ones that

292
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:52,560
move up fast okay what happens is a lot

293
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,480
of these sodium salts down here sodium

294
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,120
chloride they have a high solubility so

295
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,200
the higher the number here the more

296
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,279
soluble the salt so the sodium will move

297
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,360
up fast in the soil profile it gets up

298
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,399
to the top it causes the soil to

299
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,800
disperse it seals up now you have a big

300
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,760
problem how you going to get that Sal

301
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,440
out of there right um like I said

302
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,760
typically we have these salts right here

303
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,440
calcium magnesium salt and then of

304
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,720
course we have our sodium salt salts but

305
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,320
different problems and different

306
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,000
management based upon if we have a

307
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,160
calcium or magnesium salt based if we

308
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,800
have a sodic salt there so when you're

309
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:33,079
testing and looking at your salts and

310
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,320
your soils you got to find what type of

311
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:36,320
salt problem do you have

312
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,839
first okay and this is what I'm talking

313
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,440
about with this dispersion okay so

314
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:47,120
what's going on here all right so when I

315
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,399
talk that a sodic soil is dispersed it

316
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,720
means that the soil the clay particles

317
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:53,760
are pushed apart at pretty much equally

318
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,160
spaced so that soil is so evenly

319
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,519
dispersed there's really no paracity to

320
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,800
that soil there's no channels for that

321
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:03,240
water water to move down into that soil

322
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,000
profile okay so you can't get anything

323
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,279
to move through it the terms that we use

324
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,240
are floculation versus dispersion all

325
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,560
right floculation means that the soil is

326
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,760
held together in Aggregates that there's

327
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,839
pores between those individual soil pads

328
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,399
for water to move down through it okay

329
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,160
when we have sodium that aggregate

330
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,160
stability is

331
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,399
destroyed I okay said just some pictures

332
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,839
here so saline straps calcium and

333
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,360
magnesium you guys all have seen areas

334
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:40,560
like this in your field all right high

335
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,480
pH droughty conditions it's salty the so

336
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,720
they salty water will not move into the

337
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,399
those plant roads we can't get anything

338
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,160
to germinate there poor germination poor

339
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,279
growth but if you look at this soil here

340
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,880
it's not great but there's a little bit

341
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,680
of there there's a little bit of you can

342
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,920
see a little bit of structure on the

343
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,759
surface it doesn't look like pavement

344
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:02,720
okay right here these are where we have

345
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,440
these sodium problems right here pH

346
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,320
typically higher than 8.2 a lot of

347
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,120
dispersion no water movement anywhere

348
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,519
into that soil profile okay we have

349
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,680
erosion and we have limitation because

350
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,720
this soil is so dense and so hard this

351
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,120
is a field with a farmer that we work by

352
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,120
up by pure Pont South Dakota um he's had

353
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:26,639
a lot of issues with this field right

354
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,839
here he does do no tail uh up here in

355
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,480
this area here we have a a kind of a

356
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,399
little bowl area here and he hasn't been

357
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,639
able to get anything to grow here for

358
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:40,720
quite a few years last may he had about

359
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:42,880
3in rainfall that came down washed all

360
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,920
this out remember we have these sodic

361
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,600
soils where we don't have any water

362
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,199
moving in this the soil profile so

363
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,880
what's it going to do it's going to run

364
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:53,240
off as it goes down the slope it's going

365
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,160
to increase in velocity you're going to

366
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,639
pick up that speed okay so what happens

367
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,959
here is you have a little bll shaped

368
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:02,320
area up here trying to divert the water

369
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:05,639
over to the ditch well now we have some

370
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,199
problems here where uh it it uh some

371
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:09,759
junk got in the ditch there so now it

372
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,120
flows out over here flows into this area

373
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,320
right here concentrated flow this is

374
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,800
looking North right there from the area

375
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,639
where we had the bull shaped area this

376
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:24,160
is looking Sol this big here Gully right

377
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,279
here was not here the previous year okay

378
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,800
so lots of problems with managing these

379
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:32,000
areas the big problem we get with these

380
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,319
sodic soils is we have a lot of erosion

381
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,079
problems okay so like I said just the

382
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:37,959
difference between saline and sodic soil

383
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,560
just to Define what these are so you

384
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:43,160
guys have this definition in your hand

385
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,480
okay salvs tend to help a soil

386
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:50,000
flocculate okay a saline soil typically

387
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,040
does not generally become a hard set we

388
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,959
typically will get some water movement

389
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,880
with that you can see those salts uh go

390
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,079
a little bit farther down into that soil

391
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,920
profile if we get some rainfall so that

392
00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:04,440
white area will appear and disappear

393
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,920
based upon the moisture okay based upon

394
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:10,160
where the moisture how much moisture you

395
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,399
had rinf okay um water moves similarly

396
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,199
compared to normal soils plants may be

397
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,199
more negatively impacted in Saline

398
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,240
soils sodium soils disperse or they

399
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:26,399
swell they become hard step they come

400
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:29,040
become like Pavements water cannot move

401
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,519
there have a lot of huge erosion problem

402
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,680
it can impact fertility because of this

403
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,959
restrictive layer this high density and

404
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,680
this low fertility so that's just a

405
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:39,440
summary of what these soils are so we're

406
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,880
looking at when we look at salts and

407
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,560
soils we need to deci decide is it a

408
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,800
calcium magnesium salt problem or is it

409
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:51,199
a sodium problem what is the problem

410
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,079
okay so in South Dakota you guys all

411
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,880
know where your uh some the saline

412
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:57,680
issues are but when we look at the

413
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:01,279
sodicity here we see that up here by

414
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,039
aine and County here 20 to 30% of

415
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:06,199
these soils have sodic Horizon deeper

416
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:08,839
down in the soil profile sodium in there

417
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:11,959
here's Aurora County down here also a

418
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:15,120
problem down here um more up here you

419
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:17,360
know there's more coming up here we have

420
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,400
not as much here but really you know the

421
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,880
red and the yellow you know 10 to 30% of

422
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,959
those soils in any given area have

423
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,919
sodium deeper in the soil

424
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,520
profile okay so is there any questions

425
00:17:26,919 --> 00:17:31,720
on what the problems are and how they

426
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:34,600
differ before I go on doing

427
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:36,160
questions okay all right okay so soil

428
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,480
testing for

429
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,520
salts uh some terms I'm just going to go

430
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,320
through this I didn't know what my

431
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,480
general audience would be so I wanted to

432
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,720
Define these terms before I started

433
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,400
talking about them uh electrical

434
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:50,280
conductivity is the measure of the total

435
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,559
salts in the soil we add salt to water

436
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,960
it increases the conductivity same thing

437
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,400
with soil we can measure that in the

438
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,679
soil testing lab cation exchange

439
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,360
capacity how many you guys remember that

440
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,400
Okay C exchange capacity all right so

441
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,600
that is going to be the soil's ability

442
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:10,799
to hold on to positively charge

443
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:13,720
cat Okay um s so the sodium absorption

444
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,600
ratio it's a number that we calculate

445
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:20,240
based upon the relative concentration of

446
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,440
sodium to calcium and magnesium okay we

447
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,799
typically do this from something called

448
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,000
a saturated past and then the other one

449
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:27,520
that we more the most more soil testing

450
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,799
Labs use that you're probably going to

451
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,799
see the exchangeable sodium percent okay

452
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:38,120
we measure the sodium on the exchange

453
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:40,440
sites from the uh P exchange typically

454
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:44,600
here um I'm going to talk a lot about

455
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,159
this right here today in South Dakota we

456
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,919
in South Dakota the reason we did this

457
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:51,200
project is because we we know these

458
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,120
salty areas are getting bigger also when

459
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,120
I would teach my soil science classes

460
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,799
and I would get soil in from up by pure

461
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,440
Pon these saly soils and I'd had my

462
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:02,440
students go in there and and uh we test

463
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:07,400
them and we come up with these SS that

464
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:09,919
are are fairly low okay five or six s

465
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:11,840
okay five or six s they are dispersed

466
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,880
soil we try to run water through them

467
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,600
they were dispersed nothing would work

468
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:19,960
we've always used in South Dakota these

469
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:23,039
guidelines right here all right so we

470
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,960
use an S of 13 we say if it's greater

471
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,520
than 13 it's a sodic soil well I never

472
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:31,320
saw that when I bring my salty soils in

473
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:34,520
and have my students try to run water

474
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,039
through them the S was five or six that

475
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:38,039
soil was dispersed I could get anybody

476
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:40,640
to run water through it it's like what's

477
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:42,480
wrong are these numbers wrong all right

478
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,960
and then the ESP the same thing these

479
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,960
numbers are very very similar so we uh

480
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,919
we know this becoming a a lot bigger

481
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,000
problem in South Dakota all right with

482
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,760
the sailing areas I knew from working

483
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,640
with the soil that I get from salty

484
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,840
areas in South Dakota from my so from my

485
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,280
class it's like what's going on here so

486
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,520
we wrote Grant nrcs and we had some

487
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,880
money to study these areas and so what

488
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,159
we did is first thing we did like okay

489
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,440
we need to test do these numbers work

490
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,440
these numbers of determining the cut off

491
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,880
values for Saline sodic soils were

492
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,760
determined by the National cinity Lab

493
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,520
out in California so we needed to do it

494
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:23,200
for South Dakota so these numbers here

495
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,480
are old numbers here from South Dakota

496
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,280
or from from California the numbers that

497
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:31,799
we look at now if our s is greater than

498
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,960
four we consider it sodic if our ESP is

499
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:37,039
greater than five we consider it sodic

500
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,559
these numbers are too high for South

501
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,799
Dakota okay so just a little bit of a

502
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:45,559
review what's going on here okay so CAD

503
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:48,159
exchange capacity so soil science here

504
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:49,919
you know 200 so what's happening with

505
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,799
can exchange capacity just a little bit

506
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,600
of a review what happens why why do we

507
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:57,760
have sodium problem okay um past

508
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,720
recommendations said that when 15% of

509
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,600
the cash exchange sites were occupied by

510
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,520
sodium be classified it as a sodic soil

511
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:08,919
so cation are are clay soils here are

512
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,520
negatively charged due to how the

513
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:12,880
formation process the geological

514
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,960
formation process so we have negative

515
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,039
charges that reside on these clay uh

516
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,440
sheets here and of course we have

517
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:23,840
positive cats that can be occupied on

518
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:26,360
these sheets right so what happens is is

519
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:30,559
when we get greater than now in our case

520
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:32,760
we're looking at 5% South Dakota not 15%

521
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,600
we're looking at 5% we're looking when

522
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:39,200
we get greater than 5% of these exchange

523
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:41,000
sites occupied by sodium these soils and

524
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,960
end up just like a refrigerator magnet

525
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,960
right so they're negatively charged and

526
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,000
we need these positively charged cations

527
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,600
on here to neutralize that charge and if

528
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,320
we get calcium and magnesium but

529
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,200
especially calcium we'll actually

530
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,480
flocculate that we'll form a bridge

531
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,200
negative charge on one clay iell

532
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,640
negative charge on another throw a

533
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,279
calcium in there positive to negative

534
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,799
just like a refrigerator magnet what

535
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:08,440
happens it's together we have Aggregates

536
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:10,600
um stability form formation okay we hold

537
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,760
that soil together okay when we put

538
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,240
sodium in there okay sodium has a

539
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,919
positive charge on it but the problem

540
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,480
with sodium is that that positive charge

541
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,039
is insulated it's completely insulated

542
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,679
it's a small atom you put a lot of

543
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,240
sodium in there you have that negative

544
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:27,400
charge on those on those clay uh clay my

545
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,520
cells those clay Aggregates what happens

546
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,320
nothing in there neutralize it dispersed

547
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,679
okay so that's why we have the problems

548
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,159
that we have that's why we have the

549
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,039
dispersion just like refrigerator magnet

550
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,520
when we have too much sodium in there we

551
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:41,840
have

552
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,679
repulsion okay so what we how do we

553
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,039
figure this out right so how do we

554
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,559
figure this out what we did is we took

555
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,279
large Columns of soil and we brought

556
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,080
them in from the field from different

557
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:55,080
places that was so and then what we did

558
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,720
is we did we did some amendments as well

559
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,720
we we worked some uh soil amendments I'm

560
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,240
going to talk about that in just a

561
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:04,559
minute but what we did here is we looked

562
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:08,200
at okay based upon what the S is so down

563
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:11,840
here it says initial soil S A initial

564
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:15,679
sodium concentration so here is five

565
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,520
here is 10 here's 15 and here's 20 then

566
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,400
what we did is we started running water

567
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:24,200
through this okay so permeability milles

568
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:27,000
per or milliliters per hour is what we

569
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,640
looked at here all right so what we saw

570
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,440
here in southa

571
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,320
that when we saw an s on these big soil

572
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,080
columns that we brought in we brought in

573
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,600
there about this big round about this

574
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:41,840
deep our grad a student um did this work

575
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,400
on part of his PhD and what he did here

576
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,360
is he ran water through this these

577
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:50,320
initial one so we saw slow infiltration

578
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,039
um at an S of greater than four we're

579
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,000
doing this work with Tom dutter you know

580
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:56,360
tomter up in North Dakota the soil scien

581
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,279
have you ever heard of Tom at all before

582
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:01,000
or not okay he's doing a lot of the salt

583
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,320
work up in South Dakota up in North

584
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,840
Dakota we did this work with Tom dter

585
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,720
he's looking at the number he's using

586
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:10,320
for North Dakota is five so remember we

587
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:14,520
said this used to be 13 it's way lower

588
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:17,840
for our soils than than than 13 so right

589
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:20,720
here uh considering 1 Mill per hour uh

590
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,600
as a threshold the data suggests that s

591
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,360
greater than four can be considered

592
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:27,600
sodic because once we hit this much

593
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,640
sodium in the soil we can just see how

594
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,240
much oops

595
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:34,720
sorry you can just see how much there

596
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,440
that our water infiltrations blows

597
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,279
down okay so that's the problem that's

598
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,440
the problem and here here's how we're

599
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:44,919
trying to give some terminology and

600
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,880
describe the the extent of our problem

601
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:50,080
with some of these soil testing values

602
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,600
so in South Dakota here uh all numbers

603
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,159
are soil e to measure the tot salt we

604
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,279
used four with a saturated paste greater

605
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,240
than four we call it a saline soil

606
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,640
that's what saturated a past we talk

607
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:05,440
about that in just a minute too okay s

608
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,880
of greater than 13 with sodic ESP

609
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,000
greater than 15 with soda these are old

610
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,159
numbers we are going to we are rewriting

611
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,720
all of this we're going to work with the

612
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:16,080
nrcs to put out some bulletins on this

613
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,080
new nrcs research project for North and

614
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,880
South Dakota we're still going to go

615
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,360
with four as saturated pce of the saline

616
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,039
soil but here we're going to use in in

617
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:29,799
North Dakota they're using five in South

618
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:31,880
Dakota we're using four es of five okay

619
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:33,320
so a lot of different numbers here than

620
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,120
what we originally thought and that's

621
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,799
why when I go get the soil the the soil

622
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,720
samples uh from from these salaries from

623
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,559
out in the field and I bring them in to

624
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,200
my for my students to work on you're

625
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:48,240
doing water infiltration I'd have an S

626
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,960
or five or six and it's like that's why

627
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,720
the water would go through it it's

628
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:56,960
because there's too much sodium in those

629
00:25:52,720 --> 00:26:00,799
soils already at an S of four or five

630
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,840
okay so now when you're testing for

631
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,919
salts okay there are some questions you

632
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,960
need to ask the soil testing lab because

633
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,880
what we're going to do is we first of

634
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,799
all we have to determine the total salt

635
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,039
content and then we got to figure out

636
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,159
how much sodium is in that total salt

637
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:19,840
content all right so just a

638
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:22,120
percentage so when they extract for salt

639
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,880
soil testing Labs will either use most

640
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:28,520
of you use a one to one extract so what

641
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:30,960
does that mean that means that you take

642
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,200
100 gram of soil and you mix it with 100

643
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,640
gram of water and you mix it together

644
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,399
that's a one to one extract okay then

645
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:40,120
you let that sit for a little while and

646
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:42,480
you'll put a a EC probe in there and

647
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:45,320
you'll measure the electrical

648
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,039
conductivity um with a saturated paste

649
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,640
that is totally different with the

650
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:53,240
saturated paste what we do is we take

651
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,559
the soil and uh my kids love to do this

652
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,399
all right you guys probably all did this

653
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,360
when you're little your grandkids do it

654
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:00,919
you take a cup of soil

655
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:03,200
and you mix it with enough water just

656
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,919
until it looks like melted chocolate

657
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,159
okay and that's called the saturated

658
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:10,279
paste you let that sit that settles out

659
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,520
and then you measure what the EC is in

660
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:15,760
the top of that saturated past so we

661
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,679
have two very different ways of um

662
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,960
determining EC here we have a much more

663
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:22,880
dilute method than what we have over

664
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,000
here if you're not going to if you take

665
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,960
one to one take 100 gram of soil 100

666
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,320
Millers of water and mix that together

667
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,559
you're going to get a fairly dilute

668
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,200
solution here remember we're going for

669
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:36,240
melted chocolate with the saturated

670
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,840
paste okay why is this important because

671
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,679
the EC is used to C estimate the total

672
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,039
salt so if we're going to calculate

673
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:45,519
their percent sodium we need to know the

674
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:48,240
total percentage of salts that are there

675
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,360
you can use our EC to do this okay but

676
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,559
we have to make sure that we understand

677
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,960
the method that we're measuring the

678
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:57,519
total salt okay because if we look at

679
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,240
concentration of sodium in the in in the

680
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,279
on the top of the fraction and the

681
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,200
concentration of total cations in the

682
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,799
bottom if we have a different number

683
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,679
down here that's going to make our

684
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,159
percentage

685
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,120
different right so um because EC is used

686
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:14,559
to count the total salt is required for

687
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:18,200
s or the ESP okay so here this is how

688
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:20,399
this kind of goes if I'm reading a uh EC

689
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:22,960
of four and that is aoic soil on a

690
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,960
saturated past that is going to be

691
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,360
equivalent to a EC of two in a 1:1

692
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:32,279
delution okay and remember we're looking

693
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:37,320
at the the our criteria for a saline

694
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:40,480
soil is EC = 4 on a saturated paste it's

695
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:43,640
not EC equals 4 on a 1: one

696
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,080
solution okay so here and if we go take

697
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,240
that some Labs may do a 1 to five

698
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,640
delution once again we're diluting that

699
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,640
out an EC of four on a saturated paste

700
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,120
equals an EC of two on a 1:1 delution

701
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:59,919
equals an EC of

702
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:03,519
0.72 on one to five solution so

703
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,640
understanding how the EC is calculated

704
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,640
is very important when you're trying to

705
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:10,080
determine the am total Sals that you

706
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,279
have out in the store okay this needs to

707
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,519
be taken into account when making

708
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,559
management recommendations okay so

709
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,360
here's a little graph and I also should

710
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:20,960
mention too I have a very technical

711
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:22,720
article uh it's available out on one of

712
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,159
the tables there's only about 60 copies

713
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,679
of it but a lot of this information that

714
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:29,960
we are that I have here we are put in

715
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,760
where we have a core manual that was

716
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:34,880
very poor when it was initially made and

717
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,519
we are rewriting that completely and

718
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,320
we're going to have the the chapter for

719
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:41,960
Saline sodic soil management that draft

720
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,720
chapter Ruth you have that out in the

721
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,000
right there I'll put them on the

722
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,360
registration table we've got two two

723
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,640
different ones but they'll both be yeah

724
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,799
and there's also a really good one there

725
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,480
from North Dakota so if you're

726
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,399
interested in some of these the stuff

727
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,000
that I'm showing here if you want some

728
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,240
information about this to take home and

729
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,120
read U Roose will have that back out on

730
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,200
the on the table back there

731
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:02,640
okay so just a little general guideline

732
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:06,519
too texture is really important too when

733
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,919
it comes to measuring our EC versus our

734
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,360
uh we're going to do it with a saturated

735
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:13,360
paste or one to one delution okay this

736
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:17,120
Dave Franson did this back in 2007 soil

737
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:20,200
scientist up at NTSU so keep that in

738
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:22,919
mind that when you are testing for salt

739
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,039
you're going to ask for the EC the EC is

740
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:27,679
going to estimate your total salts in

741
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,840
that soil okay what that number number

742
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,840
represents is going to be different

743
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,200
based upon your extraction method so

744
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,880
when you talk to a soil testing lab you

745
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,880
need to know their extraction method now

746
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,559
we've contacted a lot of our soil

747
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,840
testing labs around here about Iowa

748
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:46,159
State is about the only one that's

749
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,799
running the saturated pce so if you go

750
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,399
to North Dakota University of Minnesota

751
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,640
egg viice Ray Ward lab pretty much

752
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:56,440
everybody's doing one to one right

753
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,159
here now what type of sodium index are

754
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,000
they calculating there what types of

755
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,039
values are they looking at there well

756
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,600
pretty much everybody egg Vice Labs up

757
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:06,960
in North Dakota Minnesota Valley testing

758
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,559
W lab pretty much everybody there is

759
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,600
running pretty much everybody's running

760
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,559
in

761
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,720
ESP so that's what you're going to

762
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:16,200
probably that's the type of dat you're

763
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,240
going to get okay so now soil sampling

764
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,720
for salts all right so where you going

765
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,880
to stand the top 6 in you know is it

766
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,919
going to be like phosphorus where it

767
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,320
doesn't move is it like nitrate or

768
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:27,960
chloride where it's going to move so

769
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,399
what do you to think about soil sampling

770
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,440
for yourself okay so when we look at

771
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:35,279
soil sampling okay now I'm once again I

772
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,480
teach soil so I got to use some soil

773
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:41,440
terms here everybody okay all right

774
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,720
taxonomy soil scientists you know when

775
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,840
with Biology you know we have a

776
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,600
taxonomic system where you classify you

777
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,240
all the different types of organisms

778
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,519
well soil scientists also have their

779
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,760
taxonomic system as well too where they

780
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:56,000
come up with this long name right here

781
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,679
uh that describes kind of what the soil

782
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,039
is I'm going to use an xline and an

783
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:05,480
abine soil these soils are more common

784
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:07,760
uh up in the up probably up north up by

785
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:09,240
Red field and up in that area here you

786
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,960
guys your soils down here probably be

787
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,159
like a beetle soil or something like

788
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:18,720
that down here your soil series name

789
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:20,399
spinetic Fric leptic naad dool okay

790
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,440
that's our xline soils it's the soil

791
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,880
series name that you would see in your

792
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:30,120
on the on the nrcs soil survey map and

793
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:31,919
an aine fine IC frigid glossic natur

794
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:36,840
doll so what does all this mean right

795
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:40,519
here fine texture lot of clay whole

796
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:42,399
climate differences are here all right

797
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:44,600
natur

798
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,200
natric uh sodium that means you have

799
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,039
sodium in it where you have quite a bit

800
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,519
of rainfall and this means that it was

801
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:53,080
derived from a grassland soil okay so

802
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,039
what is the basic difference between

803
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,720
letip and glossic when we look at this

804
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,639
okay lepic means that you have the

805
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,360
absolute worst sodium conditions that

806
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:06,159
you could have blosic would be the best

807
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,559
tiic would be in the middle okay right

808
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:10,480
here here is an example of leptic soil

809
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,880
these slides are from Tom D Suter up in

810
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,919
North Dakota because I didn't have any

811
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:16,919
good as good of pictures as it as him

812
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,480
okay so the sodium is very close to the

813
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:21,200
soil surface with sodic soil you get

814
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,080
this columnar structure so if you see

815
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,600
something like this out in your field

816
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,120
this kind of columnar structure that

817
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,559
starts to form and the soil is really

818
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:30,440
really hard and down

819
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:33,559
you most likely have sodium there

820
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:36,200
okay glossin means that that that that

821
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:37,480
sodium is deeper in the soil profile so

822
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,840
you get it down in here or something

823
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,080
like that where you see pan in that hard

824
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,519
pan anywh you get these hard pans

825
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,159
forming here in South Dakota and a lot

826
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:48,440
of times those hard bands are due to

827
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,399
that sodium in there making that soil

828
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:53,919
really dense so nothing will Groll

829
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:55,320
through it okay like I said here and of

830
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,559
course these areas are going to be

831
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,360
interspersed between each other okay

832
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:02,120
these areas you know in your field are

833
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,880
small okay and they can they they're

834
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,399
they're they're scattered out okay and

835
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,399
the degree of of of sodium issues you

836
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:11,359
can change in a very short short period

837
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:13,919
of time so here's the lectic where that

838
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,879
sodium is more on the soil surface right

839
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,960
there nothing's going to grow there and

840
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:22,480
here's that glassic over

841
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:24,679
there so soil samples how deep why where

842
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,320
and where are we in the soil

843
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:31,240
sample okay agronomic is 2 ft typically

844
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,359
that's what we're looking for okay

845
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:36,720
now I know there's a lot of different

846
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:40,000
opinions on tile uh tiling in the in in

847
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,919
the audience here all right if you

848
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,440
tiling with these sodium sodic Fields is

849
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:49,359
is something that kind of tricky okay

850
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:52,040
can cause problems okay at least 3 feet

851
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,800
to figure out where that sodium is okay

852
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:56,919
if possible to the depth of the tile why

853
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,720
do we want to do that it's a lot of work

854
00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:01,040
why do we want to go that deep if we are

855
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,560
going to tile we want to invest in that

856
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,760
tile we want it to

857
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,520
work what happens

858
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:09,079
is if you're evaluating for a drain tile

859
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,040
there then you need to look down at

860
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:15,800
least 3 ft deep here's why okay so

861
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,520
here's a picture this here are three

862
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:22,400
different types of xline soils up by

863
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:25,240
aine up in that area there um right here

864
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,680
we have the S right here and then the

865
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:30,079
surface below um the depth below the

866
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:34,079
surface okay here's your X line right

867
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:36,440
here okay so here we had not very high s

868
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:41,560
at all all the way down all the way down

869
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:44,480
to 30 in almost 3 ft down here on on the

870
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,119
X line one we started about four okay so

871
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,119
North Dakota says that five there

872
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:50,760
dispersed we come down here well about 2

873
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:54,119
ft we're at

874
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:57,440
10 with this last X line right here you

875
00:35:54,119 --> 00:36:02,040
started about six 10 in down we're about

876
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:06,280
s of 15 about 18 in down foot and a half

877
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:10,440
20 in or S of 25 and at almost 3 ft

878
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:14,640
we're at an S of almost 27 okay so now

879
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:18,280
you go put a tile line in here okay you

880
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,040
put that tile line below that sodium

881
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,520
Horizon think you're going to get water

882
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,520
to flow in

883
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,599
there get your sodium Horizon here get

884
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:29,200
your tile line down here is water going

885
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,400
to

886
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,720
flow no yeah so why isn't going to flow

887
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,319
what's what's that sodium doing to that

888
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,839
subsoil surface what's this

889
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:40,920
doing it's dispersing it right it's

890
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:44,960
dispersing it okay so here's the problem

891
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:46,440
right here that we see uh that's why I

892
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,079
don't know if thaing is a very good idea

893
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:51,839
in South Dakota with with the types of

894
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,200
soils that we have so when we have uh

895
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:56,359
it's a it's kind of like a balance you

896
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:59,280
can think it's a teer pot so if we have

897
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:02,319
quite a b bit of sodium in here okay in

898
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:05,040
the soil and we have a high EC we'll

899
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:06,839
have a dispersed soil all right because

900
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,400
we have enough calcium and magnesium

901
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,079
over here to flocculate that soil and

902
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,720
have some soil structure

903
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:15,240
there if we take and we start tiling and

904
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,720
we start moving some of those other

905
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,440
salts out of this water we start moving

906
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,720
some of that calcium that magnesium out

907
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:25,079
of that soil through that tile water

908
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,400
remember the sodium it's going to move

909
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:29,880
up and down pretty fast but once it gets

910
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:32,119
up it's going to disperse the soil and

911
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,440
still move if you get water through

912
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:36,839
there you can't get water to go through

913
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,280
there because it's dispersed okay so

914
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:42,440
right here that's the problem so you

915
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:44,480
know um May negative impact you know

916
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,880
pull of water from a tile line you know

917
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:50,400
water doesn't flow from tile uh from the

918
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,000
tile if the F field Still Remains wet so

919
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,720
that's why when it comes to tiling and

920
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,800
South Dakota you need to know what your

921
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,839
subsurface soils are you need to know

922
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,640
what types of soils you have there you

923
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:03,680
know because if you do have sodium down

924
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:06,160
deep piling it is not really a good

925
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:07,960
option so any questions so far about

926
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,640
that

927
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,560
stuff all right so soil management how

928
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,520
can we manage this right and I have

929
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:16,359
until how long do I have until like 15

930
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,119
minutes okay all right so it sounds good

931
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:19,839
so how do we manage this so we've looked

932
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:21,119
at this a couple different ways okay

933
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,880
we've looked at this by putting soil

934
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,760
amendments on and we've looked at this

935
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,200
by putting perennial crops on and trying

936
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,040
to put cover crops out there okay uh

937
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,200
studies that we've done we've worked at

938
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,079
Pier Pont we worked at an Andover we wor

939
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,640
we had we're going to put in Falon so

940
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,960
Pier pont's been Greg toppel I have to

941
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,720
give credit to the farmers we're working

942
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,680
with here pure PO is Greg toppel and

943
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:43,880
over is Roger and Grant rips um Redfield

944
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,599
is going to be we're working with Jim

945
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:49,480
Miller craft consultant there and then

946
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:51,680
uh Kenny Selman is the uh he Farms the

947
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:53,040
land and Jerry West is the land owner

948
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,480
that's who we've been working with here

949
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,960
and then down in your area down here

950
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,720
we've been working with David Gillan at

951
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,319
White Lake so these are the farmers that

952
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,079
we've worked with you couldn't do this

953
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:05,319
research without them right so what

954
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,760
we've done is we've looked at okay now

955
00:39:05,319 --> 00:39:08,560
if we have too much sodium there if we

956
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,319
add some calcium can we improve that

957
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,079
floculation okay so what we've done is

958
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:15,040
we've taken and we put out our studies

959
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:16,680
where we put all these plots out we

960
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,880
design them so we can do statistics on

961
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,920
it because we like to do statistics you

962
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,240
know so um four blocks and the

963
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,400
treatments that we put on are going to

964
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:31,640
be calcium sulfate or gypsum Elemental

965
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,720
sulfur calcium chloride or no salt those

966
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,359
are the types of salt that's the

967
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,960
treatments that we're putting out there

968
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:38,240
okay and then what we've done is we've

969
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,520
done two cover crop treatments of course

970
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:42,040
we got you know there's no there's

971
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,720
nothing growing out there okay because

972
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:46,680
the salts are so high drilled into corn

973
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,079
uh in Redfield we've had some luck we

974
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,599
have more of a saline soil there you can

975
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:52,560
but a lot of the cover crops we just put

976
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:54,280
into the soil if we drill it into corn

977
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,760
we're putting it into V6 but we're

978
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:59,960
always putting the cover crops planting

979
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:02,079
them probably about mid mid to end June

980
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:06,599
uh with after these Sals ands have been

981
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:08,880
put on okay so now you say I have salt

982
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:10,680
you tell me to put more salt out there

983
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,319
all right that doesn't make any sense

984
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,599
right I have salt and now you're going

985
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:16,760
tell me go put more salt up there okay

986
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:19,560
well here's what's happening okay the

987
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,440
salt most of them have a a component to

988
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:23,680
an either sulfur or in the case of

989
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,200
chloride okay where they're going to

990
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,839
lower the soil PH all right so if we put

991
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,839
anything with sulfur on so if we put an

992
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:33,359
ammonium sulfate if we put gypsum on if

993
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:36,800
we put Elemental sulfur on what happens

994
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:39,280
is we lower the soil PH we release

995
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,160
calcium from the lime and we hope to be

996
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:43,520
able to exchange that with the Sodium on

997
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:47,400
the exchange set so that's why I showed

998
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,880
you that picture of uh C exchange that's

999
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,040
what we're trying to do we have too much

1000
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,920
sodium on those exchange sides we're

1001
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,520
trying to lower the soil PH bump a bunch

1002
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,720
of calcium off flood the system with

1003
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,079
calcium and through cat exchange now we

1004
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:03,400
have more calcium in solution will

1005
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:06,000
promote the movement of the sodium off

1006
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,040
that exchange site get it in solution

1007
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,520
and now once sodium is in solution we

1008
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:13,599
can get it to go down if we get rainfall

1009
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:16,280
okay Elemental suer takes longer to work

1010
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,280
than gypson okay so if I'm going to put

1011
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:21,200
out when we look at this we we when we

1012
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,200
look at the tempar elemental sulfur and

1013
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,640
gypsum Elemental sulfur you need to

1014
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:29,800
oxidize that down to sulfate to form

1015
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,119
acid to get the calcium up so typically

1016
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,800
when you put amendments on if you're

1017
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,599
going to apply amendments you put them

1018
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,280
Elemental sulfur on it's going to take

1019
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,160
about 6 months to work compared to

1020
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:43,240
gypson so El but you need less of

1021
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,720
Elemental sulfur right so anything so

1022
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,960
what here's what we're doing any

1023
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,680
Amendment with sulfur lowers the soil PH

1024
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:53,319
releases the calcium cation into that

1025
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,560
solution to exchange with the Sodium

1026
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:56,760
okay and we have to have formation of

1027
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,520
that hydrogen

1028
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,040
of the acidifying of that soil to get

1029
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,200
that calcium off that Elemental sulfur

1030
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,160
when it's applied it's straight As we

1031
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:07,839
need the soil bacteria to oxidize that

1032
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,680
into our sulfate so we can have that

1033
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:11,880
acid formation so that's what we're

1034
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,560
doing I'm asking you to apply a salt but

1035
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,880
I'm really not asking you apply a salt

1036
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,200
I'm really asking you apply something

1037
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,720
that has an acid in it to lower that pH

1038
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:22,160
and get that calcium off okay so here

1039
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,880
let's take a look here I just did some

1040
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:27,480
study here so this is pure pant celic

1041
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:30,480
coder right here this is our

1042
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,480
there we go

1043
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,200
uh right here so I don't have a very

1044
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:37,359
good pointer in the red box up there

1045
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,800
here's my pure Pon site sodium right

1046
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:43,920
there

1047
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:45,079
4,846 parts per million s of 19 bad soil

1048
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,480
okay that's the first thing I'm going to

1049
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:50,720
talk about uh what we did here is we had

1050
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:54,400
this is what the plots look like right

1051
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:57,000
here these sub PL this was put on

1052
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,880
um a year after after these photos were

1053
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,359
taken okay so here's site number one no

1054
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:04,520
treatment no salt Amendment no cover

1055
00:43:02,359 --> 00:43:06,520
crop looks pretty ugly looks like it

1056
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,160
looks like concrete and those are the

1057
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,559
white salts on the surface so that's the

1058
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,119
first one right there this one here is

1059
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,359
calcium chloride we had some cover crop

1060
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,200
on the surface you can kind of sort of

1061
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,800
roll it right there we had a big

1062
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,599
rainfall that came down through here

1063
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,599
after we planted our cover crop kind of

1064
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:25,079
roll it a little bit there cover crop we

1065
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:27,280
planted with barley and sugar

1066
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:30,240
bead so that's that one right there

1067
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,920
here's gypsum down here so gypsum down

1068
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,920
here you can roll it a little bit better

1069
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,720
right there you can roll it a little bit

1070
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,359
better there that's the gypsum right

1071
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:41,040
there P salt on the surface and here's

1072
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:42,760
our Elemental solf for right here and if

1073
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,680
you look at this Elemental sufur right

1074
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,119
here you can see that that soil doesn't

1075
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,800
have quite it doesn't have the white

1076
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:52,040
salts on the surface if these other ones

1077
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,319
do so at least in this study with the

1078
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:56,640
conditions that we saw at pure Pont

1079
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:58,119
where we had the high sodium the high is

1080
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,079
now we have a lot of magnesium in this

1081
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:04,440
soil too okay that that has an influence

1082
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:06,880
as well too but at least here we saw we

1083
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,079
put an elemental so for a year before we

1084
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,200
came out and planted a cover crop in

1085
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:12,520
there a barley and sugar beads The

1086
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,839
Barley grew way better than the sugar

1087
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,839
beads

1088
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:20,040
did I agree and you know what Greg toel

1089
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,319
has a huge problem up there he's just

1090
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:23,800
like he I asked him I said can what can

1091
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:27,160
can we work in this field he says you

1092
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:29,559
can do anything you want is what he said

1093
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,160
so yeah and you know if we what would

1094
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:33,079
happen is if we start growing all these

1095
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,599
weeds for a cash crop then they start

1096
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:38,520
get diseasing and die yeah that's

1097
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:41,559
exactly what would happen okay all right

1098
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:43,839
so um right here Elemental sulfur you

1099
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:46,200
know Bary germinated go pretty well

1100
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:48,400
gypsum some of the barley germinated

1101
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:50,640
calcium chloride salt so how much should

1102
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,040
we put on we do these calculations based

1103
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,520
upon an S A lot of times we rather use

1104
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:59,440
EC or ESP to do the calculations um we

1105
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:02,599
drips them we put on to lower that uh

1106
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,839
almost uh you know 4 tons per acre right

1107
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:08,760
there cost 12 cents so it's not cheap uh

1108
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:10,960
calcium chloride works really fast okay

1109
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,800
you can put calcium chloride on calcium

1110
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:15,200
chloride is highly dissolvable in the

1111
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,480
soil you should not put calcium chloride

1112
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:22,359
on if corn is growing there I learned

1113
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:24,160
that the hard way um so but it came back

1114
00:45:22,359 --> 00:45:26,000
I thought it was going to be dead I we

1115
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,839
we put some on I told the gradu soon I

1116
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,559
said make sure you put it down the

1117
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,359
middle of the row I said do not put it

1118
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:33,400
near the corn plant so what they didone

1119
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,920
broadcast it all over you came and

1120
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,880
looked at the corn plants of the kisum

1121
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:40,520
chloride they look like they were gone

1122
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,720
but they fortunately we had a big

1123
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:44,640
rainfall two days later all the calcium

1124
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,480
chloride went down the corn started

1125
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,280
looking a lot better so I felt a lot

1126
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,480
better about that so you know so mother

1127
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:54,440
nature interven um Elemental sulfur you

1128
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,680
don't need as much all right um so

1129
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:57,800
that's a little bit cheaper but it takes

1130
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,280
a a lot longer to react and of course no

1131
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,400
Sal that doesn't cost any money if you

1132
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,000
don't do

1133
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,720
anything now so how are these rates

1134
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:07,079
calculated so I'm running out of time I

1135
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:08,520
only have 5 minutes left I if you're

1136
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:10,839
interested in learning on how you

1137
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:13,240
calculate these the information you need

1138
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:14,920
from your soil cast is the C exchange

1139
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,160
capacity of the soil you need that

1140
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,200
measure and you need the ESP I would

1141
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:22,640
prefer the ESP versus the S and so what

1142
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:25,640
we would want to do is we want to reduce

1143
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:28,760
the ESP in that surface soil down to at

1144
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:29,680
Le at least 5% if not less okay so I'm

1145
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,359
not going to go through these

1146
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:34,040
calculations CU I'm running out of time

1147
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:35,520
here if you want to go through these if

1148
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:37,359
you're interested in this from a you

1149
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,800
know from a Consulting point for

1150
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:41,839
applying gypsum I can show you how to do

1151
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,680
it it's also in that guideline up there

1152
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:46,119
there's some nice boxes and step-by-step

1153
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:49,079
details on how to do it but there but

1154
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:50,599
this is the method where we used the ESP

1155
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:52,480
and what we're basically trying to do is

1156
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:54,599
we're trying to take that we know this

1157
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,160
is the total salts on the surface we

1158
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:59,200
know what our ESP is we test that we

1159
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:01,160
want to go down to five what's the

1160
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,319
difference between what our ESP is to go

1161
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,200
down to five that is going to be uh

1162
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:06,640
that's the the math that we work out to

1163
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,160
determine how much of an amendment that

1164
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:12,920
we put out okay like I said I'm going to

1165
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:14,720
run out of time okay now Bas since these

1166
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,240
amendments are a little bit different

1167
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,880
the word we use when I teach soil

1168
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,640
science is molecular weight the mass um

1169
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,839
you can put on just like with lime a

1170
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,920
different lime product you can put on

1171
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:27,760
different rates based upon what their

1172
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:28,720
math is so if I put on one ton of gypsum

1173
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,760
I can put

1174
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:35,280
on19 uh tons of sulfur um if I put sulur

1175
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:38,800
sulfuric acid I put 57 calcium chloride

1176
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,839
86 and so on okay so last one I just

1177
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,280
want to mention is this here I know I'm

1178
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:46,240
almost have the time do I have five

1179
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:48,880
minutes yet or not three okay talk M

1180
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,760
okay right okay so here David gillet

1181
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,680
he's a great producer is he David Gill

1182
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:54,520
here I don't I didn't know if he's

1183
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:58,680
coming today okay so here's an area in

1184
00:47:54,520 --> 00:48:00,240
his field right here white salt 2010

1185
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:04,960
contacted us we got some money from the

1186
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:06,680
corn Council what can we do okay so s we

1187
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,640
did a field day down there

1188
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:11,000
2011 tall wheat grass right here looks

1189
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:14,520
just beautiful that's this old white

1190
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,839
sight right here got a soil pit okay

1191
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:20,119
look at this here it it look like snow

1192
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:22,640
out there in August 4 in down very very

1193
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:24,760
few salts right there no salts on the

1194
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,720
surface right here down at the bottom of

1195
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:29,440
the pit soil scientist you like to talk

1196
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:31,359
about redo features okay redo features

1197
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,920
means that you have this Orange in here

1198
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:34,760
these orange colors like can't really

1199
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,000
see them but right in there right in

1200
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,400
there that means iron has been oxidized

1201
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,599
if you have a piece of old equipment

1202
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,680
that sits out in the woods you don't pay

1203
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:44,240
any attention to it what happens to it

1204
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:47,960
it what happens to it over time it will

1205
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:49,400
what rust okay when iron in the soil is

1206
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,400
in the present of oxygen it does the

1207
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:54,559
same thing it turns orange so I know

1208
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:58,799
that where I had those Sal problems that

1209
00:48:54,559 --> 00:49:00,359
was the 4ot in my soil profile I have uh

1210
00:48:58,799 --> 00:49:02,160
reduxx features that are orange there

1211
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:05,839
hasn't been water there for a few few

1212
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:08,359
years soil water water table is deeper

1213
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:10,240
down here here is a pit that we do right

1214
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:12,920
by his cornfield in his cornfield as a

1215
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,920
matter of fact sorghum corn a soybean

1216
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:18,680
rotation water at the bottom of the pit

1217
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:24,000
okay white salt right up by the surface

1218
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:28,160
up there okay so here's what's going on

1219
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,880
um oh shoot okay right here uh white

1220
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,880
great here's our soil White Lake right

1221
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,200
here that we did this in August right

1222
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:39,079
here the weat by this uh the S by the

1223
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:42,640
site right there uh I'm hting too many

1224
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:46,960
buttons right here the S was one sodium

1225
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:49,720
is 179 here the right in the the the pit

1226
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,040
in the cornfield Horizon 1 2 and three

1227
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:55,079
sodium

1228
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:58,079
1296 s borderline right there he we have

1229
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:59,319
a we have sodium issues there okay so

1230
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,240
like I said I talk a little bit more

1231
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:04,680
about this but I'm running out of time

1232
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:07,799
Bruce KY did work with uh looking at n

1233
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:09,559
as soil scientist looking at water table

1234
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:11,319
depths here where is the water right

1235
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:13,799
here these lines are where the water

1236
00:50:11,319 --> 00:50:16,079
table depth is based upon precipitation

1237
00:50:13,799 --> 00:50:18,880
look at this where we had alala and

1238
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,119
grass 2010 we had all that rainfall we

1239
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,200
had the same problem with South Dakota

1240
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:24,960
you guys did okay too much rainfall even

1241
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,000
when we had all that rainfall where we

1242
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,920
had that

1243
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,760
and where we had that Al Alpa right

1244
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:34,960
there that water that um that soil that

1245
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,319
water table was considerably lower so

1246
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,720
I'm going to end there because I'm

1247
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:41,000
running out of time I'm going to go here

1248
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:42,480
and I'm going to give credit to all my

1249
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,400
the people that they help with our

1250
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,760
research then right there okay so like I

1251
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,720
said I really appreciate coming and

1252
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,880
talking to you about cell here I think

1253
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:54,440
it's an important subject we two quick

1254
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:57,440
questions if anybody has quick

1255
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,440
question

1256
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:01,400
be around yep I'll be around Y and so if

1257
