1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,440
so the first thing we want to get doing

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:07,560
is set up this plant in one of our net

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,960
cups this is a 3-in size and you just

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,480
want to be able to make it so that at

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,119
least couple of those roots are coming

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,880
through the bottom just so that they can

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:22,720
find that nutrient water doesn't have to

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,560
be very much and then we're going to use

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,560
our clay balls

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,080
here so these clay Pebbles offer

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,320
stability around your plants when you

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,600
are setting them up in the net cup so

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,480
you just kind

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,440
of put them around they also help keep

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,079
the light from getting through to your

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,079
nutrient water
