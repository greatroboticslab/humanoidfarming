2
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:15,120
a few foresters Amy here and today we

3
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:18,270
are going to harvest our Virginia jumbo

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,519
peanuts that we got from ehsan's family

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:27,840
gardener or aka the sapper gardener

6
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:30,109
sorry if I messed up Rob yes so we

7
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,850
planted peanuts through this whole

8
00:00:30,109 --> 00:00:40,739
raised bed here now unbeknownst to us

9
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:44,149
some of our yellow Mexican sunflower

10
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:48,989
seeds happen to get spread in here and

11
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:50,430
so these will will transplant these

12
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:51,690
somewhere else but I'm not gonna worry

13
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:57,899
about bringing them pulling them up

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:01:02,460
right now but for the peanuts that takes

15
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:06,020
about 90 to 110 days and what you want

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:09,090
to do is when the leaves start to start

17
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,280
turning yellow here that's when you want

18
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:14,490
to harvest them so I've got my basket

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,880
and we're gonna go ahead and pull a

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:21,080
couple out and then also to when we get

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,520
done picking the peanuts off

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,520
left over

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,840
all right when we get done picking the

24
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,310
peanuts off of the roots what we're

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,259
gonna do is we're gonna take these tops

26
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:38,680
and we're going to go ahead and give

27
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:48,630
them to our animals as a treat so let's

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:52,210
get started okay so as you can tell

29
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:57,430
these are very tall because this bed is

30
00:01:52,210 --> 00:02:04,000
a little low but I'm going to buy one

31
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:06,600
here oh wow

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,600
here we go

33
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:20,430
I don't know if you can see this there's

34
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:25,650
some peanuts just pop one open and see

35
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:28,140
if it's well let me pull I just broke it

36
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:30,060
off the root you should be we should be

37
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:35,459
using a fork I'll have to get one a

38
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:40,380
little large tool but look well let's

39
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:49,580
see if the being inside is if the peanut

40
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:49,580
is fully formed crunchy crunchy is good

41
00:02:51,319 --> 00:03:01,260
yep yeah it looks like it's filled up

42
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:04,830
that's good yeah it's good hold on let

43
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:10,170
me get my gloves off so I can peel these

44
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:12,000
I want to see and sure one of course I

45
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:13,560
know it's gonna be all natural it's

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,989
probably chocolate tastes like a roasted

47
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,570
peanut we have a little bit of green

48
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:21,690
I'll have a little dirt with it dirt

49
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:27,260
don't hurt alright so there's the peanut

50
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:27,260
out of the shell all right here goes

51
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:43,230
definitely has the peanut taste it's

52
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:45,940
like um

53
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:49,300
it does it's not really an earthy taste

54
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:52,690
though but it's good it's different it's

55
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:55,780
more like a um like an unsalted peanut

56
00:03:52,690 --> 00:04:01,830
basically not boiled not cooked not

57
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:04,150
roasted we're gonna boil these up and

58
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:07,840
probably freeze some eat some and

59
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:10,840
probably freeze them but let me try that

60
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,620
one you want to try that one here let me

61
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,620
get your reaction

62
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:24,840
that's about eating a green peanut Bo

63
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:31,210
but not bad

64
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:34,120
no not bad at all it's up salt tastes

65
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:39,419
like a big raw harder green bean or

66
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,419
something yeah not bad not bad at all

67
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:51,130
all right so let's uh pull out some more

68
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:53,289
here you know what um in our little tool

69
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,060
shed here I think down at the bottom is

70
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:57,840
one of those fork things and a shovel

71
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,840
you want to go grab it

72
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:16,350

81
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:12,380

82
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:17,510
pick them out of here yeah nikka balls

83
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:20,740
let me um hold on cuz there was some

84
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,740
that fell off so

85
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,449
I just wanna make sure cuz it went older

00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,449
that nice big warm

87
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:44,520
all right guys we're gonna start picking

88
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,010
them yeah I'll just start separating

89
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,110
them and putting them in here but we may

90
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:52,230
need a smaller basket cuz this baskets

91
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:55,110
got a lot of holes in it so we may have

92
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:56,720
to grab something else okay all right

93
00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:00,520
we'll see it a little bit

94
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,750
what you doing a me pick a pea nuts

95
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:08,450
[Laughter]

96
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:10,890
so now just so you know it's July

97
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:15,780
today's supposed to get up to 104 with

98
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:17,730
the heat and the humidity so sweating

99
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,500
and breathing heavy not a good

100
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:23,430
combination

101
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:31,590
if he's not outside alright so as you

102
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:32,790
could tell this is our pile so far this

103
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,700
is what we're gonna be giving a duck's

104
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:39,120
and in the turkeys and the chickens some

105
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:40,890
nice little treats Donald's been pulling

106
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:47,460
this up in sections we got one small

107
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:49,920
section left but as you could tell now

108
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:53,580
you can cure these by hanging them to

109
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:57,800
dry but we're going to be roasting them

110
00:07:53,580 --> 00:08:00,630
right away and also we're going to be

111
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,120
boiling them so we're not going to

112
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:07,050
bother with curing them we're gonna go

113
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,640
right to cooking them now just for you

114
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,110
guys to know what we're gonna do is

115
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:15,480
we're gonna let this bed rest for a week

116
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,860
we're gonna add some nice topsoil to it

117
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,860
once I'm able to get the rest of this

118
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,540
stuff cleaned out because you can tell

119
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,420
we got dollar weed in here and I went

120
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:29,940
crazy and then we are going to go ahead

121
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:34,100
and plant another crop of these jumbo

122
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:38,790
peanuts we still have some left over and

123
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:41,010
then that way come near the fall we'll

124
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:43,620
have another harvest of the peanuts

125
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:46,200
that's one good thing about Florida we

126
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:50,940
have a very long growing season

127
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:53,880
long and hot so we should so we're

128
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,339
attempting to get a second season out of

129
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,110
the you ain't guarantee and we can but

130
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:01,350
it's a good experiment to see if we can

131
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,839
and they did so well in this bed we just

132
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:08,329
got to replenish it and I think what I

133
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:11,970
may do is I may take one of these

134
00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:14,760
Mexican sunflowers do the chop and drop

135
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,810
that's gonna add in that nitrogen back

136
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,639
into the soil

137
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:22,380
I don't know we want to do with all

138
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:24,540
these seed pods on these I'd rather chop

139
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,670
and drop them someplace else I don't

140
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,070
want more I don't want to end up with

141
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,540
the same thing with Mexican Sun well to

142
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:32,010
be honest this is the first year we've

143
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,889
been able to grow them I've planted

144
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:38,010
these all over the place before and just

145
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:39,779

146
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,949

the flower that's got a lot yeah I just

173
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:49,680
double-check in the soil yeah sure miss

174
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,910
any and that one didn't have a bunch

175
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,290

00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:03,410
one more plant

178
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:17,530
and we oh yeah the weeds hold the plants

179
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:24,010
in pretty good just double-check that

180
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:38,430
make sure there's no throw that in the

181
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:38,430
ditch peanut more
