1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,480
so I run a Halfacre vegetable farm in

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:09,200
Northern Wyoming I have 8050 foot by 2

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,160
and a half foot beds that grow two to

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,400
three crops a year so I have a lot of

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,680
weeds to deal with and a lot of crops to

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,240
deal with so in order to maintain all of

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,519
that I have to have systems to make it

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:23,279
go really really fast really really

9
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:27,240
efficiently and those same systems can

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,519
work in your 220 or 250q foot garden at

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,239
home so the first thing that I like to

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,680
do is go around the entire garden and

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,640
pull everything I consider to be a

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,719
perennial weed what that means is it's a

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,879
weed that has to be pulled out by the

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,640
tap rout with something like a weed hook

17
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:50,879
or a digging fork

18
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:53,559
and um especially things like grass

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,800
dandelions um you know some of these I

20
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:56,359
don't even know the names of because

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,680
I've just done it so many times I know

22
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:00,879
that I can't cultivate them bind weed

23
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,760
and

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,400
get him with a digging fork and with a

25
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,840
tap fork with a Tap Root intact and get

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,960
them in a bucket and get them out of the

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,240
garden because every one of these that

28
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:17,040
you pull now will not grow back and this

29
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:20,360
is how over time your garden becomes

30
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,520
weedless and a lot less work this is

31
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:27,479
brand new soil I just started growing in

32
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,040
it um in August and it's now May so it's

33
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,920
not even a year old so there's quite a

34
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,280
bit of these perennial weeds and you're

35
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,520
kind of going to have to figure out

36
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:35,799
which ones are perennial in your area

37
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,799
you could do some research with your

38
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:42,040
local Extension Agency but if you do

39
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,680
this a little bit every week you're

40
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,360
going to be in really good shape in a

41
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,320
year in two years it's going to be an

42
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,600
Immaculate Garden so this little bit of

43
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:52,920
effort on your hands and knees once in a

44
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,680
while is going to save you a ton of

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,680
bending over in the

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,799
future now another tip for keeping your

47
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,880
garden weedless is cultivating instead

48
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,000
of pulling by hand so using a tool like

49
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,959
this colinear hoe or a stirrup hoe or

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,480
any of the hoes that are available

51
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,560
there's a million different hoes out

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:21,280
there uh and I'm not making a joke there

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,080
that's just you know I have to use that

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,879
term uh the there's a million hoes out

55
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:29,480
there and um any of them will work you

56
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:32,200
know the idea is just getting the weeds

57
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:34,760
when they're really really small like

58
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,120
this is kind of past du this is too big

59
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,319
but um I'm really going for weeds that

60
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,560
are about the size of a quarter or or

61
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,640
smaller and they're much easier to

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,239
tackle that way so um this is much

63
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,599
easier than being on your hands and

64
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,480
knees all day um this greenhouse is 1600

65
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,440
square F feet your garden is probably

66
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:59,319
only 200 250 square ft if that this

67
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,000
takes me about a half an hour to cover

68
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,000
the entire Greenhouse with this

69
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,280
technique versus being on my hands and

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,400
knees if I was sitting there pulling

71
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:12,120
weeds like this you know I'd be in here

72
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:15,840
all day so it's way faster way less work

73
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,280
to cultivate your weeds instead of

74
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,200
pulling them by hand like I just did all

75
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,599
I got to do with this is get underneath

76
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,480
them the weeds will be turned upside

77
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:26,720
down and they will die in the Sun that

78
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,920
little root will die in the Sun and you

79
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,680
have to know your weeds too you know you

80
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,280
do this with hand lines it's not going

81
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,879
to work you have to do it with stuff

82
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,280
that will die in the sun really really

83
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,439
quickly but this saves you a truckload

84
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,680
of work and again this is really new

85
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:43,720
soil and new ground so there's a lot

86
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,640
more weeds in here than normal but over

87
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,840
time just becomes less and less work

88
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,519
another tip for keeping your garden

89
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:54,239
weedless is planting in perfectly

90
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,760
straight rows see these two beds of

91
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,280
carrots here I use a special tool to

92
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,840
draw a grid on the beds perfectly

93
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,959
straight end to endend it makes it

94
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,200
really easy to do that cultivating stuff

95
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,920
where I'm just running a hole up and

96
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,360
down these beds and all the weeds have

97
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,280
been turned over just like this and they

98
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,560
will die in the sun makes it go really

99
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,359
really fast also if you plant with

100
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,720
perfect plant spacing every single time

101
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,120
that's very consistent and in a grid

102
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,680
pattern like this cabbage you see here

103
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,400
you're going to have a lot easier time

104
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,479
getting that hole up and down the roads

105
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,600
and in between the plants and you have

106
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,240
access to every square inch of the bed

107
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,479
so you can kill all the weeds without

108
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:40,080
bending over perfect plant spacing every

109
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:42,120
time is a must for keeping your garden

110
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,960
weed free I have a whole another video

111
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,639
about that that I'll put right here

112
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,600
another tip is using this black stuff

113
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,360
called weed mat all around your garden

114
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,639
to stop weeds from growing in between

115
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,440
the outside and the inside of your

116
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,680
garden and all it does is it stops light

117
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,199
from hitting the plants they die over

118
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,240
time and water comes through so you

119
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,360
don't have big puddles but this is

120
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,280
really cheap you can buy it on you just

121
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,639
Google weed barrier and you'll be able

122
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,199
to put it all around the perimeter of

123
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,240
your garden so you have a nice barrier

124
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:21,639
from the outside where the seeds weed

125
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:24,280
seeds are coming up and blowing in and

126
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:26,520
it makes it a lot easier because you

127
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,440
have a lot less weeds growing right next

128
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,960
to all your plants that you want to

129
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,600
harvest

130
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:36,600
so the most important of all these tips

131
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:39,600
is doing a little bit of all of the

132
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,759
stuff that I mentioned every week doing

133
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,240
a little bit of consistent effort every

134
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,440
week is a lot better than doing it all

135
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,960
at once when you have giant bushes of

136
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:55,000
weeds in July if you just spend 15 10

137
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,600
minutes in your garden doing all of the

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,199
stuff that I talked about every week

139
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,199
it'll be a lot less painful event it'll

140
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:07,520
turn into five minutes or 2 minutes but

141
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,960
um as you get better at this and cons

142
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,720
consistently do it it's a lot easier to

143
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:16,240
manage this whole High tunnel or

144
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,039
caterpillar tunnel is brand new it took

145
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,479
me an hour and 45 minutes to do all the

146
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,919
things I mentioned in 1600 square feet

147
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:25,560
and that's because the perennials are

148
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,599
really bad in here still there's still a

149
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,720
lot of grass that I have to pull every

150
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:31,440
time I bet you by the end of the year

151
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,400
it'll take me a half an hour to do the

152
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,880
whole 1600 square ft and so I do this

153
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,080
every week on the farm uh on a half acre

154
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,000
of growing space which is a lot more

155
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,080
than 220 Square F feet and that's how we

156
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,160
keep the all the crops looking as good

157
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,039
as they are and the weeds as little as

158
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:54,360
they are so hope you enjoyed that and

159
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,360
I'll see you in the next

160
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
one

161
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
e

162
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
e

163
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

164
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

165
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
e for
