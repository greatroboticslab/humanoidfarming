  "text": "Hello everyone,\nMy name is Youngsang Cho the founder of JADAM. In this episode, I'm going to talk about how\nto assemble an irrigation system. There are overall 2 parts one for the external\nhardware assembly And the other one is about the electrical\nsystem. To begin the assembly, as a major piece of\nequipment first you will need 3 pallets to flatten the land surface where you are going\nto locate the tanks. then one big water tank and 2 medium size\ntanks and lastly the 2 motors one for the water tank and the other one is for smaller\ntanks. and lastly, the water softener. For this video, I have purchased 2 tons size\nbig tanks and 2 600liter size tanks. The first 600 liters \ntank will be used as a microbes incubator and liquid fertilizer. And the nest one will be used as a pest solution. There was a lot of controversy on environmental\nhormones from the plastic tank, It was partially true but now all most all\nwater tank products are eligible to use for drinking water as well. Let's first start with assembling the motors. The first motor is from the company called\nHanil which they are broadly known brand in south korea. The first electric water pump's electric power\nconsumption is 1,500 watts The pressure height is 15.5 meters. I'm not an expert on electrical water pumps\nso you can always get advice from your nearest hardware store for more information. The size of the pump can vary depending on\nyour land size. And the second pump's power consumption is\n580 watts Which is better with smaller tanks. This pump is made for houses, it will automatically\nturn off when is not in use. And this is the water filter called the disk\nfilter. when you start using it, expect to clean it\nquite a bit often cause it will get dirtier the more you\nuse it. First, let's attach this filter to the main\npump. And of course, we will use Teflon tape to\nprevent leakage. After this one, let now assemble other pipelines\nthat will be connected to the other pipes and water tanks. If you open the PVC valve,\nyou will be able to see 3 different parts. When it comes to Teflon we also don't know\nhow much the accurate time to wrap the thread with Teflon, but with my years of experience, wrap about\n20 times on plastic parts and 7-15 times for steel-made parts depending on the size. Do wrap the Teflon properly because you don't\nwant to find a leakage after completing the assembly. Then next, I will install this part, for this\none, You will be needing a 50A 40A connecting nipple,\nBecause the plastic valve comes in the size of 40A but the filter's size is much bigger. And I will repeat the same thing on the other\nside. Then when we come below to filter, there is\nanother 50A size thread for the pump. I going to attach a steel connecting nipple. When it comes to PVC pipe,\nthere is a specific tool rather than just a normal wrench. This is much more convenient for you and you\ncan get it from the. Hardware store as well. Next, I'm going to make a hole to install\nthe valve. Before drilling, make sure to drill a little\nbit higher so that the valve itself has some space to rotate freely\nor you can put extra pallets to install it a little more below. The tool that you need is the hole cutter. The hole cutter should be a little bit bigger\nthan the steel fitting so that it will be firmly installed. Continue drilling slowly, then when the cutter\nreach to tank, give a little more force to drill further. Once you complete making holes, there is one\nproblem. The fitting that I'm holding should be installed\nfrom the inside. going into the tank to install that would\nbe a time-consuming and not smart way to do it. And this is where the trick comes in. Let me show you how. First, take some thin pipes,\nThen insert it into the tank and through the hole below. Lastly, just drop the other part of the fitting. Then hold it until it is tightened, Keep on installing it until you feel enough. If the part inside of the tank is rotating\nalong with the bolt, Then hold that part and continue until it's\ndone. And don't forget to wrap up Teflon on every\nsingle thread. Then next I will make another hole for the\nincubator tank. Once I'm done, I will repeat the same thing\nfor installing the fitting. Then I will be using a 20A size valve in order\nto fit the PB pipe. The most general pipe that we know is the\nwhite clear pipe. But these are weak in heat during summer,\nSo I would recommend using the PB pipe which is much more durable. You have probably noticed the difference between\nthe previous black PVC valve and the current one. Let me show the difference. The structure is based on 3 components,\nOnce you open the bolt, You will see 3 different rings. The first one is the rubber fitting,\nsecond is plastic fitting, then the third one is steel teeth for securing\nthe pipe. before pushing in the pipe make sure to put\nthe steel part inside of the pipe. Then when I push the PVC pipe in,\nthere will be a first smooth click. Then another hard click. That means it is all fixed in place. From now on I will connect the pipeline from\nthe bottom to the top. When you purchase large quantities it comes\nin a roll. So make sure to stretch it straight before\ninstalling it. There is a specific cutter for the PVC pipe. Purchase one of those and slightly force the\nlever then cut it through. Once you are done with cutting,\nIt is now time to fit right in. But before that, there is a 3 different parts\nafter when you open the bolt. Rubber fitting and 2 diffenrent PVC fittings. The mechanism of assembling together is pretty\nsimilar to the thin PVC pipe. It is just little bit bigger. fit in the PVC parts first, then fit the rubber\nfitting to plug it right into the connecting point. Once I'm done, let me install the elbow. After that same procedure is continued. Next, I will connect the smaller pump from\nthe tank. Then from here, I will connect the separator\nbefore installing it all in place. The single side is for the water goes into\nthe water softener, And the other sides are for the future, just\nin case you are going to connect some other tank. For this one, I will use the 20 A size connecting\nnipple, and for the other side I will use the size converter for 15 A-size components. Then I'm going to cut the PVC pipe into 49cm\nto connect the pipe on the side. Now let's come to the smaller tanks. One is for the pest solution and the other\none is for the microbes incubator or the liquid fertilizer. The fitting installed on the top is 20 A size\nand the bottom is 25 A size in order to drain the water quick. I'm going to install the bottom fitting first,\nMake sure to calculate the working angle of the component so that you won't have to release\nagain and again to fit the angle. And I will use the same trick to insert the\npart. You might need these small tools depending\non the product. Now it's time to install the valves. Then next let me connect the all pipes first\nwith T joint Once it is all connected I will make a turn\nfrom here, If your sink for the water is on this side,\nturn the pipe where the sink is located. The other pipe parts which are already assembled\nare for the water softener exit. The lower pipe you can use with just ordinary\nwater, and the upper part is for pest solution. And let's continue with the bottom part assembly. It is quite simple most of the procedures\nare similar. The bottom pipeline gets a direct connection\nfrom the main tank, and I will install the filter in order to avoid blockage from any\nunknown material. Then next I'm going to drill a hole in the\nexisting pipe. This particular component is called a plumbing\nsaddle clamp. It enables me to drill a hole in the pipe\nand make a different connecting point for other components. There is a rubber packing in the middle, make\nsure it is aligned with the point where you wanna drill a hole. Then use the screws to hold it together so\nthat it won't wobble when you are drilling. For this, I will use a 16mm hole cutter. Once it is completed, I will move on to the\nnext step. Which is connecting the tank with the water\nsoftener. I will convert the ordinary socket with the\none-touch fitting. The the same thing with other parts on the\ntop. Next is, we need to install other thin pipes\nto be connected to the water softener. For that, I will need 2 PVC elbow because\nwe are gonna turn twice. After that let me connect the other PVC pipe\nto connect the water softener. Now, we are almost completed installing all\nthe parts. And I will connect the other parts to the\ndisk filter. I will install the parts on both sides and\nplease measure the length before cutting the pipe. Then measure the other side as well. Once it is done, bring the pipeline to be\nback of the disk filter. Then decide which side you will be going to\nmake a turn. It really depends on your farmland's design. Next, I will add another 25mm hose line to\nease the pressure of water for the pump. To do that I will make 4 different holes. Let me tell you why we need to install these\npipes. When you are turning on the irrigation system,\nthe pressure of each pipe will increase. And If you release the lever, the irrigation\npipe on the field cannot be sustained due to its high pressure. And to secure the pipelines, we need a sub\nhose which will reflux the water back into the pump. Meaning, the water pressure will be normalized\nand prevent any leakage happens. As you can see there is a main pipeline coming\nout from the container, and there is one lever to control water level. But also it is connected with the thin pipe\nwhich is connected to the other water tank for liquid fertilizer. If you release the big lever all at once,\nof course, it will just flow into the ground. But If you release a little bit, the pressure\nwill absorb the water from the fertilizer tank. So it is capable of irrigating water and fertilizer\nat the same time. And this specific part is not very necessary. But if you have it, then it would be great\nto connect water pipes and water tank along with it. This small water pump is automatic and whenever\nthere is a tank with the lever opened, it will water it until it's full. But it will be closed if the tank is already\nfull or the lever is closed. As you can see the inside of the water tank\nis not visible. And it's because of moss if the tank gets\ndirect contact with sunlight. But with this blue tank, we don't know exactly\nhow much water is inside right? So I'm going to install some parts which will\nenable us to see the water level. Once you are done, right down the indication\nof the amount so that you won't have to look into\nside to check every time. And here install one of the short pipes inside\nthe tank. Bent down the hose with fire then install\nit. Then you will able to see all. The water gets drained out of the tank. Use the marker to indicate which hose is coming\nfrom which pump and water softener. You can use these two tanks for both pesticides,\nmicrobial solution, and liquid fertilizer. When you would want to use the both the tank,\nrelease all the levers down below which are connected with the main water pump. And let's talk about the floating valve. The big tank needs a big floating valve because\nof its size. And of course small valve for the small size. There are a lot of products for stopping the\nwater such as the electric floating vale but this one is so far cheapest and most reasonable. As you can see our setup includes three major\npieces of electric equipment. The main pump, small sub pump, and electric\nheater for microbial incubation. But you can also add some more such as electrically\npowered spray. And to run all of that of course we will be\nneeding some electric distribution board to cover the circuit from the rain. For that, I will make another video on how\nto make one. Speaking of the electric heater. You can get these from amazon or aliexpress. This is needed when the temperature drops\nbelow 18 C . because of active microbes. Chose the one which fits the tank perfectly. Don't choose something long or very short. Using microbial solution is the key factor\nto maintain healthy soil conditions. So make sure to irrigate often as possible. There is no right temperature indication with\nthis piece of machine. If it gets too cold,\nyou have to increase the temperature even higher. So please keep that in mind. And lastly, when you are using this tank for\nthe first time, make sure to pour the water in. and\nduring winter, please release all the water out to prevent freezing. There is going to be some problem with the\nautomatic pump when you use it for a longer period\nof time. If that happens, check the part behind the\nmotor to fix it. Thank you for watching and I will see you\nguys in the next videos.",
