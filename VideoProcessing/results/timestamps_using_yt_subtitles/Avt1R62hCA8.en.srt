[Music]

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,080
hello everyone thank you for having me

3
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:17,240
and thank you for joining us today and

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,359
um today I will be uh focusing on a

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,480
little more on the surface part of the

6
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,359
so compaction and trying to give two

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:27,240
different studies that I had experience

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,039
before with the manure so Erin kind of

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,679
explained quite a bit about the

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,279
compaction and I'm just going to move

11
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:35,280
you guys a little bit more towards the

12
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,960
Manu applications and its effect on uh

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,960
compaction and um Rel some some related

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,000
so

15
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,520
properties so the first work I will be

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,360
presenting is going to be from South

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,960
Duda and and the second part of the work

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,719
second part second work is going to be

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,960
from the Wisconsin and the Wisconsin one

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,079
has sendy souls in the in the in the

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,600
field so there are going to be some

22
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,640
similarities to those areas in the east

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:04,799
coast but if have deep sendy soils and

24
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,400
hard pains in it in each cost then these

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,119
impacts of the manure on on the

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,280
compaction and other soil properties

27
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:13,159
could be could be more limited than what

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:14,560
it is in in this in this presentation so

29
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,080
three different things I want to

30
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,080
highlight here that I think they are

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,880
really important uh for manure

32
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,040
application and especially when we focus

33
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,680
on the soil property changes especially

34
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,640
from the physical

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,040
perspective would be the type of the

36
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,439
manure and handling an application and

37
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,320
also interaction with other uh

38
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,200
management practices like tillage or

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,680
field traffic uh because the distraction

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,680
factor from the disturbing disturbing

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,479
agents like tillage or or any other

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,640
field operations uh may be greater than

43
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:47,159
what we actually add as an organic met

44
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,719
and trying to expect positive

45
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,759
relationships with or positive effect on

46
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:54,799
soil compaction so poultry manure or

47
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:56,759
Hawk manure or or cattle manure they're

48
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,039
all having different characteristics but

49
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,880
within the cattle manure the beef manure

50
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,520
and da manure also has different

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,360
characteristics they have different

52
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,759
nutrient contents different moisture

53
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,640
levels that I kind of categorize them in

54
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:11,560
two different categories like nutrients

55
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,040
and also physically like moisture and

56
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,160
these are really important for manure

57
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,879
application and and expecting the

58
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,519
changes in so properties is because they

59
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,360
have different nutrient content and when

60
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:24,040
you apply the manure you calculate

61
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,920
according to nutrient contents like

62
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:29,120
nitrogen or phosphorus and they also

63
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,200
have different moisture levels so the

64
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,959
application amount of the manure is

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,599
going to be different in dairy or beef

66
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,760
so for instance here let's say we are

67
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,360
applying according to phosphorus or

68
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,040
nitrogen you can see greater numbers in

69
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,920
beef manure but when you look into

70
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,560
moisture you will have greater moisture

71
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,760
in Dairy means to reach the same level

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,280
of the nutrients that amount of the

73
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,959
manure you need to apply is going to be

74
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,319
much more in Daily and also because of

75
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,920
the moisture that's going to be even

76
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:00,159
more so just keeping those mind and

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,080
those in mind and pipe is really

78
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,280
important handling application is

79
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,120
important but then in the second study

80
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:08,640
we will be digging into uh some other

81
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,519
factors that is playing the critical

82
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,760
rule for those

83
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,799
changes so improper manure handling or

84
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,560
or or spraying or exercising of the

85
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,480
application can lead to so compaction so

86
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,480
it is important to consider the the how

87
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,799
much field traffic we are causing and

88
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,280
and so condition like we just me Aon

89
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,080
just mentioned about soil moisture is is

90
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,040
really important especially when you're

91
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,959
focusing on compaction and and also

92
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,040
application rates how much manure you

93
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,560
are adding there uh that that could be

94
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,400
even more concerning when you think

95
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,280
about the environmental perspective but

96
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,640
focusing on the compaction how are you

97
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,200
applying that manure are you applying

98
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,840
the solid manure on the surface are you

99
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,400
incorporating with the tillage or are

100
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,680
you just applying like in the picture

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,599
here on on the snow and in liquid form

102
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,879
or you're just Drilling in or injecting

103
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,120
in the liquid manure those are really

104
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:03,000
important factors to consider and

105
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,400
depending on the objective of of the

106
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,640
work so next I want to talk a little bit

107
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,840
about the manure management uh for

108
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,239
enhancing the soil resilience here we

109
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,680
have some different pictures of the

110
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,479
different size of the Aggregates and we

111
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,040
also have organic met playing critical

112
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,000
rule so there are different factors

113
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,440
there but I want to categorize in three

114
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,080
different category one is increasing the

115
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,919
sole organic matter and we know so

116
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,960
organic matter has an impact on the soul

117
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,720
structural development so the second one

118
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,280
is soul structure having a better

119
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,199
weather Soul structure usually help and

120
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,880
also the root growth having the living

121
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:38,280
roots in the system those are the three

122
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,039
different things that many could

123
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,800
incorporate like supporting more

124
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:43,880
vegetation growth or increasing the

125
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,280
organic matter and improving soil

126
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,400
structures so we have different

127
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,560
aggregate sizes and those has different

128
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,320
pores and particles together and and

129
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,280
also you can see even here in much

130
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,280
detail we have different pores in in

131
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,919
even smaller sizes and incorporating

132
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,800
manure in in the system can can lead

133
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,880
aggregation or increasing the organic

134
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,680
matter but at the same time we need we

135
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,080
need to consider that soil structure is

136
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,840
also playing a critical role there and

137
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,520
those pores are the where we store the

138
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,800
nutrients and those are the where we

139
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,240
store water and and we also need to

140
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,160
understand that organic met could be a

141
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,319
binding agent between particles and it

142
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,960
can also take place in in creating of

143
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,720
those pores so strategies to minimize

144
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,440
the compaction would be choosing the

145
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,720
appropriate equipment trying to avoid

146
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,600
the field traffic and also monitoring

147
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,880
the soil moisture level that's really

148
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,919
important and having the heavy

149
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,720
equipments in the field when it's moist

150
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:42,360
we just saw from the a in Stall that is

151
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,400
really really important timing and soil

152
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,479
conditions and and also uh incorporate

153
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,759
manure properly are you going to do a

154
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:51,319
reduced Dage just to incorporate the

155
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,919
manure are you going to spray it on it

156
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,840
or liquid form they're all really

157
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:58,160
important as I just mentioned in in the

158
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,759
previous slide too so the first study is

159
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,120
going to be about um different three

160
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,120
three different rate of the menu

161
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,880
replication rate and we have two

162
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,120
inorganic fertilized replication rate

163
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,000
and a control and for the manure PM is

164
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,160
representing the phosphorus based manure

165
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,440
application is a recommended rate for

166
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,759
satoda and NM is a nitrogen based manure

167
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,240
and hm means High manure which means

168
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:24,479
it's double rate of the NM basically so

169
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,240
this two two times nitrogen we are

170
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,160
adding in the system with the a then we

171
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,280
have nitrogen fertilizer where we add

172
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,280
nitrogen only for corn and then we have

173
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,720
high fertilizer where we support other

174
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,280
nutrients like phosphorus pottassium

175
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,000
zinc and sulfur as well and control

176
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,280
there's nothing no no manure no

177
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,319
inorganic fertilizer and we did this

178
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,919
study in two different sides which da

179
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,840
manure and beef manure are the one we

180
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:50,960
used for for each side and they were in

181
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,960
s theota and all my grass for this work

182
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,759
is going to be color coded so green is

183
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,039
going to representing manure and orange

184
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,800
is going to represent in organic

185
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:01,560
fertilizer and control is gray and

186
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,080
increasing the it of the color in each

187
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,680
uh in in figures they are going to be

188
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,360
representing the increasing the rate of

189
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,319
the menu replication so basically what

190
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,199
we have seen here focusing a little bit

191
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,440
on the surface 0 to 4 in that manure

192
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,520
application did decrease the B density

193
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,400
and increasing the rate also decreased

194
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,319
that and when we move into the second

195
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,240
depth is a subsurface 4 to 8 Ines we see

196
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,120
slightly changes in back density but

197
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,720
effect is limited compared to surface

198
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,720
dep means the impact of the menu is is

199
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:37,560
slowly moving in deeper profile but we

200
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,199
are still very close to surface so the

201
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,160
the another property that I'm going to

202
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,960
show uh soil structure really important

203
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,960
about the compaction and having more

204
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,720
aggregation having more pores in the

205
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,120
space is is really important we have

206
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,720
seen improvements in in Manu application

207
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,680
again increasing the rate has better so

208
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,000
for the surface manure has a great

209
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,440
impact on improving so structure in

210
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,720
subsurface it seems slowly moving and

211
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,360
this is the effect after 14 years both

212
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,800
bity and aggregate stability was 14

213
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,919
years of the application of manure and

214
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,919
we have seen some negative effect from

215
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,360
the fertilizer even though they are not

216
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,280
significantly different numbers were a

217
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,120
little low compared to control in

218
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,759
previous years this was not visible too

219
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:23,479
much but when we move forward to like

220
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:26,599
more 14 years level and we have start

221
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:29,159
seeing this more and more so impact of

222
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:32,760
the manure is is there in in aggregation

223
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:34,919
too so we talk about B density and soil

224
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,680
aggregation so of course they are all

225
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:39,000
related to pores and bigger pores

226
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:41,760
especially are going to be a good story

227
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,519
today we have in the second work too and

228
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,800
water infiltration is heavily depending

229
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,680
on that right so we have seen an

230
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,720
increase in water infiltration uh due to

231
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,640
the manure impacts and we don't see that

232
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,560
effect from the fertilizer

233
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,880
applications again don't forget the

234
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,640
color codes and looking into organic

235
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,800
matter comparing different years so

236
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,160
previously we were looking looking into

237
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,160
different deps right now in general we

238
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,640
are looking difference between between

239
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,079
the years so one year after we start we

240
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,720
have no seen seen no impact from the

241
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:15,000
manure in organic fertilizer and we come

242
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,800
when we come back after 14 years we we

243
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:20,320
we see a much more impacts from the

244
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:21,920
manure and it has been increasing the so

245
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,000
organic matter and increasing the rate

246
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,360
of manure application also increases all

247
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,360
organic matter

248
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,360
level so the next I'm going to show here

249
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,200
in this graph same thing with so organic

250
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,760
matter nitrate nitrogen also show

251
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,160
similar results you know the nutrients

252
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,839
can be responsive in shorter time than

253
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,600
the soil structure or other soil

254
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:44,000
properties we have seen a greater impact

255
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,880
with increasing the rate after 14 years

256
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,760
in organic fertilizer there were little

257
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,000
move but differences are not significant

258
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,680
and we have seen same trends for other

259
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,720
nutrients as well I'm not going to put

260
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,240
the figures for them here but just want

261
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,040
to sum highlight that other nutrients

262
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,920
were also showing the similar trends

263
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,440
that nitr nitrogen or or so organic

264
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,720
matter so the next is pH uh there's a

265
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,920
huge database behind this data this

266
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,320
slide so I just want to summarize here

267
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,600
for pH manure showed different reaction

268
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,720
in different fields the the pH show

269
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,519
different reactions to manure

270
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,200
application in different fields when the

271
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:26,000
pH level was high like 8 8.5 manure tend

272
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:30,240
to decrease that pH and when the level

273
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:33,600
of the pH was low about 5.56 level and

274
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,160
manure tend to increase that pH level

275
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,760
and but when we look into inorganic

276
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,800
fertilizer we know their pH level is low

277
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,519
so it's we always seen a negative effect

278
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,399
of the inorganic fertilizer no matter

279
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,560
whatever the level of the initial pH

280
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,959
is electrical conductivity probably one

281
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:53,000
of the negative effect of manure when we

282
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:54,360
apply in a really high rate this rate is

283
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,680
crazy like

284
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,839
17,700 pounds per acre that that's

285
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,279
that's too much and um and also we have

286
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:06,399
seen inorganic fertilizer has has either

287
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,800
no impact or decreasing and only highest

288
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,880
rate of the manure has increased

289
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,880
electrical conductivity but we are still

290
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,440
in the safe range right 78 is is a good

291
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,240
number for especially Souls like in s

292
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,600
Dakota has good structures and good

293
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:21,399
organic met levels uh I think the

294
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,440
numbers are okay

295
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:29,320
still so how about Biologicals uh and we

296
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,040
have seen support to fi and nitrogen and

297
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,920
carbon based enzymes like uas and metag

298
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,279
glucosidase and we haven't seen any

299
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,040
impact on bacteria because of the manure

300
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,000
application but fungi population and and

301
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,480
also some enzyme activities were were

302
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,560
increased again why we are talking about

303
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,639
all this properties together because

304
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,320
when we talk about the soil health and

305
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:54,000
which is focusing on soil compaction or

306
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,040
soil physical properties we have seen a

307
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,920
quite a bit correlation between soil

308
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,839
Health scores and crop yield in xais

309
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,839
here we we have the so Health scores

310
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:05,519
from left to right is increasing and

311
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:07,120
crop in the Y AIS from bottom to up is

312
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,399
increasing and you can see it's kind of

313
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,839
a not completely linear but very close

314
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,320
right so we have seen control right here

315
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:17,320
and then we have two inorganic

316
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,240
fertilizers and three manure so manure

317
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,519
is definitely helping the so Health

318
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,839
scores right but when we look at in the

319
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,360
crop yield fertilizer and low rate of

320
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,839
the manure has not not that much

321
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:31,320
significant differences uh but when we

322
00:12:28,839 --> 00:12:33,480
look at so Health score fertilizer is

323
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,000
not significant like high fertilizer and

324
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,959
control they are not significantly

325
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,040
different so it seems the increasing of

326
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:42,360
the manure rate like you can see from

327
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,560
the lighter blue darker blue and green

328
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,560
like here we can see increase both from

329
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,839
the crop yield and so held as a summary

330
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,279
graph it's showing that high rate of

331
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:55,279
manure is also supporting crop yield as

332
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,880
well so that was the first study we

333
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,480
mainly focus on the different type of

334
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,680
Manu application and in here in second

335
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,360
study I want to highlight a little bit

336
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,079
about the disturbance factors with

337
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,800
manure or without manure so we had a no

338
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:12,360
till and conventional teal systems in in

339
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,600
Wisconsin and in on a slope and we had

340
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,720
the manure incorporation with solid

341
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,560
manure or or liquid manure and since we

342
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,639
first study was solid manure let's let's

343
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:24,800
focus on solid manure too so we can kind

344
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:26,800
of have some comparison there uh and we

345
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:29,160
also sample different times like before

346
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,920
tillage before planting after planting

347
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,920
summer before harvesting and after

348
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,720
harvesting so that way we can see the

349
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,720
impact of the Agricultural activities

350
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,800
right like planting Impact Summer impact

351
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,600
harvesting impact tillage impact with

352
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,199
and without the manure

353
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,440
scenarios so here the blues are going to

354
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,399
be tillage and intensity of the color is

355
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,199
going to be manure or no manure so as we

356
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,279
can see in the Box density we had a

357
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:55,040
greater box density in noal systems and

358
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:57,240
manure did not differentiate this was

359
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,560
very common in most of the so properties

360
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,759
in in Wisconsin in more

361
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:05,399
Souls uh we have seen greater impact

362
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,839
from the disturbance agents like tillage

363
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,639
or AG any agricultural activity that add

364
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,759
more traffic in the field or or erosion

365
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,279
sometime we had some some data to

366
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:18,320
measure that too so disturbing factors

367
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:21,680
due to the agricultural activity were

368
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,000
always having greater impact than manure

369
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,800
having impact in in the sols so in here

370
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,120
we can see B density was much higher in

371
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,079
in in Nal system again uh I only showing

372
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,480
the surface depth but we have this all

373
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:39,480
the way down to the 40 50 CMS which is

374
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,199
around 16 18 inches I I believe so

375
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,279
you're welcome to ask more detail if you

376
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,320
are focus on the deeper Soul profile so

377
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:48,199
when we look into aggregation again

378
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,199
tillage is making the huge difference

379
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:52,079
especially in the bigger Aggregates so

380
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:55,519
is effect of the disturbance on bigger

381
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:57,639
Aggregates is great and even but we can

382
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,399
also still see some of the significant

383
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:01,480
differences for menure Edition and which

384
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:03,440
is the orange here is has manure and

385
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,519
blue doesn't have manure you can see

386
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:08,320
some shift in the big one too in in

387
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,639
different sizes so when we move from the

388
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,160
planting for example this one was before

389
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,240
planting to the harvesting the responses

390
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,560
are changing under manure and and no

391
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:19,160
manure but when you go in the smaller

392
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,440
Aggregates those response kind of

393
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,279
constant between the different timing

394
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,959
but effect of manure is there same thing

395
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:29,120
in the noil has has an impact but

396
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,199
tillage impact is much greater than

397
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,120
adding manure in in the system because

398
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,639
it's kind of disturbing so here x access

399
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,880
we are going from planting to harvesting

400
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:43,199
from left to right and here on on on the

401
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,480
y axis we have soil micropores so you

402
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,440
you can just kind of this is the

403
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,560
convention till no manure you can kind

404
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,360
of see here from the planting to the

405
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,680
harvesting this is the year one and this

406
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,120
is the year two and you can see a

407
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,360
decrease from the mcro P so we have a

408
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,720
quite a significant effect on Agri paral

409
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,480
disturbance on the on the micropores

410
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,279
presence in the soils or proportion in

411
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,079
the soils we have a very clear impact of

412
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:10,880
harvesting that is decreasing the

413
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,560
micropores proportion we also have a

414
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,000
very clear impact of the tillage on them

415
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,720
and when we look at the scenario with

416
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,160
the manure we still have those effect in

417
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,240
conventional till systems but when we

418
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,480
look into no till system we see an

419
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,399
increase so the agricultural disturbance

420
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,639
is not as intense as in conventional

421
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,759
Tails so we start seeing the positive

422
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,440
effect effect of that in in in this

423
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:37,279
study so again effect of the manure is

424
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:40,120
still limited but in in in tillage or

425
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,519
disturbance effect is is more clear and

426
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,360
you can see that from the starting

427
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,040
points that there's a significant

428
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,279
difference and ending points there are

429
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,360
much different so the the effect of

430
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:52,279
activity in in field is is quite

431
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,959
significant but when we look into

432
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:57,279
microor we don't see that even though

433
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:59,399
they starting the same level and changes

434
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,319
in the micropores

435
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,000
proportion doesn't change too much so it

436
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:07,839
shows that disturbance is more effective

437
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,480
on the on the on the bigger pores in in

438
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,280
in the system and this also shows in

439
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,240
water release so when we look into more

440
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,600
into smaller ports or moisture content

441
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,919
in different pores there we can see a

442
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,480
significant impact of the manure so

443
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,520
especially in the noil systems dark blue

444
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,640
is representing solid manure and lighter

445
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,880
blue is no manure you can see there's a

446
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,520
significant effect even in in in small

447
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,200
smaller pores compared to compared to

448
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,280
bigger pores uh but tillage effect is

449
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,640
still there it is still there same thing

450
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,000
with the carbon content we have seen

451
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:45,240
differences from 0 to 6 in no

452
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,679
differences 6 to 12 in we have increas

453
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,880
if we have an effect of tillage for

454
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,720
example no till no manure conventional

455
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,400
till no manure significantly different

456
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,799
but when we look into conventional till

457
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,000
systems even though tillage has effect

458
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,240
and manure also shows an effect on it so

459
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,159
manure has effect on organic carbon or

460
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,520
organic matter in in both studies we

461
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:07,720
have seen

462
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,440
this so looking into more stable organic

463
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,880
carbon or or or active organic carbon we

464
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,440
have found the relationship between the

465
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,360
active organic carbon and bigger

466
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,799
Aggregates which are being heavily

467
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,799
Disturbed compared to smaller ones and

468
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,440
we have seen more stable organic carbon

469
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,520
in smaller Aggregates I think that was

470
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,880
something really important to know that

471
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,799
so for the conclusion this is an inner

472
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,919
layer surface of the aggregate uh I

473
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:35,960
thought it's a good slid for conclusion

474
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:37,720
and we can see different port sizes here

475
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:40,120
with different shapes and with different

476
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,280
sizes and we sometimes have the port

477
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,039
there continuous we have so particles

478
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,080
around it with different colors and with

479
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:47,760
different elements in it so focus on

480
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,360
this rectangle because most of the data

481
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,039
I'm going to show is from here so when

482
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,520
you when you look into Elemental

483
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:56,679
distribution is you can see from the top

484
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,280
to bottom the the these are the most

485
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:00,520
representative elements here they they

486
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,480
are in this area and from top to bottom

487
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,960
the the proportion is decreasing and we

488
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,400
can even map them and we can look at

489
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,280
into different pores and different

490
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,880
elements and see which one is higher in

491
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,400
the system you can see like lighter

492
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,640
color means we have more of that you can

493
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,520
see Iron this this particle is in Iron

494
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,840
this particle is calcium and we have

495
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,720
calcium around here too I I I'm focusing

496
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,400
on calcium because we have seen a quite

497
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:26,400
a good correlation between calcium and

498
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,960
so structure stability and and aggregate

499
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,760
sizes in in the system so they they

500
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,320
definitely play a critical role and

501
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,440
menure has all these in it including so

502
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,200
organic matter carbon nitrogen different

503
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,760
elements and so just consider them when

504
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,480
you're applying manure and and in the

505
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,679
questions that what you are

506
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,200
expecting so I am a and an assistant

507
