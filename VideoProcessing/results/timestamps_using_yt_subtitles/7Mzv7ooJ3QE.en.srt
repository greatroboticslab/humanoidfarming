1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,520
All right, welcome aboard everybody.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,400
This is Steve at Thousand-Year Homes.

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,240
So, out here I'm just solo building. Uh

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,480
uh and this is a real world build.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,240
There's not uh you know, bank money and

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,040
a whole bunch of money. I'm I'm building

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,080
from paycheck to paycheck. Uh just like

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,080
uh just like they did 50 years ago. So,

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,240
uh and I can only build so much at a

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,320
time. So, when you come visit me, I'm

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,160
homesteading. I'm building these uh

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,599
shipping containers. They're looking

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,359
pretty good in thigh, but uh I'm slow.

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,079
Uh which is an honest approach,

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,079
especially here in Texas where uh the

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,960
heat and the drought has been something

17
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:42,160
fierce. And uh but it rained last night

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,079
and it rained really solidly. Um and I'm

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,000
it kept me up all night long, so I'm a

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,320
little tired. But let's go ahead and

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,640
walk around today. See how successful

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,480
the rain has been or not. Uh the horses

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,160
are up. They're showing me that uh

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,840
they're muddy as all get out. So,

25
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,039
they've at least got a little cooling

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,120
off. Let's take a look. Okay, let's real

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,120
quick just show you what's going on so

28
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,479
you can get an idea as I drive around.

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,360
So, uh right here, uh you see there's

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,000
the farm. Um this is the satellite image

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,240
that's about a year old. So, uh there's

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,200
the shipping containers. What I've done

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,439
today is I've driven you up to this

34
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,640
stock pond which was dry. So, this one

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:26,080
was mostly dry and we've taken a look at

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,640
some other things. First off, uh on this

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,680
particular satellite image, if I scroll

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,840
in, it doesn't even have the uh pond

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,240
that I built right here with here where

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,240
I um first off, let me scroll in a

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,640
little bit. So, right here is the pond

42
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,119
that I went ahead and just dug and put

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,960
the bridge over. So, from the house

44
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,079
walking over now, I have this little

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,119
pond right in here in this woods. Uh

46
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:55,320
there is the um the two gardens that I

47
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,680
have uh right there. So there's the

48
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,320
gardens. So you'll see that I've done a

49
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,799
lot of manage water management already.

50
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,960
So let me go ahead and and zoom back out

51
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,200
for you all so you can see the the

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,520
complete property. So the couple of

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,920
different things that I'm doing here. So

54
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,400
one thing that I'm doing is I'm uh

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,959
building a swale that will run through

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,840
here. Let me go ahead and just get brown

57
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,400
up then. So, this swale runs through

58
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,959
here and I'm trying to pick up the water

59
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,800
out of this area. So, I've got a little

60
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,680
swale coming out here and it goes

61
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,000
down and it goes all the way up to here.

62
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,599
So, you can see that this area, if you

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,480
look at it closely, that it drains over

64
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,720
to here. So, I'm hoping that I can pick

65
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,760
up all of that water that drains. Now,

66
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,519
this didn't uh drain at all here uh

67
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,040
during this rain, but that doesn't

68
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,280
surprise me because

69
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,599
um you know, we've had a drought. So,

70
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,760
all of this water here that gathers up,

71
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,000
what I want it to do is flow down here,

72
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,480
go through the new bell gate that I

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,480
have, run through here, and then find

74
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,480
its way down to here. Now, what I've

75
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,200
decided to do is I've decided to go

76
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,519
ahead and um dig out underneath this

77
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,840
fence and run a couple more swailes down

78
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,800
to here. You can see the cattle are

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,800
gathered up just like this. So, I'll

80
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,040
have three swailes that'll be running

81
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,040
down in. Now, these don't exist yet, but

82
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,519
I'll go ahead and do them. But what did

83
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,440
exist and what did work is right here.

84
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,560
You can see there's a wet spot in the

85
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,159
field right right through here. And um

86
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,680
what I'm going to do is I'm going to go

87
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,599
ahead and I put in that test pond right

88
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:43,000
here. And

89
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:45,920
um so that test pond is in and it's

90
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,640
successful. And uh you know I've got a

91
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,000
little tiny sweat ditch really that I

92
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,480
just dug over to here and uh it's topped

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,760
off right now. So those are uh the

94
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,519
things that I'm doing. I'm trying to

95
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,080
gather up the water here and pipe it

96
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,760
down a swale into the pond. So instead

97
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,920
of this dried up pond, I'll have a

98
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,400
filled one. Then this paddic will have a

99
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,560
pond. That paddic will have a pond. And

100
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,599
then this paddic, what I'll end up doing

101
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,920
is dividing it out. There's a there is a

102
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,079
stream that runs through here, a ditch

103
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,919
rather, that runs through here and dumps

104
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,400
all the water into here and then it all

105
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,880
runs down to Butcher Creek. So what I

106
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,479
want to do is I want to harvest that. So

107
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,880
couple of different things. Right now,

108
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,800
this is spilling spillway through into

109
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,280
the garden and then it'll run over to

110
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,960
here and down. This thing when it tops

111
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,800
off, you could see that it runs this

112
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,560
way. What I want to do is uh one final

113
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,120
pond and it will be a large pond uh that

114
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,280
I'll build and I'll build it over in

115
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:51,120
um this tree area. And I really want it

116
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:55,280
to be a a two or three acre pond uh so

117
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,600
that I can capture uh as much water as

118
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,560
possible. Now through the property, I

119
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,440
have a swale that goes here already and

120
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,680
one that runs through here and they both

121
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,960
dump out already right through these

122
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,639
trees where they go through into the

123
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:14,720
creek. And so I'll be building this pond

124
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,039
eventually. Uh, and I want it to be a

125
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,000
couple acres pond. And I want it to be,

126
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,440
I don't know, 18 ft deep. So, with that,

127
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,960
I'll have a p one, two, three, cuz

128
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,720
hopefully this thing will hold

129
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,199
water. Three ponds. And if I can get it

130
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,600
filled up, I might even do, you know,

131
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,919
expand out the pond a little bit here.

132
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,639
But first, let me dig it deeper and get

133
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,440
these swailes going so it doesn't go dry

134
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,199
in the droughts. And then this pond. And

135
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,960
then these uh swailes here, uh they're

136
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,039
they're working out pretty good. So all

137
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,840
of the uh everything that I'll capture

138
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,360
in these areas, uh you know, all of that

139
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,840
water that I'm going to capture in this

140
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,160
area and run down this swale uh you

141
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,320
know, will dump into that pond. I have

142
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,479
to build these swailes. They don't exist

143
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,360
yet. This one and this one. And that

144
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,840
fence row has got a wall built up along

145
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,720
it. So, the water kind of runs this way

146
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,520
and is escaping into the creek uh like

147
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,000
that. So, anyway, that's what's going on

148
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,080
uh in this little roundabout. So, oh,

149
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,639
the last thing that I did is down here

150
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,120
I'll put NY uh you know, I have the

151
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,360
little stock tank that I put in and it's

152
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,840
only a little bit full. But that's a lot

153
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,240
of different water solutions. And on 3

154
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:33,919
in, I already picked up a little bit

155
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,479
here. I I filled this off. Uh, this

156
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,120
didn't work here, but it will, right?

157
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,919
The theory is is there. That one worked

158
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,960
really well. This one is sort of kind of

159
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,919
working. And that doesn't exist yet, but

160
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,639
it will. So, um, and this doesn't exist

161
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,880
yet. So, really happy with the overall

162
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,199
water plan. It might take me more than a

163
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,560
year or two to get it done, but I will

164
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,840
get it done. And then during the

165
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,520
drought, uh, you know, July, August,

166
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,199
September, uh, you know, October, I'll

167
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,400
be I'll be digging each one of these

168
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,240
ponds as I can go. Um, the swailes will

169
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,720
be the first thing up here that I'll do

170
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,960
because I've already started them. And,

171
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,440
uh, I want to get seed back on the the

172
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,440
fields as soon as possible. So, without

173
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,360
that uh, further ado, let me jump back

174
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,280
into the video and you guys can watch

175
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,120
the actual physical outcome of this game

176
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,120
plan. All right. So, as my mud beasts

177
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,160
are showing here, we actually had some

178
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,080
rain around here for a change. 3 in is

179
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,639
what my neighbors report. My weather

180
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,639
gauge is not currently working. So, what

181
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,479
I will do is we'll go take a look at the

182
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,039
pond. We'll take a look at some of my

183
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,720
other uh materials. I got to pick up all

184
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,479
of my wet boxes that the uh UPS guy just

185
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,039
left on the side of the road without

186
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,800
plastic bags. That's always pleasant.

187
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,000
So, let's take a look here. Now, one

188
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:58,080
thing I did wrong was I did not get the

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,759
salt block out of the water. So, uh this

190
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,280
is always a bummer when this happened,

191
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,599
but I I leave it evaporate, dump oats in

192
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,800
it. They still get the uh you know, the

193
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,240
salt lick out of

194
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,879
there. But that looks I'm underneath

195
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,120
trees. So, that's looking like 3 in,

196
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,280
right? Maybe even a little more if I

197
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,840
look at that wheelbarrow. Now, let's go

198
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,000
take a look at some other things. Well,

199
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,199
that looks pretty good for a no water

200
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
garden. Uh, you know, nothing else grew

201
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,639
in here. I found a composting place for

202
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,599
me to go ahead and put compost over the

203
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:37,479
top of that box. But, uh, let me tell

204
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:40,719
you, my uh, it came too late to save

205
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:43,519
my sunflowers. Either that or the horses

206
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:46,080
got in there and ate them all. Not sure

207
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,399
what happened there. Disaster on that

208
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,240
sunflower field. I don't see anybody

209
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,640
left.

210
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,800
But they do look eaten rather than

211
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,279
anything else. And I I don't actually

212
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,240
keep the horses out of that. It doesn't

213
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,440
matter to me, but something got that.

214
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:07,200
Wowee. Well, 3 in is the magic number to

215
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:10,880
take this from uh dry to filled right

216
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,200
up. This looks really, really good. Uh

217
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,839
man, this year was so dry. It went dry

218
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,760
twice. So, there won't be any frogs in

219
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,959
here that I can think of, unless they

220
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,720
buried themselves in the mud. Uh, I'll

221
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,920
go ahead pull the weeds out of there.

222
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,640
There. I don't like that one.

223
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,399
Weed. Not half bad, everybody. So, those

224
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,040
have been I'll get some pictures of this

225
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,000
when it's dry so you all can appreciate.

226
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,800
Now, I have seen this as a running water

227
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,320
and it runs this way. So, what I'm doing

228
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:46,160
here is uh from the um uh pond, I'm

229
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,920
going to make a swale. And I'm slowly

230
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,480
working on it. And the swale will go

231
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,320
around and it'll go around

232
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,480
here. And if you look there into the

233
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,720
garden, you could see that I've got a a

234
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,279
swale beginning where the water will go

235
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,120
flow into the gardens and and then out

236
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,120
that way to a

237
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:09,600
river. Looks really good. But oh my

238
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,600
gosh, I have been I might be able to

239
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,240
make it this year for water for my

240
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:19,200
horses without having to bother my poor

241
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,200
neighbors anymore. That's really really

242
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:27,160
good. This side I I've got I put gypson

243
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,920
in it and so this side ends up getting

244
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,600
clear. And uh I might do the same thing

245
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,440
to that pond. My chickens are out in the

246
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,560
in the forest.

247
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,680
All right, let's go ahead and get a uh

248
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,600
in my uh UTV and go and drive and see

249
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,040
what else we've got going on

250
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,839
here. All right. Well, I'll tell you

251
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,480
this rain really changed my mood. I I I

252
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,720
just can't do in five months we got like

253
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,120
two inches of rain. I I just couldn't do

254
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,360
it anymore. I I'm not built that way.

255
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,440
And uh I grew up in Michigan where you

256
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,399
know land of lakes and there rains all

257
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,880
the time and uh I never have adapted to

258
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,000
Texas and to be honest when I watch

259
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,959
everything die that I plant it uh gives

260
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,040
me a a heap and helping of depression.

261
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,399
So I'm very much a creature of my

262
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,120
atmosphere very much connected to the

263
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,519
land and uh you know it doesn't take

264
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,240
much just some rain to cheer me up and a

265
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,560
full stock tank. Uh, this thing is

266
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,320
working out. Um, and I I wondered if it

267
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,880
would. That's just three inches. So, if

268
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,680
it rained a normal amount, I could dig

269
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,720
this out even bigger and deeper and have

270
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,040
a um, you know, I would still keep the

271
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,800
front for the horses to wait into. So,

272
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,839
it's a ramp there, but the rest of this

273
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,000
I would dig out uh, pretty deep and

274
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,640
pretty narrow. I try to retain as much

275
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,880
moisture as I can. But, uh, this end of

276
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,240
the house I'm real happy with. I've got

277
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,399
grass seed. I've got long stem uh uh you

278
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,360
know, blueg grass to plant and some

279
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,079
other things uh natives uh grass seed

280
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,720
here. I'll put it in the ground. Um it's

281
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,880
supposed to maybe rain again this week.

282
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,560
Now, I'm not declaring victory. I'm

283
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,200
fully expecting uh to see, you know, uh

284
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,079
the gr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr

285
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,120
dr dr dr dr dr dr dr dr drought continue

286
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,040
through, you know, July, August,

287
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,120
September. But it was over 101 degrees

288
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,079
in the summer here and everything that I

289
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,480
had was was dying. Uh the horses were

290
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:32,079
having to hang around me all day long

291
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,839
and um because the grass is too stringy

292
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,839
when it doesn't get any moisture in it

293
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,440
and it's really hard to graze. So I was

294
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,600
feeling their

295
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:43,600
complaint. And uh anyway, I'm I'm so

296
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,000
much happier with this. Let's go up and

297
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,839
we'll take a look at my test uh stock

298
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,399
tank that I dug as well as my swale that

299
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,160
I put in to try to redirect more water.

300
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,360
I I don't know if it got enough rain for

301
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,360
that or not, but we'll find out

302
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,360
together.

303
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,639
Well, there's a whole herd of buzzards

304
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,440
here. I don't know

305
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:30,800
why they're still roaming around. I

306
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,800
don't see anything for them to be

307
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:36,120
eating. Maybe they were just having a

308
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,120
convention.

309
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:54,959
That there is all of the cedar that I'll

310
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,199
end up stripping for uh coyote fence.

311
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,199
I'm just moved it out of my way so that

312
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,240
uh the needles can fall off of it and I

313
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,720
can go through. I also uh will run this

314
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:09,440
over with my brush hog. It can run up to

315
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:12,079
3-in uh size logs. So, that's how I uh I

316
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,399
mulch it, right? So, I'll turn that all

317
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,399
into

318
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,040
mulch. Sure made the field look a lot

319
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,240
better.

320
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,199
I did get grass uh head. So, uh

321
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,199
hopefully it'll recede. The cattle

322
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,000
haven't been out here because there's no

323
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,760
water for them to drink. This stock tank

324
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,600
I'm coming up to has been

325
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,440
empty. And the cattle, if they did use

326
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:56,440
it, they would have had the trunk in the

327
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,440
mud knee deep, and that's not safe.

328
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,549
[Music]

329
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:10,800
Yeah. Yeah. So, uh, for reference, the,

330
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,880
uh, the pond used to be up to the bottom

331
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,040
of that tree right there. Right. So, uh,

332
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,560
it got a little water. It was all

333
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:24,839
cracked and and whatnot, but not nearly

334
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,839
enough. Let me see if my swale work.

335
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,639
Doesn't look like flowing water went

336
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,639
into it. It looks like the idea might

337
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,600
work, but I'm just going to have to cut

338
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,600
it in deeper.

339
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,000
Some shallow spots there.

340
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:41,279
All right. So, that uh bit of rain

341
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:44,000
wasn't enough to cause runoff here along

342
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:47,759
uh that old Pioneer Road that used to be

343
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,480
a road that would go to a dip tank as

344
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:54,800
well as some other go off in church or

345
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,800
wherever it went. I don't know.

346
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:02,720
So, that feels like my pond idea there

347
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,240
uh might work, but uh I'm going to

348
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:10,439
require more than 3 in of rain after 5

349
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,439
months of drought, right?

350
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,919
Yeah, I don't see anything that

351
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,160
happened. Just wasn't enough rain. Oh,

352
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,120
I'm

353
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:35,360
wrong. Oh, lookucky

354
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:38,120
there. Well, that's a 4 and 1/2t hole.

355
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,440
I'm going to take a look at it right

356
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:44,440
now. Pretty pretty excited. My idea did

357
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,440
work.

358
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,320
Like I say, that's a 4ft test

359
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,000
hole,

360
00:17:53,320 --> 00:18:00,160
huh? Well, all

361
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:03,600
right. Well, I'll scrape the land with

362
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:07,720
my uh my little tractor and I'll make a

363
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:10,640
little halfacre pond here. All right.

364
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:14,720
Wow. Wow, man. That that would be

365
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,720
awesome. I would have

366
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,120
uh I would have then

367
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,440
two ponds. Uh I'd have this pond, I

368
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,919
would have that pond in these paddics.

369
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,960
So each paddic would have a pond. Man,

370
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,960
that is exciting

371
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,919
stuff. All right, another success that

372
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,720
I'm super happy about. Lookie, you know,

373
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,200
that was just a a wild hair that I got

374
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:50,320
that um based on the lay of the land and

375
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,600
how it ran into this aoyo over here. If

376
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,640
I can hijack it and get it to come it

377
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:01,360
and I could put a pond in here and uh

378
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:04,559
look uh that I did it. So, uh, the the

379
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,880
plan will be a similar size pond with a

380
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:09,919
a decent ramp for the cattle to come in,

381
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,559
but narrow and deep in order to kind of

382
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,480
keep as much water as possible. Now,

383
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:19,360
I'll be losing a little bit of uh of

384
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,760
pasture to this pond, but it'll more

385
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,160
than make up for it because uh I'll be

386
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,120
able then to close off both paddics and

387
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:30,000
then I can density graze each one. So,

388
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,400
the cattle and horses um they'll they'll

389
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,320
last a little longer. So, my bell way

390
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,520
down there where I'm slowly working on

391
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,360
the fence uh uh I I might get excited

392
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,720
about and finish up. But now that it's

393
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,039
cooler, uh I'll be I'll be back on the

394
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,760
sawmill. Uh I just couldn't handle the

395
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:51,039
tin there. Too hot. But uh this is super

396
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,280
exciting. I feel like I've won. And uh

397
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,520
you know, that's not a mud uh just a mud

398
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,919
puddle. That thing's 4 foot deeper. So

399
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:01,200
I'll put some uh some of the video of me

400
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:04,000
digging that. Uh super exciting, man. I

401
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,840
am happy about that. So and so will the

402
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
wildlife. They'll they'll appreciate

403
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:12,080
that little little drinking spot and so

404
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,080
will the cattle. Ah, just so

405
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:17,919
happy. Well, I'm pretty happy with the

406
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,000
results of what little bit of uh water

407
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,320
collection I've got going on here. I've

408
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,880
been working on it for a few years. The

409
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,760
first year I wasn't out here living. Uh

410
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,720
I had an apartment, but uh I went and

411
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,039
collected uh you know, images and paid

412
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,000
attention and came out. So, my last bit

413
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:39,000
of uh water is this tank. And Leah and I

414
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,960
went ahead and repaired it, and it was

415
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,919
dry. I can see that it's uh gosh, not

416
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,600
not very full, just the 3 in. Now, I was

417
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,760
expecting to collect more water than

418
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,080
that from there. But what I'll do is

419
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:55,039
I'll get aluminum tape and I'll tape

420
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,799
along the gutter and the uh convolution.

421
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:00,480
I think I'm losing, you know, half the

422
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:03,760
water um through each one of the uh uh

423
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,679
ridges and peaks of the corrugation. So,

424
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,159
I'll go ahead and tape that up so that I

425
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,039
can capture more water. This was just

426
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:14,799
all juryrigged right now temporarily. I

427
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:17,440
want to I've got I found enough uh um uh

428
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:20,240
eaves to run the other side. I'll put a

429
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,840
bulkhead here. Rebuild this. I need this

430
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,320
to be about half full so before I can um

431
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,600
uh go ahead and put the walls around it

432
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,720
because uh I'm expecting it to change

433
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,960
shape once it gets filled with water. So

434
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,600
I was hoping more would be in there than

435
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,960
the the 3 in. But I'm grateful for the

436
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,960
three that are there. Uh I can see based

437
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,679
on the bottom there's water underneath

438
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,520
it causing a little uh you know can't

439
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:52,400
burp out of there etc etc. But, uh, I'll

440
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,720
just live with it the way it is. Once I

441
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,039
get it full, then I can, you know, use

442
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,919
this for agricultural, keep my gardens

443
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:02,480
green, uh, get some additional trees out

444
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,720
here. That was destroyed. Destroyed in

445
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,039
the storm. Destroyed. It was already

446
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,799
torn up, but the roof was still there.

447
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,559
So, win some, lose some, but all that

448
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,799
will be moved when I'm done with the

449
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,960
sawmill area. I've got enough storage in

450
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,120
there. I can move all of that. And so,

451
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,919
I'll get the sawmill all set up way back

452
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,400
yonder. uh working hard doing a lot of

453
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,080
different things but uh when the when

454
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:28,640
the heat is the way it is and it's over

455
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:31,039
101 and you know you can't touch tin and

456
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,960
all I'm doing is working with metal and

457
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:35,200
uh it's hard for me to keep positive

458
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,200
energy going so you know I look for

459
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,760
little jobs to do like clearing a tree

460
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,679
or something like that uh working at the

461
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,600
front on the gate just little things

462
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,000
like that but they're not forward

463
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:47,520
progress on the li on the living

464
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,679
arrangement

465
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,080
uh which this year I've got high

466
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,480
ambitions to get the real foundations

467
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,840
underneath here as well as the roof,

468
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,240
etc., etc., etc. And daylight's burning

469
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,480
and uh we'll see if I can accomplish

470
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,720
this. So, a little bit of work here to

471
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,240
do on the uh you know, I want to make

472
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,799
sure that this thing catches all the

473
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,200
water it can and fills up. Uh so, I'll

474
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:13,200
be working on that. I might cut across

475
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,159
here and grab that one, too, and see if

476
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:20,159
I can double up the capacity. Uh, I

477
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:23,360
should be getting about 340 gallons per

478
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:26,400
inch of rain off of there and maybe uh,

479
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:27,840
you know, that's a 5,000galon tank, so

480
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,080
you know, it takes a lot of water to

481
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,919
fill it up. Uh, but I need it at least

482
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:35,039
half filled so that the walls are pushed

483
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,760
out so that I can earth bag it about and

484
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,480
stuckco it and, you know, not make it an

485
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,440
eyesore. It's an eyesore. Uh, but it's

486
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,200
an eyes sore because uh I got to get

487
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,760
that yet. I don't have any water out

488
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,679
here. I'm a dry cabin. So, I got to get

489
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,600
that filled up with some water so that

490
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,440
it's the right size and then I can fix

491
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,000
it up, make it look nice, fix up the

492
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,679
bulkheads, uh, you know, do these eaves.

493
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
They're temporary, too. So, they're just

494
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,080
up there with magnets. Uh, there's a lot

495
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,080
of things to do, but I'm pretty excited

496
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,360
about this bit of rain. I appreciate it

497
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:10,360
much. uh really changed my moods and uh

498
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:13,440
grateful to God because I

499
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:17,200
complain. I have a relationship with God

500
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,200
that's very vocal and uh so you know uh

501
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,200
I appreciate the rain being out here and

502
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,159
fill it up and hopefully it'll continue

503
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,159
on.
