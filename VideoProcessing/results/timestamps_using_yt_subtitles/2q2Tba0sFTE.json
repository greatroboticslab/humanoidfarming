  "text": "hi i'm sarah and here on the manager farms channel today it's upcycle monday which means we're going to be making a solar powered drip irrigation system for free just using recyclables the first thing you need for this project is a one liter completely free of any labels at least as much as possible and then you make a cut about at this line here first things first for any project especially with little ones around it's better to not have them with arms reached when you could be cutting something so i'm going to pass them off to his uncle yes now you just need a two liter bottle again as freeze-label as possible can't get everything all the time cut about here so now that we have all of our parts cut up and ready it's time to install the watering system into our plants it's important to note that this is not to replace your regular watering system but just to help when it gets hot and your plants are going to need the extra moisture so leave the cap on so the water does not absorb into the dirt that's for the other parts so i think i want to install it right about over here i miss the plants but yet not too close to any one particular root structure and you're going to want to go a couple inches down because you want to get some of the base into the dirt so it doesn't really loosen up too easy and because we're not forecasted to have any rain in the next couple days we're going to add some water into it i'd say about there never waste got some extra water you might as well just splash it around any thirsty plants that might be nearby now the cool thing about this irrigation system is that we then place this piece of plastic over the water and down a little bit so as the heat heats up the water it causes water to evaporate the water evaporates and condenses and goes down the sides of the container back into the soil watering all the root systems at once and that extra time of thirst thank you for joining us and have a great day [Applause] now remember if we all gave up our lawns for gardens there'd be no more hunger in america good boy because i am not good at this do i have to do it like right here okay hold on [Applause] hi today on the maybe farms channel oh i messed up i go then you go okay okay is it ready okay hi i'm sarah president of lot number seven and today on the miami farms channel we're going to be doing a solar powered dammit carl i forgot what size of all is this one liter now we're ready hi i'm sarah and today on the management farms channel",
