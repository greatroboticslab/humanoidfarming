00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,519
like to share with you the abilities of

34
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,959
this 40 foot wide corn head as well as

35
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,879
its production history,

37
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,599
first, let's head out to the field so

38
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,610
you can see and hear all this harvesting

39
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,679

The 40 foot wide, 16 row, 30in space

55
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:20,240
John Deere C6. 16F folding corn head was

56
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:23,840
introduced in model year 2020 as part of

57
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,840
the company's range of C series corn

58
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,240
heads which includes nine different

59
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,240
models of rigid and folding headers

60
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,440
manufactured at John Deere's Harvester

61
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:39,440
Works located in East Molen, Illinois.

62
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:44,039
The corn heads range from the C6R six

63
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:49,360
row 30in head all the way up to the

64
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:52,639
C18F 20in folding corn head. The C16F is

65
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,680
equipped with a 19in augur which allows

66
00:06:52,639 --> 00:07:00,080
the header to consume a large amount of

67
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:04,240
corn. The C16F can harvest 65 more acres

68
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,599
per day than a 12 row 30in space corn

69
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,680
head. Paired with an

70
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:13,360
X9100, this header allows the large

71
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,840
combine to harvest 7,200 bushels of corn

72
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,039
per hour. The farm featured in this

73
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,080
video is harvesting their crop with two

74
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,840
John Deere X9100 combines equipped with

75
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,639
the

76
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:31,479
C16F corn head. The combines harvest

77
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:36,479
14,400 bushels of corn per hour. that

78
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:38,759
requires four J&M 1150 grain carts with

79
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,560
a carrying capacity of

80
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:46,720
1,150 bushels. The carts are operated by

81
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:51,840
four 620 engine horsepower John Deere

82
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:55,280
9620 RX tractors. It takes a fleet of 13

83
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:59,039
semi trucks to haul the corn away from

84
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,800
all this harvesting action. The C16F, in

85
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:06,479
addition to picking corn in a hurry,

86
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:09,680
also helps to size and reduce the amount

87
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,800
of residue out in the field. It's

88
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:17,280
equipped with Romax chopping stock

89
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:20,800
rolls, which help chop up the stocks

90
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,840
into pieces that are 6 in or less, which

91
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,319
help speed up the breakdown and burial

92
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,039
of the residue left out in the field

93
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,599
without it washing or blowing away. The

94
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:35,360
headers are also equipped with John

95
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:38,479
Deere stock deflectors which are used to

96
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:41,039
push down the stubble and fracture it

97
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,360
which again helps in the breakdown of

98
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,160
the residue and it also reduces the

99
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,760
chance of damage to the tires and tracks

100
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:52,880
on the combines. These deflectors are

101
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,720
placed behind each row unit across the

102
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,160
header. You can see from the aerial

103
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,640
views of the video how the Romax units

104
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,120
and stock stompers leave the residue in

105
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,040
the field as flat as a pancake. The

106
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:10,000
outside points on the

107
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,399
C16F cornhead snouts light up at night.

108
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,200
This feature allows the farmer to have

109
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:18,080
better visibility of the 40ft wide

110
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,040
cornet from inside the cab as well as

111
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:24,240
the grain cart operator to have a good

112
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,480
view of where the corn head ends and how

113
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,440
far they need to be away from the

114
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,160
combine. This header's ability to fold

115
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,800
up speeds up the harvesting process.

116
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,040
When it goes into transport mode, it

117
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,279
drops down from 40 feet wide to

118
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,200
20.75 ft. Being able to leave the header

119
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,519
attached to the combine and move on to

120
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,240
the next field saves a lot of time

121
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,640
without the hassle of loading it onto a

122
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,090
header wagon and moving it separately

123
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,519
from the combine. The C16F weighs in at

126
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,480
Deere.com, it has a list price of

127
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:13,519
$270,520 for model year 2022. The C16F

128
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:17,920
corn head featured in this video is

129
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:20,160
attached to a John Deere X9100 combine.

130
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:23,040
This machine was introduced in model

131
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,560
year 2020 and went into full production

132
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,959
for model year 2021. It's manufactured

133
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,000
at the company's Harvester Works located

134
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:38,160
in East Molen, Illinois. It's powered by

135
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:41,320
a 13.6 L John Deere Power Tech 830 cubic

136
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:44,800
in engine rated at 690 engine

137
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:49,760

138
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:53,040
pair of 24 in diameter, 11 1/2 ft long

139
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:57,279
rotors. It has a grain bin storage

140
00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:01,920
capacity of 460 bushels that unloads

141
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:04,560
through a 31 ft augur at 5.3 bushels per

142
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,240
second. According to John Deere.com, the

list price for an X9100 combine for mall

144
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,399
