that is not just sustainable but one

22
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:55,920
that thrives before we introduce this

people across the globe and today's

28
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,759
topic is something Our Guest is very

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,600
familiar with this is sustainable

30
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:13,360
agriculture we would like to introduce

31
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,479
today's guest Le llo deini she has a

32
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,680
bachelor's degree in physics and

33
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:19,880
agrometeorology she has worked at a

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,680
science and technology institution in

35
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,600
South Africa she has completed her

36
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,360
Masters in Business Administration at

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,200

United Kingdom and has a special

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,119
interest in climate change and

40
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,680
agriculture thank you for joining us

41
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,799
today thank you for having me maybe we

42
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,520
could start by just understanding what's

43
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:40,640
the definition of sustainable

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,079
agriculture in simple terms sustainable

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,600
agriculture means farming to meet uh the

46
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:51,759
demands for food production without

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,040
destroying natural resources Land Air

48
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,799
and most

49
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,479
importantly water to irrigate and grow

50
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,399
the crops or livestock that you have on

51
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,960
your I know you uh have a background in

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,720
sustainable agriculture how did you come

53
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:13,239
about getting involved in the space uh

54
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:16,840
actually the plan was not to uh go in

55
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:20,319
agricultur sector I actually plan to

56
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:23,440
study uh matology which was mostly

57
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,319
influenced by my mom because my my mom

58
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,640
worked at matology

59
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,519
to but uh agriculture it's something

60
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:36,599
that was always there at home my dad was

61
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:40,080
a a teacher but on the side he plant

62
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:43,840
crops we had uh a shink and cows

63
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,400
chickens we basically farming on the

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,959
side and we will sell to the community

65
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,680
that we have people passing by our house

66
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:59,200
they see they saying this crops and

67
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:01,480
animals and then just come and B and uh

68
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:06,519
like I said earlier the influence was

69
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:08,959
more of what my mom studied so when I

70
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:14,080
completed my

71
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:18,200
metric um I applied University of

72
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,239
Victoria to study materialy but then

73
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,560
there was challenges with Finance

74
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,840
because if I had to go out of the town

75
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,879
that I've stain to go and study in

76
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,319
another Province um it will actually

77
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:34,840
more expensive so my parents were like

78
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:39,480
can't you find something similar here at

79
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:43,000
home that it's related and that's when I

80
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:47,120
uh looked at uh the university that was

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,959
in my area I see that they offer AGR

82
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,920
matology that's when I was like it's the

83
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:55,560
same it's the same as studying matology

84
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,239
and at home we are doing farming so I

85
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,040
pursued

86
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:02,680
agrology that way yeah sounds like a

87
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,920
blend of you know what you had seen all

88
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,159
your life and somehow happened very

89
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,720
coincidentally yeah it's it's basically

90
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,560
my childhood everything was they

91
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:16,799
influen most of my career what do you

92
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,799
see as the need for sustainable

93
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,240
agriculture like why do we need it and

94
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,840
what's kind of wrong with the ways uh

95
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:27,120
for at least quite some time it's it's

96
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,919
maybe industrially done or it has been

97
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,960
followed uh I think SU

98
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:38,720
agriculture we have to ensure that we

99
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:41,440
keep our we protect our resources so

100
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,720
commercial farming it's good in a way

101
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,800
that it provides uh food to people but

102
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,320
now it also compromises on

103
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,919
sustainability compromises on

104
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,960
uh the environment now we have pollution

105
00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:01,560
and using Machinery that requires foral

106
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,960
them so if we can try to at least um

107
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,680
incorporate methods that are more

108
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:10,840
sustainable providing food still

109
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,960
providing food for people but without

110
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:19,199
impacting their environment so I think

111
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:21,880
it's important that uh we we consider

112
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,960
those factors especially for commercial

113
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:30,800
Farmers they are more on the commercial

114
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:32,720
side of using more um energy

115
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,560
consuming uh

116
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,240
machinery and so uh it's important they

117
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,479
also focus

118
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:45,199
on uh bringing that sustainability

119
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:47,759
aspect in their farming practices and

120
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,080
you did mentioned about I think maybe it

121
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,560
is challenging when you look at the way

122
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,759
agriculture has been done until now uh

123
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,280
in the sense that uh you know commercial

124
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,720
agriculture probably uses a lot more

125
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,160
resources and in cases where even for

126
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,759
example Forest are probably uh being

127
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,360
slowly removed uh to promote certain

128
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,160
products which are extremely high in

129
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,880
demand so in in such a situation of you

130
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,960
know extreme high demand and then uh

131
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,039
just the need for food increasing and

132
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,000
variety of food increasing what are the

133
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,319
different challenges that somebody who's

134
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,400
trying to move into sustainable

135
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:25,199
agriculture would probably

136
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:29,039
face um the challenges that I think I've

137
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,160
noticed among fers is um lack of

138
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,520
knowledge

139
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,000
a lot of farmers are not aware of what

140
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,840
sustainable practices are for them to

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,360
actually begin implementing that in

142
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:44,400
their farming

143
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,400
practices and some of them once they get

144
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,479
the knowledge now they are faced with a

145
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,880
challenge of funding how do I now get

146
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:57,400
the money to get these uh resources that

147
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,360
are going to help me to produce enough

148
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:04,080
for

149
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:06,840
people and and uh help me transition to

150
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,840
uh sustainable agriculture shows those

151
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,240
are the

152
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,680
challenges and the other challenges that

153
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,199
uh farmers

154
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,960
face uh when it comes to converting to

155
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,479
sustainable

156
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:25,879
agriculture is the demand people are now

157
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:29,080
used to uh conventional way ways of

158
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:31,960
producing food so now when a farmer

159
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,720
comes and tries to introduce food that

160
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:39,080
are organically produced

161
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,319
or um they didn't use a lot of uh

162
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,919
chemicals you find that now they are

163
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:47,039
only at a small percentage of the

164
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,120
community so they're not getting a lot

165
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,400
of buyers so now you find that the

166
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,840
family

167
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:58,159
like I still think I need to produce for

168
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:01,840
me to I have a livelihood I still need

169
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:06,319
to produce my my crops the way the the

170
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:10,960
conventional way so and uh

171
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:14,479
sustainable sustainably produced um food

172
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,599
are usually more expensive than

173
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,080
the the conventional produc food so

174
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,240
people normally opt for that and it's

175
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:27,000
really a challenge for Farmers

176
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:31,279
so um then those are the main challenges

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,399
actually with uh transition to a

178
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,399
sustainable AG

179
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:39,959
culture yeah and I think I've also seen

180
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,360
uh for example certain organic products

181
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:43,760
sometimes don't look or are not

182
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:47,000
sometimes the same size in terms of

183
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,200
specific species that work well as a

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,360
conventionally produced one which look

185
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,279
like that pict a perfect in some sense

186
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,480
and I don't know if that also has has an

187
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:58,360
impact because I have seen people who

188
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,120
might not see a big price difference but

189
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,959
they just don't find it

190
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,320
goodlook enough to buy uh sometimes um

191
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,480
not sure if that's an experience that

192
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,160
you had

193
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,240
too H yes yes I can agree with you with

194
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,680
that and also the other day I I I got

195
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,320
these wipes that said they were organic

196
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,200
and then I realized I have to use them

197
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,079
more than the conventional product so I

198
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:30,760
thought maybe I would use those less but

199
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:34,000
now I find myself using more of those

200
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,720
products than the other

201
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,160
ones yeah I just wanted to uh you know

202
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,000
raise as well and question um you know

203
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,880
the the fact when we're talking about

204
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,560
obviously different organic produce and

205
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:48,120
even as you were saying lot L lot small

206
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,720
scale examples of of like you know

207
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,440
farming you know in a small scale within

208
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,800
a local community but I suppose another

209
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,000
factor is as you was kind of alluding to

210
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,920
the the quality of produce is things

211
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,200
like efficiency and on that commercial

212
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,680
level the efficiency of produce and

213
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,160
meeting meeting demand from the public

214
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,079
and you know having enough of um you

215
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:13,040
know having enough resources uh you know

216
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:16,600
products to to to feed a population Etc

217
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,480
and how that kind of intersects with the

218
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:21,160
you know sustainability requirements on

219
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,279
that kind of mass scale obviously people

220
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,959
can talk about organic F but on that

221
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,360
sort of mass scale I think that must be

222
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,000
one of the biggest challenges in terms

223
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,800
of supplying uh demand within you know

224
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,639
populations broadly and how what the the

225
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,760
sustainability approaches are there so

226
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:42,079
I'm wondering if that's something that

227
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:45,519
could be uh noted as as needing more of

228
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:48,040
a a revision um and you know more of a

229
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,639
comprehensive one as opposed to what is

230
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,959
often cited as as I I've noticed where

231
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:55,680
people do talk about uh they they might

232
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,040
ignore the need for um let's say

233
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,000
approaches to preventing

234
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,600
deforestation you know

235
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,440
talk about say animal agriculture for

236
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,120
example and the huge impact that that

237
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,720
has on deforestation or water use Etc

238
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,440
but people then point to small scale

239
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,120
examples to kind of say yeah but this

240
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,600
can be done in a way which is yeah more

241
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,399
sustainable but obviously there are huge

242
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,200
challenges given the the fact that uh in

243
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:26,040
order for

244
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:28,040
most uh supply for most people uh there

245
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,800
is that well let's say that large scale

246
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,040
commercial need you know of of

247
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,839
agricultural uh for agriculture so I'm

248
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,040
just wondering what the how how we could

249
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:42,160
address those challenges and and how you

250
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,519
would see that lot Lo the distinction

251
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,399
between or or where in the African in

252
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,639
the South African context how you would

253
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,600
see local or

254
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:55,200
community-based

255
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:57,279
produce is that possible to supply

256
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,920
populations broadly or is the commercial

257
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,279
side needed and therefore needing to be

258
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,600
revised in how it's done so it's done

259
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:08,639
sustainably I think because now there's

260
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,560
more people especially let me speak

261
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:15,120
about South Africa because more people

262
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:19,040
are now um in the city we do need more

263
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:23,519
conventional agriculture to supply uh

264
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:27,399
food but if people really stayed in

265
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:31,279
their Villages and not move more to the

266
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:34,760
city and I I think because what happens

267
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:37,760
in rural areas and Villages people

268
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:42,320
plant crops and they have

269
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:44,440
animals and they would either sell those

270
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,880
crops to the community so you find that

271
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:51,079
you are think the community

272
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:54,880
so now the the farmers the commercial

273
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:57,360
Farmers don't have too much pressure on

274
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,360
feeding the whole population because now

275
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,279
people are also moving away from the

276
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,279
villages to the

277
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:09,120
city there's a demand now to feed these

278
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:12,399
people who are in the city who are not

279
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,959
planting crops in their gard and all

280
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:19,519
that so that's why I think the the

281
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:23,079
conventional farming has become

282
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:27,519
prominent that way

283
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:29,399
so there are still uh small farmers like

284
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,839
for instance for me I always always

285
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:36,720
tried for Farmers that I can go to to

286
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:39,079
buy the food directly from themb and now

287
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:44,079
in find the challenge now with them I

288
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:47,240
think they also saw okay people now want

289
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,639
naturally grown food and they don't want

290
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,759
food that are

291
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:55,399
produced conventional way you find that

292
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:57,480
now the prices are now so high and then

293
00:13:55,399 --> 00:14:00,399
you realize when you compare them with

294
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:04,680
the the prices at the Supermarket you

295
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:10,160
realize wow I'm paying twice as much to

296
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:14,880
get this Natural Glow chicken or

297
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:19,440
sheep and that also discourages one to

298
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,759
actually um support those small farmers

299
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:24,519
who are producing sustainably grown

300
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,480
chickens and other

301
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,920
livestock yeah I'm just wondering yeah

302
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,040
in turn the the you know the I suppose

303
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,000
the reality faced with the world at the

304
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,440
moment is the factor of you know our

305
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,199
population growth and huge we've got

306
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,279
what over 8 billion people on the planet

307
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,800
now and suppose that comes into it as

308
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,480
well that like historically you know

309
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,519
thousands of years you know we've been

310
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,839
able to live within sustainable

311
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,360
parameters obviously but uh with that

312
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,199
population growth and supply of food

313
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:55,839
products to to the population there's

314
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:57,759
obviously has to be some attempt that uh

315
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,440
because of the huge scale of Agriculture

316
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:02,839
required there has to have that revised

317
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,160
approach and I think obviously yeah so I

318
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,680
suppose um population is probably a big

319
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,360
part of it as you said so many people

320
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,759
are living in cities but that too is um

321
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,560
you know just our human existence is

322
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:20,079
generally has a big encroaching impact

323
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,560
on the on the natural world yes yeah on

324
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,000
the demand side I think that's one of

325
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:27,040
the biggest challenges is having a

326
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,079
market that's accepting organic uh you

327
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,440
know food and also just given standard

328
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:34,920
of living uh and just struggles with

329
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,360
bunch of crisises we've had in the past

330
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,120
I would say three to four years there is

331
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,800
a you know costs attached to it but

332
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:44,519
there are other challenges as well that

333
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,759
we spoke about for Farmers U are there

334
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,399
any solutions uh maybe technological

335
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:52,440
solutions that are actually helping

336
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:54,680
organic and sustainable practices going

337
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,480
forward are there in examples that you

338
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:00,120
want to share with us for actually for

339
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:04,199
commercial even for for sustainable

340
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:07,519
Farmers um I think now the usest

341
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:10,519
technologies that farmers are using now

342
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:14,000
is uh Precision

343
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:18,399
agriculture where farmers are now using

344
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,959
um drones and sensory devices to

345
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:28,360
actually detect pirs checking whether

346
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:32,720
the crops uh the field it has water or

347
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:36,360
it's dry so it helps them um

348
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,680
improve their farming practices so those

349
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,920
that that is one of the technologies

350
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,680
that I'm

351
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,680
seeing

352
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:49,959
happening as well as also artificial

353
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:52,279
intelligence is is really gaining uh a

354
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:55,720
lot of momentum in the agricultural

355
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:58,680
sector farmers are using it to get early

356
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,759
warnings of severe weather conditions

357
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,240
like like these days we are having heat

358
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:07,760
waves and um most farmers are

359
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:11,280
complaining that crops are drying out so

360
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:15,839
uh artificial intelligence can help

361
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:18,679
farmers with um detecting severe weather

362
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:22,439
conditions like droughts and floods

363
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:27,039
which normally are some of the factors

364
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:29,880
that uh influence Farmers production and

365
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,320
artificial intelligence they can also

366
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:37,080
determine the moisture content in the

367
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:41,280
soil of the crops that they have planted

368
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:44,640
uh whether there is enough water or less

369
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:47,440
water so it improves the improves the

370
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,160
farmer's irrigation system so the farmer

371
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,280
will end up implementing smart

372
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,880
irrigation systems that will let him

373
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,720
know when to

374
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,880
irrigate and when not to irrigate so in

375
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,720
that way they are conserving water so

376
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,480
use water based on what the crop

377
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:10,080
requires so those are some of the

378
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,840
technologies that are actually improving

379
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,600
the agriculture

380
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,760
sector yeah I think I think that's great

381
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:20,360
that but there are ways technology can

382
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,280
help especially today with digital

383
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:26,000
technology moving at the pace that it is

384
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,400
um and are there any actual practices

385
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,039
that the farmers do which which have

386
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,720
changed

387
00:18:30,039 --> 00:18:34,520
from a day-to-day perspective in the

388
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,840
pursuit of being more sustainable on one

389
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,159
hand like you said it's the use of

390
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,640
technology to get certain data U or

391
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:45,679
watering systems but what have they

392
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:48,720
probably changed in how they do farming

393
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:52,120
yes there are other farming

394
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:55,400
practices that uh promote sustainable

395
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:56,679
agricultures which uh requires Farmers

396
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:02,440
to

397
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:07,200
use less uh machinary less energy and

398
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:12,240
these are for example no till practices

399
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:15,600
no tillage so Farm you find that uh in

400
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:20,080
conventional farming a farmer would use

401
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:23,200
fossil fuel powered um vehicles to

402
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,880
actually prepare their soil for plant

403
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:30,240
but no tillage you don't have to use um

404
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:34,240
fossil fuel consumption Machinery you

405
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:37,880
just plant uh the the crops directly on

406
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:41,840
the soil without having to alter or

407
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:44,880
disturb the soil so no tillage is

408
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,679
actually one of uh the sustainable

409
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,559
methods that some farmers are using to

410
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:55,520
eliminate um energy

411
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:59,679
use and there's also crop

412
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:05,480
rotation Farmers they basically PL

413
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:09,640
crops uh not at the same area or piece

414
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:12,480
of land consecutively every year so find

415
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:16,280
that where you have where the land where

416
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:21,799
you initially planted uh spinach for

417
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:26,600
example we now change plant like pnut

418
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:31,520
watermelon so it also helps retain the

419
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:33,440
um soil health and not really affect the

420
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,840
composition and the structure of the

421
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:40,880
soil maybe while while you're at talking

422
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:44,039
about practices um we can um mention how

423
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,120
does having local products or Market

424
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:50,159
have any impact definitely yes local

425
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,799
products are actually good because you

426
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:57,600
find that it takes a shorter time

427
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:59,840
for to deliver these foods to the stores

428
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,200
to the retail that so it takes quite a

429
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:07,919
shorter time and the food are fresher

430
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:11,480
and it becomes less expensive local

431
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:15,200
agriculture supporting it's actually uh

432
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,240
very sustainable and in some cases if

433
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,760
you buy directly to the farmer you

434
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:22,640
actually eliminate having to the farmer

435
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:28,159
having to Now

436
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:32,120
package um his uh her product so I think

437
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:35,840
even my my dad CU he

438
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:39,960
also supplies to one of the local Stones

439
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:44,600
egg home they don't use packaging like

440
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,880
you see in big retail stores just just

441
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:51,799
you know fasten it with a rubber band

442
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:55,720
and it's done it just saves a lot

443
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:59,080
on packaging material yeah that's

444
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,640
predominantly plastic in most places

445
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,520
it's it's quite insane for example when

446
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:07,120
you see a banana wrapped in a plastic

447
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,919
which makes absolutely no sense uh no

448
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:12,159
matter where I think it comes from and I

449
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,840
think one of the other impacts I think

450
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,960
we see that in terms of local products

451
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:23,919
um correct me if I'm wrong are specific

452
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:26,919
crops or you know way of farming that uh

453
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:30,279
promotes uh more sustainable agriculture

454
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:34,480
yeah it's really uh dependent on whether

455
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:39,480
the crop can sustain the type of weather

456
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:42,360
conditions so farmers normally uh they

457
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:47,400
look at weather patterns and when they

458
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:51,559
plan for farming in the next year they

459
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:54,799
okay this year I might not I don't think

460
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:57,200
I should plan or some in some cases they

461
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,159
don't know what the weather is going to

462
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,240
be like so but

463
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:05,000
some of them have knowledge about how to

464
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:09,000
mitigate on these severe weather

465
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,000
conditions so crops like Maz where I

466
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,600
come from in the Free State they

467
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,919
can uh tolerate uh drought they can

468
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:22,320
tolerate heat heat waves is a big thing

469
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:25,760
in South Africa these days and

470
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:29,559
sunflow it's also one of the crops that

471
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:32,400
um can collect great drought and heat

472
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:36,720
and there's other crops in other parts

473
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:41,240
of the world like wheat I think even

474
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:47,440
wheat and beans they do well in those

475
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:52,320
conditions so and um yes and uh like I

476
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:55,520
said earlier farming systems like crop

477
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:59,880
rotation helps because if you are

478
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:03,880
planting the same crop every year

479
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:06,360
it but you might find that uh it's not

480
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,919
going to survive in this year's weather

481
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:12,279
condition so when you rotate your crops

482
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:16,159
and not plant the same thing the crop

483
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:19,320
might do well and farmers can also try

484
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:23,039
to farm other crops that they haven't

485
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:26,919
farmed before CU you don't know how they

486
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:29,640
do in the type of soil your your farm is

487
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:34,240
or the type of weather

488
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:36,200
that uh will be there yes yeah I just

489
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,000
wanted to briefly add to that and I just

490
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,200
wanted to yeah briefly add I'm not

491
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,360
certainly not an expert in agricultural

492
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,640
sustainability but yeah one one

493
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:47,200
interesting Innovation I'm aware of as

494
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,640
llo was mentioning about new crops was

495
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,679
uh or new you know approaches was the um

496
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,159
phenomena recent phenomena of seaweed

497
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:57,240
farming and just seeing how that has an

498
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:58,840
extraordinary uh potential at least

499
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,960
because there isn't that requ for

500
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,880
fertilizer or water use you know for it

501
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,200
to grow and it does have many uses

502
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:09,000
including to supplement plastic you know

503
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,799
bags you know it can be a plastic use as

504
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,480
well as food food source uh for for

505
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:17,640
different additives as well as protein

506
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:20,120
but also um it is a huge um carbon you

507
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,039
know source of carbon sequestration so

508
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:24,919
it's really it's good for climate the

509
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:27,320
climate and mitigating climate change as

510
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:29,080
well so that's probably another just a

511
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,440
little interesting point point I thought

512
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:34,000
to to mention that um going forward you

513
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,080
wonder to what extent that will be uh

514
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,320
embraced given that it has a completely

515
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:43,440
different uh sort of output and um way

516
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,919
of being produced than most traditional

517
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:50,720
agriculture obviously on land

518
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:52,480
anyway yeah yeah and I think yeah Beyond

519
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,360
land agriculture there's also other

520
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,440
other things that we could probably grow

521
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:01,080
what is needed uh to promote sustainable

522
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,760
agriculture for me what I think uh

523
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:08,399
consumers can do really to contribute to

524
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:13,559
sustainable agriculture firstly they

525
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:17,039
should um focus on eating what is in

526
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:21,120
season buying what is in season that way

527
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:23,760
we do not put too much pressure on the

528
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,919
resources in fact we do not put too much

529
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,200
pressure on Farmers to

530
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:33,960
produce uh crops that are not

531
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:36,000
season and that also helps the farmer to

532
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,960
not put too much pressures on the

533
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,240
resources because now they have to

534
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,360
produce crops that are not in season

535
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:47,799
because people now want if people can

536
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:50,919
just eat what is in season and rotate

537
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:53,200
crops like that I think it will

538
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:56,399
contribute to sustainable agriculture

539
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,159
and won't have to put too much pressure

540
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:02,520
on our resources yeah and I'll probably

541
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:04,600
just yeah mention um obviously being

542
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,600
just being the consumer to be aware of

543
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:10,039
of you know the the impact that um some

544
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,120
some agriculture can have on the

545
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:15,960
ecosystem broadly and um yeah to try and

546
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,679
choose sustainably obviously plant-based

547
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,880
approach is is helpful but yeah to

548
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,919
choose sustainably broadly just to be

549
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,880
aware of things like water use as well

550
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,000
yeah and as well as particular

551
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,399
particular businesses which might not be

552
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,880
sustainable um in the in their

553
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:33,880
operations as well yeah and I think just

554
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,159
education broadly is not just for

555
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,320
Farmers it's also for for consumers a

556
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,559
lot of times like was saying um and I

557
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:43,840
think we could also probably focus on

558
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:46,559
the fact that there needs to be probably

559
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,679
policies and just general promotion uh

560
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,320
something

561
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,360
that people from all walks of life can

562
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:55,120
kind of come together and try and uh

563
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,399
make a push in their local governments

564
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,640
and their local uh agencies as well to

565
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:03,159
ensure that there is some kind of policy

566
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,679
and incentives that might help farmers

567
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:08,760
really um focus and sustainable farming

568
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:11,840
without losing you know their source of

569
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,159
Revenue yes most defitely yeah and I

570
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,240
think it's also important I remember a

571
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,000
study particularly showing how

572
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,840
incentivizing uh farmers and and having

573
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,080
proper yeah policy guidance by

574
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,799
governments for for uh you know moving

575
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,720
towards more sustainable farming and

576
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:30,000
particularly where it's particularly uh

577
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,279
the current practices might be

578
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,519
particularly bad but there does need to

579
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:38,799
be leadership from governments and less

580
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:41,519
um sort of governments adhering to

581
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,519
short-term economic profits or you know

582
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:46,480
GDP short-term benefits and looking more

583
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:49,279
so the future of sustainability and and

584
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,919
guiding both farmers and and consumers

585
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,760
alike in that way and and the people uh

586
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,200
people within the community the

587
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,480
consumers putting pressure on

588
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,120
governments uh to do so and to look at

589
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,799
what is sustainable farming and what

590
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,360
isn't and to put pressure on governments

591
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:06,840
to lead in that way to to make it E

592
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:09,159
