00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,199
hello everyone welcome back to the

2
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,040
cottage today we are working on storm

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,160
prep we've got some tornadic weather

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,440
coming through tomorrow so we want to

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,000
get everything secured

6
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,679
and we thought we'd bring you along okay

7
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,719
so our first step is we're going to lay

8
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,320
down all of our

9
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,480
top heavy arbors that aren't really

10
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,920
secure we're going to secure our high

11
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,800
tunnel actually i'm just going to take

12
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,480
it down

13
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,400
it's pretty much apart because of the

14
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,320
wind that's already kicked in

15
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,840
and we've got row covers to pick up

16
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,439
and put away and we're going to just

17
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,840
make sure anything that can fly

18
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,200
is buttoned down or laying flat so it's

19
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,200
a little bit harder to pick up the wind

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,920
okay our row covers are tucked away our

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,120
barn is going to be sound

22
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,160
um just in case we need to put people in

23
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,960
and usually our storms roll through at

24
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,840
night

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,520
oh goody so our animals will be tucked

26
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,280
away during the nighttime hours

27
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,559
because we also live next to a huge game

28
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,719
preserve

29
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,160
so it's just not safe that we feel to

30
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,280
leave our animals out so we'll have

31
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,600
everyone tucked in

32
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,640
our goats will be in here along with our

33
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,560
ducks um

34
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,119
and we're gonna work on picking violets

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,560
before this batch fade away and then

36
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,040
we're gonna work on getting the rest of

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:27,840
our tarps that we've been using

38
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:27,840
stowed away in the garage

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,000
all right we've pulled down the

40
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,200
makeshift greenhouse because if it can

41
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,720
catch the land it's going to come up

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,600
like a parachute and i'll take the armor

43
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,799
with it

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,240
so we're just going to hold this up and

45
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,880
pack it in the garage so it doesn't end

46
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,560
up counting over um we get really bad

47
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,280
straight line wins so anything that can

48
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,720
catch

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,399
anything more than that really can catch

50
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,640
the wind and it's going to be blown over

51
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,960
or broken in the process so

52
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,040
just keeping everything like an umbrella

53
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,840
that could catch the wind and then pull

54
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,840
needs to come down

55
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,079
we're going to use our contest bags like

56
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,000
a sandbag on the low side of our garden

57
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:23,680
so any flooding will be diverted around

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:25,360
it and not destroyed

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,120
again we're going to lay down our arbors

60
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:37,840
because they don't break these aren't

61
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:37,840
secured to the ground

62
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:51,840
or blown across the yard

63
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,360
oh god we just come to you right now and

64
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,480
we ask you for protection

65
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:15,599
we ask you to protect these fruit trees

66
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:18,080
protect our home protect our animals

67
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,480
each and every one of the trees that we

68
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,120
rely on for food

69
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,159
for blessing of others we just ask you

70
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,560
to protect them in this coming storm

71
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,879
let no weapon formed against us prosper

72
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,879
lord

73
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:39,440
keep this weather calm and the wind low

74
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,440
not just a gentle rainfall

75
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,720
nothing harm us or damage us or our

76
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,879
neighbors

77
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,239
let our harvest be good and plentiful

78
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,280
this year

79
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,080
so that we may not only eat of the

80
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,319
harvest

81
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,400
but give freely to others

82
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,439
to be able to trade with others that

83
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,959
have

84
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,840
other things that we need protect our

85
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,840
animals father

86
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,840
this weather's pretty scary we just need

87
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,080
your hand to protect us and cover us

88
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,880
lord

89
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,880
tuck us under your wings in jesus name

90
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,880
amen
