  "text": "hi I'm here at mosy and the sunflowers are growing and maturing and we've got one uh that hasn't actually uh completely matured but it's enough that we can show you the counting that we want you to do when your sunflowers are ready um don't do this when they're still looking like this and they still got the yellow petals and in particular you can't see the SE pattern very clearly in the middle you want to wait until all these little flet things have fallen off and you can see the black seeds usually black seeds it might be white L of the sunflower underneath right so once you got to that stage um uh for extra bonus points before you get to that stage you can count the petals but that's not the key thing we need once you before you do anything else just measure the height to the middle of the head and I've got 98 CM plus 3 so that's 1 m 2 uh for this sunflower now I've measured the head I'm going to uh take it off I've taken one off I don't know how easy it's going to [Music] be not very easy if the answer scissors is what is what's recommended at this [Music] stage okay that's not going to work we need to [Music] um there we go okay so um as I said I think this seed head actually probably died and the the flower heads fell off before it got maturity the other thing that we'd like you to do you can't do it on this one cuz they've got moldies measure these green brats count the green brats around the back but the key thing is to look at the spiral counts so let's see if we can do that on this sunflower just I'm just brushing off the flower heads so I can see the seeds underneath and now we can see I think we can see just about there's a pattern of seeds here and there's a little spiral of these four seeds all in a line what I'm going to do is just so I can count where I'm up to one two three four so I've taken out that spir now the key thing that we're trying to count we're not trying to just go around the outside and go one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 say how many there are outside cuz that's not very accurate what we want to do is count how many of these spirals there are so I'll start at this one and I'm actually going to call that zero for reason you see in a minute so this is one 2 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 I'll just pull that one out so I can check later on that's that's 0 10 1 2 3 hard to see cuz it's not very mature one four five 6 7 8 9 and I think that's a 10 there I've got a Rimer on the camera who'll tell me if she thinks I've missed any I think that's 10 okay once we once youve taken this another way of a much better way of doing this actually is to take a photo of the seed head and then use your um computer you can do it in uh in PowerPoint to draw lines onto your photo that way if you get it wrong you can try again that's another one so where do we start from 0 10 20 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 [Music] okay and I can see already that we're going to get in quotes the wrong answer right so I started here at zero that's 10 20 30 31 32 oh no that is right 33 34 right so what we've done is we counted all the way around the outside of the um head the number of spirals who started at at zero went up in 10 it's got to 30 and then finished off with 31 32 33 34 before we had number one so this has got 34 spirals around the outside of its sample head which um if you like Fibonacci numbers is good news cuz 34 is a Fibonacci number now the next thing we want you to do is to notice which way that spiral is this as you go out from the center outwards it's curving around in a clockwise Direction so we'll call that a clockwise spiral and then the next thing is to uh look at the spirals in the opposite direction dire so we might need to zoom in again right so we were counting spirals there before but if you just follow my finger there's another line of spirals here so I'll pull out a seed to count that one one two again maybe a good tool would help here there now these are flatter so there should be um less of these I guess around the seed head so let's see if we can count those by hand 0 1 2 this is what if you do end up taking a photo you need to be really careful cuz you see these areas around here where the structure isn't very easy to see and maybe if you rub off some of the extra Gunk it's easier to see the little white dots that really help your eyes see the spirals so that's one two 3 4 five 6 7 eight nine and I think that one is 10 oops extra one there by mistake uh okay so that was uh from our beginning 0 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 do you know I've done this probably 20 times now on sunflowers and I'm always just amazed every time it comes out with Fibonacci numbers it is just fantastic so uh the good news is that the uh science museum is capable of growing sunflowers which obey the Fibonacci rules the big question is out of all of these sunflowers how many of the time how much of the time are we going to find that that's true when it isn't true what are the patterns going to look like um so good luck with the counting",
