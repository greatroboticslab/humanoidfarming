  "text": "drone AG was founded in 2015 by farming brothers Jack and he ran using their own Farmers of research and development base they've supplied Agri specific drone packages and first of their kind specialist training courses to the agricultural industry now based on the experience and insight gained over the previous years the brothers are moving into software with a clear mission to make farming more productive through practical hassle-free drone automation and AI technology there is a growing need to produce more food with less resources as farmers we need to increase yield and we need to do it while using less chemicals and be more efficient overall in order to remain sustainable and profitable as a business a drone AG we have used many different types of software systems to control drones and process the data learning what is useful in the farming setting and what isn't we've been very much focused on how we can help farmers use drone technology through that knowledge by our training courses and hardware know-how and we've also been looking at how we can build practical hassle-free drone technology ourselves the industry is at the start of the next major agricultural revolution drones will form a large part of this revolution with drones and agriculture growing to four billion US dollars by 2020 for building on our years of experience we knew we needed a system that saves us time provides us data we can readily use we also wanted to lower the barriers of entry both in terms of cost and complexity so over the last year we've been using drone technology in a completely new way and we've begun building our own software system based on those principles our Skippy Scout app is simple to use taking affordable off-the-shelf drones like this and automating them in the way never done before Skippy flies the drone around the field and at multiple points it descents to only a few meters above the crop and takes a photo these images are collected from across the field much faster than possible on foot and in a much more detailed way possible with mapping or satellite technology and they can be viewed in near-real-time once images have been collected users will be able to view them in location I mean right into leak level and Rai can already identify crop cover verses we cover and even nutrient deficient leaves we plan to offer the software as a subscription-based service with two primary tiers one aimed at farmers and the other agronomists the price point will be a lot lower than current software offerings as a farmer having this information straight away means I can confidently assess pest weed and disease levels in the field and I can make informed decisions to deal with them quickly and accurately which hopefully means less crop damage and better yields the accuracy and detail in the data also means that can specifically target the worst areas of the crop which helps save on pesticides and labor thanks to our expert developer with both experience in drone control systems and app development we have an early version of skippy Skerritt up and running now and the next stage is to implement the full user interface and integrate green area index measurements and we detection we plan to bring in further expertise to allow us to develop our AI and recognize different types of disease weeds and crop growth stage people have been using drones in different scenarios with little effect on a big scale the technologies been there to be able to map fields and look at images but there's not been a simple way of putting it all together and basically aiding people's jobs in terms of the agronomist to actually do their job quicker I think in the past the software has been cumbersome and slow and in the end you've stopped using it because you haven't had the time to do it whereas this Kippy Scout will mean that you'll be quite easily get out of the card set the drone away and get the data quickly new technology can provide solutions to the challenges ahead but for farmers to adopt those solutions now they need to be simple and practical Skippy Scout optimizes crop management in real time at leaf level all with just a phone in a drone and we plan to take this a lot further over the coming years using automated drone systems and AI to optimize the whole crop management cycle from scouting and mapping through to intelligent control of both manned and automated farm machinery on the ground and even drone sprayers in the air growing to over 30,000 users worldwide by 2025 we can help farming to become more profitable and sustainable while benefiting the environment as a whole you",
