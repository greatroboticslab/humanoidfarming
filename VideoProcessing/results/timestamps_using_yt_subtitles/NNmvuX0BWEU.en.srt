1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
other than the 40 minutes so I'm Grand

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,740
butcher I'm cheering the session just on

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,690
the on on the loose in I have a

4
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:11,429
timekeeper here somewhere I think well

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,460
there you go Charlie good um can we have

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:18,690
the nord at ten to two your big stink

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,609
you do what you have to do but probably

8
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,250
everyone here knows Dirac anyway he's

9
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:25,859
extremely well known scientist based up

10
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,420
at Lincoln been there since 1996 and

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,910
he's the go-to man when it comes to

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,070
loosen and sub clover will touch on

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:38,300
subcriber but mostly talking about loose

14
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,300
in who hasn't heard Derek speak before

15
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,559
so anyway we'll get straight into it

16
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,160
we're going to have a 10-minute session

17
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,570
at the end but are you happy to take

18
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,629
clarifications all the way through we

19
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,920
have there's this little innovation here

20
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:57,239
if you've got a question put your hand

21
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,710
up or throw this at you you have to

22
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:05,760
catch it all right I won't throw it fast

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:08,869
we'll have so I'll hand it over to Derek

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,869
[Music]

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,020
thank you very much and thank you for

26
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,640
coming what I thought I'd do today is

27
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,810
actually I'm going to talk about loosing

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,580
but really what I'm going to talk about

29
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,920
is how I got on to loosen and what the

30
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,840
principles of it are and trying I know

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,400
that the audience here is not a true

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,049
Lucerne audience some of you are not

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,090
actually in areas that would be

34
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,869
conducive to Lucerne but the principles

35
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:35,909
that we talk about hopefully are

36
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:43,320
appropriate for all the farming systems

37
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:45,299
that we work with what I'm going to do

38
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,640
is give you some information so when I

39
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,670
operate what I'm doing are called on

40
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,950
station experiments so my postgraduate

41
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,890
students they do good research that has

42
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,840
great data integrity and farmers

43
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,000
consider their of low currency and

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,340
relevance so generally the results that

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,860
come out of a field experiment done at

46
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,119
Lincoln or done at Massey farmers are

47
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,550
all that's interesting but it didn't

48
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,129
happen on my farm it's that's the

49
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,090
tendency for that sort of thing so what

50
00:02:11,129 --> 00:02:13,120
we're trying to do is well I actually

51
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,159
have to do

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,709
it and the students have to do that

53
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:19,629
because we want good quality data but

54
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:22,000
when it becomes more relevant is when we

55
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:25,330
get down here and we have some case

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,940
studies so case studies are often for

57
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:31,599
farmers what happened in the region or a

58
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:34,269
farmer - becomes of high relevance so

59
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,220
high currency and relevance here but for

60
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:39,340
me trying to publish in journals it's

61
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,260
got low data integrity so I can actually

62
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,090
talk to other scientists with those case

63
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,069
studies because they're not considered

64
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,599
to have really good controls so what

65
00:02:45,069 --> 00:02:49,420
we're doing is scientist is trying to

66
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:52,599
operate from up here way down to here to

67
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:55,060
get things to happen no personal opinion

68
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:57,099
here has low currency relevance and low

69
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,720
data integrity so you may think you know

70
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:01,090
everything but actually unless it's got

71
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:04,359
some science behind it it probably isn't

72
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:07,090
that good and I'm not sure where we put

73
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:09,280
Donald Trump on that particular diagram

74
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,440
myths and legends maybe over here I

75
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,700
don't know and as I mind so what I'm

76
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,040
going to try and do is give you a little

77
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,410
bit of data to say look this is this is

78
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,569
what I base things on but then try and

79
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,040
give you a few case studies of people

80
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:22,359
that have implemented some of the things

81
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,690
we've talked about in some of the

82
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:28,000
results that they've got from doing so

83
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:30,849
this is me you can spot me here as a

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,919
callow youth look and I did wear shorts

85
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:33,970
and I don't show my students that but

86
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:35,500
that's pretty much how many of my

87
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,060
students look at the moment so I

88
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,410
finished I did some farming at Bell

89
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,430
Pluta for part of my prank

90
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,690
and I finished and I went overseas and I

91
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,910
was given a book when I left it was

92
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,620
called the village pub so we visited 87

93
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:51,280
village pubs in England my wife and I it

94
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:53,410
was fantastic got us off the main roads

95
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,340
but what I was doing it was actually

96
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:58,810
working on climate change and that was

97
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,760
2022 many years ago twenty to twenty

98
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:03,099
three years ago and at that time people

99
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,750
were just starting to measure carbon

100
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:06,040
dioxide levels and start to think about

101
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,069
whether climate change was going to

102
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,629
occur and as a young scientist oh well

103
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:12,190
I've not really heard much about this so

104
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:14,109
I did some investigation and thought

105
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,430
yeah actually I think this is real I was

106
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:17,440
working out whether we could grow wheat

107
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,449
and Spain or not anymore what was going

108
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,419
to happen in 25 years so that was what I

109
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:23,470
was you know doing my research on and

110
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:25,270
then I came higher

111
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,590
and I was given a brief one of the nice

112
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,120
things about the university is you given

113
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,090
a brief we don't care what you do

114
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,950
research on just do something very nice

115
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:36,040
brief to be given and that's what it was

116
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:38,890
and I said well if I put climate change

117
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,410
with farming actually in New Zealand the

118
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,490
predicted biggest impact is on the east

119
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,050
coast of New Zealand

120
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,600
it's from Central Otago through the

121
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:48,840
Hawke's Bay that's where climate change

122
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,580
is supposed to have the biggest impact

123
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,960
and more importantly actually they're

124
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,580
already coping with the greatest

125
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,440
variability of climate of anywhere in

126
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:59,980
New Zealand any way they cope with years

127
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,140
of rainfall no rainfall cold with the

128
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,970
whole lot so I didn't really talk about

129
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:05,830
climate change for twenty years and some

130
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,910
people I don't still don't talk about it

131
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,600
with them but I talk about trying to

132
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:12,010
cope with the variability that occurs

133
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,930
from farming on the east coast of New

134
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,760
Zealand and so that's what I did I said

135
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,410
well let's work on that the other thing

136
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,820
was there was no one really working on

137
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,560
anything but rye grass and white clover

138
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:22,230
when I came out 25 years ago so I

139
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,940
thought well I'll do something different

140
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,730
everything we do is actually on our dry

141
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,830
land website so if you're looking for

142
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,630
information from my research team that's

143
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,610
basically at Lincoln University slash

144
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,930
dryland and I'll put this presentation

145
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,430
there as well and it'll just have

146
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,140
today's date and go on it so you'd be

147
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:41,020
able to have a look at that if you want

148
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,330
to as well the first experiment I ever

149
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,340
did those of you that heard me speak

150
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:48,160
before will recognize this it was very

151
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:50,229
simple we've got a cocksfoot pasture and

152
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,030
we said well what actually makes plants

153
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:54,610
grow here's our normal cocksfoot

154
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,890
let's said all the water we can to it so

155
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,640
we've just bought $10,000 with a center

156
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:00,669
pivot irrigation

157
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:03,130
or let's add all the nitrogen we can to

158
00:06:00,669 --> 00:06:05,770
it here all it said irrigation and

159
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:09,310
nitrogen here and so that's what we did

160
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:11,140
and we looked there was a nine year old

161
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,490
one a cocksfoot scheme so it doesn't

162
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,500
have a lot of leg in a minute and it was

163
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,910
pretty grass dominant but the results

164
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,290
actually have transferred when we've

165
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:19,000
gone and worked on Grimes and rye

166
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:20,979
grasses and tall fescue the same thing

167
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,720
happen that's pretty much what the

168
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:24,760
average growth rate for the dryland

169
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,190
pasture was was about six and a half

170
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,169
tons of dry matter that we got when we

171
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,800
just added water we took that to ten

172
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:31,780
tons

173
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,000
now if you've just spent a lot of money

174
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,250
converting to a dairy farm that's not a

175
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,889
great change in the amount of yield that

176
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,830
you get

177
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:41,990
what interested me was that one when we

178
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:44,210
gave those pastures all the nitrogen

179
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:48,020
they needed we went from six and a half

180
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:49,909
tons to sixteen tons so that highlighted

181
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:55,189
how nitrogen deficient those pastures

182
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:56,990
were the consequence of of that line is

183
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:58,430
that farmers recognized that water

184
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,900
wasn't their main limitation in

185
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:01,159
Canterbury now remember this is

186
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,229
Canterbury 20 years ago

187
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:04,819
all those dryland farmers being

188
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:07,069
converted into center permit irrigate is

189
00:07:04,819 --> 00:07:07,490
actually the main limitation wasn't

190
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:10,219
water

191
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:11,990
it was nitrogen and so to produce 22

192
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:13,879
tons of dry matter that's what they

193
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,979
actually do is they add nitrogen and

194
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:19,909
water to get 22 tons of dry matter

195
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:22,069
that's pretty much what's happened if we

196
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:25,490
if we look at this graph and you look at

197
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:28,039
the blue line at the top this line here

198
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,990
has all the water it wanted and all the

199
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:31,400
nitrogen it wanted so the only thing

200
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:33,500
that's causing it to go up and down is

201
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,919
temperature and if I account for

202
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,120
temperature I can do that I simply

203
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,039
account for temperature and instead of

204
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,169
saying that today is Thursday I

205
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:45,469
accumulate how much temperature we get

206
00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:47,419
today and if I do that I can get my 22

207
00:07:45,469 --> 00:07:50,210
tonnes of dry matter and say that that

208
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:52,639
pasture grew seven kilograms of dry

209
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:55,219
matter per hectare per temperature unit

210
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,990
that I've accumulated okay so that's the

211
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:59,389
22 tonnes and I've got rid of the wiggly

212
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:01,430
line and this one here is the irrigated

213
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:03,409
one that had no nitrogen so which

214
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:05,479
produced three and a half kilos of dry

215
00:08:03,409 --> 00:08:08,000
matter four that's the nitrogen gap

216
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:10,550
that's what was missing in those

217
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,500
pastures there was the potential yield

218
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:15,050
gap that we have in those dryland

219
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,509
pastures so what's happened to nitrogen

220
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,979
applied in New Zealand well that's

221
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:21,229
what's happened to nitrogen applied in

222
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:23,659
New Zealand because people started doing

223
00:08:21,229 --> 00:08:25,490
this around here and recognised that if

224
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:27,439
I put water on I'm not really getting

225
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,960
much of response so we have increased

226
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:33,380
their nitrogen footprint and nitrogen

227
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,260
use quite dramatically in recent times

228
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:38,930
with their nitrogen production is a very

229
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:42,289
inefficient process so we produce a huge

230
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:44,630
amount of carbon dioxide it's an energy

231
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:47,690
intensive process but I'm not begging

232
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,069
nitrogen because without it we wouldn't

233
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:49,740
have seven and a half billion people on

234
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:51,750
the planet

235
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,360
that's a good thing or a bad thing

236
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,770
doesn't matter until the 1950s there

237
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,839
were about two billion people on the

238
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,120
planet after that with nitrogen

239
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,430
fertilizer it's allowed the population

240
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,440
to increase exponentially prior to that

241
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:07,050
the haber-bosch process which produces

242
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,670
the nitrogen if you looked at farming in

243
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,000
the 1920s it wouldn't have been much

244
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,560
different from the 1820s or the 1720s

245
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,120
it's really the advent of nitrogen that

246
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,149
allowed us to grow wheat crops it

247
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,610
allowed us to industrialize rice

248
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:24,330
production that has allowed the growth

249
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:27,959
of what people now call industrial

250
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:30,149
agriculture so that's what happens and

251
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:34,020
that's the urea use in Canterbury since

252
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:36,600
about 2002 it's gone up on average eight

253
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:41,190
and a half thousand tons per year every

254
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,080
year okay now you can shake your head

255
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:44,670
when you look at that but if you look at

256
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,410
the previous graph you can understand

257
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,110
why that's happened because they put

258
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,520
water on and nothing grew because

259
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,140
actually what was limiting their

260
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,149
production and what limits their

261
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,540
production all the time and what limits

262
00:09:54,149 --> 00:10:01,260
every plant's production is nitrogen I

263
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:03,839
haven't got a nitrogen I don't grow so

264
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,270
what we now have is the difficulty of

265
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,950
we've still got yellow nitrogen

266
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:10,170
deficient pastures all over Canterbury

267
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,730
and thousand kilos are being deposited

268
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,709
from a urine patch causing us

269
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:15,649
environmental problems so there's a real

270
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:18,000
dilemma on how we deal with this issue

271
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:19,500
but actually we've still got in

272
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,209
deficient pastures and if you drive

273
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,339
around Southland in the spring and you

274
00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:25,050
see those urine patches that's the yield

275
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:28,200
potential that you must say that's the

276
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:31,020
gap that's accurate one of the other

277
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:33,329
things that happens is we add nitrogen

278
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,700
fertilizer is we stop nitrogen fixation

279
00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:37,649
so this is loosen and white clover and

280
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,870
what happened to them as we increase

281
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:42,209
nitrogen fertilizer application this is

282
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,250
the percentage of their nitrogen that

283
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:46,800
they derived free from the atmosphere

284
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:48,450
how much did they fix with nitrogen

285
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,820
fixation so all of it when they've got

286
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:54,089
no fertilizer and then it decreases down

287
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:56,190
as we increase the fertilizer rate so if

288
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:58,230
we put a lot of nitrogen on we suppress

289
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:59,670
the nitrogen fixation we also give the

290
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,530
advantage to the grass and we end up

291
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:04,660
with very grass dominant pasture

292
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:06,280
natural state of affairs and now the

293
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:09,340
dairy industry and Canada a lot of the

294
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:12,370
time it is when the cows leave the

295
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,990
paddock they call the arere truck in and

296
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:15,310
and I don't have an issue with that

297
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:18,310
because that's actually makes sense

298
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:21,640
biologically but what I was trying to

299
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:23,800
get at was this one do I really want to

300
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,530
be doing that or can I get the dryland

301
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,510
farmers to get somewhere between the six

302
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:30,070
and a half they've got now in the

303
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:33,220
sixteen that's possible by having

304
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:36,130
nitrogen on the system and the way to do

305
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:39,520
that if we look at sorry if we look at

306
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:41,260
that from a summer perspective I'll just

307
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,420
go back to that Griffith year you can

308
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,910
see in both of these cases we've got a

309
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:51,190
dry period through the summer if I count

310
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:52,960
for that summer while looking at the

311
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,670
moisture response what you find is

312
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,190
here's my seven kilos of dry matter

313
00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:00,130
three cubed greasy day at my 22 tons of

314
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:03,040
dry matter in the spring if I've got

315
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:06,070
water and I have nitrogen in the system

316
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,800
that pasture that grew 15 tons of dry

317
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:10,270
matter is growing as fast as the one

318
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,130
because it's exactly the same it's got a

319
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:14,020
nitrogen and it's got water and then it

320
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,420
runs out of water now plants are not

321
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,100
that clever but if ever you've spoken to

322
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,190
them recently but they don't really talk

323
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:22,060
back that well they don't know they're

324
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,370
running out of water

325
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,410
so what they do is grow as fast as they

326
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,610
possibly can and then bang they run out

327
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:29,740
of water and that's why you've got a

328
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:32,890
flat line there so we ran out of water

329
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:35,110
and then the slope of verse is pretty

330
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:37,900
much the same of this life of this so

331
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:39,910
here's I can't do much about it but

332
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:42,070
there's huge potential for me to grow

333
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:44,290
feed and spring when I've got water and

334
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,980
in autumn when I've got water if I have

335
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:50,260
nitrogen in the system because nitrogen

336
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,600
is used at the same right water is used

337
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:55,450
at the same rate whether the pasture has

338
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,860
nitrogen or not so this shows you what a

339
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:58,420
bucket of water looks like here's my

340
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,820
bucket of water in its full this is

341
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,980
basically your soil profile on your farm

342
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,650
when you've got fuel capacity start

343
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:09,490
sweet and then we use the water as we go

344
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:10,930
through the summer period and then we

345
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,400
get dry and we've got a little bit of

346
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,040
rainfall happening so we come up a bit

347
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,630
but more

348
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,639
I'm full and then at the end of the

349
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,380
season hopefully we've filled the bucket

350
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,889
again it's a dry land

351
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:24,170
rain feed sort of system but both the

352
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:27,079
dry land plus nitrogen in the dry land

353
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,860
without nitrogen pastures used that back

354
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:33,139
in a water at about the same rate

355
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:37,220
because the use of water is driven by

356
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:40,399
physics it's driven by the humidity the

357
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:42,050
wind speed and the temperature and you

358
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,089
know the use of water because you've

359
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,790
heard that today we're going to lose

360
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:49,310
five millimeters vedepo transpiration

361
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:51,050
all that's saying is how much water are

362
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:53,480
we losing from the system we're losing

363
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:55,370
five mils of water and every day we lose

364
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,990
some water not five mils if you've got

365
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:59,329
nitrogen and two mils if you haven't

366
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:01,100
it's five mils that's what the

367
00:13:59,329 --> 00:14:04,540
evapotranspiration is on any given day

368
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:07,009
driven by temperature wind speed and

369
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:10,730
humidity and that's what's going to

370
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:12,709
happen so they're pretty much says I can

371
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:15,199
use lots of water efficiently the same

372
00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:16,759
bucket of water sorry efficiently or not

373
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:21,170
depending on with rahi being in the

374
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:24,139
system so what it means is this patch

375
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:27,010
here in this patch here are using the

376
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:30,680
water at the same rate that clear

377
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:34,910
alright so my philosophy was well if I

378
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:36,170
know that it can I get dryland pastures

379
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,139
to be more efficient than what they

380
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:41,269
currently are because we know we have a

381
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:43,490
limited water supply we know nitrogen

382
00:14:41,269 --> 00:14:45,199
makes plants grow we know we've got a

383
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:48,110
meat animal demand particularly during

384
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,510
lactation and we know that we can grow

385
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,430
more feed in spring if we have some

386
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,500
nitrogen in the system we want to

387
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:56,899
minimize impact on a year in water be

388
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:59,389
productive and profitable and socially

389
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:01,519
acceptable and my answer was well I

390
00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:03,350
think we can do that with legumes and it

391
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,630
wasn't that new because when I was a

392
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,029
student that was what I was taught it's

393
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:10,339
sort of changed a bit but well how do we

394
00:15:08,029 --> 00:15:12,680
make the system actually operate so when

395
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:14,269
I started working there was I'd been

396
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,990
taught about loosen when I was a student

397
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:19,519
at Lincoln by a professor professor

398
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,420
Langer the late Professor Langer who

399
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,459
died last week

400
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,899
but I've been taught about loose and I

401
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:27,220
came back to New Zealand no one was

402
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:31,040
talking about it so can we use

403
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:33,710
soli games fix about 25 to 30 kilos of

404
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,650
nitrogen per ton of Liam that you grow

405
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:39,680
and that doesn't matter if it's beans or

406
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:41,870
it's peas or its course or its white

407
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,620
clover or its loosing or sub clover

408
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:48,320
about 25 30 kilos of nitrogen fixed for

409
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,210
nothing from the atmosphere for every

410
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,260
tonne of legume that you grow that's

411
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:56,330
what you get put into your system okay

412
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:58,820
and we also know that hive eating value

413
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:00,500
pastures look like that the leafy

414
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,320
there's not a lot of deep material

415
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,640
there's a lot of dicot a lot of liam in

416
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,650
there and a little bit of grass so

417
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:09,050
that's what we're looking for and we

418
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:12,170
also know that if we want to grow

419
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:15,320
animals fast and I had to grow them fast

420
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:17,900
300 grams per head per day or more then

421
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:20,450
I have to actually have an MA of 12 and

422
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:22,520
the only pastures that do their a mostly

423
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:25,310
clover pastures good quality loose soon

424
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:29,120
rate pairs ja or bidam that Mother's

425
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:32,180
Milk if I get the national average of

426
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,280
around 150 odd grams per head per day

427
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,110
really what I'm dealing with is average

428
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,690
rye grass growing pasture but he may

429
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:41,750
have a bear team now for my dryland

430
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:44,630
systems I've got a graph later but for a

431
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:50,330
lot of the people I work with they had

432
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:52,820
to get a lamb from birth to slaughter in

433
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:55,160
a hundred days because I've only got

434
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,200
three months of growth September October

435
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:01,400
November or October November December

436
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:03,860
and then it's dry so they either sell

437
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:07,580
stores and get hit by a store market or

438
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:09,590
they've got to grow animals quicker so

439
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,060
if you think about that if I have a five

440
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:15,350
kilo booth weight and I want to get to

441
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:18,230
thirty five kilo live weight to finish

442
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:20,690
I've got to put on 300 grams bahid per

443
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:23,150
day over a hundred days that's just the

444
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:25,550
numbers that's just what it says and to

445
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:29,990
do that I therefore need high-quality

446
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:31,760
pastures and we also know that animals

447
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:35,090
like to eat legumes given a choice

448
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,380
they'll eat 70% liam 30% grass so when

449
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:38,060
we put them on a paddock and there's not

450
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,490
very very much liam that's what they go

451
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:41,380
and eat so we constantly put pressure on

452
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:43,880
the lagoon

453
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,680
but I wanna he'll block constantly it's

454
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,510
the legging that gets eaten so over time

455
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,160
the he'll block starts to deteriorate in

456
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,660
terms of their production because the

457
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,970
thing they'll eat when they target and

458
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,010
particularly use they will target the

459
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:59,840
high protein they'll target that need

460
00:17:55,010 --> 00:18:02,660
you so I asked around white people

461
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,550
weren't using leucine at that time and

462
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:07,250
got a few answers and so what I've got

463
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:08,540
here is a precis of some of the results

464
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,910
of the research that we've done in

465
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:13,520
getting the lucerne system operating now

466
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:15,680
I don't care whether it's a red clover

467
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,560
and plantain or its sub clover it's

468
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:20,990
white clover or what it is that might

469
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,010
work in your farm system the principles

470
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:24,440
are pretty much the same

471
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:27,160
it's a liam that will drive production

472
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,200
it's a league in that the u requires

473
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,490
just pre lambing and.and as their lemon

474
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:33,200
because that's when the greatest demand

475
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:35,510
is coming on and any animal that's

476
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,250
losing weight during that time as an

477
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,710
animal that's harder to put back weight

478
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:40,880
back on your to put more feed back into

479
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:42,560
them before you take them through to

480
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,230
toughing the following year so

481
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:48,550
high-quality feed is very important

482
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:50,870
through their early lactation period

483
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:52,520
from an establishment perspective

484
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,430
loosen'd does based on free draining

485
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,740
soils with same sort of pH and fertility

486
00:18:55,430 --> 00:19:00,680
as rye grass white clover we saw about

487
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,270
ten kilos per hectare and we use peat

488
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:05,510
and occu lated seed particularly if

489
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:07,670
you're putting in lucerne stand into an

490
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,770
area that hasn't had one before then you

491
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:11,780
need the inoculant for a lot of our

492
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:13,370
legumes red clover white clover there's

493
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:15,170
actually the bacteria that will fix

494
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:17,390
nitrogen floating in the atmosphere here

495
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:20,600
now and if you sow them under the ground

496
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:22,490
they'll actually grow pretty well we

497
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:25,820
generally spring so occasionally we

498
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:27,320
autumn so and we generally cultivate all

499
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,810
direct drill now leucine can be

500
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,790
successfully direct drilled if you are

501
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:34,250
direct drilling anything if it's weeds

502
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:36,230
or it's looser whatever it is you should

503
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,840
be thinking about using something like

504
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,550
diammonium phosphate one of the things

505
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:42,710
that direct drilling does is it doesn't

506
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:44,890
mineralize nitrogen to give those plants

507
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,390
a kick off because you're not actually

508
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,860
turning the soil over so a little bit of

509
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,450
phosphorous is very important when

510
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:53,450
you're establishing a suede crop for

511
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:55,370
example particularly if you're direct

512
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:57,560
drilling it it becomes really important

513
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,420
the root system the more important the

514
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,570
phosphorus becomes phosphorus is the

515
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:03,950
energy source for plants because what

516
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,470
we're trying to do with a Lucerne stand

517
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,360
is grow a decent tap root and this one

518
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:10,640
is one and a half meters long after

519
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,040
eight months so you know it's growing

520
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,020
about a centimeter a day that one

521
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,460
actually came out of Pleasant point it

522
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,410
was sent to me by a farmer when they had

523
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,910
a flood there a few years ago and it

524
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,610
washed away a part of his paddock and he

525
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:25,580
sent me sent me through a picture of his

526
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:28,280
plant in Central Otago those you've

527
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:30,080
grown driven through there you'll see

528
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:32,030
there's quite a big change in that so

529
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,370
one of the key things we've done here is

530
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:36,560
autumn spraying really important if

531
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:38,690
you've got a weird autumn and you've got

532
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,310
brown top dominant pastures or you've

533
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:43,460
got California thistles you're trying to

534
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:45,740
kill that's the time to do it the autumn

535
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,920
is the critical time because the plants

536
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:51,590
are taking sugar down from the top to

537
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,090
the roots so that's an author the thing

538
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,160
that really happens every year and

539
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,850
pretty much but even some willow trees

540
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,670
over there

541
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:00,920
that's what deciduous trees do they take

542
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,570
the nitrogen out of the leaves and they

543
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,330
store it in the trunk or they store it

544
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:07,640
in the roots and they store nitrogen

545
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:09,110
because they can't make nitrogen but

546
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,940
it's the nitrogen that makes the leaf

547
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:13,670
green that allows photosynthesis to

548
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:15,260
happen so our deciduous trees actually

549
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:17,960
take that light region out of the leaves

550
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:20,030
the tune lovely yellow and red and all

551
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,230
sorts of colors but it's the nitrogen

552
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:24,560
they're storing and waiting for next

553
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:26,390
year so does the brown top so does the

554
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,460
Californian thistle if you want to

555
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,710
control Kelly thistles top them in the

556
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:33,290
spring we'd wipe them in the autumn with

557
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:36,620
a trans locatable herbicide that's when

558
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:38,540
they'll be taking sugars down so the key

559
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,090
thing here this is low rainfall

560
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,370
obviously is to conserve moisture and

561
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:45,350
killed the root mass seek and spraying

562
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:47,270
in the spring but these are really you

563
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:49,790
know did and this is just to reach

564
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:53,830
drilled so that's an autumn spray that's

565
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:56,570
then been seek and sprayed in the spring

566
00:21:53,830 --> 00:22:00,080
again with some insecticide and then

567
00:21:56,570 --> 00:22:01,760
drilled in the drilling here as the

568
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,550
loosens being direct drilled in here

569
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:07,250
seed plus fertilizer and that fertilizer

570
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:09,149
as the phosphorus phosphorus is what's

571
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,039
keeping you warm

572
00:22:09,149 --> 00:22:13,649
the moment it's the energy source for

573
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,479
all of us and for plants it's the energy

574
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:17,070
source for them to do photosynthesis and

575
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:19,409
it's the energy source for them to do

576
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:21,749
nitrogen fixation so plants actually

577
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:23,489
need phosphorus that's why we do super

578
00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:25,200
phosphate but here we're just talking

579
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:27,119
about banding at below the plant and

580
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,279
giving that plant a good kick off when

581
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,469
it gets going one of the other issues

582
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:34,259
that comes up is people get concerned

583
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:35,279
about carbon soil carbon everyone wants

584
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:39,529
soil carbon

585
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:42,690
I don't want soil carbon okay this is

586
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:44,639
organic Medus this is a fetch sitting on

587
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:48,029
top of soil I don't mind the soil carbon

588
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:51,629
down here but this carbon here actually

589
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:53,219
stops nutrient cycling so one of the

590
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:57,119
problems when you get a thick thatch of

591
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:58,889
brown on top or a buildup of material on

592
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,229
the top of your pasture is it's

593
00:22:58,889 --> 00:23:03,599
difficult to establish in here you've

594
00:23:01,229 --> 00:23:06,359
got to get rid of that I can't put a

595
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:08,070
seed in here and expect it to grow but

596
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:09,659
that's often the thatch we have when

597
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:13,289
we're breaking in new lands so we've got

598
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:15,599
to get rid of that thatch and we might

599
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:17,249
use a rye corn crop or something like

600
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,469
that to be able to do that that's one of

601
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:21,359
the reasons that these cereal crops work

602
00:23:19,469 --> 00:23:23,999
so well when we're breaking in that

603
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:26,369
she'll and is that we put a seed and

604
00:23:23,999 --> 00:23:29,820
what we're doing in that case is we can

605
00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:33,599
put a rye corn seed at depth through

606
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,799
this I can't put a clover seed in here

607
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,139
and I can't put it down here because

608
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,749
it's too deep it won't come up but a big

609
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:42,359
cereal will go in there and it'll then

610
00:23:39,749 --> 00:23:44,489
come up so the cereal crop in that case

611
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:46,769
is being used to break down that organic

612
00:23:44,489 --> 00:23:48,809
matter and often farmers that put in

613
00:23:46,769 --> 00:23:51,299
their rye corn crop or their oak crop or

614
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:54,210
whatever it might be find that the first

615
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:55,409
year crop isn't very good and the reason

616
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,969
that's not very good is because they're

617
00:23:55,409 --> 00:23:59,519
generally putting nitrogen on to grow

618
00:23:56,969 --> 00:24:02,339
this crop but the nitrogen is being used

619
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,979
well by the microbes to break down this

620
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:07,049
cabin because you've got to have

621
00:24:04,979 --> 00:24:09,299
nitrogen in the system to get the

622
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:11,099
breakdown of that carbon so we lose some

623
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:12,929
of that nitrogen but then if we break

624
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:15,779
feed this through the winter we return

625
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:17,219
some urine and then that urine helps and

626
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:20,190
the seeking year crop is generally much

627
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:22,349
better so on a dry situation that's the

628
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,590
way we've predominantly been breaking in

629
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:28,309
it

630
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:30,360
sort of land from establishment in

631
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:31,890
cultivated areas and Canterbury will

632
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,230
sell in about October and we'll get our

633
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:36,240
first crop in December and we graze that

634
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:38,700
if it's weedy and then we start

635
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,130
rotational grazing we don't need it to

636
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,020
flower if it does that's great but we

637
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:45,270
don't need Lucerne to be flowering as

638
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,400
we're rotationally grazing it the key

639
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:48,809
thing is to be patient I'm not going to

640
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,250
go through all the technical details of

641
00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:52,110
this if you've got specific questions

642
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:54,049
around this we can do it but in 40

643
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:56,730
minutes I can't give you how we do

644
00:24:54,049 --> 00:24:59,360
loosen ABC I just wanted to give you

645
00:24:56,730 --> 00:25:02,130
some principles some other principles

646
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,220
growth is what we call kilograms of dry

647
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,690
matter per hectare per day okay so we

648
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:09,809
need to understand that growth is about

649
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:13,200
catching light and one thing to keep in

650
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:16,380
your head is that light is instantaneous

651
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,049
if I don't catch the light today it's

652
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:21,419
not there tomorrow the soil moisture is

653
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:24,090
I can conserve that for tomorrow I can

654
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:25,649
consider the nutrients for tomorrow but

655
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:28,620
light is instantaneous you either

656
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:30,149
captured or you lose it so capturing

657
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,919
light becomes really important because

658
00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:33,929
light is the driver of kilograms of dry

659
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,340
matter per hectare most of you think

660
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:37,110
kilograms of dry matter per hectare per

661
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:39,059
day what I like what's my growth rate

662
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:40,860
actually what you're talking about is

663
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:43,350
how much photosynthesis happened today

664
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:47,490
how much carbon was made how much sugar

665
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:49,409
did we make okay and then and to do that

666
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:51,330
you've got to capture light and then

667
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:52,830
development is when the plants flower or

668
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:54,419
when do they produce leaves and those

669
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:56,399
things are driven by temperatures

670
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:58,110
they're driven by the same sorts of

671
00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:00,539
things and they're influenced by

672
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:02,970
environmental signals plants can tell

673
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:05,370
time and they tell it by the day length

674
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,049
how did the willow tree know to drop its

675
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:10,020
leaves because the days were getting

676
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:13,080
shorter okay so that's how they're

677
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:15,779
telling the time so that's our energy

678
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,600
capture device whenever I don't have a

679
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:21,570
canopy of leaves then I'm losing light

680
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:23,490
from the system one of the issues we

681
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:26,279
have in spring is we have our pastures

682
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:28,080
so short that actually we are losing

683
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:30,419
light from the system because if they're

684
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,850
completely short they're not capturing

685
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:34,530
all of the light that's available if I I

686
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,410
just wanted to illustrate that if I've

687
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:37,690
got

688
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:40,210
me too squid that area here and I've got

689
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:42,160
it completely covenant in the ground I

690
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:45,880
have what's called a leaf area index of

691
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,730
1 1 unit of green leaf 1 meter of green

692
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:51,340
leaf a meter of ground to capture all of

693
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:54,190
the available light I actually need

694
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:57,520
about three and a half meters of green

695
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:59,020
leaf for every meter of ground so I

696
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,340
actually need the leaves to be up a

697
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,020
little bit to be capturing and

698
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,970
intercepting the light because there's

699
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:05,620
generally more light available for us

700
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:07,180
than the plants have the ability to

701
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,730
capture so we're going to capture all of

702
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:12,370
that light what we found with the

703
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:14,320
Lucerne was that if we irrigated the

704
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:16,360
crop and we had a mean temperature of 12

705
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,600
and the spring it's growing about 60

706
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:21,310
kilos of dry matter per hectare per day

707
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:23,490
but in the autumn it's still irrigated

708
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:27,880
it's still capturing all of the light

709
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:31,540
but it's only growing 35 kilos of dry

710
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,430
matter per hectare per day so this is

711
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:36,070
these are it's got nitrogen because it's

712
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:37,810
a leaking so we said about trying to

713
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,130
work out why do we get this big

714
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:43,840
difference in growth rates between

715
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:47,140
spring and autumn so this was a PhD

716
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:49,930
students job at Lincoln and we had crops

717
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:52,180
that we grazed 38 days resting and four

718
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:54,400
days grazing were crops that we grazed

719
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:56,500
after 25 days 19 gave them three days of

720
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,180
resting the experiment doesn't matter

721
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,760
too much what matters is what happened

722
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:04,270
below ground so this is the start of the

723
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:06,070
spring and I've got about three tons of

724
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,600
biomass below ground because we don't

725
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:10,300
often think about what's happening below

726
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,520
ground but below ground the Lucerne

727
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:15,850
stand and I suspect the red clover in

728
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:18,330
the chicory have this mass of carbon and

729
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:22,990
nitrogen stored and then they use that

730
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:26,320
and transport it up and therefore we get

731
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:27,940
high growth rates hence we get those

732
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,030
higher growth rates that I showed you on

733
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:33,870
the spring and then in the autumn in for

734
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:36,790
the plants there's only spring in autumn

735
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:38,320
plants only register when the days are

736
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,940
getting longer and when the days are

737
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,550
getting shorter that's how they tell the

738
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,350
time and if they do that then at the end

739
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,000
of the season this crop had got back to

740
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:48,400
its three tonnes of dry matter and look

741
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,120
pretty good so it was doing very well

742
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,070
but

743
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,910
the consequence of that if I was only

744
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:56,350
measuring above ground was that this

745
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:57,940
that's being put under the ground makes

746
00:28:56,350 --> 00:29:02,290
it look like it's got a lower growth

747
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:04,900
rate so the difference between these two

748
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:07,900
lines is that really the mean is about

749
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:10,780
here this is from stuff coming from

750
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:13,480
below ground up Californian thistles

751
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:15,490
exploding in the spring this is from

752
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,670
sugar being put under the ground into

753
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:21,790
the rhizomes and into the roots going

754
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:23,020
down that's when I put my herbicide on

755
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:24,640
the Kelly thistles and get them because

756
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:28,059
they're taking it down so Lucian is

757
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,950
doing that once we understood that the

758
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:31,450
same thing happening if we don't if we

759
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,800
don't look after the Lucian stand the

760
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:34,510
same thing happened in the second

761
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,070
treatment but we killed that crop in two

762
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:38,440
years because we never gave it a rest in

763
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:42,130
the autumn needs a risk to get back to

764
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:44,230
three tonnes to be breeding so what that

765
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,179
told us was we can be much more flexible

766
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:48,990
with grazing a loosen stand than we ever

767
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:51,130
thought we could be so we now graze

768
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:53,080
loosen stand I had people that are

769
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:55,120
grazing loosen stands that are about 10

770
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,700
centimeters tall in the spring they will

771
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,790
start when the first panic and the

772
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:02,920
rotation is about that big okay now I

773
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:04,809
used to be told when I was a student you

774
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:06,280
wait for 10% flowering sometimes the

775
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:08,620
crops with us but who's heard that he

776
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,040
was in flower okay that's what I got

777
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,740
told

778
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:15,190
and this set of data I've just shown you

779
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:17,440
is my scientific explanation for no we

780
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:20,080
don't we can start when the lucien is

781
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,580
quite small we can start rotational

782
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,590
grazing on that or we can actually we

783
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:25,240
have some people who made a low stocking

784
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,830
rate er actually set stalked on that

785
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,240
because they've got so much leucine on

786
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:30,309
their property if they didn't have some

787
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,660
animals on it during spring and when

788
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:34,720
it's just starting to kick off they'd

789
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:37,510
run in a room so we can graze before

790
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,540
flowers of d appear ideally with using

791
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:42,670
lambs the growing point is at the top of

792
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,679
the plant so once I remove that growing

793
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:46,690
point the growing point of a plant is

794
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,520
the bit that produces the leaves it's

795
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:51,610
also the bit that tells the temperature

796
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:54,429
okay so the growing point at the top now

797
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:57,520
with a grass that growing point is below

798
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:59,830
ground so pokes the leaves above ground

799
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,440
and therefore I can see it stopped

800
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:04,659
grasses because if I remove

801
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,820
the leaf another one will pop up because

802
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:09,159
the the point the growing point the bit

803
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:11,379
that produces the leaf is protected and

804
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:12,940
it's below ground with loose units at

805
00:31:11,379 --> 00:31:15,490
the top of the plant so if I take it off

806
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:18,610
it has to start and produce it a whole

807
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:20,529
new one from from that crown of shoots

808
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,659
that it's got so that's why we

809
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:26,110
rotationally graze loose soon and we can

810
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:28,779
set stock grasses so here we're looking

811
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:30,940
at a stand pre grazing now I've got that

812
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:32,529
at 20 to 25 centimetres tall as being

813
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,139
the first paddock that we're grazing in

814
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:38,200
September we've now shifted this down

815
00:31:35,139 --> 00:31:40,299
we're actually at Lincoln grazing often

816
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:44,139
the first week of September and we're on

817
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:46,179
to 10 to 15 centimetres okay so it's

818
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:47,559
then becomes a really viable option

819
00:31:46,179 --> 00:31:50,919
because we're using it early in the

820
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:52,000
spring this one looks like it's 10 to 15

821
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:54,519
centimetres because the photo has been

822
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,620
taken on an angle but that's what a

823
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:59,019
grazing rotation looks like so this is

824
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:01,240
that first paddock it's got to be at 2

825
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:03,610
tons a dry matter second paddock we go

826
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:05,289
into third paddock 43056 panic because

827
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:07,450
we're rotationally grazing around the

828
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:08,799
paddocks that all looks pretty good and

829
00:32:07,450 --> 00:32:11,289
I've come back here a top paddock one

830
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,840
two and three and about three town about

831
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:15,509
30 centimetres which is perfect for

832
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,889
going back in for the second rotation

833
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:20,500
perfect height to be going in 25 30

834
00:32:17,889 --> 00:32:23,379
centimeters 30cm metres tall but look

835
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,730
these ones here gotta weigh on me so

836
00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:26,169
they'd be paddocks that I probably

837
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:30,190
should be dropping out of the rotation

838
00:32:26,169 --> 00:32:32,019
and cutting and carrying so what we're

839
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:34,929
in an experimental situation is very

840
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:37,929
difficult to do there but if I'd shifted

841
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:40,330
this set of lines down a bit which is

842
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:42,370
what we're doing now then actually all

843
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:44,379
of these come down a bit and I no longer

844
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:46,629
have to drop those out so I'm maximizing

845
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:49,240
the feed that's actually going in to the

846
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:51,820
animals so we're starting grazing at

847
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:56,860
about 10 centimetres tool in the spring

848
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:59,409
and that's about twelve use plus twins

849
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:01,929
per hectare is what we're starting on at

850
00:32:59,409 --> 00:33:03,700
about that point so if I've got a 20 hit

851
00:33:01,929 --> 00:33:06,360
deer block of low soon and maybe I've

852
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:09,570
got it split in into five paddocks

853
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:13,119
that's 20 times

854
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:16,799
12news plus 28 years that's 240 in a

855
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,799
mall so it'd make sense

856
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,540
you

857
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:27,120
would have been an absolutely no problem

858
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:28,740
start grazing 22nd of August that's a

859
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,630
month earlier than we were starting when

860
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:32,730
we first started doing this research I'd

861
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:35,720
be quite comfortable coming into the

862
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:38,670
sluicey understand now 22nd of August

863
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:41,250
okay so that's very that's for me at

864
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:44,430
Lincoln but it's a month earlier than we

865
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:46,590
ever were previously and then it grows

866
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:48,630
it continues to grow and we grew some

867
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:50,550
stuff that 60 centimeters tall and you

868
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:52,230
can't see a flower anywhere near it so

869
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:54,590
it's this big and there's no flowers if

870
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:57,900
I'm waiting 14% flowering what a waste

871
00:34:54,590 --> 00:35:00,210
okay so the key message is let's get on

872
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:03,330
to the loosen and the spring and look

873
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:05,640
after it in the autumn triplets happily

874
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:09,240
grazing some malucia and grass here in

875
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:11,970
priority stock lamb beef deer we've got

876
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,940
dairy cows grazing lucerne now once

877
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:17,220
they're on it they should stay on it and

878
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:19,740
we want to stay on a rotation with those

879
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:22,580
with that mob of animals if you haven't

880
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:25,680
got loose in and you'd like to have it

881
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:27,030
about 20 hectares is a good amount to

882
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,760
start with because it'll take your

883
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:32,940
Hoggett mob for example five hectares

884
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,160
becomes a nuisance five hectares cut and

885
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,140
carry you know but if you're just

886
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:39,450
starting 28 years is probably what you

887
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:41,430
want to do and that'll give you the

888
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:43,530
opportunity of having five four here

889
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,240
paddocks and being able to work some of

890
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:47,640
us out and see see whether it's going to

891
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:49,680
work on your property high numbers for

892
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,690
short periods of time no more than seven

893
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,000
to ten days on any individual panic and

894
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:55,410
then they're off these bulls are quite

895
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,140
happily grazing with the ewes and lambs

896
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:59,880
and early spring in Marlborough but a

897
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:02,700
fibres out there for them to eat and

898
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:07,260
some salts available to them blue stone

899
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:09,150
stores salt or sodium in its roots so it

900
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,190
needs sodium to be available so it's

901
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:13,500
just a normal Salt Lick gets put out

902
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:17,090
whenever your grazing Lucy needs some

903
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:19,740
sodium out yeah one of the things that

904
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:21,450
Doug Avery started to do for those who

905
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,760
don't know Doug farms in Marlborough

906
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:25,560
it's pre grazed my when the Lucien's

907
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,270
really lush and the spring I have no

908
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,400
scientific evidence to say if this is

909
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:30,320
good or bad but it seems to work so

910
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:35,400
instead of

911
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:37,970
oops go backwards go big go big oh it's

912
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:41,760
not wanting to go back for me here we go

913
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:45,240
instead of having to put the fibery out

914
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,730
if you've loaned some strips the animals

915
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:50,580
will actually come in here and eat this

916
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:52,440
so that's the fiber and because whatever

917
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,030
we put out is hey is not going to be as

918
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,790
high-quality as the stuff and the

919
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:58,500
paddock the animals will tend to not eat

920
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:01,230
the hay you can't get every animal to

921
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,460
eat hay because it's not quite as good a

922
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,500
quality and they'll always try and

923
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:06,330
choose the highest quality feed but if

924
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,700
you have some strips like this then this

925
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:10,860
is actually just wilted for about 48

926
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:13,230
hours before the animals have gone in

927
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,450
and that deals with that lush lucerne

928
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:17,040
that can be a problem in the very early

929
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:18,870
spring and you can see the Bulls are in

930
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,490
here eating the loose and at the same

931
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:25,140
time in the autumn because we know it's

932
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:27,600
putting stuff under the ground we look

933
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,970
after the plant so what I'm trying to

934
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:31,500
say is I think Lucerne fits the breeding

935
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,210
systems really well we've got a lot of

936
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,980
animals coming in the spring it's

937
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,290
producing a whole lot of carbohydrate

938
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,760
coming up producing more feed than it

939
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:41,070
should based on how much light it's

940
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,870
intercepted but in the autumn we've got

941
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:45,720
to recognize it's going to slow down and

942
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:48,480
so in the autumn we've got to give it a

943
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,370
chance to build up those root reserves

944
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,770
and that means trying to leave it have a

945
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:55,910
flower or an extended period in autumn

946
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:59,370
as anytime between the second week of

947
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:00,830
January and the end of May that gives

948
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:04,770
you a pretty big window to get it right

949
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:06,930
and go here the stand needs a rest okay

950
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:09,890
and that way we can keep stands or wait

951
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:12,840
around for a while in terms of quality

952
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:14,760
the Emmy of the leaf is always above 12

953
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,590
the Emmy of the steam is always about 8

954
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,150
the reason we're trying to graze it

955
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:21,150
about 30 centimetres is because that's

956
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:23,400
about 3 tons of biomass if I grace 5

957
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:25,200
tonnes I've got two and a half tonnes of

958
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,370
leaf and two and a half tonnes of steam

959
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,080
if I graze

960
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:31,170
two tonnes I've got two tonnes of leaf

961
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:34,110
in no steam it's all highly palatable

962
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:36,810
there's a bear two and a half tons of

963
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:39,780
good stuff in a loose sense game which

964
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:41,520
is about 25 30 centimetres tall now if

965
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:43,800
I'm making hay I'll probably have to do

966
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,050
40 centimetres because I need that bit

967
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:48,630
of steam at the bottom to have hardened

968
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:50,700
off so I can actually cut it and so

969
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:51,420
that's why you tend to find hay crops a

970
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,849
taller

971
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,809
but from a grazing perspective actually

972
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:56,640
that's where we want to be and I don't

973
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:59,359
know what that is it's just that my

974
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,589
hands go there so you know it's that

975
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,930
that's what we want to go into a para

976
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:07,049
can eat about that and if it's Wayne

977
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:08,760
lambs probably about that but that's

978
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:10,799
about where we want to come under loosen

979
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:14,790
stand to maximize the quality that we're

980
00:39:10,799 --> 00:39:16,920
eating we can't have animal health

981
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:20,700
issues so a vaccination program has to

982
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,290
be good and I'm not an animal scientist

983
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,200
but people tell me a seven and one is

984
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:28,140
the best option for a loose hoon

985
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:30,390
situation b12 injections for if you've

986
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:34,109
got a cobalt deficiency and we don't

987
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:36,299
flush on loosen if we can avoid it in

988
00:39:34,109 --> 00:39:40,200
dull or wet weather because these little

989
00:39:36,299 --> 00:39:42,569
spots here they cause a compound and

990
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,730
they loosen to rise and when it rises up

991
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:47,160
it's called chemists roll it actually

992
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:49,380
suppresses ovulation rate so you don't

993
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:51,270
get as many twins as you expect and we

994
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,790
may find that we get that this year cuz

995
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:55,770
there was a lot of wet autumn and if

996
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,849
farmers use their loosen and it may find

997
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:59,910
they're scanning and lambing percentages

998
00:39:56,849 --> 00:40:02,910
are down a bit but this is some recent

999
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:05,010
PhD work what we found was if you're in

1000
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:07,079
that situation you can leave them on the

1001
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:09,809
loose in until two weeks before the RAM

1002
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:11,190
goes out so they can be going through

1003
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:13,049
the window if you go through the summer

1004
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:14,640
putting on weight doing really well and

1005
00:40:13,049 --> 00:40:16,170
then two weeks before you want to put

1006
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,910
the rear mirror they should be off the

1007
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:21,180
loo soon and then you won't have a

1008
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:23,309
conception problem okay once they're

1009
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,869
pregnant they can go back on Lucy and no

1010
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:26,130
problem at all it doesn't cause abortion

1011
00:40:24,869 --> 00:40:28,920
there's no issues with that

1012
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:32,309
it's just that leaf disease from fungal

1013
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:34,170
causes it some problems Reed got the

1014
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:36,450
fiber that mowing helps in that

1015
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:37,770
situation bloat we know about it can

1016
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,329
always be an issue I'm not going to say

1017
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:41,280
you won't get bloke people do get bloat

1018
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:43,890
and it's devastating when it happens

1019
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,440
okay sodium we've talked about because

1020
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:47,880
we need we need you might see sometimes

1021
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,049
animals go into a Lucy and panic and

1022
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,790
that and the third paddock in the

1023
00:40:49,049 --> 00:40:52,260
rotation and they're just eating the

1024
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,609
fence line it's often because they're

1025
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,559
eating the weeds because the weeds have

1026
00:40:53,609 --> 00:40:59,700
got sodium in them because we haven't

1027
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:00,990
they have any excess to sodium so start

1028
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,000
well that's fifteen between us enemies

1029
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:05,030
tool qualities maximized at thirty

1030
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,280
centimeters the leaf and the saw

1031
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:08,990
part of the high quality stuff dari

1032
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,040
about the residual that's in a panic

1033
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:12,470
once you've grazed it

1034
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,340
it's of no consequence to the plant it

1035
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,350
looks messy

1036
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:17,090
so if you don't like a messy looking

1037
00:41:15,350 --> 00:41:18,620
stand you can go and trim it off but

1038
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:20,540
otherwise it's of no consequence

1039
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:22,040
drop out paddocks if it's getting away

1040
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:24,110
what you should be doing ana-lucia and

1041
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:26,450
grazing in the spring is I'm grazing

1042
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:29,330
panic for and my six paddock rotation

1043
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:31,100
what does paddock one look like I'm

1044
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:33,170
grazing paddock five what does paddock

1045
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:35,000
one look like because I want it in two

1046
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:37,940
paddock one the second time when it's

1047
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,110
about 30 centimeters tall so that's how

1048
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,780
you should be looking at your stand

1049
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:44,210
there's no defined number of days

1050
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:45,710
grazing rotation nothing like that it's

1051
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:48,530
when do I get back to about 30

1052
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:50,270
centimetres and for us at Lincoln's

1053
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:53,600
sometimes that's been after 28 days

1054
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:55,820
sometimes it's been after 35 4 to 5

1055
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,400
weeks has been what we've required when

1056
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,960
we started that short one - when we get

1057
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,780
back onto the first paddock again the

1058
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:05,330
second time around we've talked about an

1059
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:07,400
extended period of autumn growth and in

1060
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:09,080
some areas if you've got a wet autumn

1061
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,840
then use your grass for tapping not your

1062
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:13,340
loosen and weed control the weather it

1063
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,140
is then the weed control becomes really

1064
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:17,810
important so that's sort of an overview

1065
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:19,490
of loo soon and I'll take technical

1066
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:21,260
questions later if people have got them

1067
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:23,570
I just wanted to give you an overall

1068
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,280
understanding of the plant and then give

1069
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:26,840
you a little bit of case study stuff so

1070
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,360
this is Doug average who's who Doug

1071
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,830
speak a number of here Doug speak was

1072
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,930
retired he's in town now I'm going to

1073
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:34,580
visit him this weekend my own will still

1074
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:36,170
live in Blenheim so I'm off to visit my

1075
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,160
in-laws and I'll go and see Doug but

1076
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:38,960
I'll see him in Teheran we'll have

1077
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,700
coffee instead of me driving out to the

1078
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,670
farm but phrase is still on the farm I

1079
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:46,670
Gompers at Frazer this is the story this

1080
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:48,980
is the graph that really turned Doug's

1081
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:50,900
mind was when I shown him this one and

1082
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:53,390
said you know what because of that

1083
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:55,820
remobilize ation plus the plants never

1084
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:57,470
nitrogen deficient in your limited

1085
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:00,530
bucket that you get there at Vaughn

1086
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:02,840
Avery and Marlborough in the spring you

1087
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:04,250
can do about 30 kilos of dry matter for

1088
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,110
every millimetre of water you've gotten

1089
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:08,750
the soil whereas your grass is only

1090
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:10,160
doing about 13 so all of a sudden

1091
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:12,650
instead of producing two and a half

1092
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,300
tonnes per hectare and spring you're

1093
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:16,340
producing six tonnes per hectare and

1094
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,830
spring because you've dealt with that

1095
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:20,740
nitrogen deficiency that I talked about

1096
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:23,450
by having the league game in the system

1097
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:25,700
and he got that and he then started to

1098
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:28,250
understand that what he really was is a

1099
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:30,050
farmer of water and it's maximizing the

1100
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,970
use of the water that becomes important

1101
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:35,030
when we talk about five mils of

1102
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:37,670
evapotranspiration what that means is

1103
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:40,760
you they actually lost 50 tonnes of

1104
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:43,040
water from a hectare you know the

1105
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,780
process of photosynthesis is not about

1106
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,420
saving water it's about getting carbon

1107
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:48,710
dioxide into the plant to do that it's

1108
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:51,410
got a little holes that open and the

1109
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:54,830
water flies out you can't change that

1110
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:57,290
that's biology but we can maximize the

1111
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:58,700
use of that water by having nitrogen

1112
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:01,190
efficient plants and the system

1113
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:02,990
particularly in spring hence my desire

1114
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:06,500
to have sub clover and because it's our

1115
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:08,930
earliest growing medium that's 14th of

1116
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:11,000
August so obviously lots of using lambs

1117
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:13,160
around and one of the things that we

1118
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,500
find is that you get hog at mating as

1119
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:19,910
you put more weight because those new

1120
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:21,770
Lambs oh go back again you lambs here

1121
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:23,780
will get mums milk

1122
00:44:21,770 --> 00:44:25,820
so they'll do 300 grams per head per day

1123
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:28,370
and then they'll get straight lu soon

1124
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:31,820
and it's much easier to get them up to

1125
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:34,970
55 kilos by the time they come around

1126
00:44:31,820 --> 00:44:36,890
and saved in your hog at mating and we

1127
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:39,740
know that as you put weight on hog it's

1128
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:42,230
you increase the percentage that you're

1129
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:44,210
going to get out of them so the whole

1130
00:44:42,230 --> 00:44:48,350
system starts to spiral up because

1131
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:51,170
you've got better grown you lambs wider

1132
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:52,760
that from that first period of growth

1133
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:54,410
when they're just born right through

1134
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,790
they stay on the loose in and they're

1135
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:59,300
looking pretty good by the time you come

1136
00:44:55,790 --> 00:45:01,670
to mating it's an example of them

1137
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,710
growing and just another example of if

1138
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:05,840
you this is October and he's still

1139
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:07,940
cutting some strips in here because it's

1140
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:11,780
been raining as a 550ml rainfall

1141
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:15,530
environment on Doug's property he

1142
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:17,930
increased the land area between 2002 and

1143
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:19,730
2012 I stopped he gave me the figures

1144
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:22,010
every year but I stopped in 2012 because

1145
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:23,810
about then he started to lease a lot of

1146
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,430
land and take another farm all except

1147
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:27,680
when it became too complicated to try

1148
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:30,020
and do a true comparison between the

1149
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,270
systems but over a decade when I first

1150
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:34,490
sort of met Doug he went from

1151
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:37,100
1100 Heatley's to 1800 a sheet numbers

1152
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:39,140
went up a bird about 12 percent but the

1153
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:41,900
key thing was the performance so we've

1154
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:44,300
got a 28% lift and lambing we're no

1155
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:47,870
longer selling stores at 13.3 we're

1156
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:50,810
selling 19 kilo lambs that are going off

1157
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:53,450
prime so we've got a 43% increase here

1158
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:56,090
in total lamb sold we've gone up almost

1159
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:58,730
100% now I know we've got an increase in

1160
00:45:56,090 --> 00:46:00,140
area of about a third to a half but

1161
00:45:58,730 --> 00:46:02,300
we've gone up a hundred percent in terms

1162
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:05,690
of lamb production now to pretty much

1163
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:09,080
the same flock in the return obviously

1164
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:10,640
being quite high and for those of you

1165
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,710
that are interested then he's written a

1166
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,420
fairly good story that you might want to

1167
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:16,670
have a look at called the resilient

1168
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:18,710
farmer one of the key things he says

1169
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:21,310
about that is it wasn't playing sailing

1170
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:23,870
and so I wanted to illustrate that

1171
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:26,150
whenever you have a farm system your

1172
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:29,540
farm system or whatever you're operating

1173
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:31,820
on you know that system so you've

1174
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:33,260
maximized that system and its operating

1175
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,290
as well as it possibly can because

1176
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:39,140
wherever your farm is after say five 16

1177
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:40,010
years you've got it as optimized as it

1178
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:43,460
can possibly be

1179
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:46,070
so your ability to have to change it

1180
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:47,630
becomes limited you already know where

1181
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:49,610
the animals should be on any given day

1182
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:51,680
or how much feed you're going to grow

1183
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:55,880
you've optimized that farm pretty much

1184
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:58,100
and so your system starts to plateau and

1185
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:00,230
what we're talking about is how do we

1186
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:02,930
implement a new technology like Lucerne

1187
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:05,750
grazing well generally what we find is

1188
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:07,550
things go backwards and Ford AG they

1189
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:10,760
went backwards quite quickly but this is

1190
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:14,540
you get a new car or you whatever it is

1191
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:15,830
you do something different you start to

1192
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:18,800
play squash and you've never played

1193
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:21,320
before you know there's a damn period

1194
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,910
here where you go backwards a bit and

1195
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,740
it's always going to happen because

1196
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:26,390
you're trying something new but what

1197
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:29,420
you're wanting is look if I keep on this

1198
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:30,830
path I'm going to stay here so I go

1199
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:33,440
backwards a bit and then I've got

1200
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:35,270
potential to increase my output quite

1201
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,700
dramatically that's what we talk about

1202
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:39,520
when we say transformational change

1203
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:43,670
incremental change is a little bit

1204
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:44,610
transformation is big output change what

1205
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:46,830
agribusiness

1206
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:48,480
there's a problem here and this is if

1207
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:51,870
you read Doug's book that sort of when I

1208
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:54,390
met him when he was down here you know I

1209
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:55,710
and it took a bit to come out and

1210
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:58,170
there's a risk you're going backwards ah

1211
00:47:55,710 --> 00:48:01,380
this isn't gonna work so we have to

1212
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:03,570
minimize that and hopefully that's what

1213
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:05,820
science agribusiness technology people

1214
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:08,280
are doing that's their job is to try and

1215
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:10,200
minimize that but don't be scared if

1216
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:13,410
things don't work the first time you

1217
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:15,090
grow on a rape crop or a plantain red

1218
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:17,880
clover crop or whatever it might be that

1219
00:48:15,090 --> 00:48:19,200
you try you can't expect it to work as

1220
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:21,120
well as what you've been doing for ten

1221
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,480
years because you don't know the nuances

1222
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:27,210
of that system so you have to learn how

1223
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,090
to deal with that and our job is to try

1224
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:35,610
and minimize this negative the output in

1225
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:38,580
the risk of reversion from there maybe

1226
00:48:35,610 --> 00:48:41,250
the next thing is irrigation and you can

1227
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:42,780
move to another I'm not sure most guys

1228
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:44,520
that switch from a dryer into an

1229
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:45,990
irrigation actually have a problem it

1230
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,400
doesn't it's not plain sailing to fish

1231
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:49,310
start putting an irrigator on there's a

1232
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,720
lot of problem a lot of things to learn

1233
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:53,550
keep an ID it keep it thought of that

1234
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:57,600
process as I show you the next case

1235
00:48:53,550 --> 00:49:00,960
study this is Bob Roy 300 400 mill

1236
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:03,900
rainfall and central in the Mackenzie

1237
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,910
you know Oda Matata Dundee and Lisa

1238
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:08,610
Anderson this is their property and what

1239
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:11,760
happened is they had heard Doug's story

1240
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:14,820
in about 2008 and they were driving back

1241
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,770
from somewhere unless there was a fir

1242
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:18,270
trip for Ravens down and she came into

1243
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:20,430
my office because she was Aniak student

1244
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:21,660
and she set my office and we she was

1245
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:24,150
asking me some questions calendar and

1246
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:26,460
what the questions were but Gandhi was

1247
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:28,140
sitting there sort of a bit bored and he

1248
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,750
saw this handout that I'd had from a

1249
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:31,920
field day at Doug over his place and so

1250
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,060
he grabbed that and he started reading

1251
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,820
it and then he just took over the

1252
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:37,920
conversation said I heard about this guy

1253
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:39,480
and that was it and I don't know Gandhi

1254
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,730
at all but he told me what he was trying

1255
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,470
to do and I said to him well actually

1256
00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:45,570
your farm system your feed supply an

1257
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:46,890
animal demand don't match you're trying

1258
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:48,990
to produce a whole lot of animals in the

1259
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:50,580
middle of January in February we don't

1260
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:53,010
have any feed your for hundreds of

1261
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:56,250
rainfall weren't your grazing your

1262
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:58,200
loosen and that was about it that was

1263
00:49:56,250 --> 00:50:00,089
about the end of the conversation you

1264
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:03,119
brilliantly from there from Lincoln

1265
00:50:00,089 --> 00:50:04,710
through to America he then just talked

1266
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,640
to Lisa the whole way home about what

1267
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:07,500
they were going to do and how it was

1268
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,660
going to change so this is their story

1269
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:12,089
after ten years there was their old

1270
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:14,099
system see it stopped constantly chasing

1271
00:50:12,089 --> 00:50:15,300
grass hill country going backwards

1272
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:16,310
because they're constantly up there

1273
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,690
looking for every blade of grass

1274
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:21,270
hundred-day supplementary feeding peak

1275
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:23,490
demand and feed supply completely

1276
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:25,650
misaligned so what we did was try and

1277
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:28,200
implement what I call landscape farming

1278
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:30,810
so we take the areas that are deeper

1279
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:32,040
soils and we put some loose in and

1280
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:34,980
because that's where the waters going to

1281
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:36,810
run - why would I cultivate this it's

1282
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:40,560
already hard and bony I'll let the water

1283
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:42,000
run here and cultivate that area in the

1284
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,170
first time they're using lambs went on

1285
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,570
they got a phone call from the neighbor

1286
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:47,490
the user lamb escaped and dear Lucy and

1287
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:50,339
paddock because until high country was

1288
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:51,810
traditionally cut and carried so you

1289
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:53,970
know outside the box

1290
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:55,800
getting started they had a little bit of

1291
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:58,589
Lucerne but starting the grazing was the

1292
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:01,200
big issue and in working out which bits

1293
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:04,349
of our landscape can we put moose in

1294
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:06,589
into and utilize loosen in there the

1295
00:51:04,349 --> 00:51:09,750
best thing Gandhi did was marry well

1296
00:51:06,589 --> 00:51:11,550
because Lisa was quite happy to cut

1297
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:13,290
cages and get some idea of how much

1298
00:51:11,550 --> 00:51:15,930
they're actually producing she was a

1299
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:17,579
numbers person and her training and

1300
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:20,280
forced her to do that so they got good

1301
00:51:17,579 --> 00:51:22,440
support also Peter Anderson my things

1302
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,329
with stock here and they recorded the

1303
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,099
numbers so in the last 12 months or so

1304
00:51:24,329 --> 00:51:28,800
I've just being able to go back and look

1305
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:32,670
at the numbers over time what they found

1306
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:34,230
was kilograms of lamb weaned it was the

1307
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:36,510
number of lambs you've got times their

1308
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:38,099
weaning weight so that's the key period

1309
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:40,200
we were looking for how much how many

1310
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:41,790
kilos are you getting and that depends

1311
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,920
on your scanning percentage your lamb

1312
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:46,589
wastage and your lambing this is the key

1313
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,450
thing that changed they decreased the

1314
00:51:46,589 --> 00:51:50,069
lamb wastage Marino's are not very good

1315
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:52,319
mothers any of you there's no anything

1316
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:54,630
about Marino's because they're generally

1317
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:57,900
being starved so they give birth and say

1318
00:51:54,630 --> 00:52:01,230
thank God the parasites gone

1319
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:03,420
and they walk away but if they feed well

1320
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:04,920
then they might not walk so far and they

1321
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,240
might actually go back and inquire as to

1322
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,150
what that thing was that they just

1323
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:11,460
dropped or maybe - look now we've got

1324
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:15,360
two so the lambing percentage Liam

1325
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:18,450
growth rate etc you can see the 2008

1326
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:21,570
system producing about 90 to 90 tons of

1327
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:23,700
weaned lamb and then starting to get an

1328
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:25,590
increase from their grazing and then a

1329
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:27,300
bit more and then a bit more near no

1330
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:28,680
reversion I'd like to say that's because

1331
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:31,440
they had some intervention from good

1332
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:33,360
agribusiness and myself so they're

1333
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,150
backwards but that's what happened and

1334
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:39,060
you can see now the same property is

1335
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:41,670
essentially producing 150 tons of weaned

1336
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:45,600
lamb when it was producing 90 it's a 50%

1337
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:48,150
increase and they've done that on a four

1338
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:51,000
hundred mill rainfall environment and

1339
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:53,790
there you use mated hasn't changed very

1340
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,410
much initially so what you find is you

1341
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:57,000
don't have to change your stocking rate

1342
00:52:55,410 --> 00:53:01,920
very much you're just feeding animals

1343
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:05,250
better paths place are we all right okay

1344
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,050
that's good because I am - putting the

1345
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:10,650
two together you can see those steps and

1346
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:12,900
stairs and that's the the change the key

1347
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:15,810
take-home message they listen to advice

1348
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:17,250
and acted on it that was the key thing

1349
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:19,680
I'm just here the advice they actually

1350
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:22,260
listen to the advice and acted on it

1351
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,330
so the lucerne story has worked pretty

1352
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:26,970
well it's defined a lot of systems

1353
00:53:24,330 --> 00:53:29,850
people are making money out of it the

1354
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:32,370
sheep milk goat milk people they're all

1355
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:34,110
wanting green chopped looser because

1356
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:36,810
they know it's the highest quality feed

1357
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:39,480
if you're making if your product is milk

1358
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:42,660
out of sheep you need high quality feed

1359
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:45,990
to do that and rye grass cab I'll flick

1360
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:49,350
through that one except to say that part

1361
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:50,880
we knew 5 to 35 kilos in 100 days the

1362
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:52,170
other plant we've been interested in and

1363
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,720
we're working on more at the moment is

1364
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:55,490
sub fly though so this is the 11th of

1365
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:59,490
September

1366
00:53:55,490 --> 00:54:02,460
Ashley Dean at Lincoln and what we're

1367
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:04,320
finding is we're able to produce animals

1368
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:08,220
that are growing 300 grams per head per

1369
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:09,810
day very early and within a hundred days

1370
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:11,250
I mean Ashley Dean is essentially a

1371
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:13,830
grave all for those who don't know

1372
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:17,490
it's a stone farm at Lincoln that they

1373
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:19,110
put some soil in pretty much what the

1374
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:21,660
dairy cows are on and most of the plains

1375
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:24,270
there's not a lot of soil there but

1376
00:54:21,660 --> 00:54:28,620
within a three-month period we are

1377
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:31,410
averaging 300 that's about 330 grams per

1378
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:34,680
head per day and if you do that 300

1379
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:38,250
grams per head per day the time to go

1380
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:40,710
from 25 to 35 kilos live weight is about

1381
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:42,690
a month or is if you're only doing a

1382
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:47,850
hundred grams per head per day it's

1383
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:52,200
three months so you've got to have

1384
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:54,800
animals growing fast have to get 20 to

1385
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:57,030
megajoules per day if I've got 12

1386
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:59,400
megajoules from my Lucerne they need to

1387
00:54:57,030 --> 00:55:01,020
be out two kilos of loosin per day

1388
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,590
that's what I need to eat to be able to

1389
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:06,120
do that and then they're gone in a month

1390
00:55:03,590 --> 00:55:09,780
from a sub clover story if you're

1391
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:12,090
interested in sub clover this is amol

1392
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:14,190
broccoli team Paulo David and Joe Greg

1393
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:16,800
and their staff is online on the beef

1394
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:18,120
and lamb website and what they pretty

1395
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:21,450
much did was all through grazing

1396
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:22,710
management David learnt how to graze he

1397
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:25,110
didn't even know he had sub clover on

1398
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:27,360
the property when we visited he didn't

1399
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:30,990
know it was there and he grazed it

1400
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:34,470
properly get that sort of pasture in the

1401
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:36,360
spring and his values here saying he's

1402
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:39,210
gone from sixty to seventy six tons of

1403
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:41,730
meat all they did was put in stock water

1404
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:44,220
and fences so they could manage this sub

1405
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:46,440
clover no seed introduced in that so if

1406
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:48,870
there's any seed merchant to you but

1407
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,430
they just managed what they had and knew

1408
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:54,090
which league in was going to work in

1409
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:55,980
their environment you can have clover

1410
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:59,820
and sometimes that can be too short so I

1411
00:55:55,980 --> 00:56:02,940
just wanted to finish sometimes high

1412
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:05,940
quality feed is not good enough by

1413
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:09,390
itself there needs to be intake this is

1414
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:11,940
too short and what you find this is a

1415
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:14,700
sheep well then you may have a living

1416
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:18,150
and a half but a decent intake so you

1417
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:20,370
can get decent and take here depending

1418
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:23,130
on what the herbage mess is so you can't

1419
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:24,240
just have high quality feed there's also

1420
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:27,000
got to be a

1421
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:29,760
decent Amanda herbage so I might take

1422
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,680
home heroes sometimes our pastures are

1423
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,830
too short and it's not the quality of

1424
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,990
pasture that's limiting our production

1425
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:38,910
it's the intake you've got to have both

1426
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:43,040
and that's why the lucerne works is why

1427
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:43,040
the sub clovers work and there I've done

1428
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:55,890
sorry

1429
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:57,390
I'm around Moran til the end of the day

1430
00:56:55,890 --> 00:57:11,400
some people got questions happy to

1431
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:12,900
answer them thanks Graham we looked at

1432
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,849
our place because we were in the Waimea

1433
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:17,250
Valley and I see that's got the greatest

1434
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:22,080
change in climate and so you're looking

1435
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:24,420
towards drier okay and I thought a great

1436
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:26,280
idea we plant looser well then I looked

1437
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:27,920
around and there wasn't a paddock that

1438
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:31,410
didn't have fill tiles in it that

1439
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:37,290
required some extra care with that help

1440
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:40,550
bed is looser in field trials I'd put

1441
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:40,550
the loose in in and find out

1442
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:48,890
very brave I'll give you a ring so so

1443
00:57:46,190 --> 00:57:53,480
what we know is that it will find them

1444
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:55,340
and it'll probably block them but the

1445
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:59,090
advantage you get out of it I suspect

1446
00:57:55,340 --> 00:58:03,440
will be worth the hassle and I'd have a

1447
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:05,510
go and I'd find the dryer of the

1448
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,460
paddocks obviously north west face if

1449
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:11,810
there's any slope at all any contour I'd

1450
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:13,940
go under those contours first but the

1451
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:14,740
benefits are so great that I would give

1452
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:17,750
it a go

1453
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:19,520
that would be my advice and if I get it

1454
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:23,330
wrong well you've done a panic and I'm

1455
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:28,400
sorry but at least unless you do it

1456
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:31,310
we're not going to know how far no what

1457
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:35,920
what is your the the highest rainfall

1458
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:38,450
that you can suitably okay loosen it

1459
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:42,140
rainfall is a misnomer it's when does it

1460
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:43,790
rain okay so a lot of people think

1461
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,380
they've got 1200 millimeter rainfall and

1462
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:46,700
go you should be dairy farming but

1463
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:49,190
actually it all falls in June and July

1464
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:51,980
and August actually what matters is how

1465
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:53,450
much rainfall do you get in October

1466
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:57,610
November December January and February

1467
00:58:53,450 --> 00:59:01,100
if you have six weeks eight weeks of dry

1468
00:58:57,610 --> 00:59:03,680
then it's worth putting loosenin it's

1469
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:05,060
worth having a go with a deep taproot of

1470
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,860
legume that will give you some summer

1471
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:09,050
production and you only got three weeks

1472
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:11,300
of dry well most years you'll get

1473
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:13,940
through there so the amount of rainfall

1474
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:15,560
doesn't matter it's when it falls that

1475
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:18,620
really matters

1476
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:20,420
so yeah it's easy to say 400 mils and a

1477
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:22,280
dermatology absolutely you've got to do

1478
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:23,720
it but I've got people at a thousand

1479
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,480
mils of rainfall that are still doing

1480
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:28,730
loose in because they're back they've

1481
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,830
got soil like this it's already fall if

1482
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:33,770
they get another 200 mils of rainfall in

1483
00:59:30,830 --> 00:59:36,110
August and September not actually

1484
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:36,790
helping that's when it falls that

1485
00:59:36,110 --> 00:59:38,930
matters

1486
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:41,300
hm could I've got the nod for another

1487
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:46,580
year you just do a few water tables at

1488
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:50,410
20 meters and you're 20 meters yep and

1489
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:53,770
you're your tip rates going down a meter

1490
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:56,289
and it's you got Tim which is dry is is

1491
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:58,599
it still beneficial and you're farming

1492
00:59:56,289 --> 01:00:01,630
on Gribble if you found me on gravel

1493
00:59:58,599 --> 01:00:05,289
what else you going to grow and I've had

1494
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:07,450
situations and of people that sell the

1495
01:00:05,289 --> 01:00:10,480
gravel ringing me to try and kill the

1496
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:13,839
elusive because at the end of the load

1497
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:18,150
that going down to get the gravel they

1498
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:21,849
were still loose in routes at six meters

1499
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:24,430
so it won't stop at a meter it'll keep

1500
01:00:21,849 --> 01:00:26,950
going down as long as there is moisture

1501
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:29,200
there now if the water table comes up we

1502
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:31,089
don't know whether that will cut but you

1503
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:33,099
know if you've got a water table that

1504
01:00:31,089 --> 01:00:34,630
goes up and down but if it's just down

1505
01:00:33,099 --> 01:00:37,510
there and you've got gravel nothing else

1506
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:39,160
is going to grow on it so I know that

1507
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:41,140
situation I'd probably look at all them

1508
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:42,309
selling but we can talk about there at

1509
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:44,470
morning tea because you're wanting to

1510
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:46,180
stop there nothing to do you want other

1511
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:47,559
people to bring this issue to a close

1512
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:51,130
I've got people busting to get into the

1513
01:00:47,559 --> 01:00:54,329
door just like you to think Dirac please

1514
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:54,329
and the normal sort of work

1515
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,859
I don't it always a it's quite

1516
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:04,130
remarkable you get the top-flight

1517
01:01:00,859 --> 01:01:06,050
speakers they make reasonably complex

1518
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:07,790
sort of discussions quite simple and

1519
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:10,130
easily understandable and Derek's a real

1520
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:11,780
cracker at that and just an addition to

1521
01:01:10,130 --> 01:01:13,970
the round of applause you can drink this

1522
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:15,470
on the aircraft on the way home it's for

1523
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:17,150
you and that's for you as well and many

1524
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:18,320
thanks again Derek so you mean a good

1525
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:21,820
thank you

1526
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:21,820
[Applause]
