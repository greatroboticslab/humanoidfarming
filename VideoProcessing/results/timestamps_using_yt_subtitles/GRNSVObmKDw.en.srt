1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:05,200
what's up modern stuts we're here at the

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,680
Mother Earth News fair and we're looking

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,880
at some nice gardening tools that this

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,040
gentleman makes in his backyard let's

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:13,960
find out how he does it so what's your

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,480
process of making your of all these nice

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:18,400
fine tools well it obviously it varies a

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,640
little bit from tool to Tool but first

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,080
step is the forging uh we start forging

10
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,000
all the shanks first uh the blades I cut

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,519
these blades out in a plasma machine we

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,040
buy this in 4x8 sheets uh

13
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:33,800
and depending like I say depending on

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,440
the tool and quite what we're doing

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,719
we'll do all the forging get ready to

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,079
weld and then there's a cleanup step to

17
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,440
get this uh down to pristine metal for

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,600
the weld weld them on there and then the

19
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,520
TRS for example they go back they go for

20
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,760
another round of forging where I cup

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,360
them and put the bend in them after that

22
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,000
they sit and cool off a little bit to

23
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,559
where we can mess with them again and

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
then they go back into the forge a third

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,120
time for a heat treat cycle that's the

26
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,800
uh you can see the heat treat line here

27
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,879
where we've got a hard Edge out here

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,360
that Fades back to softer more ductal

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,200
material in the center y uh from the way

30
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,439
the slag holds on to it there so what's

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,680
the best way to condition this after

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,280
you've been using them for a while uh

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,840
well after you've used them for a while

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,360
a little bit of any kind of a light oil

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,320
uh I like the beeswax and linseed oil

36
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,240
because the wax gives the oil a little

37
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,119
bit of extra tack to to help hold on um

38
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,640
the reality is like these are dipped in

39
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:33,200
beeswax and linseed oil now

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,880
but uh they're all carbon steel over

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,759
time they're going to pick up rust and

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,799
the best way to maintain your tools is

43
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,000
just keep using them awesome if it rusts

44
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:43,759
uh you're not using enough go yeah

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,600
you're not using it enough and once you

46
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,479
start using it again it's going to be

47
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,320
shiny again in a couple hours now the

48
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:51,640
handles way just f with beeswax or

49
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,680
tongue oil or tongue oil linseed oil

50
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,640
little beeswax just the natural oil off

51
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,159
your hand if you're using it a lot

52
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,719
that's where you really want to take

53
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:00,640
your time to take care of it is the

54
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,600
handle itself don't leave them out where

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,159
they're getting wet dry wet dry um take

56
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:08,640
good care of the handle and the rest of

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,360
it will be fine you yeah a little bit of

58
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,160
rust on this isn't going to hurt it

59
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,800
within the first couple hours of using

60
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,360
it again it'll be shined up and and look

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,480
like a new one again these tools are

62
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,080
awesome guys I'm going to leave a link

63
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,120
