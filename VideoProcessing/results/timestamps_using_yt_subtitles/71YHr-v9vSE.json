  "text": "right so you got a shorter side and a longer one yeah you're toing off at the handle here so this knot that I'm doing is um deemed to be 80 H sorry 70% the strength of the wire which isn't too bad it doesn't slip and you can use it on short strains and it comes up pretty neat that's how fast it is when you can do it well well it's quicker than putting in a Crump or anything you know yeah and um my wire strainers are Rusty because nobody seems to be able to build good wire is these days that don't slip so yeah show it again uh slower slower yeah so what you yeah around the first and then the loop and around the second each of these wires is uh tension to around 150 kgs and I'm pretty confident that this particular fence will stay that tight for the next 30 years because um we've used 2.7 M strainers all driven all the foots are driven yep and um so here we're just at a corner it's going from this is about halfway down the line yeah halfway about um from there somewhere industry standard yep is for these these lines to actually be tied off on the strainer so that there's no um knots on the line except for joining knots of wire where your coil Runs Out M but um that's good and and I do tie off a lot of fences in that manner but uh this works really well on a long strain you need to get even tension from both ends and like to say the knot is um pretty strong and it doesn't slip see this no sharp edges on it or nothing like that yep and um it'll be fine it'll stay here for years then you got to put some buttons on everywhere three three for every panel yeah so this is a 9 wire fence and it's a pretty standard fence for New Zealand conditions I really like it because uh by the time you put three BTS on this fence there Ain nothing going to put its head through it and hassle it and it's tight tight like a guitar you know and um they ain't going to get through this ever and then that means that I can finish this job and look laying should be as good as you like you know yeah those where the five first and the last four in here yep yep I set the strainers so that um all the knots fall in a row as good as you can get but the reason for that is when we come to batting this fence there's going to be a bat in here and another one here so all of those knots are going to fall um down in the middle and it's not hard to change the um strainer to do that oh yeah but you got to think in advance where you put your nuts yeah because of the buttons of course yeah yeah so I'm just trimming off here what I need to uh work with the rest is just Surplus so this is about how much wire we've pulled out of the strain the strainer fence yeah so if you have a look along here we've built around 200 M here between the two uh both ends nothing like this is the the last of about 1.2 km that we've built in this particular job M so it's a relatively short strain and um the rest of them are around between 3 and 400 m which some people would consider quite long for one strain but I'm a real fan of um having a long strain because it takes advantage of the elasticity of this wire it's just like a piece of elastic really I mean we're dealing with high tensile wire yep 2 and 1/2 mil and uh a little short piece like this feels very hard but over a great distance it becomes very elastic and um you've got to take advantage of that so that you do have something move in your fence line for example if a foot comes up um that wasse not going to lose much tension but of course you try to set it up so you can't do that we've had a trials on this job there's been a lot of um angle post to put in which is like this one here and um three of them we had to blast and those three took a day's work each by the time we blew a hole into solid POA and then blew out a big crater and then got down 1.2 M deep stick the post in foot and then you got to find all the Rocks get them back in the hole and by that time your M will pack the GE up and call it a day yeah all all those corners and uh and strainers they're uh deeper in the ground than uh over the ground longer under uh this one here is the same length in the ground as it is out yeah but all the ones at the end of the line are um uh how far are they in to uh 1500 right 1300 shouldn't move with this you hope not but some of this [\u00a0__\u00a0] ground around here is letting us down a bit we've got to make sure that we put foots on them and we're lucky that we're doing this job in in the winter time well you know wet season anyway so that it makes us think really hard about putting foots on that aren't going to move yeah because you can get fooled In The Summertime by coming around and thinking oh it's nice and dry here we can um just put a little foot on and away we go come winter time and this ground gets really wet and you've got a tight fence it'll move which is unfortunate but yeah we just saw before we had to put a huge foot and replace that's right yeah and um let's we get trapped trap for young players I've had many years of doing this and I've I can I can proudly say I suppose proudly say that everything I've learned I've learned the hard way because when something fails and believe me I've had a few things fail you go and have a look at that and ask the question why and you do what you know you learn from it next time you think right ain't going to let that happen so you know I'm still trying to build the perfect fence have you done it yet I'm working on the right I'm too fussy for that I I I spend too much time picking holes in my own work and uh wire strainers can be a dog to deal with and I've found for years that if you just put them on a little safety pin like that M you've got them all and then you can drop them on the ground or do whatever and carry them over your shoulder and you can you've got them see you can drop them on the ground here and you pick them all up by grabbing that and not losing them good cuz I wanted this one up the front easy to deal with yeah whole bunch whole bunch that can be pretty heavy to carry up to have 20 of these but um yeah oh 10 and 10 together load I used to have 20 but um useless buggers that I've had working for me over the years of lost them is it expensive a strainer like this I think they're over1 130 bucks or something each now yeah and what annoys me is you know there's two main companies who make wi in this country and they still haven't got them perfect well they're working on it so these are all my scrapes that I just made yeah take back all the [\u00a0__\u00a0] yeah still got either end to clean up but hey yeah that's all good part of a job yeah oh yeah good so just buttoning for this one and it's done well you know this fence is stock proof now but um bons will just trip it off honly know",
