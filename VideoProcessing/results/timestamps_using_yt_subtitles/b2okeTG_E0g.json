  "text": "[Music] we are F we're located in North Indiana about 5 hours from here an hour and half Chicago um we've lived there for about almost five years now so that's where we're at and as said our topic is improving SE production you can see some pictures of our family we do have two young children S three that help us out and also add some challenges and you can just see some pictures of our property there well we we grow about a quarter acre of garlic seed right now and we we are looking to double triple that um I work fulltime off the farm and J kind of runs the farm basically and so uh we just want to share a little bit of our experience and then talk really about the specifics of our production system yeah no that's so I grew up working at King green houses starting at age 12 working there through college so that was the beginning of my farming experience that was all conventional but everything from you know transplanting to retail in that business um I grew up in Maine and ended up in the Midwest and so I grew up a city k and now uh went on to manage a couple Farms um just small scale vegetable production Apprentice on caretaker farm you may have heard of that in Massachusetts I believe it's the second oldest organic farm about 150 200 member PSA went on to Iowa to start a small farm to Port Julie um see if we were right for each other while farming and um then B and I together went on to Victory acres and Upland Indiana down down by m and took a small farm from about 20 csas members to about 12550 we had two houses chick so we've kind of done it all in a lot of different ways and now we're at our current location living a small farm dream and garlic is hopefully a key part of that so another part of our farm is a winter produce program we just started that this past season we buil the hoop house last summer did um just a 7 we CSA through the hoop house pick up at the farm Dan to delivery by his office about half hour away and that was really successful we ended up with a reading list by hand of the season and also requests for more vegetables all the time people saying you know my kids only eat your lettuce Your Spinach so that's great and we're planning on doing another trial um we just started ping and we're hoping so in terms of our specific garlic cart production um we were looking for a cart um with organic hardnet garlic we have to plant by hand because if you go non caret garlic it has to be oriented a certain way otherwise the neck gets bent and people don't want to buy that so um there's yet to be a machine that can do that efficiently um and so we were looking to scale up for tion that could do that for us um and also ease some of the labor fatigue that goes into planting molting those sorts of things um also in terms of looking towards sustainability trying to find a A system that we didn't have to till as much we as vegetable farmers are are guilty of probably over tilling so we're trying to move away from that especially in our really sandy soils low organic matter uh we need to really um work on that so that was kind of one of our goals we were kind of hoping the cart would help us multra straw and Aid in harvesting as well um one of the products we have so far is a review of carts available so this is a 34 page document that's available on the s website that kind of um part of our grant was working with Purdue University so their a engineering department and a couple students that came up to the farm kind of figured out what we needed and it was their job to see what was out there and see if um if they could come up with a better system um something that wasn't commercially available so I'm not I can weld but I'm not a great welder so this was a great opportunity to partner and maybe come up with something today so that document is available so if you're thinking about ways to increase your um comfort level whether you have strawberries or any sort of crop it's a you really useful document so just to give you an idea of what prodction system actually looks like as we think about what kind of kind machine do we want to help us on our so you can see this a picture field that's in October but we're going to start looking at midly so we SC pasture and we spread on field and then first part that's when we do the cover so we brought a broadcast for the cover you can see we oats spring radish and we like disc that that's the beginning of August then month later in October trop strips creat beds and then St BS Fin and add am and then October garlic and this is specifically what we're looking at the cart for this is where we are doing everything by hand and placing each bold to the ground after we've done that you know you're hovering it all back up and mulching it and you can see you from the position there that it gets to be a little bit uncomfortable um then we have the 9 mons [Music] where and early to mid July you also dri irrigation for the water of the garlic um and then July we Harvest and cure so that's the Bas production system we're looking at we'll take questions at the end just because we do have a short amount of time so here some more pictures of us planting so we have these little buckets around our waist to where we need to go and then um here's another picture just again trying to adjust your back so that you you have least amount tension at the end of the day so that's how we currently do our system a lot of hands and knees work which you know over quarter acre that doesn't sound like a lot but try doing that for four days straight really kind of adds up wear and tear on the body so part of the grant was to kind of look at okay where do we really spend a lot of our time um and where can we maximize the use of equipment if we're going to spend money on it how are we going to use that efficiently so one of the things we did is looked at our system and timed it out okay where are we spending our time and if you add it all up planting harvesting and molting is where we are spending 60% of our time and so um and then we also kind of looked at okay what's the most physically hard um actually harvesting and hanging it we spend a lot of time there but that's actually somewhat not leisurely but it's it's more upright work and and it's can kind of be done in different stages so we kind of looked at planting as kind of the big one that we were trying to trying to address so how do we eliminate back bending awkward positions um how do we eliminate unnecessary tillage so this cart's going to be have have to be able to drive through this pretty um heavy cover crop and we'll show you some pictures here and then of course related to that in our Sandy soils you know we have about about 18 hot soil it's all yellow so conserving that moisture is really important to us and then what's a scale appropriate machine for us I'm just going to walk through real quick kind of what the student at Purdue found available options here's a cart you found um and looking further details this cart didn't end up working that well the hand crank broke and couldn't really move along but maybe it has some merits uh this is something that's current exists in the US about $3,500 um but we didn't know you know we're not doing strawberries we're doing Carli could it drive through that type of heavy biomass we weren't sure uh this is another cart that's quite a bit more expensive um you'd have to import it into the US to find it as far as we could tell and then here's kind of the cream of the crop the most ideal cart um kind like a small tank on Wheels but again it's it's pretty expensive so if you had a lot of Acres it might might work um so here's some of the unique features yeah that these unique features of how we do our so we pl we have a tall living cover crop that's really important on our farm to build the soil add those nutrients create iteration garlic not strawberries as you saw some of the carts the right height for the that you're doing uh we need something that's small medium scale appropriate we like said we're only quarter acre we like to you know grow that but this is not a full time thing at this point and then also also something that multitask planting eating harvesting muling um and then finally we want something that can be built on far we a welding shop like just across the street from us um you know you import something and there's mechanical problems this can't always be fixed right commun so that us and yeah and as with most Grant projects you go into these ideal thinking ideal goals um and how it ends up is often very different that that's okay that's part of why um s does these types of funding projects you don't have to necessar accomplish gos all here's a picture of the tall cover CR um these are our two boys here and some years that cover poop can be four feet depending on you know how the fall goes um and and it's it really provides probably 80% of our fertility for our Gar so this is really important that we keep this our Sy here's uh what it looks like I've mowed the strip where our bed is going to be we do two rows of garlic per bed our soils are that PO we can't do it that any more intensively um and then we um Roa till strip Roa till and so you can see this thick mat right here um of cover crop that is going to have to be able to be driven over by some sort of machine if we're plant so here it is a pulse up with our drip tape this is after planting um and here's Julie doing some planting you can see that we have really a lot of uh cover crop for garlic area plant you do that again for our and we're actually moving towards a system where we don't Roa till at all but just deep rip a a row um or a shank on our tractor um so that we don't get so at all and so that's kind of we trying to think through how we plant so here's uh just our farm all 100 with the shank um RI through you kind of see that there we do have some video on our YouTube channel that shows it specifically we won't take time to play that today but it is good so this is what uh the looks like around mid April um May June that's when we start getting thecate which we har and sell or to friends and then um in July we're looking for about a third of the plant round back and then we know it's time to harvest yeah uh so the garlic part here's the actual cart un constructed it's got a canopy here where a tar can be put and then it's a lay down design um and we have you know a place where we can here's actually a better picture some some of the students actually driving it around um and we went through about four engineering students and two professors so turnover was really high um not because the carlet cart is that difficult but that's just the nature of working with with um you know University students so that's something we learned uh I was hoping to be up to about 3/4 acre garlic production by this time but the cart never really got done um which actually turned out to be the best thing because um maybe family structured time wi we wer really ready to go so yeah you had to get an extension which Sarah was gracious to understand um and at this point uh you know the part they're having some trouble with the design um in terms of how the wheels actually swivel when it's going down the road so we're almost there but now it's got a new student new group of students work so it is what it is uh some lessons learn keep it simple I think we tried to put too many things into one cart um maybe a couple versions down the road we could have done that but I think uh maybe should have acknowledged that up front students really wanted to motor think you can do it yeah I know Engineers we found that the review of the current options was really valuable that was part of something available to you to that so that was a great part of this we enough time I mean if you think a Project's going to take two years leave two and a half or three you know this not an Ideal World don't try to do too much we kind of said that um and it's about the process we've really kind of refined our garlic growing process and really thinking about mechanizing why we want to do that valuable for and then just the concept of working with students is great um but there are some limits to that so it goes all right uh any questions we got a couple minutes for questions so anything else question yeah so we have a website where we sell Harden X seed garlic um and then we also do eating Garlic um and so we do eating Garlic for about 50 cents a bulb and then our uh seed goes for about anywhere from to a pound since we're not certified organic we can't charge quite that higher price but that's certainly where certified and customers us you're not charging enough it cost us about 30 cents of linear row put to produce the garlic so we were 50 cents a ball that's pretty good INE but we we should do it more questions yeah well fortunately one of the great things with working with Purdue is that they had the students each have a budget so that like the motor um some of the materials they didn't have to pay for so we did like a 5050 C share on that so that worked I mean that that worked out great so we're about three grand into the project yeah let's say wants to make that right and that's where the students have their final report they'll have their materials list still in yeah excellent question well depending where the students end up with this I'm thinking we might just take them the motor off and pull it with our pH that might be the simplest no they they thought about that but I think the students weren't didn't know enough or weren't didn't have the staff to do that and I don't but yeah I think that's that that's a be aable yep those those are good points yeah yeah and in that 34 page document there's kind of a an assessment of of do we use electric why I not the one were seen okay yeah cover um I want my cover pup to Winter kill because we're not gonna we want it to grow as long as possible and then we Mt sometimes we melt in the fall sometimes we melt in the spring and so I don't I can't come in there with an herbicide to burn it down and I've planted so I can't till it's oats radish and uh Canadian field yeah that we we know we burned through that really quick um any other questions yeah yeah so we the re part of the reason we do two rows um to a bed and then our beds are 36 inches on Center is because of our soil fertility our soils are so poor basically Sands um and the way our cultivating tractor set up that was kind of the easiest the cart was then designed for that um get fourt wide so rle one B at you consider a cover prop you could use a roll spr the question is H have we considered using a a roller crier as a cover crop um yes the problem is Roller crimping um like tyly winter peas um it needs to be flowering um to actually kill it at crimping um and likewise the oats would have to be at drain fill so yeah some something we could consider um Tim didn't yeah it it might if it winter killed but again ripping that narrow shank through we may not even need we're we're actually TR to not touch yeahp good question that are we growing more than one type of garlic yes we have about seven varieties right now we sell four we s Ukraine music um German career and then we have three or four others that we're working on building for are they all generally ones that in early July yeah our some of our um we do like a porcelain lome and uh Asiatic those are kind of three categories our asiatics tend to be ready whichs The Works stra yes a wheat straw um we have quite a bit of pasture that a guy cuss for us and so we stre need to it well we mulch it thick enough so we don't have that's that's our goal but yeah if we do need the weed we are in yeah I I've um done a little bit of experiment we do apply a little bit of nitrogen blood meal because of our sandy soil so I'm starting to try to cut that back a little bit more um and you know we're looking at our soil test we've only been in the spot for four years so we haven't seen am okay so the question is what benefit will a c give us in terms of increase um for right now we don't hire anyone ver and I um and so the the cart will enable us just in my thinking looking at the numbers to double production and still do that also you know few years ago had give back problems to the keep work and you know those are fixed now but we don't want that again so that's time just exactly yeah and our goal is hopefully someday bearm full time just we're taking it slow we're going to do things that are best for ourf well um the question was is the cart used for um I don't think it will be but right now when we Harvest we're able to pull the plants um our soil is so light it's one advantage of um and we pick it right into a wagon pull by a truck so it's that's much more efficient the question was what is your current bu on a quarter acre um so we do uh so garlic plant but we we plant a BAL every six inches so our rows are about 250 ft long and so we have let's just say we had 10 rows so that's 50 that's 2500 5,000 Vols and about probably six 40 to 50% of that is actual marketable seed garlic in terms of size grade and then the rest are that's typically what we found that varies by variety but that's a questions haven't seen years ago when had F yes we do foler feed um hous particularly because inanity soil housing one of the first things to Le out um and so we I do a little fish fertilizer I spray every during the month of end of April through May we found that that makes a difference we business cards if anyone wants for contact information website and a Facebook page and you know glad to take questions and always willing to learn and grow from other people trying to grow garlic in October uh we do pre-sales we let our you know our customers know in June and then they pre-order and it goes really fast so that's why we will be uper numbers you like to move into restaurants and grocery stores to thank Sarah yeah [Applause] [Music]",
