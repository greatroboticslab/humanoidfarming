  "text": "three hundred thousand tons of steel a day 1,000 cars an hour food for 100 million people half the largest cities in America trade center of the nation more universities more freshwater ways more industry more agriculture than any other region in the world this is the Midwest heartland of the nation from the Mesabi Range in Minnesota to the cold fields of Kentucky from the steel mills of Pittsburgh to the wheat fields of Nebraska these of a long horizons of the Midwest most of the world's population and wealth is found in regions near the sea why is America's Midwest an exception to this general rule to examine the wealth of this region we must first look at its land thousands of years ago it was leveled by glacial ice the vegetation which followed the ice left most of the land with a rich soil ideal for agriculture now the Midwest has a rich dairy belt in the north to supply milk for the cities of the region and cheese and butter for export to other regions the southern portion of the heartland is well-suited to general farming but across the middle of the region lies the most important agricultural area in the nation the Corn Belt and it is here in the Midwestern Corn Belt that our story begins with a man who has seen remarkable changes over the last half century when I came here 50 years ago 60 bushels to the acre was considered a high yield today in comparison 180 bushes is a high yield mr. Charles Gunn an Midwestern scientist who has devoted his life to improving the corn plant 85% of the corn grown approximately is fed to livestock the Midwest handles more beef and more hogs than any other region in the nation this morning John Piggott a progressive Illinois farmer he's shipping some of his animals to mark good highways and the modern truck have changed the farmers method of getting products to market this slaughterhouse 40 miles from the farm is the destination of mr. Pickett's beef when John was a young boy almost all beef was sent by rail to the large packing houses of Chicago now the packing houses have moved out of the city we still just been out here about four years now and it is a convenience just ship over here we still have to sell we can get the best price we'll sell the Swift we'll sell an Armour which is over here at Sterling which is 60 miles away which is about the same distance of Chicago but we just have to sell the demand at all that'll give us the most money for the cattle that's about the only way we determine who we're gonna sell to Midwest farmers are so productive that overproduction and the tougher market competition have become serious problems our big problem is that we don't really have much bargaining power when we go buy our cattle we have to buy them at the price that the man wants to sell on that if we can buy them a little cheaper we try to but basically speaking we have we give his price and when we turn around to sell our product we take the price again that they'll give us and we're one of the few people that do this we don't have enough bargaining power we're going to have to organize as producers and get in a bargaining position with these chain stores and the people that are gonna consume our meat today the market was good but next month prices may drop this is the problem facing every farmer in America every time he buys for the future we usually buy in the south southwest majority I cannot come from Texas my father and I or either maybe just one of us will go down there at least once a year and look at these cattle and usually buying them we may not buy them the day we see him we not may not buy him till two or three months later over the phone hello John Piggott a decal oh yeah just fine say we're looking for some campers weighing approximately five six hundred pounds you have those heifers that you spoke about earlier uh-huh those are Hereford heifers what what's the price you're asking for those cattle now that's a little bit higher than we want to pay our market isn't that good well we better buy him around twenty four and a half cents at the highest laid into us here at home that's right well we'll we'll bid you twenty four and a half cents a pound on those Hereford heifers if you want to deliver them to the cow when one could we get those cattle side 180 to 200 days that they'll double their money which of course isn't all profit about 75% of that doubling money we're talking about will be feed cost we would consider this a fair return the midwest has become the meat tenderizer to the nation because of the corn that it feeds the livestock mr. Pickett's farm produces two and one-half times as much as it did 30 years ago for the equipment necessary for this increased production in 1903 John Pickett's grandfather and Irish immigrants began a dairy operation on this land the farm has remained in the family through two world wars and a Great Depression again there are new faces on the farm my father's been in the cattle business a good number of years and I always did enjoy wanted to be in it and as far as raising a family there's just no place to raise a family like in the country and it's a good life there's no question about it John's brothers have not gone on to farming and throughout the Midwest and the nation the farm population is just half what it was a generation ago when these children grow up they will face an unusual situation constantly rising productivity in the face of serious farm problems poor marketing methods high cost of machines and labor rising land values and taxes these are the problems which face the children of the world's most productive land but farming is only half the story of the Midwest for the land which provided the agricultural opportunities also gave us the beginnings of a great industrial boom in 1837 and Midwestern er John Deere began to develop steel plows to work the Midwestern soil a few years later Cyrus McCormick began making reapers in Chicago to be near his farm customers now almost every need of the consumer is provided by Midwestern industry the rich topsoil may have attracted the farmer but in the lower layers of earth industry found the energy to run its machines energy in the form of coal [Music] now almost half the nation's energy comes from the Midwest in cadiz Ohio a large-scale strip mining operation provides coal to energy users in the heartland and neighboring regions the potential power from the earth had to be matched by an energetic people I am Craig Robert I have been working for the company approximately 26 years I started as a ditch digger run tractor and oiled and finally worked myself into the position I am in now [Music] machine is operated by two hand controls and two foot controls this is a hundred and five cubic yards which would be equal to two railroad cars of material [Music] half the coal has been exposed a small 9 cubic yard machine will come in and take the coal and load it in two hundred and twenty ten trucks and the trucks will transport it approximate two miles to our cleaning plant to be worse size and dry and put on the railroad car to the customer most of our shipping goes north michigan's our biggest customer [Music] from southeastern Ohio the coal is sent across the states into Indiana and up to Michigan what industry needs materials to work and the energy resources of the Midwest are matched by large mineral deposits just below the surface of the earth in Minnesota lies the country's most important deposit of iron ore because of its ease of mining and nearness to the Great Lakes the Mesabi Range has been important to the success story of industry in the Midwest or is easily shipped to steel mills on the Great Lakes which supply steel to the nation from Indiana Illinois Ohio Pennsylvania and Michigan here in Detroit raw ore arrives at a typical steel mill the Great Lakes freeze up during the winter and are only safe for navigation seven or eight months out of the year therefore during the shipping season large quantities of ore our stockpile at the steel mill to feed the furnaces that will operate every day of the year [Music] steal for refrigerators and toasters steal for lawn mowers and flowers steal for safety pins and nails steel to be sent out all over the nation and the world but the most important single steel user in the Midwest as well as the nation is the auto industry the physical birth of every car is here in the infernal Heat of the blasters one out of every five pounds of steel made in America goes into an automobile and the pattern of producing automobiles is typical of much Midwest industries [Music] [Applause] from the mill in Michigan rolls of Steel are sent south to the town of Twinsburg Ohio only a few trucking hours away by modern roads here the metal for our car begins to take a more familiar shape the drug has a force of a thousand ton on the punch in approximately 700 done on the outer ring which holds the blank it running rate is approximately 430 an hour I've been here at about 10 and a half years by trade on the tool and die maker I've been working with automation for quite a few years they're shipped throughout the country anywhere from Delaware to Los Detroit st. Louis del retiro Illinois although auto assembly plants have been built throughout the country in recent years most are located within the Midwest and Detroit is still uncontested as the auto capital of the world and it is here that our car will be assembled from parts manufactured throughout the Midwest parts like the engine carved out of cast-iron in Trenton Michigan on machines made in the Midwest [Music] in Jackson Michigan the tires are vulcanized out of materials shipped in the Midwest from all over the world while the heavy products of a car are produced near the factory the more delicate and expensive instruments can be made wherever labor is available so it is the Delavan a small town in southern Wisconsin we'll make the clock for our car [Music] [Applause] [Applause] the Midwest has hundreds of light industry towns that subcontract for the large manufacturing centers of the heartland and the nation and so our car is shipped in pieces to the assembly plant in Detroit some 15,000 parts in all are needed for a typical American automobile probably wondering what these computers have to do with building cars well when you go to your dealer and order a car with particular equipment like white walls a clock and a radio and a heater that order is punched into cards that look like this we receive these cards and run them through this machine this tells the people out in the plant behind me here what to put on the car and when to put it on our car will be assembled in less than half a day this plant turns out a car every 60 seconds [Music] [Music] the technology that built the car has brought us wealth and fantastic urban expansion but sometimes centralization conflicts with the prosperity we've earned now more than a quarter of the nation's population lives in the Midwest most of the population growth has taken place in the cities because of the advantages afforded by urban living its wealth of goods and services [Music] it's cultural opportunities it's trade centers like this one in Chicago where the law requires voice bidding on farm commodities [Applause] the wealth of the city allows it to support excellence in spectator sports [Applause] but the concentration of people compounds the problems of human engineering [Music] and do mr. Jones in reply to your letter of the 14th I would like to say that our board of directors dear mr. Johnson we were very happy to see her concerning rates for regularly-scheduled with the enormous wealth that industrialization has brought us we have inherited the monumental problems of poverty [Music] these are the problems only people can solve people like the farmer coal miner machinist the painter the engine builder the auto assembler the office workers these are the people who face the challenges of the Midwest",
