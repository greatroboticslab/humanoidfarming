  "text": "[Music] hi my name's Allen Pattillo I'm your fisheries and aquaculture extension specialist at Iowa State University I'm here to talk to you today about citing and building a quality pond as you can see here we're in a watershed this is the future site of a pond and some things that you need to consider whenever building your pond is the amount of soil that you're gonna have to move because that's the major expense component of building upon as well as the volume of water that you want to try to hold in there now we recommend that your ponds be at least eight feet deep 15 feets probably better this is to prevent winter kills you're going to want to make sure that your your dam is gonna have a lot of good clay in there very little sand so that it can packs very well and holds water you're also going to want to check out the watershed and find natural pinch points so right here we have three ridges coming together and we're gonna take the shortest distance across there to hold the most water for the least amount of soil moved other things that you want to take into consideration is what's in your watershed so as you can see here we're in a prairie this is going to do a really good job of stopping soil sediments from coming in as well as reducing nutrient loads so you don't have the aquatic plant problems another thing you want to consider is the construction the shape of that dam so you want to have a three to one slope in other words for every one foot of rise you want to have three foot of run that's going to establish some aquatic plants on the edge but by the time you get about ten feet offshore you're gonna be at a depth where you're low enough to where you're not promoting aquatic plants to grow other things you can see here we have trees in the watershed and we can cut those trees off and create really good fish habitat and that's gonna congregate those fish in that area so other questions that you might have you can contact me again my name is Allen Pattillo I'm your fisheries and aquaculture extension specialist thanks and good luck out there",
