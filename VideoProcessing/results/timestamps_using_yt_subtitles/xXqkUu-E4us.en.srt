2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,680
In Australia, forestry is a major

3
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:30,480
industry and we occupy about 125 million

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,880
hectares all up and 16% of our Our land

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,360
mass area in Australia is forest or

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,600
plantation. Most states of Australia

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,840
have a major forestry hub situated

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,079
within them. At Green Triangle Forest

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,320
Products, we manage about 25,000

10
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,480
hectares of pine plantations in the

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,559
Green Triangle region of Australia. The

12
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,559
Green Triangle region is in the

13
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,280
southeastern part of South Australia and

14
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,079
the southwestern part of Victoria. Now,

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,719
in forestry, we're not unlike any other

16
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,359
farmer you that may farm cows or may

17
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,280
farm sheep. Here, we farm trees. And

18
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,040
when those trees grow to maturity, we

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,159
harvest them. We cut them and process

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,320
them into logs or chips. And uh and

21
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,400
that's our commodity. What's different

22
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,439
about us though is that we manage our

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,439
trees over a much longer term than a

24
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,560
farmer would usually manage a cow or a

25
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,520
sheep. Some of our rotations last for 35

26
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,960
or even 40 years. Basic cycle in

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,080
plantation forestry is site preparation,

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,520
planting, weed control, forest

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,799
management, and then harvesting.

30
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,640
We in pine will thin our trees two to

31
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,360
three times before we clear for them

32
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,840
when they're 35 to 40 years of age. It's

33
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,479
actually a very high technology process

34
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,200
where we have equipment mainly imported

35
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,439
from Europe and that will cut down a

36
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,680
tree that may take 40 years to grow in

37
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,360
less than a minute and process it. And

38
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,759
this is what we call a mechanical

39
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,880
harvester. Not every mill produces the

40
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,280
same product. They will mill a very

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,840
specific kind of log and they will

42
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,000
produce a very specific kind of product.

43
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,680
Generally the higher value products like

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,239
our saw log is processed domestically.

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,360
Products that we don't process locally

46
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,640
we export overseas. So things like uh

47
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,879
pulp, wood chips and other small low

48
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,440
value logs we will export to other

49
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,440
countries that have the processing

50
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,239
facilities there to manufacture other

51
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,319
products. Some companies in forestry are

52
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,640
so large that they have processing

53
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,879
facilities the world over and that's

54
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,640
good for them because what they can do

55
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,640
is they can share their inputs.

56
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,080
Kimberly Clark is a global company that

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,800
produces health and hygiene products um

58
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,920
such as toilet paper uh facial tissue,

59
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,760
kitchen towel, um diapers. Um here in

60
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,680
Australia we produce tissue and this

61
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,440
mill produces all of the tissue for

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,519
Australia and New Zealand. The tissue

63
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,599
that we produce here uses a range of

64
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,599
fibers. And we import pulp from New

65
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,920
Zealand and we import pulp from South

66
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,159
America and we import pulp from North

67
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,319
America. And the the different fiber

68
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,400
types provide different characteristics

69
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,720
in the products that we produce. It

70
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,879
comes in bales which you'll see and

71
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,120
comes in on a truck and then they go

72
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,000
into what we call a hydropula where the

73
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,720
pulp is mixed up with water and then

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,280
from the hydropula it goes to a tissue

75
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,959
machine where it's made into tissue and

76
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,360
rolled up and folded into the products

77
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,239
that you you'll see around us. Well, out

78
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,440
of this mill we produce around 80,000

79
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:41,280
tons of tissue a year. That equates to

80
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:45,280
around 26 B trucks of product leave here

81
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,440
every day. We look to recover and

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,680
recycle anything that is a waste from

83
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,120
this mill. Uh currently we've been

84
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,040
successful in recycling 96% of our waste

85
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,360
from this mill so that it doesn't go

86
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,280
into landfill. So only 4% of our waste

87
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,599
from the mill goes to landfill. We have

88
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,920
a lot of technology on the mill which

89
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,920
requires a broad base of skills to

90
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,200
operate it. We have mechanical

91
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,439
engineers, we have electrical engineers,

92
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,280
we have a lot of traded people, we have

93
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,760
automated guided vehicles behind us,

94
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,759
which until recently that job would have

95
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,160
been done by someone on a fork truck.

96
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,199
But we also have accountants and we have

97
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,280
various other people in staff roles and

98
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,680
highly trained and highly skilled

99
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,720
operators that operate the plant 24

100
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,919
hours a day. So there's an amazing range

101
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,479
of skills and job roles in this mill for

102
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,240
it to operate. It's really hard to uh

103
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,160
imagine when you look around here and

104
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,560
you see all the plastic and you see all

105
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,759
the products and the people around us to

106
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,430
know that none of this would have

107
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:50,589
happened without a Great.

108
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,589

109
