1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,040
guys country I mean I Jason for example

2
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:08,080
has a little farming operation you know

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,480
he has one field that's 1600 Acres they

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,080
don't they don't make many corners wow

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,280
the canola is still really big uh that

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,920
kind of thing uh it depends on where

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,439
you're at they got a little dry at the

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,600
end and it really affected the canola

9
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:22,279
crop but at the same time if you go to

10
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,439
Tisdale Canada it reminded me a lot of

11
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:26,560
Oaks North Dakota you know a lot of

12
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,439
still Square it's funny in Saskatchewan

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,320
they still talk about miles and they

14
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,360
still talk about Acres sh don't tell

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,760
anybody they do yeah oh yeah yeah and uh

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,239
they still got to you know follow the

17
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,280
street signs and all that kind of thing

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,520
but you know everything's laid out very

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,399
similar to North Dakota um they they

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,960
don't do as much tiling as they do

21
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,000
around here they haven't got that far

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,199
yet and you know very little row crop

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,640
there's a few areas of soybeans it's

24
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:52,680
just you know just that much farther

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,199
north and it gets a little colder there

26
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,199
yeah
