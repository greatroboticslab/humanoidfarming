1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,439
Now, I just want to show you my

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,520
strawberry patch because if you guys

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,839
have followed me or if you've actually

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,840
come to me because you saw my strawberry

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:15,120
planting video, then you'll know that we

6
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,359
planted these strawberries uh about 3

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,840
months ago and they are doing

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,000
wonderfully. So, as you can see, these

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,560
strawberries are doing quite well. You

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,720
can see all these beautiful, beautiful

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,199
strawberries right there. You can see

12
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,880
all these wonderful runners here and

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,559
even the unripe strawberries right

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,879
there. And these guys are loving life.

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,559
These guys are producing well. They are

16
00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:45,520
happy and they are busting at the seams

17
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:47,039
here with all the produce.

18
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,000
Now, if your strawberries are not

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,440
looking like mine here, there's a couple

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,960
of things that you can do that are going

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,399
to perk them up that's going to make

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,160
them produce better and going to make

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,359
them grow the most luxurious

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,520
strawberries you've ever had, the

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,559
sweetest strawberries you ever had. Now,

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,960
the first thing we're going to do to

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:09,680
help our strawberries out is we are

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,520
going to fertilize. Now, right over here

29
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,479
is the video on where I planted these

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,200
strawberries, the fertilizer I used and

31
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,640
why we did that. Because strawberries

32
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,320
are a very finicky kind of plant. They

33
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:28,400
really like to have a lower pH soil and

34
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,840
they will suffer if they don't. So,

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,400
we're going to add that fertilizer in

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,799
there that's got those components that

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,880
lower that pH, and that's going to help

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,799
them grow big, nice, firm, juicy

39
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,840
strawberries and is going to help your

40
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,960
plants look like

41
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:47,280
these. The other thing is is

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,560
strawberries like to have a very, very

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,439
loose, lomy soil, and they don't like

44
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,799
wet feet. Just like a tomato, they want

45
00:01:53,439 --> 00:02:00,439
that soil to drain away fast, but they

46
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,960
still want to have moist soil, not wet

47
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:05,119
soil.

48
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,200
So, in order to take care of that, I

49
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,399
have added straw.

50
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,000
Now, the straw is going to help keep the

51
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:18,560
moisture into the soil, but it's also

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,959
going to allow that soil to drain and

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,800
kind of maintain that that kind of happy

54
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,599
medium, which is going to help these

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,239
plants grow and do well. Now, the first

56
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,760
problem we run into is especially with

57
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,160
straw is most of the straw you're going

58
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,319
to buy is going to have seed in it. I've

59
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,560
kind of found a way that we can keep the

60
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,200
straw but actually separate out the

61
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,280
seed. And what I found is is if you take

62
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,319
a five gallallon bucket or actually I

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,400
used a large like almost like a big wash

64
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:53,120
tub, you take that straw and actually

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,480
for for this because I knew I had a

66
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,879
bunch of plants that I needed to fit

67
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,840
that that straw in around. I didn't want

68
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,560
these super long pieces of straw. I

69
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,800
actually cut it up and then washed it in

70
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,200
that bucket. Got about a half a bucket

71
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,480
of water, put that straw into it that I

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,159
chopped up and moved it around to

73
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,040
release those seeds and make them fall

74
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,159
to the bottom. Then I pulled, you know,

75
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:21,159
I took handfuls out as I was washing it

76
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,040
and then placed it in my beds around my

77
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:25,760
strawberries. And I'm going to tell you

78
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,360
that it worked wonderful. But I will

79
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,879
tell you when you pour that water out,

80
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,840
pay attention where you pour it out at

81
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,159
because there's going to be a lot of

82
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,799
seeds in the bottom of it. The other

83
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,360
thing that helps is as you're washing

84
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,360
this straw, that straw is picking up

85
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,440
water and it's going to retain that

86
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,760
water. So when you put it down now,

87
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:48,480
you've got a moist layer of straw on top

88
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,480
of your of your bed and it is going to

89
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,120
start leeching moisture down into the

90
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,720
bed, but it's not going to get it to

91
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,200
where it's actually wet and it's going

92
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,560
to be harmful to these plants. Now,

93
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,360
dealing with straw and covering our beds

94
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,000
or even if you're using

95
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,439
mulch, we run into a a sort of an issue

96
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,120
with the fact of we have

97
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:13,120
runners. Now, with runners, runners are

98
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,599
a wonderful thing. These are where our

99
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,639
strawberry plants actually send out long

100
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,959
leads. And wherever that long lead will

101
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,040
touch the ground, it will actually set

102
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,840
down roots and create a whole another

103
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,880
strawberry plant, which is wonderful for

104
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,040
you guys who have a whole bed and you

105
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,160
have room in between those strawberries

106
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,639
and so forth. But for guys like me and

107
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,720
I've got this I mean really I've got it

108
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,600
over full of these strawberries that

109
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,479
whenever you have these leaders going

110
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,080
out. You don't necessarily want them

111
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,520
here. So a technique that I've come up

112
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,320
with and something that I think is going

113
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,280
to help a lot of you if you don't have

114
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,880
room in your beds or if you've got straw

115
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,600
which is going to keep those runners

116
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,320
from contacting the ground. Here's

117
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,400
something you can do in order to save

118
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,800
your runners and be able to move them

119
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,919
somewhere else or it will allow you to

120
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,000
transplant those into your bed, but

121
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,520
maybe not where the plant wants to put

122
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,600
them down. So, what we're going to do

123
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,320
is we are actually going to take a

124
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,280
little 4x4

125
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:28,160
pot of soil and we're going to set this

126
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,759
in our bed.

127
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,759
And what that's going to allow us to do

128
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,000
is

129
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:35,759
take these runners like this. We can

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,160
bring them over to where that that

131
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,000
runner is and see right here where it

132
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,160
makes this little bend. That's where

133
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,600
it's going to send out a root. And all

134
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,360
we've got to do is give that thing a

135
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,960
little

136
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:50,160
shove and cover it with a little bit of

137
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,479
soil. We have to move it over here

138
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,280
because unfortunately this leader is

139
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,840
going to go where it wants to

140
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:00,199
go and you're going to bury it.

141
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,960
That is all you're going to

142
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:07,319
do. Now, as you can see, I've already

143
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:10,639
got some here that are down in there and

144
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:13,080
are trying to make roots. Now, as you

145
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,759
can see, this one is actually continuing

146
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,199
on. Well, I don't want this to continue

147
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,240
on. I want it to stop. So, what I'm

148
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,600
going to do is I'm going to pinch that

149
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,680
off, and I'm going to stop that runner

150
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,800
from continuing on. And this is going to

151
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:29,280
be the end of it. And so whenever this

152
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,160
actually takes root, you'll start to see

153
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,240
this start to die

154
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,000
back. Once this dies back, we can clip

155
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,000
this

156
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,400
off. We can take that plant out and we

157
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,840
can put that wherever we want.

158
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,000
Strawberries are what I like to call a

159
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,919
family and friends plant. And that means

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,160
that number one, if you plant them and

161
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,240
you give them the nutrition and they are

162
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,600
happy plants, they're going to do two

163
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,720
things. They're going to give you enough

164
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,960
strawberries that you're going to be

165
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,080
able to share with your family and

166
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,280
friends. And number two, they're going

167
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,280
to send out enough runners to where

168
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,240
you're going to have enough extra plants

169
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,680
to give to family and

170
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:08,240
friends. And you might even have enough

171
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:11,680
that if you want to, you can sort of. So

172
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,400
these plant are going to give back what

173
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,080
you put into them. If you give them love

174
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,280
and care and all the nutrition they

175
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,919
want, they will reward you with fruit

176
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,759
and with new

177
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:25,639
plants. Now, keep in mind, these new

178
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:29,520
plants that are being

179
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:31,840
made are the replacements for the other

180
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,039
plants that are going to stop producing

181
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,319
and slow down and are going to die

182
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:39,280
eventually because strawberries have a

183
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,360
very limited lifespan. And you need

184
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,440
those new plants in order to replace the

185
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,800
older plants. going to stop producing.

186
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,240
So, we need to keep that in mind

187
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,759
whenever we're, you know, maybe we're uh

188
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,599
getting our pots and we're getting these

189
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,560
other runners that we're we're making

190
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,759
into plants and we're giving those

191
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,319
away. You might want to hold back a

192
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,560
couple for yourself so that in a in a

193
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,039
few years or in maybe the next year if

194
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,039
you've had them in the ground quite a

195
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:06,479
while that you can start replacing those

196
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,960
plants that are not making fruit

197
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,400
anymore. Now, another care tip that I

198
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:16,560
can give you guys is strawberry plants

199
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:19,599
are going to have leaves that die off.

200
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,720
Here's a perfect example. That leaf down

201
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,960
there had died off. Here's another one

202
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,479
that has died

203
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:31,440
off. And the reason that that's going to

204
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:34,719
happen is because you are going to have

205
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,399
these plants are going to get huge.

206
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,240
They're going to go get a lot of green

207
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:43,599
on top of them and some of the

208
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,600
under some of the the leaves that are

209
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,720
under the

210
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:51,320
plant are going to

211
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:54,880
die. Now, typically

212
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,600
this is going to provide a natural mulch

213
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,200
for your

214
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,560
strawberries. But if you have mulch or

215
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,519
straw or hay underneath these

216
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,920
strawberries, you don't necessarily need

217
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,959
that natural mulch. You can leave them

218
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,600
there. It's not going to hurt

219
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:15,279
anything. But if you, you know, you

220
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,800
don't want to look at it, it's not going

221
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,440
to hurt to pull those off.

222
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,480
and get rid of

223
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,279
them. You just kind of give them a nice

224
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,120
little tug and they come off. Now, I

225
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,320
will say that some people told me that I

226
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,880
should never plant this many

227
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,839
strawberries in one

228
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,320
bed. And you know, that may be right for

229
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,640
some people, but I live down here in

230
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,000
Texas to where it's extremely hot most

231
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:44,720
of the time. And if you plant your

232
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,720
strawberries this way, you have to be

233
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,560
kind of mindful of where you live at

234
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:53,120
because of if these are in an area to

235
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,880
where it is you have a lot of moisture

236
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,519
in in the air that is not going to dry

237
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,440
off quickly, you can deal with wilt and

238
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,000
mold and mildew and those kinds of

239
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,920
things on your strawberry plants. You'll

240
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,680
get gray mold on your strawberries,

241
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,640
things like that.

242
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:13,560
But down here in Texas to where we're in

243
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:16,480
I mean we're already in the 80s in April

244
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:18,640
and these the moisture on these plants

245
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,320
is going to dry very very quickly. It's

246
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,440
not going to stick around. There's not

247
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,880
going to be enough of a a chance for any

248
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,480
kind of mold or wilt to set in. So me

249
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,320
planting them this close together means

250
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:34,320
that I maximize my space to get more

251
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,880
strawberries out of a smaller space. And

252
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,000
frankly, I had the plants, so I didn't

253
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,800
want to, you know, I wanted to plant as

254
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,120
many as I could in order to have the

255
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,640
most production that I could get.

256
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,440
There's plenty of nutrition in the bed

257
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,680
to carry these things over. I put the

258
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,680
straw down to help retain the moisture.

259
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,240
And as you can see, these plants are not

260
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,600
suffering by any means. Now, if you look

261
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,519
at the planting instructions whenever

262
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,320
you get them, they're going to tell you

263
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,839
to plant them about a foot apart. And

264
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,760
the rows need to be about a foot and a

265
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,320
half apart that you need to heal them

266
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,800
and all these other things. And yes,

267
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,120
that is a perfectly good description of

268
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,959
how commercial farmers and commercial

269
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,440
growers grow these plants because they

270
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,880
need to have room in between these rows

271
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,480
to get people down through

272
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:28,560
there in order to pick them. And also,

273
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,160
they won't want them so close together

274
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,519
that they have to hunt and find for

275
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,880
strawberries. They want them to be right

276
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,320
out in the open. Now, this the way these

277
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,720
are planted is kind of like a treasure

278
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,399
hunt. Every day I come out here, I sift

279
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,560
through and I push all the plants out of

280
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,880
the way and look at everything because

281
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,399
I'm hunting for strawberries. Now, a lot

282
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,600
of times I've kind of scoped them out. I

283
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,839
know where they're at. But I can do that

284
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,320
because I'm a small home gardener. I'm

285
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,279
dealing with, you know, 40, 50 plants

286
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,000
here at most. And I can just go through

287
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:02,399
and pick them out. No big deal. I'm not

288
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,640
worried about time production and I'm

289
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,680
not I'm not looking at efficiency

290
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,440
whenever it comes to picking

291
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,680
strawberries. So, if you have a

292
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,040
different idea or a different reason why

293
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,120
you think that these plants are supposed

294
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,120
to be spaced that far apart, put it down

295
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,920
in the comments. Let me know. School me,

296
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,200
educate me. I may be a gardener who's

297
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,440
been doing it for years, but I don't

298
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,240
know absolutely everything. And I am

299
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,560
always willing to listen to and have

300
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,560
someone tell me something that they I

301
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,160
might not know already. So, hope you

302
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,200
found these tips and this information

303
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:35,920
very, very helpful to help you you grow

304
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,880
bigger and better strawberries. And if

305
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,760
