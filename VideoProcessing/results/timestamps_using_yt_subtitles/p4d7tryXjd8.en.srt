00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:13,519
thank you

2
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:41,219
agriculture is the main source of

3
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:44,160
livelihood for 95 percent of the rural

4
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,860
households in Lao PDR

5
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,680
almost 80 percent of this cropped area

6
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:53,520
is dedicated to growing rice

7
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,559
rice is life for the people of Laos who

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,440
have been planting and nurturing their

9
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,719
rice fields for hundreds of years

10
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,660
but the land doesn't always give back

11
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,119
what this farmers put in and with a

12
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,960
country whose birth rate is the highest

13
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:12,840
in the region at 2.5 percent increasing

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,180
rice production to feed their country is

15
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,960
a high priority

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,759
in the southern province of Savannah cat

17
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,159
Farmers fields are continually at the

18
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,040
mercy of drought and flooding

19
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,500
unknown to some there is a field here

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,540
which has been privy to a specially bred

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,960
Lao modern variety or lmv rice plant

22
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,960
s

23
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,479
Village is just one of the many

24
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,960
communities which have been part of the

25
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:03,659
Lao Erie research and training project a

26
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,479
partnership between the Lao PDR Ministry

27
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,360
of Agriculture and Forestry and the

28
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,480
international rice Research Institute or

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,540
Erie this collaborative project was

30
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,540
established in 1990 to assist the

31
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,819
government of Lao PDR to achieve their

32
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:25,020
National goal of rice self-sufficiency

33
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:27,480
on a sustainable basis and for more than

34
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,540
a decade of this 15-year partnership

35
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,840
with Erie the Lao people have been

36
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,840
celebrating rice self-sufficiency

37
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,840
and

38
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,900
um

39
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,900
for Laos rice makes up 70 of their daily

40
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:56,900
calorie requirements

41
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,580
when loud people speak of achieving food

42
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,440
self-sufficiency they mean having enough

43
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,300
rice to eat

44
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,480
a new technology for the right

45
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:16,140
production is based on the new varieties

46
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,560
new acronym aspect and also increasing

47
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,560
the year

48
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:33,900
the feedback from the farm are very

49
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,480
important because we we keep the sea to

50
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,900
the family after that we we get the

51
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:44,099
information from them from 1997 the the

52
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:46,260
first variety and the farmer grow this

53
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:49,260
variety and get the high yielding

54
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,260
injections

55
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,180
foreign

56
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,299
over the course of the project 18 new

57
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,420
varieties were released they have been

58
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:18,120
so successful that three-quarters of the

59
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,239
households using Lao modern varieties

60
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,940
were self-sufficient or had a surplus in

61
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:26,880
rice while 64 percent of the farmers

62
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,080
planting traditional varieties were rice

63
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,720
deficient

64
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,979
these are high yielding moderate

65
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,979
duration rice varieties which have Eerie

66
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:40,620
parentage these rice varieties would not

67
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:44,220
be there today if it were not for the

68
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:49,080
training and the assistance of the

69
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:54,440
lawyeri project major achievement is

70
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:58,440
here in this Jin Bank we keep 13

71
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:58,440
193 uh

72
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:07,620
varieties we have to preserve this for

73
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:11,759
the sustainable used by the researcher

74
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:14,820
and Farmers to train people to identify

75
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,160
and characterize those accessions and to

76
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,919
use them in a breeding program

77
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,380
below Eerie project has also supported

78
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,479
the establishment of a training center

79
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:27,419
out at the agricultural Research Center

80
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,500
at a village called Nepal I think the

81
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:34,740
training is very useful I have learned

82
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:39,240
English writing report how to collect

83
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:42,000
rice for research in the cold room the

84
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,340
main thing before going further to

85
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,880
disseminate our technology to the farmer

86
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:51,840
first we train our participants we train

87
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,840
our staff is

88
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,620
foreign

89
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,660
National right self-sufficiency since

90
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:16,380
1999. the rice sufficiency of the poor

91
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:18,500
is estimated to be only 6.8 months in a

92
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,500
year

93
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,880
foreign

94
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,280
foreign

95
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:45,960
environment of Laos Farmers rice fields

96
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,479
slope across the faces of the

97
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,880
Mountainside creating more challenges

98
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,419
for researchers and the farming

99
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,419
communities

100
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,139
thank you
