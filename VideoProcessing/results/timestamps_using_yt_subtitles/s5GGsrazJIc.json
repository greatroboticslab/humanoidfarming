  "text": "hello this is um an additional presentation um to understand how to make and reproduce imo or indigenous microorganisms so what are indigenous microorganisms they are microorganisms that have been adapting and evolving in the native soil for a very long time before we even came here so it's all about it's the diversity and the life that lives in the soil and connects the trees under the soil for them to share nutrients and communicate so there are mainly while there's many and probably many that we don't even know about but there are fungi bacteria and yeasts within these ones they kind of some of them look like this in the piece of bark that i'm showing and the the important thing here is that the more beneficial biodiversity we have in the soil the less chance for non-beneficial microbes to reproduce they also will add a big um web like an extension on the roots of trees so that they can be more drought tolerant and and we can boost their immune systems and and resilience to this ecosystem that we are if we harvest them here um so that our our crops and plants can grow a lot better so where to harvest indigenous microorganisms so the best shot would be in nearby forests that you can go into a functional ecosystem close by hopefully that you have access to that the closest the better so that um you can go and find them there so it's gonna be an expedition for sure it's gonna be a nice way to connect in the nature so you want to find something that looks like a mycorrhizal something like looks something like the picture i showed you in the bark they they normally appear in leaves like this white webs barks um pieces of wood of course it has to be a healthy soil full of mulch that if you remove a little bit of the leaves there you'll find kind of like a white dish presence there in the soil that's the fungi that's the that's the mycelium that you're looking for a quick recommendation is that you shouldn't harvest in a rainy season you should at least wait for two days with no rain so that you can harvest the imo so the benefits of imo indigenous microorganisms is that their drought tolerance they have adapted to this place so they will benefit your plants to be more drought tolerant this is a picture of how they look like this is a picture of when we already have reproduced them but that you can understand how is it that they look like this kind of white web in the soil they also boost the immune system as we said so these filaments they add to plant roots and they increase the ability to get more nutrients in water so the imo there's many steps on how to make imo so to start with the imo one the first process is that um you cook some rice i normally make one kilo of rice but you can make as much as you want [Music] and that will depend on the size of your natural container i'll show a picture of that but you want a natural container like like a wooden box um that is not plastic however if you're reusing plastic i guess it's okay as long as it can breathe that you can have um some holes underneath that on the sides for the biology to grow so um it can be a canasta also something that breeds that is made from palm leaves or natural material is most convenient so what you're gonna do is the cooked rice you're gonna put it in your container and then you're gonna cover it with a paper cloth on top so um you're gonna take this container full of rice and you're gonna full of cooked rice you're gonna go and bury it where you have found that fungi and those branches so um if you can you can dig a small hole and you place your container there and i would recommend put some of the branches full of the fungi on top of the paper cloth never in there never in the rice so what what's going to happen is that the biology that lives in the soil is going to travel through the paper cloth and through the holes of the box and it's going to go and reproduce in the carbohydrate in this case it's the rice so you're going to leave it for five days without getting wet that's very important um make sure that it's in a dry spot and in case that it rains or it's a rainy uh area maybe you want to cover it a little bit so that there's no rain on it so what's going to happen is that the biology is going to it's going to reproduce in that carbohydrate and it's going to heat up and then you're going to have a big big colony in that rice so that would be imo 1 to harvest them and after five days it's gonna look something like this where this webby stuff is reproducing it is important not to add organic matter in the rice that was my first mistake and then it was very difficult to get rid of that you just want the pure rice with the ecology with the biology so avoid doing that adding the leaves and stuff in the rice the biology will spread in in any ways in the carbohydrate so it should smell nice and fresh if there's a smelly odor i would dispose it i would throw it in your compost but it should smell very nice very fresh like the forest and then once you have your rice full of the biology i would say that you live just one hour until you start doing imo too so you want to to harvest it when it's full of life and you don't want to take too long because it can heat up way too much and you can lose part of the biology so with ny hour one hour we moved to imo 2. and basically imo 2 is mix the equal amount of that rice full of fungi with brown sugar that's the only thing you have to do so the sugar will absorb the available water that is still in the rice and it's gonna make it not available anymore so they that the the biology go into a dormant state and they release some spores and this way you can store imo from the forest for a very long period of time as you can see i have many samples that i have taken in different forests that i have found and it was not necessarily a forest but it was a very abundant natural sight that i found one of them so to have the most diversity possible so you just grab that rice that you have with the same weight the amount of black of brown sugar and then you mix it in one boil in one bowl you don't really want to um to press that hard on the rice once you're mixing it you just kind of want to gently and evenly mix it so um you don't want it to be too liquid in case it's looking very liquid i would add some of the brown rice on top of that imo so that you avoid that that there's a lot more water because if there's a lot of water then it's going to react and the bacteria is going to start eating all that sugar and it's not really going to store very well so um i wouldn't use that as a primary imo in case that happens just make sure that it's not too liquid that is consistent and it's uh and it's more solid so always i i use a sugar a brown sugar cap on once i'm finished uh mixing the rice with the sugar just add a little bit of brown sugar on top to make sure that there's not going to be excessive moisture and this you can store with a breedable lid you can store um in a place without direct sunlight and it can be good for for a long period of time and you should have many of these and this is the way that you're already relating with the natural biology and implementing it in your soil is the best fertilizer so once you decide you already want to take your biology out of the dormant state it's called imo 3 step number 3 and i'll briefly go through how to activate and reproduce 10 gallons of imo so of course you're going to use your imo 2 and you're going to have several inputs that are going to help that reproduction so fpj is the first one or fermented plant juice and you use 0.3 ounces for them you use brown rice vinegar same amount sea water so if in case you don't have sea water it would be great to go on a little trip to the ocean and otherwise i guess you could order it online a little bit of um of seawater or you know just the best way that you can get sea water be okay 5.3.3 ounces humic acid in liquid form is best um so the imo 2 now i just use one finger and then water 1. 24 gallons so what you want to do here is that you want to make a kind of of a tea so in the water you're going to add all your inputs and you're going to mix it gently so that the sea water and a humic acid is gonna is gonna enhance the fungi fungal activity is gonna give them enough nutrients to reproduce so um i'm gonna briefly say how to make plant fermented plant juice so in this case i used moringa because it's produced here locally organic so i got a lot of it fresh so what you want is to harvest your plant and it it can be a local weed if you want a wheat that you know that has a lot of potassium and magnesium a lot of nutrients one that you see that is thriving in the environment that you live in so what we want is to extract those nutrients so we can give them back to our plants to our biology so i used moringa and i used brown sugar and so um i cut them and i mix them i i cut them very small so that the juices can come out and i added the sugar i just mix it in in a bucket with my hands and once you do that already there's some moisture coming out and then what you want is to let it sit for two weeks maybe a week is is enough but just make sure that that it remains liquid that is going to stay liquid so that the fermentation can start and um when when i did this i had to extract it didn't look very liquid although it had some liquid i had to take out the moringa and just really really press it with my hand so i could get all the liquid out and then that's how i stored it with a breathable lid so this is briefly how you make fpj or fermented plant use juice you can use um a plant that you see that is thriving and with the sugar you're going to be able to get its nutrients and ferment it so you can give it back to our biology so along with the inputs of the imo 3 you need 5 gallons of carbs and 5 gallons of carbon maybe you can check what is available locally for you what i use uh in this case is five gallons of wheat bran that is very easy to find here and five gallons of cacao shells it's a very good smell i mix them even mix them evenly because the wheat is going to cause um it's a carb and it's going to make the biology heat up a lot so i try to stabilize it with the cacao shells that is not only the wheat bran because if your temperature goes above 120 fahrenheit then most of the beneficial biology will die because of the heat so when it's dry you mix your your calves and your carbs and your carbon you mix them well and then you add your liquids including the imo 2. so once you add the liquids you really try to mix it thoroughly um and you want to use a natural box for that because if you use plastic then um the the part of the imo 3 that is against the plastic can become an aerobic and this is something that happened to me as well so you really want a breathable box whether it's wood or cardboard something like that so this is when i already mixed my inputs with the carbs and the carbon and it's it looks like this this one smells like chocolate cake so it has to always have a good smell and so after five days you have to turn it every day so that it doesn't heat up that it never goes past 120 fahrenheit so mix it every day i do it with my hands you can use a shovel you just really want to move it you know not for it not to become an aerobic and you know that that you can keep that aeration stabilization this is this happened one and on the second day this photo and it looks so beautiful just to see that much ecology uh biology just thriving right there but yeah it will look something like this if you're in a very dry climate you may need to regulate the moisture it happened to me that i use cardboard because cardboard absorbs a lot of water it dried up in three days you really want it you want it to be at least five days that it's reproducing so it can really colonize all the all the grains so uh you may add a little bit of water not too much just to keep that going for in case it's drying up and you feel that the moisture is not correct the moisture should be um you can press it with your hands but it doesn't really stay like a ball it just has like a little bit of compression but it falls apart that's that's what you're looking for in cold climates it may take a longer time than five days just stay vigilant and be open to to make mistakes and do it again just always keep an eye on them they look something like this they're very very beautiful so in the end after the five days it should look something like this so you get this um these chunks of they will colonize these chunks and if you open them up you you shouldn't open all of them but if you open them up they should look something like this very webby in there it looks um it looks very good it smells great and those are good biology for our soil the native biology and you can store that in a natural uh in a wooden box in a closed wooden box you can store that for some weeks and from this you can make you can make certain things you can make liquid imo or you can just mix the imo 3 the finished product with your native with your native soil and the same inputs so that you can build soil that's how we really build um native soil again you mix your native soil with the with the biology and then you have that soil full of that um or microorganisms you know that are going to stabilize are going to help with the restoration of our soils and to make liquid imo which is very easy to add you just need this amounts of um fpj same brown rice vinegar seawater humic acid imo 2 or imo 3 is ok to use when making liquid imo and your water important that when you're making liquid imo since we mainly have fungi you need a narrator something looking like this i got something like this with at least two tubes giving oxygen you can use um your stones you can add the end of the tube to a stone you can make that oxygen rock and it goes in the bottom so that you can always have this stimulation for 36 hours and then you have your liquid indigenous microorganisms that you can add to your soil and to your plants so i hope that was helpful on how to make in written reproduce indigenous microorganisms that is uh has been very helpful for us it is super fun to do and that way you make sure that you're working with the available native biology which is most important thank you",
