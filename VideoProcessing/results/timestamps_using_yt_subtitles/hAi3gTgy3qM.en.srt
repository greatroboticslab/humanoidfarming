00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,360
Indonesia's farmers are finally getting

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,219
enough water for their crops in

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,320
Indonesia water did not reach many

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,780

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,140
Indonesia's irrigation system was

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,760
functioning at full capacity

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,080
to fix the country's irrigation

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,080
the government launched its irrigation

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,700
Improvement program 2015-2025

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,840
Indonesia's Ministry of Agriculture with

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,059
funding support from the international

15
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,500
fund for agricultural development is

16
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:39,239
ensuring that the benefits of the

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,040
irrigation improvements reach farmers

18
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,079
and farming communities providing them

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,360
with better Water Services better access

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,879
to agribusiness finance and better post

Harvest handling and delivery services

22
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,660
but more remains to be done to address

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,020
implementation gaps and support the

24
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:58,680
ambitious decade-long program

25
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,180
in May 2017 ADB committed 500 million

26
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,940
dollars to support Indonesia's

million dollars the financing package

31
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,159
will support the program from 2017 to

32
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,320
2024 in delivering sustainable and more

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,540
productive irrigated agriculture in 74

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,460

35
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,439
strengthening institutional capacity for

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,240
sustainable irrigated agriculture

37
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,600
improving irrigation operation

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,939
maintenance and management and improving

39
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,000
irrigation infrastructure the project

40
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,939

50
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,340
as of 2023 the program has rehabilitated

51

53
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,159
getting more than enough water enabling
