1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,200
so in the last video we showed you how

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,279
we transferred the water from the well

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,160
stream into

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,719
the tote and in today's video we're

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,320
going to show you how we get that water

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,990
out of the tote in in the garden beds so

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,300
hope you enjoy this video

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,300
[Music]

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,199
alright so you saw

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,519
how we set up the

11
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,200
the transfer pump the main pump that

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,120
pumps to the tote

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,760
and now i'm going to show you

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,559
how we take that water in the tote and

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,239
then

16
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,640
pump it onto

17
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,440
all of these crops over here

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,239
so this pumping station just like the

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,320
other pumping station

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:56,480
also runs off of a solar panel

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,719
so another 100 watt ranology panel

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,000
and that is wired

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,680
to a

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,280
charge controller

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,280
i'm going to show you

26
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,760
so there's my charge controller this is

27
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,920
a rinology one

28
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,840
we have bought two

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,320
and this one's the waterproof one the

30
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,970
other one we had before was not

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,159
waterproof and didn't work out correctly

32
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,840
[Music]

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,560
and then this

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,560
rinology charge controller

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:29,520
there's the negative and the plus for

36
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,840
the solar and on the back of your panel

37
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,910
you've got two terminals a negative and

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,079
a positive

39
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,840
[Music]

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,799
so that is how

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,840
that's wired to the charge controller

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,320
so now the power from the sun is going

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,680
from this solar panel into the charge

44
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,040
controller

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,200
and then to this battery system here

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,280
and how that's possible is there's a

47
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,399
plus and a negative here

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,799
where the battery goes

49
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,000
and you can see there's a positive and a

50
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,399
negative terminal on my battery

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,640
okay and then

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:14,879
this battery is how we're getting power

53
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,879
from that pump so here's the pump

54
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,480
so it's a sea flow pump

55
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,040
it's a water pressure pump

56
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,040
it's a 12 volt pump every this is a 12

57
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,120
volt system

58
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,360
and it produces about 5.5 gallons per

59
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,260
minute

60
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,640
and the flow is great

61
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:41,200
[Music]

62
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,040
so all you have to do to wire this pump

63
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,120
to

64
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,560
your battery

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,920
is

66
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,440
this is an old extension cord wire we

67
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,959
just cut it

68
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:58,000
we took the black and the white wire

69
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,560
put the white on the black

70
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,760
out terminal and the black on the red

71
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,599
terminal

72
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,920
these are your plus and your minus that

73
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,159
come off this battery

74
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,319
and then you can see it just goes and

75
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,360
goes and goes

76
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,120
and then here's my terminals

77
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,720
my negative

78
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,280
my plus here

79
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,519
my negative here and all we're doing is

80
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,920
we're taking a

81
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,920
bolt

82
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,159
[Music]

83
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,599
on the other end of

84
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:35,360
on the other end of the

85
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:38,560
extension cord we've got that same

86
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:41,040
uh black and white wire

87
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,720
the black goes in the

88
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,680
positive side

89
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,890
what we do is we take our nut here

90
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,959
and we put the nut

91
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:52,080
[Music]

92
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,319
over the terminal

93
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,439
right nice and tight

94
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,519
same thing we do over here

95
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,080
and then this turns on

96
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,120
this is your inlet pump here

97
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,720
so this is connected inside

98
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,560
of the tote

99
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,760
and that's pulling the water out of the

100
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,680
tote

101
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,400
through the pump but it's got to go

102
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,010
through this filter first let's take

103
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,680
this off

104
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:18,060
[Music]

105
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,230
okay

106
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,230
[Music]

107
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,840
so there's your filter

108
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,080
see what sort of stuff we got in

109
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,520
here pretty nasty in there

110
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,520
probably time for a cleaning

111
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,000
so then it gets filtered

112
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,680
so then it goes through this

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,360
this filter here

114
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,800
into the pump and then your outlet side

115
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,639
and then the outlet is the garden hose

116
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,479
so i'm going to show you right now where

117
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,479
this goes to

118
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,360
now let's go

119
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:00,320
over to

120
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,090
follow the cord here

121
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,310
here it is

122
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,470
[Music]

123
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,470
[Applause]

124
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,800
there you go

125
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,690
you can see the pressure

126
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,280
is real nice

127
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,639
[Music]

128
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,160
no sort of delays in the pressure

129
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,880
and all we're doing is just watering

130
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,759
and this is how we water all of our beds

131
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,880
we hand water it

132
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,560
next year we will not be hand watering

133
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,160
next year we're going to try to switch

134
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,199
over to a

135
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,039
easier method for watering such as

136
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,199
irrigation

137
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,800
i know our first year and we hand

138
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,160
watered everything are

139
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,160
are we crazy i feel like we are

140
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,000
so pretty simple setup

141
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,639
you know that's how we're doing

142
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,400
everything with the solar powered

143
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,080
uh pumping station

144
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,160
you saw the other solar panel on the

145
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,680
transfer pump now you're seeing the

146
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:06,160
second station here next to the tote

147
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,319
and then now you're seeing all the water

148
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,120
that's in the tote get out of the tote

149
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,960
and end up in those garden beds so

150
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,520
hope you enjoyed this hopefully you

151
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,600
