1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,679
what's going on everyone it's joe to

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,000
loan more back with another video today

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,480
i want to talk about gardens and how to

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,960
water them efficiently in a process that

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,960
i love to do i've had it for years now

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,960
and i absolutely love it so let's get

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,960
started

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:23,680
[Music]

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,760
so the process that i'm going to talk

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,840
about today is right here in these three

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,439
raised beds right here it's called drip

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,560
irrigation now i did a video on this

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,239
last year

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,880
i think it was too much of an in-depth

15
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,200
video it's very simple to do very easy

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,280
to do anybody can hook this up

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,640
you have plenty of options out there to

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,239
get this stuff you can get them on

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,000
amazon you can get it at home depot or

20
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,239
lowe's i got my stuff right at home

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,640
depot um so if you run out of something

22
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,280
you can go get it bring it back and put

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,120
it together so right here is a perfect

24
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,120
example of drip irrigation you can see

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,440
right here we have these emitters right

26
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,840
here i'll show you how i've run it to

27
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,840
this to the sprays bed here in a second

28
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,840
but what these emitters are they what

29
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,439
they do is they drip every six inches to

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,840
12 inches depending on the style that

31
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,280
you get and what you can find but what's

32
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,040
really great is just a little bit of a

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,439
droplet that basically

34
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,920
drops into your garden a little bit at a

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,159
time and that way it controls the flow

36
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,759
of what's coming out into your beds the

37
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,439
great thing about drip irrigation is it

38
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,600
can hook right to your faucet to the

39
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,320
side of your house as you can see here i

40
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,479
have a melnor water timer i've had this

41
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,479
for probably three or four seasons now

42
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,479
haven't had a problem with it as you can

43
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,360
see here i have two different settings

44
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,960
right here on my melnor water timer i

45
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,320
have the one here this is for actually

46
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,560
the drip irrigation line you can see

47
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,280
here this is the half inch pipe that

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,799
comes with it it goes into a obviously

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,560
you want to have a backflow provider on

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,479
there and then this one's a two port

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,159
they also sell four port if you're

52
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,479
interested in that if you're interested

53
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,799
in above ground irrigation these things

54
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,240
are really great you can set them up to

55
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,600
four different cycles meaning four

56
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,000
different times of the day they can come

57
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,320
on this is a two zone obviously has a

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,320
manual off and on so if you wanna if you

59
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,560
see a little bit of a dry spot in your

60
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,399
garden and it doesn't the timer you know

61
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,759
comes on at a certain time and you want

62
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,599
to hit that a little bit extra you can

63
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,440
have a manual on off

64
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,280
i've done a full in-depth video on the

65
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,280
4-port one i show you how to set it up

66
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,200
i'll leave that link below it's a very

67
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,360
popular video because it is a little

68
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,959
confusing when you first set these up

69
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,599
but again i have my drip irrigation

70
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,680
right here my half inch pipe it runs

71
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,319
down and it basically what happens is

72
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,720
that half inch pipe right there runs

73
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,800
right along everything that you want the

74
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,959
half inch pipe that i have runs right

75
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,160
along the bottom

76
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,480
of my

77
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,239
uh mulch bed right here and then it goes

78
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,959
all the way back into my garden and then

79
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,959
from there you can branch off to various

80
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,040
things so let me tell you let me explain

81
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,200
to you what i mean by how branches off

82
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,519
of that so this is the half inch pipe

83
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,879
that you can buy it obviously you real

84
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,560
you really need this this is what

85
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,480
connects to the timer that i showed you

86
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,159
behind me uh there's a couple different

87
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,680
fittings that you can get very easy to

88
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,959
figure out so i'm not going to go in

89
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,560
super in depth i just want to give you

90
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,959
guys the basic idea of how the drip

91
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,680
irrigation works but basically this half

92
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,519
inch line is what i use as my main line

93
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,200
and then from there i branch off to

94
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,440
everything the shrub right here behind

95
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,319
me the rose bush has is branched off of

96
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,879
this to a nice emitter that feeds it

97
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,319
regularly on schedule every day so

98
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,239
that's why these rose bushes right here

99
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,000
behind me they look really great all my

100
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,120
shrubs always look really great

101
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,799
throughout the time of the year because

102
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,879
i'm always branching off of these half

103
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,319
inch pipes right here so what you want

104
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,920
to buy is one of these hole punchers

105
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,920
right here and then all you got to do is

106
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,560
punch puncture a hole right into the

107
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,319
tubing right here

108
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,000
i have a couple right here but there see

109
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,080
there you go and then from there you can

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,360
branch off to wherever you want to go

111
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,040
so obviously there's a bunch of

112
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,640
different accessories that you can get

113
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,239
you have some of these right here these

114
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,720
are some different fittings there's a 90

115
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,159
degree in here there's a uh there's a t

116
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,159
in here so if you want to branch off the

117
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,760
two different spots you can and then

118
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,000
from here these are the drip emitters

119
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,400
right here uh actually the company that

120
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,840
makes them is called dig

121
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,959
i think these ones are sold at home

122
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,959
depot

123
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,920
but as you can see here this bag right

124
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,720
here has a 10 pack and it does uh it

125
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,360
does

126
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,120
two gallons per hour so

127
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,680
i really don't go off the the gallons

128
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,320
per hour thing i just kind of judge what

129
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,519
my plants are doing if i think my plants

130
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,120
need a little bit more water then i'm

131
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,560
going to upgrade the timer if i think

132
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,240
they're getting too much maybe i'll down

133
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,080
the timer just things like that i don't

134
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,000
get too carried carried away with the

135
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,840
gallons per hour i've used these

136
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,759
emitters here for years now and they've

137
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,440
worked just fine so what you want to do

138
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,040
is you want to branch off of your half

139
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,639
inch line right here so what you want to

140
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,960
do is use one of these little guys right

141
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,240
here basically what this does is goes

142
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,240
into one of the holes right here

143
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,120
just like so

144
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,800
and then from there with another

145
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,759
accessory that you need to buy is these

146
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,919
micro tubes now again these micro tubes

147
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,360
they're a lot smaller i don't exactly

148
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,440
know what diameter is but you can see

149
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,440
it's a lot smaller so basically what you

150
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,280
do they come in a roll i forget exactly

151
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,759
probably 25 50 feet something like that

152
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,160
you buy this then all you got to do is

153
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,759
snip it to how long you want same thing

154
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,240
with the tubing you can snip it they

155
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,039
have end caps on here as well i juice

156
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,919
use regular uh clippers that you use for

157
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,759
pecs

158
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,280
this works really great to snap these

159
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,199
off either or

160
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,280
you can use anything you want um but the

161
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,360
pack but the pex clippers work really

162
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,800
great for this again it has an end cap

163
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,479
it cut you have to buy that separately

164
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,919
it has an end cap so the water ain't you

165
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,080
know obviously squirting out the other

166
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,680
end but from going back to your emitter

167
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,840
right here this is what i was talking

168
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,320
about each of my shrubs or each of my

169
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,400
garden strips that i have i branch off

170
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,240
so again i have my adapter on here i

171
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,280
take my micro tubing

172
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,199
now

173
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,680
sometimes this micro tubing doesn't go

174
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,000
on easily so what i like to do is i like

175
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,000
to use a torch something like this

176
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,520
and if you have something even bigger

177
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,960
you can use one of these guys and all

178
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,280
you got to do is heat up the tubing a

179
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,440
little bit and then

180
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,520
from there you can put on whatever you

181
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,080
want so if i'm going to branch off to

182
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,160
say a shrub i have my micro tube branch

183
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,600
off of the half inch line then on the

184
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,520
other end i'm going to take my drip

185
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,600
emitter right here i'm going to throw

186
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,840
that guy on

187
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,360
and there you go i have one of these

188
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,000
again i'm going to show you in a second

189
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,560
all my flower beds so oh my plants are

190
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,400
getting water just like this drip right

191
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,600
off the half inch line don't have to

192
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,639
worry about don't have to worry about

193
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,240
getting a sprinkler out you don't have

194
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,639
to worry about throwing your hose out

195
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,479
there ordering anything by hand you just

196
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,360
have the water timer on and you're good

197
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,520
to go

198
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,680
so again i have this system all along

199
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,919
this flower bed right here all the way

200
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,440
down each plant is getting a drip

201
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,840
emitter just like this right off the

202
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,360
half inch line so just imagine this on

203
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,360
the ground right here

204
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,440
that that half inch tubing right there

205
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,280
is running all along down the front side

206
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,360
of my house and then it's branching off

207
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,599
to this shrub right here it's branching

208
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,360
off to this shrub right here and then

209
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,560
again all the way down

210
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,840
so what i'm going to do now is i'm going

211
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,360
to flip it on and show you guys what the

212
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,360
drip irrigation looks like in the garden

213
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,479
we're gonna put it on for

214
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,919
15 minutes just so you guys can see what

215
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,000
it looks like

216
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,000
and just like that it's flowing through

217
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,160
so let's go show you so we're back out

218
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,639
back now and as i said this half inch

219
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,639
line it runs literally right along the

220
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,560
edge of the fence all the way down the

221
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,479
fence line and into the back of the

222
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,120
three beds back there and then from

223
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,639
there again we just branch off you can

224
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,199
either use one of these drip emitters

225
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,639
like i have on the end of here or you

226
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,720
could use the drip emitters where it

227
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,720
drips like every six inches or 12 inches

228
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,000
depending on what kind of style you can

229
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,160
find

230
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,520
so right here is a perfect example of

231
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,759
the drip emitter right here this is a

232
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,919
blueberry bush right from hamilton new

233
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,879
jersey and as you can see i have my

234
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,319
branch my line goes way down this way

235
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,160
again that half inch line just goes

236
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,759
underneath all the way down and we're

237
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,680
just branching off and as you can see we

238
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,599
have the drip emitter right here and

239
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,520
it's just feeding this bush right here

240
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,199
and then again we have one all along

241
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,520
here to feed all the other blueberry

242
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,520
bushes some are underground some are

243
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,199
above ground it doesn't really matter

244
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,280
it's going to get fed so here's a

245
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,360
perfect example of the drip emitter

246
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,280
right here the one that's every six

247
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,039
inches as you can see it's literally

248
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,160
just dripping just a little bit at a

249
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,160
time

250
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,639
and we have this all through our three

251
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,479
raised beds i have an actual half inch

252
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,639
here in the middle as well because the

253
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,840
half inch obviously more water is going

254
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,080
to come out of that than these little

255
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,959
drip emitters right here but these drip

256
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,039
emitters right here are a lifesaver it

257
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,440
really does make gardening so much

258
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,519
easier you have your timer set up it's

259
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,959
so much easier to do you don't got to

260
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,279
get out there with the hose anymore you

261
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,640
just put it up on that timer and you're

262
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,320
good to go i'm going to show you those

263
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,160
three raised beds right here and then

264
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,080
we'll finish up the video

265
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,000
and again here you go we have the drip

266
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,240
emitters right here this one i believe

267
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
is it spaced out to 12 inches i'm not

268
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,680
100 sure again

269
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,360
you might have to go online and buy

270
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,360
these ones sometimes you don't always

271
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,920
get these ones in store the ones that

272
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,000
are the six inch or the 12 inch emitters

273
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,000
i believe i got mine on either amazon or

274
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,080
