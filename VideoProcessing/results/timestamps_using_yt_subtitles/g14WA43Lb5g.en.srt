1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,880
all right I just wanted to bring you in

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:07,680
here real quick so I can do a comparison

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,599
of the uh plants that I transplanted the

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,040
other

5
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,719
day if looking sorry about my my dirty

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,000
hands just got finished planting carrots

7
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:18,320
but that one's really up next to the

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,840
third digit right there as you can see

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,119
it's not really grown out very much um

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,080
look at those still down at the first

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,240
digit maybe I I give that the second

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,560
digit right there let's go outside and

13
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:35,140
check out the transplant and if you look

14
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,399
at that one I mean it's grown out

15
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,920
[Music]

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,840
significantly another one right there

17
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,520
has grown look at that up to the third

18
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:47,360
digit easily um it has grown out to Li

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,399
gney as well and then this one didn't

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,280
grow up very much but it definitely grew

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,280
out you can see the new growth in the

22
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,079
middle in there and this is definitely

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,800
the the part of gardening that I love

24
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:01,800
the most
