[Music]

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,039
what if I told you I built this entire

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,520
farm with the help of tens of thousands

6
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,960
of dollars in federal grants money you

7
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,559
don't have to pay back I also secured

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:41,039
tens of thousands of dollars in interest

9
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,079
free loans with up to 21 months to pay

10
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:46,280
back with no interest about 5 years ago

11
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,800
I turned my Suburban backyard into a

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:50,680
thriving profitable vegetable farm and

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,920
in today's video I'm going to show you

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,399
exactly how I funded it and how you can

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,000
too hey what's up everybody welcome back

16
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,920
to the Garden if you're new to the

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,719
channel I'm Chef Mikey I'm a former

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,519
executive chef turned Urban Farmer and

19
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:05,119
this is my backyard that's my house

20
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:06,840
right up there when we bought this

21
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,159
property we had no plans to start a

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,960
commercial vegetable operation we just

23
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:13,600
wanted a small piece of land to grow our

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,560
own food I was working a full-time job

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,320
and gardening on the weekends but I

26
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,960
quickly realized I was spending about

27
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,960
$300 a week on my gardening hobby to

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,479
offset costs I started selling some of

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,119
my extra produce at work that's when I

30
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:30,880
decided to form an LLC so I could write

31
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,560
off my expenses at first I funded

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,799
everything out of pocket with money from

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,240
my job I'd sell extra veggies to

34
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,680
co-workers and reinvest every dollar I

35
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,040
made back into the garden I even went as

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,719
far as making posts on Facebook for

37
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,560
produce for sale stating that all money

38
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,320
will go towards my Greenhouse funds this

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,880
made it more fun for my friends to

40
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,719
purchase from me because they knew what

41
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,719
the money was going towards and they

42
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,280
could watch it all evolve as I posted

43
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,439
updates and they could see the green

44
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,399
houses being built on social media I

45
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,320
built my first three green hous

46
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,000
using 0% interest credit cards with 12

47
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:08,800
to 21 months to pay them off these cards

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,800
even gave statement credits like $900 if

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,080
you spend $3,000 in the first 90 days

50
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,440
which essentially gave me a $900

51
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,800
discount on my green houses it's

52
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,920
important to note that these are

53
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:22,280
business credit cards that have high

54
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,440
limits and large statement credits and

55
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,360
they're not typically available to

56
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,519
individuals understand you must first

57
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,319
form a business to qualify for these

58
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,120
types of credit cards and for these

59
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,360
large purchases to be tax deductible for

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,040
me I have a single member LLC I also

61
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,400
have an agricultural tax exemption so I

62
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,760
do not pay sales tax on these large

63
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,239
purchases I would highly recommend

64
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,560
forming an actual business and getting a

65
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,959
tax exemption before you start making

66
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,560
infrastructure purchases otherwise

67
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,280
you're just giving away free money to

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,200
the government for no good reason it

69
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,560
should also be noted that I had the cash

70
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,760
on hand to pay for these purchases with

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,440
a solid plan on how is going to pay back

72
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:05,920
the debt before I acred any interest

73
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,799
typically one shoulder season crop can

74
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,799
pay the entire balance of one of these

75
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,640
high tunnels that I bought but if

76
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:13,840
anything were to go wrong you need to

77
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,319
have a way to get yourself out of debt

78
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,560
by no means am I recommending that

79
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,319
anyone buy a high tunnel on a credit

80
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,599
card if you don't already have the cash

81
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,519
on hand I simply leveraged my

82
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:27,799
outstanding credit score to get the $900

83
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,040
statement credit and 21 months of

84
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,640
Interest free payments so I could keep

85
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:34,200
my cash on hand for working capital but

86
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,920
if I got myself in a jam with the

87
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,680
payments I had the cash to pay it off

88
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,760
but when I quit my job and relied solely

89
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,159
on the farm to pay my bills it became

90
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,439
too risky to put up my own money I had

91
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,319
savings but I didn't want to drain them

92
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:51,280
I remembered a YouTube video I'd seen

93
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,640
about nrcs high tunnel grants I tried to

94
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,159
Google information about how to get a

95
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,000
high tunnel from the nrcs and it's not

96
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,120
as easy to find the information I was

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,920
looking for deep down at felt like a

98
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,760
high tunnel Grant was probably not

99
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,519
something a guy like me would qualify

100
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,239
for since I was just farming on a

101
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,239
quarter acre in my Suburban backyard I

102
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,760
didn't think they'd take me seriously

103
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,159
but after I did some digging on the

104
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,239
internet I found an email address and I

105
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,120
sent an email to ask how I would go

106
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,400
about applying for a high tunnel Grant

107
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,040
the next day a lady from the USDA and

108
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,639
the nrcs came out and talked to me at my

109
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,800
farm she was super impressed with what I

110
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,639
had accomplished on my own she also

111
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,240
helped me apply for for an irrigation

112
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,160
Grant low tunnel Grant and a grant to

113
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:37,080
install water lines from the main line

114
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,320
directly into the garden for more

115
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,919
efficient irrigation hookups but it's

116
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,120
not as simple as just filling out an

117
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:46,199
online form and getting a check USDA has

118
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,080
lots of paperwork and the processes can

119
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,840
take time after the lady left that day

120
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,120
it took about a year before I ever heard

121
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,199
from her again I just kind of rote it

122
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,600
off and I ended up purchasing my next

123
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,199
high tunnel out of

124
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,520
pocket but then out of the blue I got a

125
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,960
phone call from the USDA to tell me I've

126
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,320
been approved for a high tunnel with

127
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,280
irrigation low tunnel and to have the

128
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,840
water line installed it was a total of

129
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:14,039
around $112,000 on that first round of

130
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,160
funding my patients paid off once I was

131
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:18,000
approved I ordered my fourth farmer

132
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,840
friend caterpillar tunnel and got it

133
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,520
installed right away I also created an

134
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,080
efficient low tunnel system using 10-ft

135
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,759
pieces of electrical conduit that I bent

136
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,360
into Hoops using a 4ft hoop Bender that

137
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,880
I bought from Johnny selected seeds I

138
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,919
bought a pool cover roller and a thft

139
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,000
roll of agrion 50 I designed an

140
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,560
efficient low tunnel system so I can

141
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,800
efficiently protect my garden from Frost

142
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,800
with only minutes of work rather than

143
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,520
hours like it took me before the low

144
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,800
tunnel Grant was like 1,500 bucks for

145
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,080
300 Square ft which was a ton of money

146
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,240
to cover 300 ft of garden space so I

147
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,319
spent all the money on enough materials

148
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,080
to cover my entire Garden so when they

149
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,800
came to to look at it they asked why did

150
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,759
you do more than 300 Square ft I told

151
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,560
them you gave me way too much money for

152
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,400
300 Square ft so I just went ahead and

153
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,880
spent it all so I could cover my whole

154
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,400
garden they said okay well I'll get you

155
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,120
more money since you covered more than

156
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,720
the planned amount but I don't think I

157
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,280
can get you more than 2500 bucks I said

158
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,160
I'll take it and they sent me a deposit

159
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,599
for even more money than we planned also

160
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,360
my Garden's on an 8% slope but the nrcs

161
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:32,919
standards state that they will not pay

162
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,880
for a high tunnel on more than a 5%

163
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,280
grade they told me I would need to get

164
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,479
it graded before I built my high tunnel

165
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,000
I looked at them and I said absolutely

166
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:44,039
not no one's driving any type of heavy

167
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,039
machinery in my garden that would be a

168
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:48,160
complete deal breaker and i' just pay

169
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:50,280
for it out of pocket if that's the case

170
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,479
I explained to them that I spent years

171
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,759
building up my soil using no till

172
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,479
practices and always keeping the soil

173
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,479
covered with compost and wood chip

174
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,720
mulches having any type of heavy

175
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,800
machinery back here do far more damage

176
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,919
than it would improvements I showed them

177
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,280
how I constructed my previous three High

178
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:09,879
tunnels by digging trenches in between

179
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,879
them so water flows away from the garden

180
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,199
and I lined The Trenches with wood chip

181
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,759
mulch to eliminate any potential for

182
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:18,919
erosion due to runoff from the high

183
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,120
tunnels and after a little back and

184
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:22,800
forth they finally agreed with me that

185
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,160
it would do far more damage than it

186
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,879
would good to have the land graded and

187
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,960
they allowed an exception for me to

188
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,960
build the high tunnel on an 8% grade I

189
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,319
just share this with you so you can

190
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,440
understand that it's okay to challenge

191
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,000
their standards as long as you can give

192
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,160
them reasons which make practical sense

193
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,919
as to why their protocol might not make

194
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,599
sense for your context what I've learned

195
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:47,319
is everything is a caseby casee

196
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:49,360
situation and exceptions can be made but

197
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,199
it's important to know that grants like

198
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,720
this aren't a free handout they're

199
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,840
funding programs you'll need to purchase

200
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:57,919
the equipment build the infrastructure

201
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,680
yourself and once you've completed the

202
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:04,000
project the nrcs will reimburse you a

203
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,479
set amount per square foot for example

204
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
when I was approved for a high tunnel

205
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:09,599
Grant they didn't just hand me a

206
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,120
greenhouse I had to pay for it up front

207
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,360
and build it myself but they reimbursed

208
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,599
me for the entire cost after I finished

209
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,639
building it they typically pay by the

210
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:20,919
square foot for example it doesn't

211
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,280
matter if you spend $1,000 on your high

212
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:27,039
tunnel or $100,000 on your high tunnel

213
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:29,960
they will just pay you around $3 to5 per

214
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:32,120
square foot so it might not always cover

215
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,000
the entire cost but it'll at least cover

216
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,919
some of the cost depending on what size

217
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,320
and additional features you might have

218
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,120
like automated rollup sides or heaters I

219
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,360
went the lowtech route and bought

220
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,360
Farmers friend caterpillar tunnels it

221
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,279
not only covered the entire cost but

222
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,080
even a little extra I think I made like

223
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,880
a hundred bucks for building mine after

224
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,480
it was all said and

225
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,200
done they also paid for the irrigation

226
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,240
in the high tunnel they don't ever seem

227
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,480
to care about how much money I spend or

228
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,480
don't spend they just pay out the same

229
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:04,000
same amount either way it's either by

230
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,760
the linear foot for water infrastructure

231
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,279
or by the square foot for everything

232
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,160
else one thing to keep in mind is the

233
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:13,000
usca doesn't make the process as easy as

234
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,560
possible because they want to make sure

235
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,399
that you're serious about fulfilling

236
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,320
your commitment otherwise there would be

237
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,160
lots of people applying to get free high

238
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,959
tunnel grants they're not actually

239
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,240
capable of falling through with the

240
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:26,320
obligation once you've completed the

241
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,279
project and met their standards the

242
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,519
reimbursement comes through and it's a

243
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:32,640
huge boost for your farm bottom line and

244
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,279
gives you the resources to expand more

245
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,519
quickly than if you were funding

246
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:38,680
everything on your own by using grants

247
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,880
for my high tunnels low tunnels and drip

248
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,399
irrigation I was able to create a more

249
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,640
efficient profitable operation and once

250
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,959
I had these systems in place I could use

251
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,560
the extra Capital to reinvest in my

252
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:53,040
business hire help and expand even

253
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,680
further applying for the grants isn't

254
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,040
easy there's no online application the

255
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,800
paperwork's extensive and the funding is

256
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:03,839
competitive each county has a limited

257
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,640
pool of funds however being an Urban

258
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,480
Farmer in Knoxville Tennessee gave me an

259
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,600
edge unlike agriculturally dense areas

260
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,959
there aren't many farms in the city

261
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,200
fewer applications means there's less

262
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,160
competition so if you're an Urban Farmer

263
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,920
like me you might find it easier to

264
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,000
receive this type of funding than

265
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,040
someone in a more competitive area

266
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,079
completing the projects immediately and

267
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,320
meeting their standards not only ensured

268
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:31,320
I got reimbursed quickly but also made

269
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,920
made me a standout example of how these

270
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,800
grants can work the nrcs was so

271
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,920
impressed that they've invited me to

272
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,440
join their subcommittee to the board of

273
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,920
directors for their Urban agriculture

274
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,760
initiative to help other Farmers achieve

275
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:46,200
similar success a pretty cool

276
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,279
achievement for someone who's never

277
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,440
worked on a farm in my life but I didn't

278
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,360
stop there I started asking more

279
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,959
questions there's codes on the bottoms

280
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:57,680
of these papers what are those how do I

281
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,959
get more do you have any other grants

282
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,000
well it turns out they do and I

283
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:05,519
qualified this year I received another

284
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,720
high tunnel Grant grants for mulching

285
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,120
and cover cropping where they pay me

286
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,079
$6,000 a year for the next 5 years to

287
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,000
implement cover crops and mulching

288
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:16,720
that's

289
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,200
$35,000 just for doing what I already do

290
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,800
and another several thousand to turn my

291
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,720
sidey yard into a pollinator habitat

292
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,680
we'll be building the next high tunnel

293
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,880
this month and we've already tarped the

294
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,320
area for the pollinator habitat which

295
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,279
will be planted next spr spring I'll be

296
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,519
sure to share all the projects with you

297
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,800
as we get them completed receiving these

298
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:39,680
grants at my homebased property allowed

299
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,959
me to reinvest and expand when I gained

300
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,320
access to lease land on a friend's

301
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:47,519
property I had the capital to develop

302
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,079
without any Financial strain I've now

303
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,040
applied for the same grants on the

304
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,440
leased property and given my track

305
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,200
record and connections within the USDA

306
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,519
and the nrcs I'm optimistic about

307
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,680
getting approved these grants will help

308
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:03,560
take my farming operation to the next

309
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,440
level so you might be wondering how can

310
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,000
you get these grants for your farmer

311
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,720
Garden well the first things first

312
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,320
there's no easy online form the process

313
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,399
can be a bit intimidating because

314
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,680
there's lots of paperwork involved but

315
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,760
don't let that scare you off the first

316
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:24,120
step is walk right into the local USDA

317
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,880
or nrcs office don't call don't email go

318
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,920
in person and start talking to the

319
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,120
person at the front desk they might not

320
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,560
be immediately available but showing up

321
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,120
in person will really get their

322
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,240
attention anyone can send an email but

323
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:38,680
very few people make the effort to walk

324
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,720
in and ask questions face to face that's

325
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,320
how you'll get noticed once you're there

326
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,279
you'll schedule a visit with an nrcs

327
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,079
representative this person will assess

328
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,920
your farm or garden and talk to you

329
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:51,240
about your goals and help you determine

330
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,160
which grants you qualify for now when

331
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,519
they come out to your operation make

332
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,440
sure everything looks clean and

333
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:58,959
organized the last thing you want them

334
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,480
to see is a messy Farm you want them to

335
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,839
see a professional operation that they'd

336
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,399
like to invest in this about building

337
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,240
trust and credibility and don't be

338
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,639
afraid to ask questions many of the

339
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,160
people who work for the USDA and the

340
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,120
nrcs might not even know about some of

341
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,800
these grants a lot of them are fresh out

342
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,320
of college and learning the ropes

343
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,920
themselves I asked about codes I saw in

344
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,399
the paperwork grants I'd never heard of

345
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,000
they didn't know what those grants were

346
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,199
at first but they went out of their way

347
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,120
to find out and that's how I secured the

348
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:31,399
cover cropping and pollinator habitat

349
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,680
ATT grants so ask those questions even

350
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:34,760
if it feels like you're pushing the

351
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,480
limit if they don't know they'll find

352
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,680
out for you and if you think it's a long

353
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,680
shot ask anyways the worst thing they

354
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,680
can do is say no and you're in the same

355
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,839
position you were in before but the best

356
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:47,240
case scenario you might get funding for

357
00:13:44,839 --> 00:13:49,680
something you never imagined for example

358
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,519
I asked for funding to install 20,000

359
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,839
gallons of rainwater catchment and they

360
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,399
said not in this round but maybe in the

361
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,160
future it wasn't a flat out no it's just

362
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,880
a not this time pal but whatever I I

363
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,680
didn't care if they said no because what

364
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,440
if they said yes so if you're thinking

365
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,399
