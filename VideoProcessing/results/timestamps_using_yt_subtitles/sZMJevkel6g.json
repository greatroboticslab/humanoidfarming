  "text": "[Music] you [Music] morning guys Tammy Trier Trier wilderness calm I hope you guys are doing good this morning I will wait a little bit here I've got some fun stuff to share I'm not sure my connection seems a little funny so I will wait and see if we can get some other people on here I thought we'd share some homesteading and off-grid and life tips with everybody this morning so I'm just gonna wait a little bit here well gorgeous weather we are having I am like so excited that's why my cheeks are all flushed I just did a treatment out on my back porch in the Sun and it just felt so good to be sitting there soaking up the vitamin D which I need also so it was just it's just wonderful but our weather's been low 70s and it has just been gorgeous with a nice breeze and just very refreshing I could handle these temperatures all year long this is just awesome and it just smells so good outside so many things are blooming and it just it's it's wonderful so it's not looking like anybody's jumping on right yet so I am going to dive in here share my thoughts and if we get people on that's great if not you guys can watch a replay and you guys on YouTube can follow along up hello Brenda thanks for joining where are you from Brenda we had an absolutely amazing weekend this past weekend we actually got a chance to get away the mountain boy wasn't interested in going so he stayed home here and held down the fort with the dogs and the mountain man and I got to get out with some friends of ours and go camping and we actually camped in our hammocks both in Montana and in Idaho we did like a big loop and it was just such an amazing escape sometimes we just need to do that and escape and get out there but I'm gonna try to do something here while I have you guys on here see if my live shows up on here I want to share some photos in the feed hey good morning glad to have you guys joining me getting out and being able to be here we go let's see if I can do this I don't know if I can share I want to share some photos there we go nothing like listening to yourself give me a second here I want to try to share these photos how have you guys been what have you been up to and are you getting things in your garden are you getting out and enjoying joining the wonderful weather we have had an absolutely amazing weather darn it I can't I don't think I can add to the comments right now let me just try another way oh maybe here ha here we go okay I'm going to share some pictures and hopefully you guys can see them in the comments below and let me just find the other ones there we go it's just fun to be able to share I got to get a little bit more techie here and be able to share things a little differently with you but right now I'm going to share it this way in the comments below you should be able to see three photos my mountain man is a tremendous cook when it comes to well no matter where we are he is really good on an open fire as far as cooking our meals he used to do a lot of pack trips back in the backcountry in Wyoming and he did a lot of hunting trips as well so he was camp cook and also guide but in the one picture you can see him making fry bread and in the other picture you can see that he's got elk steaks on a skewer over the fire we've got coffee going on and potatoes in a big frying pan and then he also made eggs so we might hike but we we eat well out there it's good that we do hike we come back a lot heavier I think but he's an amazing cook and it's just there's nothing better than cooking on an open fire so right now we are taking advantage of the opportunity good morning Sean good morning Debbie we are taking advantage of being out there and being able to take opportunities with the open fire because it gets so dry here that later on this season we won't be able to have an open fire and cook on it so it really sucks sometimes because there's nothing better I love sitting by my campfire and just taking it all in and in the other picture you can see my feet on my hammock we were hanging on the side of the mountain on the first night in Montana and it was awesome now we did have a big tarp over top of us because it was a little sketchy looking but we were he enabled that by using mule tape which is some heavy cordage and we strung that zigzagged across the trees above us and we're able to put a tarp up so we stayed dry but I have to share this this was really wild a storm blew in and of course it was an electrical storm and we're hanging there in the trees and our friend and his kids and the dogs were an attempt below us and the storm started coming in but all of a sudden simultaneously the lightning and the Thunder hit and it was so close that it made your hair stand up and you could just feel it go through your entire body it was really freaky it was that close and I was ready to dive and hit the truck just because the truck has the rubber and it's safer place to be than hanging in a tree good morning Chad and waited it out a little bit and that it just started to dissipate then but man it was you know our eyes were closed and it was like somebody just shined the brightest light possible in our eyes it was really crazy but it was also really neat to experience and we had not camped the whole weekend then and had really got to see some nice scenery some different parts of Idaho that we haven't seen before so it was really nice but I encourage you guys to get out get out practice your skills sleep in the wild if you haven't you're missing out some of you may not like it but I'm a dirt girl I like being out in the dirt I like you know I'm not keen on spiders because I react poorly to their bites but they're easy to flick and fling and get rid of and just hanging in the trees like that there's just nothing better a wise old woodsman once told me a good campfire will cure anything that ails you amen Shawn amen is that not true it's just amazing the food tastes better it's aroma therapy going on it's just is awesome and I did good I was really concerned because I went I wasn't sure with my body and my my illness as to whether being out there amongst all the molds because everything said wet right now how I would do but I had a little bit of head pain I think more from our height and the barometric pressure but I like like Shawn said I think the fire cured all that was ailing me so it's absolutely amazing so guys don't miss out on getting out and don't forget to take your kids such great learning and opportunities to be out there and teach them things I also wanted to share with you my goodies there's my spearmint jelly that is finished and my dandelion jelly you can see that's a little bit lighter and then here is the lilac now you can I don't know if you can see that but it actually does have like a purple tinge to it and I also have my strawberry and there's nothing better than fresh jellies especially when you're making them from what most people consider weeds and the lilacs I was blessed by my friend Vicki who shared some of her lilac blooms but everything's out there guys it's all at your fingertips just like it is mine it's just a matter of taking the time and and and getting out there and doing it yes get the kids out there absolutely Chad Chad's another one who's constantly out there with his littles and it's just it's a great being out there with your kids there's nothing better than teaching the kids how to do these things they get so empowered our friends kids are what's the age-wise well I'm gonna go buy grade ones going into third grade next year should be finishing second grade this right now and the other is finishing kindergarten going to first so six and nine eight nine Navy great kids and they just love being out there and they had the opportunity to each build their fire ring while Glenn was making the meal and they practice starting their fires and gathering their materials and keeping the fire going so you know that skill although some people would be fearful that that's teaching them you know how to do something dangerous yeah but it's also teaching them how to do something that could save their life if they're ever stuck somewhere even if they don't use it as as a child but they use it as an adult because they learned it when they were out in the woods with their dad plus it's such a great time to bond with your kids honestly and I told the mountain boy today on our walk I said next time we're going out he's got to go with because he missed out on so much fun he was just afraid he was gonna be too cold last time we were camping it was pretty cold so anyway I want to share something else with you you guys hear a lot about modern homesteading you hear a lot about off gridding you hear a lot about you know primitive skills and things and a lot of average people feel that that doesn't apply to them but honestly I feel all of those skills traditional primitive homesteading off-grid all those skills are things that the average man should know because they are for us a lifestyle of preparedness they are things that we think about all the time good morning Blake glad to have you joining me Sean says practice and understanding doesn't mean it's dangerous it teaches respect and discipline absolutely absolutely and and that's that's what it's about plus it also empowers encourages and gives them confidence and and also pride that they're being included in in the opportunity to participate that just giving them a pack these kids each have their own little pocket knife starter pocket knife and they're whittling all the time while we're out there they get their hot dog sticks ready and you know and they've cut themselves while we're out we've had a patch them up but you know what it's it's part of experience and and it'll teach them just like you said it's gonna teach them the respect for the for the the equipment so great great thoughts and thanks for sharing that Sean but the skills that we share and when I sharing the modern homesteading things and the and the gardening things you know if you live in town and you're living vicariously it doesn't mean you can't do these things it doesn't mean that just because where you are is is limiting you and and knowing these things and practicing these things you know even if you live in an apartment there's nothing stopping you from getting out into the woods and getting some dirt time and also experiencing it so don't limit yourself and don't feel limited when somebody says modern homesteading things and you're not a homesteader so you don't participate please don't limit yourself knowledge is power and it doesn't matter where you are or what you're doing in your life today you can still learn these skills and these skills are what are going to carry you through if anything were to ever happen in any way to our country to your your family you know we've gone through situations had we not lived a life of preparedness with our food storage in 2016 when we went six and a half months without an income we would have been eating unless we were foraging and harvesting and we know how to do that but it would have been adding more stress to the fire when we were already very stressed so eating like kings and queens because we planned ahead and prepared it's key and and that's what these things are for so the reason I'm mentioning that today is because in addition to getting the tray at Wilderness Academy live and running I was also videoing a segment for the modern homesteading summit that my great friend Melissa Norris is running and I love her dearly and I'm so proud of her she put together a really nice summit and it will be starting on June 10th and you are able to get your free seats a while it is all online so you can watch it at your convenience I did a course on things to think about before going off grid and there are 26 other homesteaders and off-gridders that have shared their knowledge and insight and I encourage you to go check it out you can go there by simply going to try our wilderness comm slash homesteading summit all one word and the links are down below good morning Richard so guys don't miss out on these free things they put three or four presentations in a day and I believe it starts at 7:00 a.m. and then and then it switches off at midnight and then the next day's will start again so you have 20 I believe you have 24 hours to watch the presentation so it's seven to seven so it's you've got 24 hours to watch the presentation so depending on your work schedule what you've got going on you can squeeze it into your day they often have encore days and then you are also able to purchase the event but it is free to everybody a good deal thanks Sean have a great day and thanks for being a part of this so don't miss out on that the other thing that's going on is I had mentioned last week grow your own food workshop was going on and they are having their encore days today and tomorrow so you can get in and pick up and watch the ones that pertain to you the ones that you would like and that's something else you can do is see what presentations are most important to you and most valuable to you if you can't watch them all pick the ones that you can so they grow your own food you can find by going to try a wilderness calm slash grow your own food and again the links are all below and there's a lot of links below check them out they're all things that pertain to what we're talking about and some inspiration now this is one of the this is what I wanted to share with you today right here you see that it's frozen water you can see it's starting to melt a little bit I just pulled it out in my freezer I have this in my freezer this was shared with me this is not my own idea but it's ingenious and I'm going to share it I don't know who the original person was but my dear friend Mona shared it with me there is if I can get it out of here there's a quarter in here there we go there's a quarter on the top of my frozen ice so say you're out and your freezer goes out and the electric goes out so your freezers your freezers off while you're at work and for us we have a propane freezer but our lines could get clogged or our tank could run out and and it would shut it off till we switch the tanks so it could happen to us too by having that quarter on top of ice if your power goes out and your freezer starts to thaw if that quarter ends up at the bottom you know very well that your meats probably spoiled because it's been off for a long time and at which point you have no idea how long it's been off but if that quarter only ends up Midway that means that your food did not get spoiled and and that you can still save what's in your freezer that it probably may have thought a little bit but it reefer it's gonna refreeze or it's part way but by having that in there it gives you a gauge on how long the freezers been off so I encourage everybody to do that because I know many people who have thrown away a whole freezer full of meat and things because they weren't sure how long it was off and sometimes it's pretty evident especially if you've been gone for a while you'll smell it first but this is a great little gauge to be able to determine how long your freezers been off the other thing to keep in mind is I use glass good morning Holly you don't want to fill it the whole way up or this jars gonna crack good morning Kerry so fill it like three quarters of the way and put your quarter in the top and that way you will have a gauge to know how long your freezers been out when the power goes off if you're out of the house and you can also if the power does go out and you're there and you don't have a generator if you keep your freezers closed they will stay cold for a long time so there's a good chance that you will be able to you know save things if it's only goes out for a couple of hours that's awesome I know what I'm doing well I know isn't that one when Mona told me I was like you know aha you know duh but that's that's such a great such a great way engaged to be able to double-check you know what's going on in your freezer and and with all the game meat we have and the work that is required that's required to get it in our freezer I would absolutely be sick if we and I'm sure you guys would too especially if you're purchasing things as well because then you've got money tied up in it we have time and sweat and sometimes blood tied up into getting our meats in the freezer not so much the money but nobody wants to throw good food away now good deal good deal Tammy yeah that's a great it's a great idea you don't have to use glass you can use a plastic container but I figured that was easiest it enables me to see through it real well hello truly so guys it's really important to be able to educate ourselves and learn how to do these things and not be fearful and not be afraid hi Becca to not be afraid of making mistakes guys mistakes happen all the time and without a mistake you're not going to learn so you know I I look at mistakes and and mishaps as stepping-stones it all depends how you look at it you know that my cup is over always overflowing and I'm more thankful that I have a cup than how full it is so it's my positive perspective but if you use your mistakes as stepping stones you'll constantly be moving forward not backward right so those of you that just jumped on I was mentioning that with them you know all the modern homesteading and off-grid things that are being shared and and different skills that are being shared you know sometimes people feel that that doesn't pertain to them because they're not actually homesteaders or offgridders but this knowledge is open to all of us so check out below directly under the word resources are the two links that I was sharing for the modern homesteading summit that's coming up on June 10th that you can get involved in now and if you're interested in being able to watch them later they've got a great price on it right now and then the grow your own food summit is doing their encore days sorry had a brain fart for a moment so check that out and for those of you that just jumped in I shared some pictures of our weekend in the comments below so that you can check those out it's always important to get out and step away from our chaos we all have chaos and last week I shared about endurance and I want to just share something with you I was doing my devotions outside this morning and I was going through Hebrews and read this and I just thought it pertains so much I almost wish I would have found it last week but there's purpose in it this week - because perseverance is important every day every week we're gonna run into struggles we're gonna run into things and you know I'm a positive person I don't mention that because life sucks it's not that it's that there's just there's we're not promised anything perfect we're not promised you know clicking our heels are going to occur every day it's what we make it though and being able to persevere through our struggles and anything and in learning persevere through making jelly when it doesn't turn out right the first time you know some my first batches of jelly ended up being syrup not jelly and that was with elderberries so you know it's gonna happen to all of us you know I'm no different than you are we make mistakes too or things don't always go the way we want them to go you know we might be skinning an animal and want to use the hide and accidentally slip and put a hole on it I mean we're no different than you guys stuff happens and you know I was a little bit disappointed when I pulled my jelly up the morning after because I'm holding it too high sorry it didn't look like it's set right but it actually set wonderful Pomona's pectin is awesome but you got a try and you got a persevere through the hiccups used on the stepping stones and keep going but in Hebrews 10 34 through 36 it says you suffered along with those who were thrown into jail and when you when all you owned was taken from you you accepted it with joy you knew there were better things waiting for you that will last forever so do not throw away this confident trust in the Lord remember the great reward it brings you patient endurance is what you need now so that you will continue to do God's will then you will receive all that he has promised and guys you know I hold true to this stuff and I lean on this and this is my my life it's my strength and I just thought it was kind of interesting that I read that this morning after sharing with you what I did last week and her the week before I guess it was and uh it's just one of those things you know we're walking through a valley we could very well lose everything but it's on material things and it's how you view life I am so rich in the relationships that I have in the life that I live that the material things around me really are meaningless they help me through my day but they're not what I hold on to for for anything it's just material things so that's just a really excessive view of perseverance but it's all how you view it it's all how you view life and I know many of you get afraid to try the new things and you see us showing you how to do it in and and you know we've we've perfected it we've done it and it may intimidate you but I don't want you to be intimidated I want you to also realize that we're human and make mistakes too and there's no reason why you can't do this as well so don't miss out on the free trainings that are available to you sometimes it can be hard to cram things into our already tight schedule so I do get that because I sometimes would like to participate in the summits and watch them and I don't have the time but there are options to buy them if that's something that you are able to do but don't miss out on what you can like I said if you only have a limited time figure out what the courses are that will best benefit you at this time Tami says our gel\u00e9e didn't set became pancake syrup yep you just you roll with it it's still usable and you know what if it doesn't become pancake syrup it ends up in my meats jellies and preserves jams the sweet stuff is so amazing in in fried up meats I you tools and onions a lot of times I'll just slice up an apple and put it in with my meats and and different fruits pears go really good too I've used my pear jellies and meats too but um the next thing I'll be making is hot pepper jelly I absolutely love that on a bagel with really good organic cream cheese I will have to be making bagels out of coconut and almond flour but I'm sure it'll work well I have made bagels already and they're really good so I just haven't made him in a while but don't miss out guys don't miss out because you feel you don't fit the mold you know last when I was talking about the perseverance I was talking about comparing yourself and and I think a lot of people compare themselves to others and question their abilities don't question your abilities and don't compare yourself because it'll hold you back yep my strawberry jam syrup is natural waffles or pound cake topping cheesecake topping - there you go you'd make lively bring that over to my house along with your cheesecake but this stuff is usable it's not like it's trashed it's not like it's not used you know yes it's useless now you gotta even even when you make a dish sometimes I'll make something good morning Tiffany and it may not turn out the way I want it to but the next night I'll use it in leftovers and it's absolutely amazing you know it's just I never waste anything nothing gets thrown away and even our scraps go to the chickens some of the scraps go to the dogs but you know perfect well set a date but don't waste anything and don't don't be upset with your mistakes because in my opinion that's not a mistake you just you just flipped it and used it a little differently than you initially intended right now I just want to encourage you guys to also you know take advantage of what's around you like I said earlier with my dandelion jelly you know that's something that most people consider is a weed and I'll tell you what the dandelion jelly tastes like honey so it is our number two honey in the house and honestly I can't believe I haven't been making it all these years I have been actually utilizing the dandelion to dry for my teas and the roots for my teas and sometimes for coffee I just wasn't making the jelly and what a mistake I've been making so anyway I'm gonna wrap this up by just saying a prayer for you guys I do this every week it may not be your thing but it's my gift to you so dear lord I just thank you for these folks taking the time out of their busy schedules to join me for sharing their input and their tips and tricks and and Lord just be with them strengthen them give them perseverance and endurance through their week and just help those that are in need that may be struggling or ill and Lord just bless them show your presence to them and just continue to guide them on their journey just as you are on ours lord I just ask this in Jesus precious name Amen so guys again I appreciate you taking the time to join me join me next Wednesday 10:30 on Facebook live and don't miss out on the homesteading summit it starts on June 10th but you can sign up now that way you'll get their emails and know what's going on there's bonuses involved also which are really great resources to add to your archives and don't miss out so guys have a fantastic day thank you again for joining me today and god bless [Music] you",
