2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,760
had some very cold weather here in

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,679
Missouri and I've wanted to give you an

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,490
update on the greenhouse to let you know

5
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:18,750
how it did we got down to six degrees

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:23,850
the lazy way outside and the greenhouse

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:25,710
temperature got down to 1630 typical

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,960
d'affaires results of course that's a 22

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,210
degree difference in temperature and

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,360
when it was six below it was blowing

11
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,820
outside it was pretty nasty we still

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,860
kept 22 degrees warmer inside the

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:41,219
greenhouse considering we have not had

14
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,829
enough Sun and warm days to actually get

15
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,469
our heat sink charged I'm pretty happy

16
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,180
with those results as always thanks for

17
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,550
watching if you have any questions about

18
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,320
the greenhouse or growing a mittleider
