1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,799
my name is darren cannelly i work for

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,640
berkey's farm store i've been a

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,160
precision farming specialist for about

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,600
seven years now

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,520
and uh the interesting part about

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,279
telematics is we do have a segment of

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,039
the industry that is more interested in

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,519
telematics especially your larger

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,960
operations your fertilizer dealers your

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,039
co-ops who are interested in fleet

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,280
management most of our producers

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,280
customers that don't have a large volume

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,280
of equipment are not so interested in

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,800
telematics now but i think the point at

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,559
which they will become interesting when

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,559
we start to really push in

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,600
the reduced downtime during the off

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,719
season

19
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,960
i think where that really comes into

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,960
play is off-site diagnostics so if a guy

21
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,520
goes down if he's able to make a

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,600
telephone call and somebody that's miles

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,199
away can access that monitor and try to

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,199
find out what the problem is that he can

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,719
keep going sooner i think that's where a

26
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,000
lot of guys are going to see the value

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,320
in telematics at this point

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,840
we don't really see that value as much

29
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,119
or the customers haven't even realized

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,560
that but i think as time goes on they're

31
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,880
going to start realizing the value of

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,479
that piece of the puzzle more than just

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,720
a fleet management like a lot of

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,720
customers or co-ops are seeing now

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,479
i think just selling the value i think a

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,479
lot of guys now when they think of

37
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,240
telematics they think that they'll be

38
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,320
able to download their information from

39
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,240
their tractor to their home

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,759
wirelessly and they're interested in

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,040
that but yeah they don't see a great

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,600
value in that because they can take

43
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,520
their card or transfer it in many other

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,799
ways so they don't see a great value in

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,479
that and i don't think a lot of them

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,159
have really seen that value that can

47
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,920
come from reduced down time so i think

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,560
from a dealership perspective we need to

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,640
be selling that value in order to see

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,920
to be able to have them convinced of

51
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,920
what that value could bring to them and

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,920
telematics

53
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,719
i think where we're seeing right now is

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,240
some of the more productive producers

55
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,920
more some of the more advanced producers

56
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,680
are starting to be interested in this

57
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,119
and they will be the early adopters

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,560
we'll probably jump into and i always

59
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,759
say the proof is in the pudding and so

60
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,679
when you get more and more people that

61
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,360
are starting to do this they're going to

62
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,200
see the value themselves and they're

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,959
going to start promoting it to the the

64
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
different friends and the neighbor

65
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,480
farmers that they do have and then from

66
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,520
a dealer perspective if we continue to

67
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,319
push that

68
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,319
it'll continue to grow
