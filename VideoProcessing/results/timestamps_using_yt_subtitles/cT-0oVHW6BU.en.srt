1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,240
all right time for another little video

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,240
showing you some of my uh issues with

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,559
the 750 grain drill

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,280
normally when i put the the main seating

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,040
rate on um i can

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,880
have no problems but when it comes to

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,039
cover crops where there's a small amount

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,640
of seeds per acre going down in terms of

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,520
weight

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,880
i have to really adjust these

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,880
seed cups

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,279
which are

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,400
this width here on the row which will go

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,359
in and out

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,760
depending on how i move this lever

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,399
and when it gets too narrow the seeds

17
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,600
start to pile up and they don't flow

18
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,360
um easily so gear what deer does they

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,920
sell a kit

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,640
half speed gears

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:50,559
which is consists of two gears

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,800
and crucially for for my purposes

23
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,600
the part number changes by serial number

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,039
and

25
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,760
i bought

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,879
this set which one of the two gears is

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,879
fine

28
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,320
for my serial number but apparently i

29
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,519
needed

30
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,040
this gear 300.

31
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,400
um which you can see there's a hole

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,920
there i don't know if it's going to show

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,799
up but a roll pin goes through that

34
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,880
where it slips on the shaft

35
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,759
this gear is in place of that spur gear

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,200
um

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,320
and then we're going to go over here and

38
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,400
i'll show you

39
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,119
the issue that gear the larger gear goes

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,280
on top on the left

41
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,600
and then the smaller gear that i just

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,119
showed you goes on in place of this one

43
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,240
down here

44
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,320
and

45
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,320
the issue becomes trying to get that

46
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,439
gear on and off there's a roll pin that

47
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,520
goes through it and you've got to be

48
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,240
able to knock it

49
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,799
sideways

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,560
to get at that shaft because the

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,240
shaft comes through

52
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,079
right here on the end

53
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,759
and the roll pin goes through that shaft

54
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,960
so the roll pin is perpendicular to the

55
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,280
shaft

56
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,479
the issue is

57
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,640
how do i get a punch in there to deal

58
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,680
with that and then the other issue

59
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,040
was

60
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,479
i don't know if you can see but i

61
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,479
modified this cover

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,879
it's a little tab i welded there

63
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,920
normally this sits

64
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,920
right down in here

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,400
but

66
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,400
in order to get that gear out

67
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,120
this one you have to pull it straight

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,760
out it won't come out because the space

69
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,120
between the shaft and the side was so

70
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,599
small you can't get the gear out without

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,280
cutting this

72
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,040
so this is all by way of saying this was

73
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,080
the difficulty i faced when trying to

74
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,400
switch

75
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,319
right before i planted and drilled the

76
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,760
cover crop

77
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,000
had no problems with the wheat with the

78
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,319
normal size gearing but when i wanted to

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,920
try to use

80
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,400
the smaller gears not only did i have

81
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,480
the wrong part but to put that part on

82
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,879
and off

83
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,400
just be i want to say a nightmare but

84
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,560
trying to get in there and then you have

85
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,400
to get new roll pins every time and

86
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,560
you're pounding on it

87
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,159
and there's got to be a better way so

88
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,000
that's what i'm trying to come up with

89
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,239
some kind of little press

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,840
to press that roll pin out

91
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,480
um

92
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,239
in order to go to the the smaller gear

93
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,560
the different gear when i have to really

94
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,480
dial the uh the rate down and

95
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,159
essentially what this these half speed

96
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,720
gears do

97
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,200
instead of having let's say

98
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,360
a half inch slit or a quarter inch slit

99
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,280
in this seed cup

100
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,200
you could you could double that size

101
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,879
that width of that seed cup because the

102
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,040
gears are only turning at half the speed

103
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,640
it lets you flow flow a little bit

104
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,560
better and you get more sensitive

105
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,879
because i was down here

106
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,239
on this scale at like

107
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,040
seven or eight

108
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,040
when it goes up to 60 and

109
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,080
it's not very sensitive there's a lot of

110
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,360
slop in it and and it's just very very

111
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,680
um it was a challenge so i'm hoping this

112
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,680
video kind of makes sense

113
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,120
um but it's something i want to work on

114
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,120
in addition there's

115
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,680
various wear parts on this drill that

116
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,799
are going to need replacing the gauge

117
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,080
wheels

118
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,479
the

119
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,000
openers the seat openers

120
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,919
there's various parts with the seed

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,759
boots that need to be replaced as well

122
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,840
and and that'll all happen

123
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,280
at this point next spring before we use

124
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,720
it to drill

125
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,800
uh the peas

126
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,840
so uh thanks for watching

127
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,199
um try not to get too jerky here but uh

128
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,199
it's a it's a it's a really good drill

129
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,360
it's worked well for me but it just it

130
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,240
just needs some attention to work even

131
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,320
better

132
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,840
thanks for watching and we will see on

133
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,840
the next one bye
