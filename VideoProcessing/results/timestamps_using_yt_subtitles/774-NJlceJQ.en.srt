1
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,840
thank you

2
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,420
hi I am Penny Adler and my Gratz title

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,359
is on the on the screen it's making

4
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,460
goat's milk soap business sustainable by

5
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,300
implementing standard manufacturing and

6
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,180
testing protocols and just to kind of

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,160
talk about it I am a small farmer by

8
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,700
Watertown South Dakota we raise goats

9
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,140
and I make soap one of the cool things

10
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,579
though that we're doing is we're doing a

11
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,180
new product and I

12
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,920
um

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:51,480
see if I can show you but this is the

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,039
cream soap it's soap in a jar so it's

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,020
not bar soap it's just something totally

16
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,600
different and it's pretty unique there

17
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,020
are very few people that do it

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,000
so what's unique about it is the lather

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,680
and you can play with this lather and

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,119
it'll go and go and go so I just kind of

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,799
want to show you that lather because

22
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:09,000
that's part of the uniqueness of the

23
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,939
product

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,580
the other part of the product though

25
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:19,020
that I'll show you and I'm making a mess

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:21,540
here is that um this is my batch and you

27
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,060
can see it should be nice and brown and

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,820
it should not have this so I had a

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,060
failed batch and so that's kind of how

30
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,119
this got going for the grant was because

31
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,939
I love my product I don't love failures

32
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,920
and then the other part of it is is I

33
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,439
always want to be natural so our tagline

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,540
is wholesome living in a colorful world

35
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,640
we make colorful soaps but we also like

36
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,479
wholesome soaps so the question was is

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,759
can I make cream soaps 100 natural or or

38
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,759
what is what do I need to do to make it

39
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,740
safe for my customers

40
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,780
so that was kind of the impetus for the

41
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,060
grant

42
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,020
um in the end I wanted a consistent safe

43
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,140
product

44
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,140
I wanted to be selling financially lower

45
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:09,179
my costs or know my costs lower my costs

46
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,920
and then also because I'm excited about

47
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,580
doing this I wanted to be able to Market

48
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:16,020
that hey when you buy from me you know

49
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,319
what you're getting a consistent safe

50
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,319
product

51
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:25,500
thank you our goals are these were the

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,319
four product goals from our grant

53
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,599
I'm going to today talk to you about the

54
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,180
first one create manufacturing and

55
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,700
testing protocols if you like what you

56
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,220
hear I would love to talk about the

57
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,160
other ones so um you can always invite

58
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:44,780
me back and I would love to talk about

59
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,780
preservatives and also product testing

60
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,120
so the first thing I want to talk about

61
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,700
is um everything that I do

62
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,340
is soap almost everything

63
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,980
so but I'm going to tell you that

64
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,760
everything I developed in this is based

65
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,440
on

66
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,440
cosmetics

67
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:11,700
so the question is for you is SOPA

68
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:15,180
cosmetic and the answer is sometimes

69
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:18,300
so if you want your soap to be soap you

70
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,060
have to have a consists of an Alkali of

71
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,340
salt of fatty acids and that's no

72
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,200
problem as soon as you mix lye and oils

73
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,540
you you meet that definition so

74
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,819
everybody meets that definition usually

75
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,340
and the product must be labeled sold and

76
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:34,620
represented solely as soap so that means

77
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:37,319
if you sell something that cleans

78
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,819
you are selling soap and the Cosmetics

79
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,819
don't apply to you

80
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:46,560
however sometimes your soap is a

81
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,720
cosmetic so I do not sell soap

82
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,879
I sell a product that will make your

83
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,099
skin feel good after you use it it makes

84
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,560
your skin feel soft it feels

85
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:58,440
moisturizing

86
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,659
I make the process of making soap the

87
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,120
interaction between the lies and the

88
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:05,459
oils creates glycerin glycerin is a

89
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,620
humectren it attracts moisture out of

90
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,140
the air to your skin and doesn't that

91
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,019
sound moisturizing as soon as I say any

92
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,239
of those things I'm a cosmetic

93
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,160
so because of that everything I've

94
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,919
developed in this presentation or in my

95
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,220
own practices is based on I am a

96
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,160
cosmetic

97
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:29,340
I am not a drug

98
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:32,180
if I sell a soap and I tell you that

99
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:36,060
this soap is really good for acne

100
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:38,220
I am crossing a line so even if I

101
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,699
formulate it maybe it's a high coconut

102
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,620
oil soap so it's high in cleansing if I

103
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,780
promise that it's going to do something

104
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,820
I fall under the Food and Drug

105
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,160
Administration and have to have my

106
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:51,660
product tested and whatever it takes to

107
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,699
be approved

108
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,160
um there are other examples are

109
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,780
antibacterial cleansers and then they

110
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,580
use talk about the ones but you know a

111
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,160
lot of people a lot of the our soaps are

112
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,380
good for people with psoriasis and other

113
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,080
skin conditions but as soon as you start

114
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,479
talking about that you're a drug

115
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,699
so everything I talk about today I'm

116
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:14,520
going to talk about is going to be based

117
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:16,860
on what the federal drug and cosmetic

118
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,320
act talks about so there's two things

119
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:23,940
that they really talk about is you must

120
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:25,979
sell a product that's not adulterated

121
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,139
or misbranded

122
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:31,139
and that's what I'm going to talk about

123
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:34,560
because what I did then is developed my

124
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,820
good manual good manufacturing practices

125
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,479
so that

126
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:41,220
I can meet these two answers

127
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:43,139
or um

128
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:45,780
things you have to meet

129
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:47,639
all right so here's the first goal I'm

130
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,500
going to create manufacturing and

131
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,080
testing protocols

132
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,800
I'm going to establish GMP to reduce the

133
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,380
risk and the documentation that you can

134
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,539
use for this also is ones from the

135
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,820
federal government that basically

136
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:06,600
exactly tells you what's in their

137
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:09,199
regulation and then Marie Gale also puts

138
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:13,680
out a book that is specifically

139
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,539
directed towards GMP for soap makers and

140
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,479
cosmetic makers

141
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:20,580
so it's very good for us

142
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,039
just to give you an idea these are all

143
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:26,039
the sections

144
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:28,199
GMP is big and it gets real detailed and

145
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:30,300
my goal was not to add all of this

146
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:34,080
administrative work to make my job

147
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:38,660
harder my goal was to make my product

148
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,880
better and so that everything I do I did

149
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:44,220
to create accountability for me so that

150
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,660
my customers could could have that sense

151
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,979
of

152
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,520
that they knew what they were going to

153
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:51,360
get every time so I don't look at it as

154
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,819
a

155
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,240
a Bad Thing even though it's a lot of

156
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:58,500
Regulation or a lot of documentation

157
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,560
because it's going to mean a better

158
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:05,520
product and accountability for me just

159
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:08,699
you know GMP is not regulations it is

160
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,060
practices it is not enforceable there is

161
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:13,380
no audit from anybody the Cosmetics I

162
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,340
believe the government wants you to

163
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,280
register

164
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,740
it is optional

165
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:21,479
and so I haven't done it and probably

166
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:22,880
won't because I'm not sure what benefit

167
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,199
it would give me

168
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,120
but uh

169
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,400
it is just a practice

170
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,620
it is Big you can tell from that

171
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,419
previous slide so what you want to do is

172
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,940
start with the biggest or the easiest

173
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:38,160
areas that have the most risk

174
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:39,900
to make mistakes

175
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,300
all right so now we're going to start

176
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:45,539
talking about

177
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:48,180
the different parts of GMP so the

178
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:50,819
easiest place most times to start is

179
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:53,819
with your master formula so this is

180
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:55,979
basically your recipe with enough detail

181
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:58,440
that you will find when you follow it

182
00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:00,960
you will get the same results every time

183
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,060
and without it you can't guarantee that

184
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,220
to your customers with it you already

185
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,560
know of the base that you can create a

186
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,940
consistent product

187
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,620
a couple of things that contains the

188
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,900
ingredients in the quantity detailed

189
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,360
steps but not just do this do this do

190
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,979
this but it also includes you know what

191
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,020
temperature should the ingredients be at

192
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:21,660
that step or how do you know when mixing

193
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,819
is complete what Trace looks like or a

194
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,879
thin trace or a thick Trace

195
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:28,259
also details for quality control what

196
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,940
does it look like what does it smell

197
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:32,279
like how thick should it be when it

198
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,240
comes to cream soap those types of

199
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,700
things

200
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:38,459
you know you have the right amount of

201
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,399
detail when

202
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:43,440
a person that's reasonably familiar with

203
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,720
similar projects products can follow

204
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,080
your master formula so that was the

205
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,480
hardest thing because the examples they

206
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,519
go way way deep so remember my goal was

207
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,800
not to create this administrative

208
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,920
nightmare so that was one of the hard

209
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,260
things was to find a level of detail

210
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,279
that was correct the second thing is the

211
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,740
batch record

212
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:06,899
so it is documenting that you are

213
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,160
following your master formulation the

214
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:10,680
easiest thing you can do is kind of

215
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,899
start with your master recipe and then

216
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,600
create checkbox that's the easiest way

217
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:17,279
to move from that to that

218
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,980
includes the date made who made it how

219
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,760
many units and also a batch record or

220
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,760
batch log number

221
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,000
all right so that's the recipe now

222
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,519
um

223
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,680
this came second for me but really in

224
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,920
the process it happens before you make

225
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,140
your recipe is your ingredients back

226
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,120
so if your ingredients are not

227
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,339
consistent from batch to batch you can't

228
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,320
even if you follow the same recipe you

229
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:47,040
may get different results

230
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,200
so this part is establishing standard

231
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,820
criterias for your ingredients and for

232
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,800
your materials

233
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,640
then you're also going to look at your

234
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:58,920
suppliers and who will supply them to

235
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,420
meet your specifications

236
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,160
and then as you go through your master

237
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,980
record then you'll verify the

238
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,500
ingredients before using them

239
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,440
one thing I learned is that you want to

240
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,959
have two vendors for each of your

241
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,420
ingredients or materials because what if

242
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,760
they run out and you need to get some

243
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:19,800
made or what if they quit selling your

244
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,420
product and I you know you've all had

245
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,560
that where they're back ordered and

246
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,980
you're struggling to all of a sudden

247
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,380
find it the one thing I ran into was I

248
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:31,200
used a lot of Malibu bottles for my

249
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:34,140
lotion and I have yet to find a

250
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,120
substitute

251
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,980
supplier that I probably should have

252
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,660
never started I should have picked

253
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,700
something out and I'm using another

254
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,880
bottle I don't like it as well

255
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:46,680
that's the way this all right so so far

256
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,660
this is everything we've talked about

257
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,279
you need a Master Formula batch record a

258
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,620
bachelor of material specs inventory log

259
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:54,839
and inventory batch record so that seems

260
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:58,680
like a lot of information

261
00:10:54,839 --> 00:11:02,820
so let's take a second look at it

262
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,920
so this is then how it starts right so

263
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,860
before I can order ingredients I have to

264
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,560
set my specs this is my example of what

265
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,180
I use for my material specs I probably

266
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,980
have a sheet of paper that has four of

267
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,260
these on a page so that I can cut them

268
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,440
up and I will have them posted on my

269
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:22,040
racks so that when I look at them I have

270
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,040
in front of me my shelf life

271
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,540
when I and it also tells me who I will

272
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,000
order them from

273
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,320
it also has the scientific name and

274
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,779
we'll talk a little bit about that in

275
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,320
the end why it's important

276
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:37,440
um

277
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,240
here cocoa butter Raw

278
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,100
when you go to order if you don't have

279
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,620
this now what did I use in that last

280
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:45,360
recipe was it raw or refined

281
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,339
because there's a difference in color

282
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,260
and there's a difference in odor and

283
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,300
there's a difference in texture

284
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,560
so when you go order it that's when

285
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,560
these things become important

286
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,220
when that ingredient then gets shipped

287
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,560
to you you come in and you have your

288
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,000
incoming raw material lock

289
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:06,360
so there you're going to write your Lot

290
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:09,420
number and what I do for lot number is I

291
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:11,820
use a system where the first two numbers

292
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,339
are the year that I received it in so

293
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:16,800
I'll have 15 Dash and then I'll have

294
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:19,079
zero zero one and I'll go through and

295
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,000
that's my Lot number when I received it

296
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:22,860
the name the quantity in those things

297
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,300
expiration date which is really cool

298
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,519
because I have it on the specs so I know

299
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,260
where that to find that information

300
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:31,019
and then a little bit of the other

301
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:32,640
information there is a final column that

302
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:34,740
says accept doesn't meet the

303
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,899
specifications and that's real easy

304
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,700
again you have them right there in front

305
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:41,100
of you you know how it should look and

306
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,899
you should know how it should smell

307
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,760
um

308
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:47,519
an example of one that you don't think

309
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,100
of maybe is like tubes where the lids

310
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,920
don't fit on type like lip balm tubes or

311
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,600
I had a batch of bottles where the

312
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:56,279
little plastic had a little catch on all

313
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,800
of them I mean those are the kinds of

314
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:01,079
things that you start to notice when you

315
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,600
are actually inspecting things as they

316
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:07,500
come in

317
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:10,500
after I um right on my log then I also

318
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:13,620
create a label for the product that I

319
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:15,120
have fixed to it and that just is real

320
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,760
simple it has product name Lot number

321
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,500
and expiration date and that way when I

322
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,500
pick something up because one of it was

323
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,720
to verify it when you use it in your in

324
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:26,220
your rest in your recipe right and so

325
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,680
there is a quick way to verify the

326
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:32,040
expiration date

327
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:33,480
uh just so you know when I started this

328
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,360
one of the things I did do was an

329
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:40,320
inventory of my um

330
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:42,300
uh ingredients and anything that I

331
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,339
couldn't go back that year to find the

332
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,019
the invoice for and I knew some of it

333
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:47,899
was older than a year those special

334
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:51,740
ingredients you got the try once

335
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:54,660
and I threw out because I couldn't

336
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,339
validate that and so I said I'm gonna do

337
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:58,680
it right gonna have that consistent

338
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:01,260
product so there was ingredients I threw

339
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,060
out at the beginning of the process

340
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,579
here's an example of my master batch

341
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:09,660
recipe so it's kind of like the bottom

342
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:11,660
part of my cream soap recipe and then it

343
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,440
has the directions

344
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:14,339
and

345
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,839
um

346
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:21,600
I include the ingredients how much of it

347
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:25,019
and also then I include the NC name

348
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,940
because I want those so accessible when

349
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:29,120
it comes to writing labels that I just

350
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:32,040
make it part of everything

351
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,980
and then those are the directions so

352
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,440
yeah so now you can see

353
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,480
you know I weigh the coconut oil and add

354
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,339
it to the slow cooker I weigh the

355
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,680
sunflower oil and add it to the slow

356
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:46,079
cooker they're pretty detailed

357
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,120
possibly you could say add your soft

358
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,639
oils add your hard oils you know you

359
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,660
would have to really think about that

360
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,060
um

361
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,000
however like number 13 just to point out

362
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:59,279
it's like pour the lies into the water

363
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,620
under the stove vent on high so I think

364
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:05,220
that's good because

365
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:07,440
um you do and I also talk about Sir and

366
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,940
it isn't you know it's dirt until it's

367
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,519
dissolved and water is clear so that's

368
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,800
an example of not only

369
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,500
you know mix the two but what it should

370
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,300
look like afterwards

371
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,660
to me this is the best part that I've

372
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,519
really loved is the batch log it has

373
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:24,959
product number and I'll talk about how I

374
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,019
come up with my product number in the

375
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,040
next slide prac name date here's my

376
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:31,740
batch number

377
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,480
so the first thing that this does is

378
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,680
when you start the next batch you go to

379
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,060
the batch log to find out what batch

380
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,459
number you're starting with next so

381
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,440
that's the big thing I use my batch log

382
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:43,019
but I say okay which soaps are done

383
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,899
curing I go to my bachelor I say okay

384
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:47,579
these and I'm ready to be done curing I

385
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:50,639
didn't talk about that but you would

386
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:53,279
also have a master recipe for how to

387
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,160
package your soaps so it isn't just for

388
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,320
the manufacturing side but it's also for

389
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,820
the packaging side and how you get them

390
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,600
out the door

391
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,220
um

392
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,079
you think the cream soaps are probably

393
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,180
harder because how am I going to get

394
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,339
them in my jars so they might feel like

395
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,680
a little bit more then it talks about

396
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:14,040
how many units so if I make

397
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,839
a log of soap at 16 bars at four and a

398
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,540
half ounces each and so that's why I'll

399
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:21,360
fill in so product number you

400
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:23,279
come up with your own way this is what I

401
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,560
do I have the first two letters talk

402
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,740
about what kind of product it is so my

403
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:32,760
CS is cream soap my LS is liquid soap my

404
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:36,199
BS is bath soap or bar soap

405
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:39,240
then my middle one

406
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:42,899
the next segment we'll talk about what

407
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:46,320
recipe it is so under ls-form one that

408
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:49,139
is my form my first recipe if I have

409
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,100
more liquid soaps I'll add form too

410
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:52,500
um

411
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,300
the bath soap you can see there I have a

412
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,500
swirl recipe that's a little bit slower

413
00:16:54,300 --> 00:17:00,959
moving for me facial soap will have

414
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,839
more gentle ingredients and so it's

415
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,819
formulated different so I will

416
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,919
um that tells me what recipe I'm using

417
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:09,360
and then the last segment will tell me

418
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,679
fragrance

419
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,419
um

420
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,360
there

421
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:18,120
because I also and I'm trying to do this

422
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,280
better I don't buy a lot of different

423
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,679
colors when I make soap I try and buy my

424
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,780
primary colors and mix them well if I

425
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:26,459
want to get the same purple now I'm

426
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,860
going to have to start documenting so

427
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:31,500
that'll come into play even when I do

428
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,720
that or how much fragrance this kind of

429
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,520
soap gets over this kind of soap that

430
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,980
all comes into play and that's why it's

431
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,380
important to have them for that so on

432
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:44,039
that batch log then that's my product ID

433
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:45,780
will have my bs-sw Dash

434
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:48,059
whatever

435
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,980
all right so now I'm ready to make soap

436
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:52,320
finally and so now I'm going to follow

437
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,080
my batch record so it's similar to the

438
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,760
master record except you can check

439
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,679
things off except there's a few other

440
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,240
things to point out

441
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,640
at the top

442
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,100
you have your product ID

443
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,600
so I have that you also have your batch

444
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,760
number

445
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,580
so those are the two things that this

446
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,620
will identify this batch of soap and

447
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,539
then you also have your date and I put a

448
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,580
start time and the end time because I

449
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:19,980
want to know how much my soap is costing

450
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,059
me to make so that helps me with my

451
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:23,940
labor

452
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:26,700
when I do my costing I will start and

453
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:30,419
end time for manufacturing certain end

454
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:32,280
time for Packaging and so I get a true

455
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:35,280
cost of my labor

456
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,960
and then I'll have the grams listed and

457
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,880
then I will also document the actual

458
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,919
amount used and again this is because

459
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,320
what is my standard operating procedure

460
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,820
going to say if I get a little bit too

461
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:47,280
much is that okay

462
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,559
is five percent over okay as one percent

463
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,020
over okay or one percent under okay I

464
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:54,000
mean what what is my variance level that

465
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,580
I'm okay with

466
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,440
um because I don't always pour straight

467
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,960
and then as soon as I do that then I

468
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,820
create a little tag that has the product

469
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,940
name the batch number the manufacturing

470
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,919
date and that goes with first with the

471
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,900
log and then after I cut it it goes with

472
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,059
that and that's how it's identified on

473
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,700
the shelves

474
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:17,580
I didn't say that when I create that tag

475
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:20,940
for the ingredients a lot of times you I

476
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,679
have to put um packaging tape over it

477
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,120
because I'm telling you there is not a

478
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,419
whole lot of inks that can hold up to

479
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:29,039
oils and so that helps

480
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:32,160
all right then standard operating

481
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:35,340
procedures so these are the ones with

482
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,260
the most words I think and the harder

483
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,880
because you just do it

484
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,080
or you don't do it and you should be

485
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,419
doing it so the good thing about

486
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,539
standard operating procedures is it

487
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:48,660
makes you question your your how you do

488
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:51,360
things so I have a scale

489
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,400
is it accurate

490
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,200
how are you going to know

491
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,919
how often should you test it to make

492
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,919
sure it's accurate

493
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,520
is there a right answer

494
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,960
the right answer is whatever you put in

495
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,880
your standard operating procedures and

496
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,140
there probably is a little bit for some

497
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,820
of them

498
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:10,440
a little bit better the calibrate your

499
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,820
pH I think meter is supposed to be every

500
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,100
month

501
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:17,520
um but there are other things safety

502
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,919
precautions look at I have wild hair

503
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,919
do I need to wear a hair net

504
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,080
you know all of those things I have a

505
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,660
workshop my husband walks by my workshop

506
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,179
and wants to come in do I let him in

507
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:33,240
after he's been out in the goat Barn you

508
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:34,559
know it's some of that stuff which he

509
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,840
doesn't like it when I think like that

510
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,620
and I kick him out

511
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,260
um

512
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,539
the other thing we didn't talk about is

513
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,580
10 minutes okay

514
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:46,860
um is how I how do you handle complaints

515
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:49,520
so there's another

516
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:51,539
possibly log that you can create but

517
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,220
afterwards it's really hard because it's

518
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:55,860
the emotional thing do it ahead of time

519
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,600
it's not so bad

520
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:01,200
all right

521
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,220
and these are examples just of other

522
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,900
things

523
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,179
um

524
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,860
that you can talk about I guess I didn't

525
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:11,160
show you on that other screen there was

526
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:13,620
a link um Marie Gayle also has

527
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,160
um a good book on standard operating

528
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,160
procedures

529
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,200
oh there it is

530
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:24,480
so um oh we're going to talk about

531
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,820
labeling

532
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,400
yeah so that was the other part for

533
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,780
Cosmetics you have to have unadulterated

534
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,460
product and you have to have good

535
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,000
labeling so we're going to talk about

536
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,000
that next

537
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,600
and they have different rules for your

538
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,700
front panel which is what the the

539
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,900
customers are most likely to read and

540
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,640
the other panels which are called

541
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,520
information panels

542
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,500
and on the front panel

543
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,440
you have to have your name your identity

544
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:55,080
and your your contents your contents

545
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,539
must be in both metric and in US

546
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,580
measurements

547
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:01,500
you have to identify is it soap or is it

548
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,860
whatever else is it

549
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:07,320
and also then this is the part that I

550
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,880
put up with from the government then is

551
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,500
then that your texts they get very

552
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,760
specific and it needs to be an eighth of

553
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,940
an inch high based on the letter

554
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:18,380
lowercase o Place bottom parallel in the

555
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:18,380
bottom thirty percent of your label

556
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:24,360
um these things

557
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:27,059
they will say good practice is even if

558
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,559
you're selling soap to have this much

559
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:32,840
okay

560
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,840
um again those soap is not regulated

561
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,440
the information panels the back or side

562
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,240
panels and that's what they say if

563
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,520
you're selling soap you at least want to

564
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,740
have your name and address

565
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,020
oh did I

566
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,919
okay

567
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,500
um

568
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:51,120
directions for safe use and you have to

569
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,980
have your ingredients and warning

570
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,320
statements so let's take a look at a

571
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,900
couple of those your name and address I

572
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,419
live on the farm do I really want my

573
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:03,559
Farm address on my label

574
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:08,100
the answer is no but you will

575
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:10,140
the uh now the the caveat is is if

576
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,640
you're listed in a printed phone book

577
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:14,760
you don't have to

578
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:18,299
so I may look at that I do have people

579
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,980
that drive up in my yard and oh we just

580
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:21,419
stopped to see your

581
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,340
your uh

582
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:25,080
thing and that's okay but I would prefer

583
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,919
a phone call

584
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,020
um

585
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,059
can I use a post office box and the

586
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:34,159
answer is no

587
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:37,320
um right now the h

588
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:39,780
scg handcrafters handcrafted soap

589
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:43,440
cosmetic Guild is putting together a

590
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:45,120
petition to take to allow PO Boxes but

591
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,120
right now you cannot use them it has to

592
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:51,120
be your physical location

593
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,059
ingredients you need to use the NC name

594
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,860
which is from the Cosmetic ingredient

595
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:59,039
dictionary except your Botanical

596
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:01,080
ingredients you use their common name

597
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:04,020
so

598
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,240
you list them in order the ingredient

599
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,760
that there's the most stuff is first

600
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,900
and then you go down

601
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:15,720
if you buy any type of a base or a blend

602
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:18,539
you have to list those ingredients

603
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:22,140
individually too with respect to your

604
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:24,960
soap so you can't just add I don't buy

605
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,820
any base Blends or bases so I'm not sure

606
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,919
what you have but you have to split them

607
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,960
out well uh

608
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,419
I used to do a lotion base that I would

609
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,820
buy so I can't just say lotion base I

610
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:38,580
would have to list in any ingredients I

611
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:42,020
have a really good recipe now

612
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:44,880
um ingredients a couple more things

613
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,799
fragrance you can list as a ketchall you

614
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,480
don't have to break it free so a lot of

615
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,120
us like to say that we're phthalate free

616
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,659
or paraben free or all those things

617
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,880
um

618
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:55,860
they don't have to list it other

619
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,700
products don't have to list it because

620
00:24:55,860 --> 00:25:01,500
of this and you can just list fragrance

621
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,840
ingredients that are less than one

622
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,760
percent you don't have to worry about

623
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,120
the amount

624
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:11,400
there any order is fine color additives

625
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,980
there is a list of approved color

626
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,260
additives and you have to abide by that

627
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:18,240
but you can list them all last

628
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:20,480
no matter if they're above that one

629
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,460
percent or above that other

630
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,980
so those are always last

631
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:29,640
after all the other ingredients

632
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:31,919
so some of you use essential oils so do

633
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,440
and you'd like to probably say hey I use

634
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,240
lemongrass essential oil what if you use

635
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:39,299
lemongrass and tea tree

636
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,880
so if you want to list that you are

637
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:43,440
using a lemongrass essential oil and you

638
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,539
also have something else you have to

639
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,100
list all of them you can't you know if

640
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:49,200
it's a proprietary blend and you want

641
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,240
only want to list a couple of them nope

642
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,880
you have to list all of the essential

643
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,500
oils if you don't want to do that then

644
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,299
you have to list it as fragrance and

645
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,820
then you don't have to give out your

646
00:25:57,299 --> 00:26:03,840
proprietary blend

647
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,980
there are some special rules about

648
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,100
um

649
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:10,500
Trade Secrets and those I don't know nor

650
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,179
did I include them so

651
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,460
um so that kind of is the end of my

652
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:16,620
presentation was there any questions for

653
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,080
me so the question was is how many goats

654
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:21,059
do you need to um before to make your to

655
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,600
make it worthwhile

656
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:28,440
so what um for a bar of soap I say that

657
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,900
one-fourth of your bar is goat's milk

658
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:33,840
so if I make a four ounce bar I need one

659
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,520
ounce of goat's milk so in a gallon of

660
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,360
goat

661
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:42,779
milk I get 128 ounces so that can make

662
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,159
me 128 bars from that one gallon of

663
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:46,980
goat's milk

664
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,419
so if you're making milking a goat and

665
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,260
they're giving you a gallon of milk a

666
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:53,340
day

667
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:55,980
you're making a lot of soap every day

668
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,600
so one goat for you to start we'll do it

669
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,900
and I only have a handful of goats that

670
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:04,460
I milk I don't the rest are meat crusts

671
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,460
or meat commercial Meats

672
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,720
foreign

673
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,900
foreign
