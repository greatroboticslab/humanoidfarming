1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,560
the constraint on farms today in asia as

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,440
in america is largely because the

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,360
management is not appropriate

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,920
it just clearly says to you you've got

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,440
to focus on the agronomy

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,520
the next big jump is going to be

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,920
agronomy

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,800
how do you do agronomy

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,320
where do you where do you do agronomy

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,400
i've never known

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,400
in 50 years maybe

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,000
of a real impact coming from some sort

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,640
of agronomic research that was

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,600
experimented and

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,719
evaluated and

16
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,480
proven

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,879
out of an experiment station

18
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,120
i just don't believe it i think it's got

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,640
to be done on farms

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,640
under real conditions where the farmers

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,039
doing the planting incorporating

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,000
whatever suggestions the specialist is

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,000
telling them to do
