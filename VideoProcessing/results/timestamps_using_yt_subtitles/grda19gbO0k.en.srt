1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:06,750
good morning modern standards we've been

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,269
getting a lot of questions lately about

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,460
our winter piglets I guess they're

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,799
really not winter piglets but about our

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,280
winter pink so we got to give them some

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,440
water

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,630
we've got some food scraps for him let's

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,810
go have a chat with him like a fireside

9
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,810
chat with piglets they're waiting for us

10
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:42,059
hello prosciutto and Coppa I'll get some

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:58,260
left over they smell the leftover food I

12
00:00:42,059 --> 00:01:00,480
have some of the first questions have

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,339
been your piglets a huge are there

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,110
really piglets well that's the debatable

15
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:09,630
I guess we wanted to get piglets that

16
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,880
were at least 60 pounds so that way we

17
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,830
knew they had enough fat on them to make

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,390
it through the winter here being in

19
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,240
northern New Hampshire for just the two

20
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,130
of them being outside once the piglets

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,409
get bigger you don't have to worry about

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,570
them being outside and if you got like a

23
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,990
thirty pound cake lit and you live in a

24
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:30,930
northern climate like we do and you only

25
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:33,270
had two of them they're gonna they're

26
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,270
gonna have trouble staying warm for a

27
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,740
little while so we went to the farm we

28
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,509
picked out our pigs I'll put a video

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,430
right here the farm at raised the

30
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:43,740
piglets out on pasture their whole life

31
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,930
he had six of them in a pen when we got

32
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,880
there there are around sixty pounds or

33
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,130
so when we picked them out these are the

34
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,200
two we wanted so he kept him in the barn

35
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,350
for a week and he fed him grain and they

36
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,119
packed on the pounds if they weren't a

37
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,890
hundred pounds when we got him last week

38
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,350
there are a hundred pounds now they're

39
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,780
huge so we're not gonna have any issues

40
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,180
with these two pigs going through the

41
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,099
winter time which is perfect that's what

42
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,929
we wanted winter pigs are gonna go

43
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,180
through more food because they burn a

44
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,099
lot more calories just to keep warm

45
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,049
their feed to weight conversion

46
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,299
isn't going to be as good as it is

47
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:21,510
during the spring and summer months now

48
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:22,290
for us in our area winter piglets are

49
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,939
cheaper

50
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,760
we paid one hundred and twenty five

51
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:29,730
dollars per piglet in the springtime and

52
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,319
those piglets were around 30 to 40

53
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,739
pounds

54
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,840
our winter piglets we paid $75 a piglet

55
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:39,150
form and they were between 80 and a

56
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,340
hundred pounds there's a huge difference

57
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,950
right there the biggest reason for that

58
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,170
is supply and demand most people want to

59
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,420
raise their pigs in the springtime and

60
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,340
in the wintertime the average person

61
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,989
doesn't want to be bothered with it the

62
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,790
nice part about that is that's going to

63
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:55,739
offset the cost we're going to have

64
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,629
invested in the feed and the bedding

65
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,609
only raising them outside hair on

66
00:02:57,629 --> 00:03:02,250
pasture I'll bring you up close to them

67
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:04,799
the Heritage raised pigs they're not

68
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,439
pink pigs their heritage breeds and look

69
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:10,700
how hairy they are these pigs are gonna

70
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:13,919
do amazingly well in the colder weather

71
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,450
we're using hay for bedding they have an

72
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,430
area where they can get in out of the

73
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:19,680
wind and they can bury themselves and

74
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,169
hay the reason why we're using hay

75
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,389
versus straw straw is like double the

76
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:26,340
price of hay there's not a lot of

77
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:27,810
farmers up here who grow wheat so I

78
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,879
think that's the biggest reason they got

79
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,530
a chuck in all the straw pigs do really

80
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,090
well outside of the elements they just

81
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,579
need a place to be in and out of from

82
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,379
the rain and the wind so it doesn't need

83
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,849
to be a fancy barn or heated barn

84
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:41,790
they just need a place to get in out of

85
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:45,449
the elements think of wild pigs they do

86
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,829
really well outside constantly when I'm

87
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:50,459
raising animals I like to think about

88
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:53,129
that like oh the animals thrive or do in

89
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:55,049
nature normally how do they do it so I

90
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:58,879
kind of try to implement those plans in

91
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,879
action when we're raising up here

92
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,290
we're going to be doing the deep bedding

93
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,790
system not just in where they can get in

94
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,620
and out of the weather but the whole

95
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,019
head we're just gonna be layering it

96
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,640
more and more with hay whatever we can

97
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:14,409
get our hands on throughout the winter

98
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,389
we are gonna be spending money on the

99
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:18,459
hay and whatever else we can get for our

100
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:20,889
deep bedding but we need to think about

101
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:24,039
that as an investment into our food

102
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:27,340
freedom this right here the deep bedding

103
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:29,139
system is a big part of our food freedom

104
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,930
we're gonna compost this and this is

105
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:34,120
gonna grow our beautiful food next year

106
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,370
and then we'll have a huge abundance for

107
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,220
us to give away to friends and family

108
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:42,130
and feed our animals in return to make

109
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,900
us some peanut better bake it you can't

110
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,729
get any better than that we install the

111
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,830
hot and cold water spigot on our house

112
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:49,750
okay so we have access to hot water

113
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,550
during our three-day hog harvesting

114
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,260
classes I'll put a link to those videos

115
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:56,169
right here it's been working on amazing

116
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:58,090
I even have an access to warm water to

117
00:04:56,169 --> 00:05:00,759
give to the animals the chickens love it

118
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,160
the pigs love it right for shoot oh

119
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,289
you'll love in the warm water the way I

120
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,139
look at that is but no one give them two

121
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:10,419
Hut cuz we can burn them but on a cold

122
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:12,550

if I know how you can enter in for your

155
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:19,490
chance to win one of the other reasons I

156
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:21,949
love having animals around on the

157
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,689
homestead is when it's cold out and when

158
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:26,449
do you don't always feel like getting

159
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:28,159
outside and enjoying it and sometimes

160
00:06:26,449 --> 00:06:29,389
you're not going to enjoy going out and

161
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:30,889
how to take care of the animals and

162
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:33,349
that's fine there's nothing wrong with

163
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:35,569
it but I really enjoy having the winter

164
00:06:33,349 --> 00:06:37,969
animals as it forces me to get out every

165
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:40,280
day at least twice a day and go feed

166
00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:43,069
them in water and it makes me go outside

167
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:44,599
and enjoy the beauty yes it might be

168
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,669
called but it's beautiful

169
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:48,800
right now it's snowing up I wasn't

170
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:53,449
already taking care of my pigs I'd be

171
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,129
inside so I just love that it it forces

172
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:56,840
me to get out and it makes me look at

173
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:58,580
the elements in a different way it makes

174
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,830
me see the beauty around the farm

175
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:03,289
one thing I love and enjoy doing is

176
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,129
taking photos for Instagram I don't do

177
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:07,039
it all the time

178
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:08,990
but I do enjoy taking a nice snapshot of

179
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,710
an area and then I can appreciate it

180
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:14,840
more when I upload to Instagram like I

181
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:16,039
wasn't looking at just that one area I

182
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,529
was looking at the bigger picture

183
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:20,479
sometimes it's just nice to focus in on

184
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:22,639
a small thing and see what you've done

185
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,680
and what you've accomplished and it

186
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,839
makes you feel a lot better but what's

187
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,300
going on sometimes it's just so much

188
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:32,029
chaotic stuff going around in our life

189
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:33,620
in the world on the homestead to just

190
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:35,120
