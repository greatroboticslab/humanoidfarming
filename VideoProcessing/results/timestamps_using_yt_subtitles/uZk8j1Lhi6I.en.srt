1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,640
there are very inspiring and exciting

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,799
things happening at the pine ridge

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,359
reservation which is home to the oglala

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,920
sioux

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,759
in south dakota this video is going to

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,440
introduce you to what they are doing to

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,560
restore resilience

8
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,359
economic independence self-sufficiency

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,400
and cultural revival among the lakota

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,439
people

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,519
being in alliance is about being

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,800
in service to each other and when you're

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,439
in service

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,080
it's about a yes of course attitude

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,440
being an

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,360
ally also means that because i'm

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,160
committed i'm going to explore further

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,000
and dig deeper and see whether where the

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,840
growth opportunity is there for me

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,840
and if i can actually add valued

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,160
everybody loves the cultural native

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,879
everybody loves the ceremonies we share

23
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,159
but when it comes to talking about

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,920
the hardships and the injustices and

25
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,600
the reality of what native people deal

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,560
with on a day-to-day basis

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,400
that native isn't so popular so being

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,119
willing to stand next to

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,119
that outspoken native that isn't always

30
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:27,840
talking about the most popular topics

31
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:27,840
i think that's what makes a good ally

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,320
i think showing up as an ally starts

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,159
with a contextual

34
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,920
understanding of not only what has

35
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,200
happened but what is happening

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,520
and i think it's really important to

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,600
remember that this isn't past tense and

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,680
these injustices are happening every day

39
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,600
and we're actually seeing them

40
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,040
unfold for people like we're seeing this

41
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,680
healing happen for people within the

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,640
camp

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,479
to this very day people don't have clean

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,439
water they don't have running water they

45
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,159
don't have

46
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,439
good food they don't have housing so

47
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,960
they're just really in this

48
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,200
mode where they can't thinking about

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,560
like intergenerational trauma and

50
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,079
epigenetics and

51
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,680
really hard to heal something when it's

52
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,039
like like you get a wound and it scabs

53
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,239
up and the sun keeps coming like ripping

54
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,920
it off and it's like

55
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,680
you know it's ongoing it's not like it

56
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,800
has it hasn't stopped yet it's been

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,720
going on for

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,959
like 500 years since then we've been

59
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,000
like in survival mode trying to just

60
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,599
survive and it's hard to really focus

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,440
on anything else you know like building

62
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,599
happy communities and having

63
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,440
healthy relationships with your children

64
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,120
it's just the willingness to help you

65
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,840
know the willingness to

66
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,840
ask questions when it's appropriate

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,000
showing a respect for the culture for

68
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,959
the land for the spirituality for the

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,800
people

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,280
if you treat the earth in a good way the

71
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,840
earth will treat you in a good way

72
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:51,840
and it's just a mutual respect is what

73
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,840
it is really

74
00:02:52,100 --> 00:03:05,840
[Music]

75
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,840
oh

76
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,280
right now we've got the second annual

77
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,400
iwps convergence

78
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,200
we had one last year and the convergence

79
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,000
is really

80
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,920
our event to bring together folks who

81
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,920
are working on these different projects

82
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,080
who have these skills around natural

83
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,239
building gardening

84
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,159
and to just come together in community

85
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,720
to really show the power of community

86
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,879
and what

87
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,760
the interrelationships can create we

88
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,799
have people

89
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:39,840
from all over the world all

90
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,920
nations converge on pine ridge and

91
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,040
then we have community based projects

92
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,239
that they

93
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,319
help to implement on pine ridge i'd say

94
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,720
that this year we're really

95
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,680
deepening our relationships and we're

96
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,400
also

97
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,439
spreading to support these food

98
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,439
distribution

99
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,200
networks across the reservation so it's

100
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,000
not just one site anymore

101
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,760
this has now become the tool hub for the

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,799
reservation and we also have

103
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,280
other places where they are creating

104
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,799
gardens to heal emotional trauma

105
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,720
there are a lot of residents who come

106
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,720
over to folks from other residents

107
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,239
and we make it very accessible we'll

108
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,079
cover fuel costs whatever it takes i

109
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,239
mean it's free for all

110
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,000
native folk to really showcase what's

111
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,360
happening here to demonstrate it

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,080
and to use this energy to

113
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,840
activate and mobilize our projects

114
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,120
moving forward as well

115
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,479
we work on low-cost alternative

116
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,720
replicable models that any family can

117
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,520
implement with a little bit of help

118
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,120
across the reservation so we build with

119
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,479
tires and

120
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,800
a lot of industrial cast off and junk

121
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,320
basically people approach us and say we

122
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,280
have a piece of land and we want to do

123
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,199
this for a family

124
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,759
and then we go out and take a look and

125
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,160
if we if it's within our ability to help

126
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,440
them

127
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,840
to do their project then we partner up

128
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,680
on it

129
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,840
and figure out a way to get the funds

130
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,400
necessary to get things together

131
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,880
this is our experiential farm or place

132
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,800
to do

133
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,240
builds and experiments and then see if

134
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,639
they're replicable if they're

135
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,280
economic enough to use here on pine

136
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,360
ridge

137
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,880
and we're all food producers the hope

138
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:25,840
being that we can

139
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:25,840
put a dent in our food desert here

140
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:46,000
[Music]

141
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,840
when i heard the term permaculture and

142
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,880
that was many years ago and i said

143
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,680
what the hell it's nothing but but white

144
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,280
people

145
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,960
and they're going around the world and

146
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,120
they're you know they're taking the

147
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,280
best practices of all the indigenous

148
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,160
nations and they're putting in a package

149
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,000
and then they're

150
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,759
saying oh look what we invented

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,240
permaculture look at this

152
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,960
but really as as my brothers here

153
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,319
mentioned

154
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,120
it's something that the indigenous

155
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,000
people have been doing for thousands of

156
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,759
years

157
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,600
all this permaculture knowledge that we

158
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,319
have we're just trying to reiterate all

159
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,840
of it because we

160
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,120
are like i most of you know our

161
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,800
ancestors have been doing this for

162
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,759
thousands of years

163
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,199
my family we used to cultivate and we

164
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,919
used to plant

165
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,960
and it was communal it's huge

166
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,759
practically the whole

167
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,560
community came to plant these enormous

168
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,960
fields

169
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,039
we practiced crop rotating everything we

170
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,639
had more than four cornfields

171
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,319
and we would plant these fields like in

172
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,080
three days and then

173
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,319
of course during harvest that was

174
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,199
distributed to everyone

175
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,639
when we plant corn we plant seven seeds

176
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,280
one is for us

177
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,639
one is for family one is for the animals

178
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,960
one is for the birds

179
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,400
one is for everyone one is for the earth

180
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,880
that's how we plant

181
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:04,000
as we move from this egocentric

182
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,960
colonialist ideology back

183
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,240
towards this indigenous ancestral

184
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,120
knowledge

185
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,800
that is ecocentric that as we move

186
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,240
through that transition

187
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,319
we all recognize and forgive

188
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,759
our part in the equation and that we

189
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,800
actively work

190
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,479
towards embracing our humanity

191
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,400
reaching out to each other and

192
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,440
