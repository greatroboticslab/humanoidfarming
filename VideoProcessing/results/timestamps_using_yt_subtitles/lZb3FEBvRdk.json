  "text": "[Applause] we wanted to keep it quiet i don't want to scare the crocodiles i'm gonna go feed a crocodile right now this could get interesting i love you [Music] what is up everybody chris as well as the pond guy we are here at the alligator farm in saint augustine florida for the winter retreat and we are rocking and rolling full of energy today well you you definitely are i'm excited because we have a lot of newbies and so a lot of newbies are going to be with you and a lot of the advanced guys are going to be over with ed at the other project so we got two projects going on this is my first time here what a beautiful place i talked to john the director last night he said this is one of the third oldest zoos in the entire country so we're gonna have a lot of fun today and we're gonna start them on live in the aquascape lifestyle i love it that's fine holy cow so as greg said we are here taking over the alligator farm today i am standing in front of what is going to be the job site for the 8x11 pond with about a six seven foot stream on it this is where the ecosystem pond is going to be installed this will be a bird enclosure so we're gonna have waterfalls back up over there meandering little stream maybe we'll include some driftwood elements for them to perch up on but just like shallow pools slow moving water that kind of stuff and then the pond will sit over in here skimmer over on this side this is going to be a training exercise for a lot of newbies so what i love about events like this is yes we have the advanced build upon which ed is leading oh look at my hair the bonds but um what i love about this is ed is of course leading the advanced build but today we are doing a just a standard 8 by 11 ecosystem pond and the simplicity of it the 20 products in 20 steps and that's what we're going to achieve so the whole part of the point of this yes is to build an incredible beautiful enclosure bird loving stream that's visually amazing but the more important thing is to educate our customers the contractors and some of the people that are actually do-it-yourselfers on how to efficiently put in a pond and do it profitably so we want to teach them the right way so that they can avoid all the pitfalls that we learned over the years so the point of this space back here is to show them the basic math or arithmetic or just a basic level of water features so i've got some incredible cacs that are also going to be with me i've got jay duke over here river cross hey mark how are you feeling today huh how you doing today give me this thing good morning good morning it's a nice chilly morning but it's going to be a beautiful day for a build a pond day so how many people do we have at their first ever build upon day show hands yeah look at that wow that's awesome that is terrific these build upon days are a hands-on experience we want to encourage everybody to jump in and get involved and talk which i don't think is going to be a problem with this group we seem to have a very energetic group which i'm completely loving we've got mr chris hanson that's going to lead this build i'm just kicking it off and saying hi to everybody and answering any questions and what i love about chris this is what he does this is his job out there doing this every single day so i'm going to let chris hansen tell you why he changed it from there and there and a little bit of explanation how the day's going to go chris hansen everybody first of all thank you everybody for being here like i said yesterday under the tent i'm so excited and i just i love this this this really gets me going and this is why i do what i do is to i love seeing all the fresh faces i love seeing people that i know and have deep friendships with like greg said lean into these guys that have been doing it a while they are invaluable resources not just myself or greg please network with these people that have been around the block they know what the hell they're doing they're going to help you avoid a lot of the pitfalls just don't be afraid to ask [Music] okay so it is 9 30 in the morning we're a little behind but not because of anything besides talking but we're doing this 20 products 20 steps so the pond is marked out skimmer's on one side bio falls is on the other we're putting the pipe down and once the pipe is down we're going to start digging the pond out great group so that right there is a typical filtration system that you will see there's a swimming pool filter that is filtering there's a swimming pool filter which you see all the time that is filtering a pond versus a swimming pool first digging going on right now [Music] we got some young guys here let's chip that out we've got a slab of concrete underneath there sidewalk [Music] we've got jay and tim over here kind of explaining some of the next steps we've got the underlayment in now what we're going to do is we are going to get that epdm liner we've got jackson sammy over here we're going to set that thing in there get some more underlayment in and we're going to start rocking this pond at the same time we are going to start attaching the skimmer underlayment going build a ponde everybody networking [Music] ah so there's the pod father and we've got everybody following over so what are we going to see guys that's an alligator what drink get eaten okay so they said you gotta feed the allergy crocodile so i'm gonna go feed a crocodile right now so this could get interesting [Music] [Music] [Music] wow [Music] yes [Music] here hey great job everybody it's been an incredible couple of days yes and right here is our new feature super proud of the guys for creating this look at how great that is isn't it fun to be completely think this is uh it was it was just an incredible time so many new faces a lot of new faces a lot of people finding us on the youtube vlogs and everything else so listen if you guys want to be part of this go to aquascapeinc.com we'll put a link down below in this video and you can see what the next opportunity for a hands-on training event is everywhere in the country because we're going to be coming to you and if not just check out the aquascape university but for me to be able to do this it's just like the old times build upon this you've been doing this since 1996 and we're going to keep doing them maybe in your area or you just fly and come to whatever area we're in good job chris thanks buddy all right isn't it insane what a small army of newbies to aquascape and aquascape ecosystem ponds can create a huge shout out and thank you to tim wood jay duke pete donahue brian rosen john adams april dugan and so many many many more people but also all the new people for coming out and being a part of this we're gonna get out of here we're gonna go check out what ed is doing and go check out that advanced build [Music] holy cow we are back we've got the man to make the legend of course ed the pond professor fast forward about two weeks since we kind of hard stop out here right yep ed's wearing his green shirt for the winter retreat which signifies that we may have had a group photo which usually is the end of a project and we're also standing in front of the gila monster shed and there used to be 35 pounds of stone 30 pounds of stone and it's been changed over to brick because there's gonna be a patio going in soon because the pond is done the pond is done 100 done and it looks awesome i can't wait i have i have i've i've taken a little glimpse of it but we're gonna show you so ed i'm gonna follow you let's go baby all right so ed everything went smooth right everything went great and that was because we spent a lot of time in the beginning you and i have been doing this a long time we know the benchmarks we know where we need to be so we made sure we had to get all those different things completed the big challenge we had if you remember was putting in that under drain all that groundwater coming in causing problems edges collapsing down we had to manipulate everything to make it work and it came together because once we got all that infrastructure in place we were able to focus on the beauty and this is what we got oh my god are you kidding me fine i know right it was awesome so we killed it the team that we had out here master cac certified aquascape contractors coming in from around the country coming together working as a team which is what i love because we were able to split up into multiple groups what we did i spent the time in the very beginning laid everything out gave them the background of what you and i did here two weeks ago showed them all of that stuff and then we started tackling everything we hit the intake bay we finished up that beautiful little southwestern arroyo which is going behind that that cypress stump we put in those big logs we got that wetland finish we did the waterfalls we did all that detail work the edging the plants the lights and graded everything but it's still not a 100 finish because there's a massive structure going over the entire top of this and they are starting on monday so there is no time there's no rest in this the brick is here patio's going in next footers are going in place this is going to be covered john and jen are gonna start planting this up with that beautiful southwestern look which is just gonna be incredible i cannot wait to come back here in about a year to check this one out awesome awesome awesome eddie thanks brother go get a cold one thanks thank you all right so that was awesome to get kind of the intro from ed if you remember when we last left off we had about 85 90 of this rocked and we had a couple frame rocks in the wetland dry fitted and installed all we needed to do is beautify it over here we've got the intake bay area these are those external pumps that we talked about so we've got an 18 000 gallon per hour pump and a 12 000 gallon per hour pump drawing in 30 000 gallons per hour feeding that amazing looking waterfalls and wetland filter as well as the circulation jets that are along this back side and down at the bottom that we talked about remember those steps that we put in once that water clears up you'll be able to see but this goes down into here then there then there then there making this very very approachable and interactive what i love and i mean love is the shape of the pond i love these peninsulas we managed to really capitalize on the square footage that was in here and we just took over and made an incredible space for john and jen to relax get in but also enjoy we've got the little seating area over here there's april what up april april was instrumental in helping myself oh wait wait wait there he is come here what do you think i love it man shawn and i have known each other for eight years now and i gotta tell you he's one of my best homies in the industry and there's a lot what i know and have not been able to do in the past and what you guys have seen our videos for this guy right here so he is jason's brother he is a very valuable member of earthworks and without him this all wouldn't have happened so he's a fantastic guy i just wanted you guys to see face with the name that we were talking about earlier in the video so thanks bro thank you you did a great job thank you sir you're the man so anyways we've got the intake bay we've got this straight down section that we talked about where we're gonna bring the patio up out over you can see all these big craggy rocks these peninsulas the incredible shape of this pond really making it organic and interactive now that you guys can see where water level actually is in the pond you can see that big cypress log that dives down into the water the way we intended it you've got that large cavity where it's hollowed out great place for carnivorous plants but it just really changes the shape we've got this aquatic planetary behind it with this gravel beach avalanche landslide but guys girls everybody alike look at these waterfalls now if you remember it was just that rock that rock that rock and that rock we only set this stuff and then we dug out the wetland filter filled it got all the gravel and substrate in but we didn't do any of the beautiful stuff on top and the guys did a fantastic the guys did a fantastic job of pulling it off creating that vision i know when we were out here the last time we had talked about splitting the waterfalls back behind this triangle rock getting a little kicker over there big waterfalls and then just a like a nice raging ripple effect a lot of white water this looks incredible absolutely incredible i love the change in direction it just turned out outstanding the edge work is incredible guys look at all that open water if you remember the amount of energy and effort it took to get down to that four and a half foot depth was a lot you can't even see the architectural wall right now because the water's a little murky and that's okay that will all settle out but it turned out beautiful that's the biological filter right up in there everybody so that's that wetland filter so that upper pooling area with that enormous log along the back edge there's a log here just the incorporation of these wood elements is so crucial in helping make this thing look natural and organic and then of course you've got the main waterfalls dumping into that upper pool which is the wetland filter everything looks outstanding i can't wait as ed said for that lanai to get built and really see this thing totally come to fruition when the patio is in where i'm standing the walkway everything over there and then the landscape i know john and jen are going to take extremely good care of this i know they have great vision because we've seen what john and jen have been able to do over at the alligator farm so they definitely have their work cut out for them but i know they're up to the challenge guys this is an incredible water feature it's been an incredible journey i was so proud happy to be a part of the prep work i wish i could have been here for this but on the same token i was glad to be bringing some new people into the aquascape lifestyle helping coach them on how to build build water features that are going to bring enjoyment to everybody else's life till next time we'll see you later [Applause] [Music] high [Music] you",
