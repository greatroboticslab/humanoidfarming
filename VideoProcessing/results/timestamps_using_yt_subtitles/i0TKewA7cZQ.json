  "text": "folks that we doing welcome to Good Works tractors it's a chilly day to say the least outside so I thought we'd do something inside I just got a new air compressor and I've got a couple other of the California yeah California air tools brand air compressors as well and what I like about them most you can't get them locally at least that I've been able to find but they're very quiet if you're inside I just hate all that noise you can hear the heater going right now in the background probably and you just well under compressor is way worse so if the saw goes well and I bought all the right stuff for it here on Amazon then uh I'll turn it on at the end of this and show you how quiet it is it's it's pretty incredible this is this is the biggest one that I bought but it still uh well it says says on there somewhere yeah oil free and ultra quiet so we'll see what's all about just plugs into a regular 110 outlet let's get to it here here well actually a couple of things too I wanted to point out well I'm still getting moved in here so everything's a mess I don't have all my tools together but I saw this earlier I want to show you I did get I got a yank them rope like you guys talked about back when we got the uh the skid steer stuck so got this right here haven't had to use it yet but I'm sure I will sometime soon but got this big old there's a fat rope I think I got one that was rated for a lot of weight did come with a couple of shackles here too so anyway that was your guy's suggestion and I've got one other thing to show you that I need a suggestion on because this is super annoying here watch this let me get this out of the way I've got this little piece of paper holding that drawer in but watch if you just open it and want to close it again it just starts to open back up that's real Annoying none of the other drawers do that stay in place you know this one here stays all the other ones stay but not that top one that's real Annoying how do I fix that we'll put that back in there for now yeah here we go all right folks thought I'd tell you a little bit about this thing uh while we're putting it together again it's my third one I've got two of the one horsepower units one that I bought a lot well I bought both of them a long time ago one for my house and one for my shop and uh still using one at the shop I got the other one at the barn I'll probably end up bringing the smaller one up here to the to the house and leave this new bigger one out there at the barn it'll be more useful out there this is a 10 gallon tank on here 70 decibels two horsepower motor 125 psi Max 5.3 CFM at 90 PSI that must be a common readout I don't know so this thing is well it's California air tools but I don't want you to be misled there on the box it says made in Mexico the the motor itself says made in China 110 volt 15 amp so you can see we're going to have it hooked up just a regular outlet in our garage oh we're going to do a sound test too at the end and show you just how loud this thing is or how quiet it is maybe depending on on what way you want to go with it but the manufacturer of the video too it looks like maybe they found the noisiest air compressor to compare it against but that does give you a pretty good sound comparison between something that is pretty darn quiet versus something that is like chattering and loud and really annoying a few interesting points that the manufacturers States they've got an easy start valve allowing it for easier startups using less starting amps oil free pump allows it for use in a variety of temperatures you know and quotes cold starts and uneven terrain no oil in the pump the easy start valve releases a small amount of air from the pump at startup to produce a no load condition allowing the motor to spin freely and again it is a pretty large for its size at least 10 gallon steel air tank I read a review on on this one just because I wanted to make sure it was similar to the other ones I have and they didn't put this I think it was just this um little hose in here that made a big difference on the the sound level maybe they forgot to put the entire filter on I can't remember what it was but uh regardless don't forget to do it here we go I think that's how that goes was there a there was an unthreaded space there must have been all right five Ace 13. maybe it's metric real sloppy 17. 17. it's fine now but boy that nut is oh was spinning with it that nut is not oh that one's must just be a real fine line at how much you have to tighten it careful not to over tighten nope too tight that other one seems to go freely I don't know what I'm doing here still skidding a bit better but that maybe it won't it's literally gonna it's gonna come it's gonna take itself right off all right I thought we did something wrong on these uh casters you can see skid marks here no not that kind of skid marks but uh it is not freely moving I thought we were doing something wrong and we're not says tighten firmly come on I'm not over tightening that seemed to make the condition worse but if you don't tighten enough they just the nut starts to spin right off pretty quick anyway I don't know maybe we've got to add some grease on there it didn't call for it but but look that is it's not freely spinning I'm pretty sure it's the same casters on all my other ones too I don't feel like that's going to loosen up with time I could be wrong that one what the heck that one spins real nice oh we got one out of two of them working we'll just kind of lean it to the side a little bit we need to move it around folks we are proud to be sponsored by rim guard Solutions a liquid ballast weight it goes right inside your tires completely hidden we're big on safety on this channel these tractors are just too light and Tippy right out of the factory not only is it going to help with safety keeping those rear tires planted on the ground it helps with loader efficiency and traction too the benefits of rim guard include being the heaviest all-natural liquid ballast weight on the market it's not going to corrode your rims like the old calcium chloride it's not going to freeze and it's available at over a thousand dealers Nationwide find the dealer near you at rimguardsolutions.com well that just actually fits right down in there [Applause] whoa foreign why doesn't that want to go on there must be why they give you two [Applause] it's a little bit better I don't think any of these are big enough though okay this thing it is off right now oh and it came in listen to this a little bit of air in there probably because that's lighter for shipping that way there you go plug this in oh a little bit closer got that get ready you ready Chris okay it's not that high pitched still have a conversation in here instead of the what's going on that's pretty nice this is louder though than my smaller one I think one horsepower this is a two horsepower unit a little bit bigger I think it's like 10 decibels louder but that's pretty quiet I'm assuming you can still hear me talking right now what happens if I take this out oh yeah that is actually louder wow [Music] off pull oh it disconnects and then you pop it out to crush your regulator safety see the pressure right now is oh 40 50 60 65 ish no sorry oh that's that's a 60 there 30 to 60. so what it divided by it's an interesting uh Dash sequence so it goes up six pounds per 36 42 48 54 60. that's natural no anywho that's what that's at pressure regulator so this is the regulated air pressure this is a tank what you're putting out right here which we're at about 45 or a little bit over 40. so you can turn that down and then once you're using it or I guess if you had enough pressure to go up above here you know this is way up here or maybe way up here you can still regulate it so it wasn't too much coming out like if you're using air tools that kind of thing on off foreign so you're going to see this is a pretty easy simple thing to put together we did have some issues with the the Caster wheel down there at the bottom on one side I'm going to reach out to them see if we can get a different one the other one works just like it should I I don't think I'm doing anything wrong I probably am but we did have to get I bought a whole new uh hose kit and fittings and and just some some basic accessories for now until I get the Barn's getting finished so I'm going to get that all set up soon and I think we'll probably get a few air tools to keep out there as well but smaller units I've had for I think three years maybe a little bit longer and they've been serving me well and in fact not too long ago the guys at the shop just kind of pointed out just how quiet that compressor is out there so anyway we'll see as long as they fix that that wheel down there I'm probably going to be another satisfied customer I keep coming back to them I bought this one on Amazon I'll put a link down there you don't have to get the two horsepower they make a lot smaller ones too but for me the big selling point with these guys is is quiet so I I hate the loud chattery sound and uh this seems to fit the bill so that'll wrap it up for us today if there's anything else I should know about this I'd love to learn something new so leave a comment down below and if you got a better solution besides uh our hunk of paper here to keep that drawer closed I would love to know about it now of course we do sell and ship tractor attachments all over the country so go to goodworstrackers.com see what we have for sale if you enjoyed today's video I'd love to have you tag along hit that subscribe button right down below I want to thank you for taking time out of your day to stop by and until next time stay safe we'll see you soon [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]",
