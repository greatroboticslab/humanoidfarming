00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
hi I'm Lucy Edwards with the Alabama

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,259
Cooperative Extension system today we're

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,019
going to go over the basic steps for

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:12,269
taking your soil sample what do you have

5
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,400
a raised bed garden a lot of times

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,940
you're going to have high organic

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,119
material in your raised bed so this will

8
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:23,970
not be a routine soil test this will be

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,960
run as what they consider a saturated

10
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:30,599
paste test to analyze that high organic

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,809
matter it will still give you results

12
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,210
for nitrogen phosphorus potassium

13
00:00:32,809 --> 00:00:38,760
calcium magnesium and then if you want

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,399
additional micronutrients it can also

15
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,440
tell you that as well so a few things

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,950
that you will need when you take a soil

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,410
sample first you'll need a container so

18
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,020
this is just an old pot lying around you

19
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,550
can use anything just something to hold

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:01:00,870
the soil if you have a soil probe you

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,850
can use a soil probe but most of us

22
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,799
probably have a handy trowel lying

23
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,070
around and so that's what we'll use

24
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,799
today with in this race bed I'm going to

25
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,780
take a couple of different sub samples

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:18,330
mix them together in my bucket and then

27
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:20,369
lastly I will combine them in a ziploc

28
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:24,030
bag because this is about as much soil

29
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:28,220
as you need and then we'll place the

30
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:34,020
soil in our box and they will fill out

31
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:36,600
the salt form that goes with each sample

32
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,810
now each form you can do up to five

33
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,659
samples so you don't necessarily need a

34
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:46,009
form for each box you can use five

35
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,990
different soil boxes to go with one form

36
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:53,399
some people will ask well do I do do I

37
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:57,420
need a separate source ample for each

38
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:00,000
raised bed my response to that would be

39
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,909
if you can tell the major difference in

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,009
your growing conditions so like

41
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,500
this bed grew really well but the wood

42
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,110
beside it grew portly I'd probably do

43
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,900
two separate samples now if they're both

44
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,430
having similar yields then I would only

45
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,500
take one sample and what I would

46
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,720
probably do is what I'm taking my

47
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,630
subsamples I would take half from this

48
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,140
bed and half from that bed so we're

49
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:28,709
gonna begin sampling this bed we're

50
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,830
gonna take subsamples about four inches

51
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:35,660
deep and we're going to take on from

52
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,660
different parts of this bed

53
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:04,239
then we're going to mix this sample

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:07,989
together that way it's a blended

55
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,989
representation of our bed

56
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,590
we're going to take our ziplock bag

57
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:48,850
we're gonna fill it most of the way up

58
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:52,730
this is about half way and that's okay

59
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:56,210
the reason why we use a bag before

60
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:58,910
putting it inside the box is simply

61
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:02,660
because this soil is moist in the boxes

62
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:05,750
cardboard and over time that moist soil

63
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:08,810
will break down the cardboard box and if

64
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:11,030
you mail this when it gets to the soil

65
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:13,940
lab this box will be all falling apart

66
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:16,220
so therefore I like to put it in a

67
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:20,870
ziplock bag as you can see it fits

68
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:23,990
nicely in the box we're gonna close the

69
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:27,110
box according to the directions it does

70
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,940
have a little sticky seal here so it

71
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:32,480
closes you don't need any tape or

72
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:35,180
anything and that is our box the next

73
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,240
step would be filling out the name of

74
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:41,990
the sender so that would be your name

75
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,060
the mailing address the location and

76
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:46,940
then field name so if you have your

77
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:50,480
raised beds labeled or if you have them

78
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,340
like tomato bed versus pepper bed you

79
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,950
would put the the name of that raised

80
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,230
bed where it says building name and then

81
00:04:54,950 --> 00:05:01,250
crop to be grown so that may be pepper

82
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:03,260
tomato squash zucchini you could do

83
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:05,840
generic vegetables and it will come back

84
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:09,860
making recommendations for all of your

85
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,650
vegetables then last what we write on

86
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:16,150
the box we're going to then write on the

87
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:19,100
form so that way it correlates this box

88
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,320
name so if we named it named it box

89
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,880
number one

90
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,560
acres you have put down square footage

91
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,770
because obviously this is not an acre

92
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,910
and then the crops to be grown again

93
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:34,940
could be tomato vegetable tomatoes or

94
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:37,040
vegetables depending on what you put on

95
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,530
your box and that is how you take a

96
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,950
basic soil sample for a raised bed

97
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,950
garden

98
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,060
you
