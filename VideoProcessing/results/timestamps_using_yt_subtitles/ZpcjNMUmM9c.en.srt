00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,000
let's say you have a massive amount of

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,200
water and you have a bunch of different

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,720
pipes and you need to get that up real

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,240
up but of course you don't want to put a

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,880
bunch of pumps over here because that

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,840
will be a waste of resource well there's

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,879
one cool trick just utilize something

8
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,960
called a water tower all you got to do

9
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:19,199
is take a water extractor a bunch of

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,960
different pumps and pump that one line

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,439
all the way to the top once it gets to

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,320
the floor that you need it to go to all

13
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,760
you're going to do is you're going to

14
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,720
bring it straight down now that's on the

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,519
original floor that you needed to be on

16
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,439
what you're going to do is you're going

17
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:31,960
to take it to your water plant then

18
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:33,960
you're going to take the pump and put it

19
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,559
all the way to the end of the system

20
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,239
this is going to push this pump all the

21
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:39,480
way to the top but what about the rest

22
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:41,120
of them all you got to do is just hook

23
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:42,640
it over to the next one and then hook

24
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,559
that one to the next one then hook that

25
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,520
one to the next one and soon this

26
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,120
massive water pump plant is going up up

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,280
and away with only one two or three

28
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,520
pumps depending on how tall you're going

29
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,199
