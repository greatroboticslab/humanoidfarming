00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,980
There are many useful products you can find
on the shelves of your local garden center,

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,490
and a few products that most gardeners in
Wyoming should avoid purchasing.

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,460
One in particular is gypsum.

4
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,410
Gypsum is made out of calcium sulphate and
is advertised as a general soil conditioner.

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:25,880
However, gypsum really serves one purpose,
and that is to remediate sodic soils.

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,529
And the only way to know that you have a sodic
soil, which is high levels of exchangeable

7
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:31,310
sodium, is to get a soil test.

8
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:34,210
But don’t use gypsum as a general soil conditioner.

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:39,960
It has not been shown to adjust soil pH, or
to necessarily lighten clay soils, unless

10
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,410
they are sodic.

11
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,360
Another product that many Wyoming gardeners
should avoid using is lime.

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,140
Lime is calcium carbonate.

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:51,510
Most of our soils in Wyoming are already high
in calcium, and quite alkaline, meaning they

14
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,860
have a high pH.

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,000
And while many gardeners that move to Wyoming
from other states are used to using lime,

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,680
Wyoming soils typically do not benefit from
the addition of lime.

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,540
The best thing we can do to improve our soils
in Wyoming is to add organic matter, either

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:08,040
in the form of compost, mulch, or manure.

19
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,990
I recommend that you work with your local
Extension educator to get a soil test to determine

20
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:15,899
what nutrients your soil is lacking, and to
develop a plan for managing the soil health

21
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:17,020
in your garden.

22
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,100
For the University of Wyoming Extension, I’m
