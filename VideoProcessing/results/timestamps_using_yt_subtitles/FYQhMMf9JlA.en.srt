00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,180
speakers presenters and sponsors this

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,670
event is put together by the South

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,530
Dakota no-till association's SDSU

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:15,179
Extension and some help from the NRCS

6
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,760
crop consultants you can receive your

7
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,800
CCA credits for each session each

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,539
speaker has a separate sheet if you want

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,090
to receive credits you have to sign-in

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,699
and sign-out before and after the

11
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,289
speakers the sheets are in the back of

12
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:33,180
the room over by Ruth Beck

13
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:35,210
the first speaker today is Michael

14
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,390
Thompson he's a farmer and rancher from

15
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,910
Almina

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,010
Kansas might go along with his family

17
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,770
and brothers operated Thompson ranch and

18
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:46,489
farm and ranch LLC the farming operation

19
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,829
grows wheat corn oats barley and a

20
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:51,960
diverse cover crop mixes the ranch

21
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,270
consists of a cow-calf operation that

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:59,100
grazes on native range and cover crops

23
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:01,379
on farm grant farmland acres in 2009

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,809
Michael began a soil health regimen

25
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,360
program which has boosted yields lowered

26
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,700
costs and improved profits he has also

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,500
built a network of no-till producers he

28
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,450
has brainstormed with over the years

29
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,490
today he's going to share his knowledge

30
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,950
and successful strategies for a

31
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,970
profitable no-till farm and ranching

32
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:23,939
operation everybody hear me all right

33
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:28,439
yeah I am from Almeida Kansas I live in

34
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:29,820
Kansas bye-bye where my house is but

35
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:32,070
everything that I farm is actually in

36
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:35,100
Nebraska and I'm kind of an oddity and

37
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,680
not a President of Colorado no-till

38
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,000
associations so before we go too far I'd

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,189
like to invite you all since I am

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,500
president of the Colorado conservation

41
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:45,299
tillage Association this was 32 years

42
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,970
ago they named it it actually is now the

43
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,350
high plains no-tell conference February

44
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,670
4th and 5th we'd love to have you there

45
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,619
if any of these things that we're

46
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:54,240
talking about today with grazing with

47
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,649
cattle on cropland interest view we have

48
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,590
a lot of speakers that are doing this

49
00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:00,119
and western Kansas eastern Colorado and

50
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:04,469
some dry land climates about like here

51
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:06,710
so our farm is basically myself my

52
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,789
brother Brian and my father Richard

53
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,440
basically my father Richard was the only

54
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:11,640
full-time person up until three years

55
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,950
ago

56
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,270
I quit my elementary teaching job as a

57
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,310
kindergarten teacher and came home to

58
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,050
farm and helped him out my brother is a

59
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:22,550
full-time accountant and he helps out

60
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:25,950
all the time when he can so basically

61
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:28,320
we're in a 18 to 22 inch rainfall zone

62
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,900
depending on what you look look at

63
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,000
whether it's fifty or a hundred years

64
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,770
but we're in a pretty similar climate as

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,870
you we're just a little further south so

66
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,700
we do have rolling topography our

67
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,640
flattest field is one percent slope but

68
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,050
most of its 12 to 20 percent slope so we

69
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,870
have a lot of rowing rolling topography

70
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,120
I guess I want to start off by saying

71
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,709
kind of I'm not here to step on

72
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,870
anybody's toes I think that's how we

73
00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:53,970
grow is maybe hearing some new ideas so

74
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,500
I'm not trying to insult you if you're

75
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,090
still doing some of the practices I'm

76
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,830
talking about that I think that that's

77
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,769
how we grow if we hear how other people

78
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,260
have got away from maybe like summer

79
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:07,560
fallow or going going away from you know

80
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,019
going to different processes so please

81
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,730
keep that in mind today with that in

82
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,709
mind I think that we've done a really

83
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,660
good job as farmers of being very

84
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:17,700
proficient in chemical farming of

85
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:20,430
treating the soil like a chemistry set

86
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:22,019
you know knowing how much nitrogen to

87
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,519
put on how much phosphorus put on how

88
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,070
much potassium how many micronutrients

89
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,019
the soil needs to grow a crop but in

90
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,730
doing so we've kind of discounted soil

91
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,769
biology and the but and the benefits

92
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,120
that soil biology can give to us so I'm

93
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:35,400
going to talk a little bit more about

94
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,110
the ecological functions and about what

95
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,640
we're doing on the cropland to actually

96
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:40,110
stimulate the cropland to kind of do a

97
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,200
little bit more with a little bit less

98
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,420
of the fertility and the inputs so first

99
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,790
off we kind of become ecologically blind

100
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,160
like I said we've really got good at

101
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,130
treating it like a chemistry set but

102
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,450
they always call this country next your

103
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,100
country you know if we don't hit it this

104
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,510
year there's always next year you know

105
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,160
maybe it'll rain next year or maybe

106
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,860
we'll get an extra snow or something to

107
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:04,200
get a little bit better crop but a lot

108
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,570
of times we discount what we do in this

109
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,310
year makes or breaks us in the next year

110
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:10,019
so I'm not cool it up there you know

111
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,700
about it's not next year country but

112
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:14,579
last year's country you know how we

113
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,560
treat the ground this last year is going

114
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:19,620
to determine how our successes in the

115
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,140
next year you know in 2020 so you know a

116
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,000
lot of times I think also we've always

117
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,690
got the mindset to get just a little bit

118
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,220
more maybe

119
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,260
little more profit or get that extra

120
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,060
grazing or get that extra hang out there

121
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,640
and sometimes we've got to defer that

122
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:34,140
and leave it for the next year to feed

123
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,870
that soil life so that we can have a

124
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,700
better soil so I believe in this quote

125
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,470
that by Gandia says that there's enough

126
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,080
for every man's need but not every man's

127
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,340
agreed you know going back to when we

128
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,310
first started farming we were

129
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,950
conventional till we did wheat fallow on

130
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,510
a lot of our acres and I can remember it

131
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,860
would set up like a brick and even when

132
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,600
we switched over to no-till when we're

133
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,640
Kim Fallot it's set up like a brick we

134
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,890
didn't have pore space our water would

135
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,360
run off you know on we need to farm more

136
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,610
like that sponge you know we need to

137
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,620
keep a living root in the soil we need

138
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:07,980
to have that pore space so that water

139
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:10,110
and air and biological life can live you

140
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,630
know I'm not here to criticize anybody

141
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,890
this is in our area so I know that

142
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,200
there's people that are still doing to

143
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:18,450
this today you know how close are we to

144
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,740
actual soil are we close to dirt on our

145
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:22,050
farms you know I want you to think about

146
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,790
introspectively on your own farm are

147
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,470
there places on side hills where you

148
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,730
still got ditches are there places you

149
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,890
know where you know you could do better

150
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:31,140
and so that's kind of how we got started

151
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,970
into this but you can see that you know

152
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,460
water erosion still a huge problem in

153
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:37,050
our area wind erosion is a problem this

154
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,820
is actually a soybean field that was no

155
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,290
tilled and it still blows so if you

156
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:42,720
don't have that cover the wind can be a

157
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,460
pretty big problem this has been a huge

158
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,300
problem since grain prices were high in

159
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,770
the about 2008-2009 on a lot of our

160
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,860
rangeland is getting converted into

161
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,960
cropland this is about six years in so

162
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,520
what have we done to our rangeland we've

163
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,169
taken productive rangeland and turned

164
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,580
into really poor cropland you can see

165
00:05:58,169 --> 00:06:02,040
that there's a lot of places on there

166
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,540
that you know our water cycle isn't

167
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,950
functioning our water cycle is causing a

168
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,900
lot of erosion and we're losing a lot of

169
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,430
topsoil there so I'm taking some

170
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:13,470
productive ground and turning it into

171
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:17,190
unproductive farm ground you know it's

172
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:18,630
great to be ecologically aware but that

173
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,640
doesn't pay our bills does it we also

174
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:22,890
have to see where the profit is so

175
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,419
protecting that soil resource I can tell

176
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:26,190
you there are some profits and some

177
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:28,169
helpful things you know that that are a

178
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,870
profit profit wise that will help you

179
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:32,520
and first off it's it's estimated that

180
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,860
about half of the fertilizer we

181
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:36,840
currently apply to farmland is actually

182
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,630
applied just to make up for all of what

183
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,100
we lose

184
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,530
erosion whether it be wind or water

185
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,840
erosion you know so that's a pretty huge

186
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,490
amount and we really don't think about

187
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,200
how much erosion actually happens when

188
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,400
we see ditching across a field but if

189
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,950
you think your thickness of a dime

190
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,530
that's five tons of soil top top soil

191
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:55,180
lost so you know it doesn't take much to

192
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:56,680
blow or much to wash away before you

193
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,050
have quite a bit of nutrients and quite

194
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,730
a bit of topsoil leaving your field you

195
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,260
know as we go through this talk and as

196
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,970
we go through when you go home I hope

197
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,370
you think about it are you a banker are

198
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:09,700
you a miner of soil carbon soil carbon

199
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:11,350
basically most of our farmland and even

200
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,270
most of our rangeland has probably been

201
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,610
mined since we first came out here and

202
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:18,280
converted it to either grazing or or

203
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:20,980
farmland we took a really carbon rich

204
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,980
soil and you know we took grains off it

205
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:26,800
we took a hay off it we took many pounds

206
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,910
of beef off it we over grazed it person

207
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,170
that's more like the banker would

208
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,000
probably be somebody that's returning

209
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,710
their manure to their soil trying to use

210
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,260
some cover crops keep something growing

211
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:37,690
as much the year as possible they're

212
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,580
probably also trying to try to plant

213
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,980
some diversity in their rotation somehow

214
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,740
to get that Criswell carbon you never

215
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,600
really think how much soil is capable of

216
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:48,430
because what we currently call soil is

217
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,280
much more like dirt than it is soil and

218
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,440
I never even knew this I'm kind of a

219
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,330
soil I guess you'd call junkie or

220
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,590
obsessed with understanding how soil

221
00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:02,230
works so actually I was watching a it

222
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,880
was a documentary on the 1930s what led

223
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,920
up to the Dust Bowl and how we got there

224
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,320
you might think that this is basically

225
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,330
Ohio Indiana Illinois somewhere that had

226
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,100
really rich topsoil this is actually

227
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,050
Springfield Colorado which is down by

228
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,150
liberal Kansas and in Southeast Colorado

229
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,710
where if you go through today it's full

230
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,690
of yucca and basically looks like a

231
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,700
desert but when they first wrote that

232
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:25,000
look at how much carbon they didn't use

233
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,620
fertilizers in 1900 this was just

234
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,630
freshly broke ground and that carbon

235
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:31,030
grew that crop you know even mrs. guys

236
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:32,950
short those oats that the heads are over

237
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:34,360
a foot tall so you know that there was

238
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,890
an abundance and they talked about the

239
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,900
abundance that they first had when they

240
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,610
came west and you know as they tilled

241
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:42,310
they burned a lot of that soil carbon

242
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,320
out so you know growing up I was no

243
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:46,450
different than maybe a lot of you I'd

244
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,480
like to say I come from 40 or 50 year

245
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,690
no-till operation which is not so

246
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,790
basically we're riding at

247
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,690
years when I came back to farm with my

248
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,180
dad

249
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,880
we basically converted from conventional

250
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,140
till my early recollections were on a

251
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,420
forty three eighty six international

252
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,950
tractor and my job was to follow the

253
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,840
combine and disc as fast as I possibly

254
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,330
could because our ground set up like a

255
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,370
brick the other thing I remember is when

256
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:12,200
I was doing fallow there were ditches

257
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,820
all over on our side Hills and my job

258
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,320
was to go out and work the ditches in so

259
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:16,640
then I could work across it so that we

260
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,350
could go ahead and plant that ground

261
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,790
without the ditches we never thought

262
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,050
about why the ground was hard or why

263
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,400
there were ditches there is just the

264
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,800
things that we did you know we just

265
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:27,710
didn't think about soil that way same

266
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,990
way on a grazing operation we'd feed all

267
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,520
winter long in a dry lot setting we

268
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:33,020
kicked the cows out probably at the

269
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,210
first of April and we'd leave them till

270
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:37,010
probably end of October 1st November and

271
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,410
bring them back to the dry lot of our

272
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,510
pastures were always out of grass by

273
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,130
about August first they'd be tearing

274
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,870
down fences getting into crops and I

275
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:46,970
absolutely detested cattle so if you

276
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:48,860
think that I loved cattle and I got into

277
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,130
cattle you're wrong because I remember

278
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,200
about 16 17 years of age I was like when

279
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,760
I become a farmer I'm gonna get ever rid

280
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,190
of every last cow in the place and we're

281
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,540
gonna farm everything luckily through

282
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,070
some college roommates and through my

283
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,570
dad talking me out of it you know we

284
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,560
still have cattle on the place today and

285
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:05,120
I have found that they've been very

286
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,300
beneficial which we'll talk about in a

287
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,330
minute the thing that killed me though

288
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:13,280
was by age of 18 I was set down from my

289
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:15,170
mom and dad well technically my mom

290
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:17,000
because my dad didn't really want to

291
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:18,770
tell me this but break the news to me

292
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,170
but they said dad's gonna be the last

293
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,880
farmer in our you know family that the

294
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:25,610
barns not big enough it's not making it

295
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,680
financially you know go go to town get a

296
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:29,630
good job you know with benefits and stay

297
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,850
away from the farm so I was pretty

298
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:33,560
hard-headed though so I went and got my

299
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,850
elementary education degree and I

300
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,770
returned home I started teaching

301
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:38,839
kindergarten and you know farming nights

302
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:41,030
weekends and I was able to rent and buy

303
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:42,589
some ground that way so I I didn't give

304
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:44,210
up on it but I knew that that

305
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:47,000
conventional tillage way was not going

306
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,820
to be the way so basically I started

307
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,070
looking in how was the soil formed our

308
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,560
Prairie soils were formed under you know

309
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,360
animals livestock out on them they had a

310
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,800
living cover or a cover on him

311
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,350
year-round and they had a living Roode

312
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,180
as much the year as possible you know so

313
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,170
we needed to have more of that on our

314
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:08,070
cropland to start restoring those water

315
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,839
cycles and the nutrient cycling some

316
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,639
might think that I'm open to change

317
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,560
because I'm young actually it was the

318
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:15,360
other way around I kind of liked that if

319
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,329
it isn't broke don't fix it you know but

320
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,610
I knew that that wasn't going to work

321
00:11:18,329 --> 00:11:22,500
for me because I had to fix our soils if

322
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,589
I was to have a chance you know not

323
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,850
farming so back when we were under

324
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:28,110
conventional till we never thought as

325
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:29,699
well as anything more than just

326
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:31,800
something we'd planned it into you know

327
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:33,149
it was either dry or it was wet or you

328
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,139
know it was eroded whatever we didn't

329
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:36,810
think about it we just put the

330
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:38,970
fertilizer down the plant grew well now

331
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,470
we look at soil as being the priority

332
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,120
and the most important thing on our farm

333
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,440
because whether it's on the range land

334
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,600
side of things or whether it's on the

335
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,670
crop land side of things that's where

336
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,230
all your profit is derive from you know

337
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,670
there's no tract or no plan or no

338
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,800
combine that are gonna that's going to

339
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:54,660
make your soil better you know you're

340
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,699
gonna have to put the investment into it

341
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,459
and and see how you can make that soil

342
00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:02,010
better I like to view the soil like I

343
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:03,630
view my son or my children I wouldn't

344
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,760
leave them out in the Sun you know on a

345
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:07,410
hot day because they get a sunburn right

346
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,180
well think about if you go out and you

347
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,130
hay or you go out and your work your

348
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,810
ground and leave it bare to the Sun it's

349
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:15,329
gonna you know get a sunburn it's gonna

350
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,949
hurt that soil life same thing you know

351
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:18,990
with the tillage you wouldn't stick a

352
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:20,910
sharp implement in your kid they'd

353
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,500
probably bleed to death right well the

354
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,300
soil doesn't like all that tillage in

355
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,529
that disruption either so you know some

356
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,779
of those things are things to think

357
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:30,750
about here's been the hardest thing for

358
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:32,579
me personally to shake I think most of

359
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,140
us in this room have always grown up we

360
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:35,610
only get so much rainfall so much

361
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:38,100
snowfall there's only so much moisture

362
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:39,959
right so we come from that let's banking

363
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,089
you know that's that whole back back

364
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:45,750
mindset with summer fallow we've got to

365
00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:47,399
Bank that soil moisture and I'm not

366
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:51,029
gonna say it doesn't take moisture to

367
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:53,040
grow covers and also grow crops but

368
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:55,500
without that good cover over the soil

369
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,649
you can't really regulate your you can't

370
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,720
regulate any of your you can't regulate

371
00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:02,579
your moisture at all you know there's a

372
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,680
lot more days with our winds and our

373
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:06,149
sunny days to lose moisture than there

374
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,860
is to gain moisture you know we have a

375
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:11,970
lot more windy sunny days than we do

376
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:13,440
rainy days also we when the first time

377
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,360
when it gets dry what happens to our

378
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,180
soils that don't have resiliency they

379
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,320
start in the crops

380
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,850
hurting and they look like they're

381
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,190
starting to burn up so we pray for

382
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:22,600
moisture right well if we pray for

383
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,190
moisture and we only hold a third of

384
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,990
that moisture have we really done us any

385
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,029
service no not really we have to have a

386
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,830
place for that moisture to be held down

387
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:33,940
in the profile not just on the top of

388
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:35,770
the soil you know if I can say one thing

389
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,810
that changed my mind about moisture the

390
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,100
most there's a PDF down here at the

391
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:43,600
bottom called the new water paradigm

392
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:45,640
water and recovery for a climate that is

393
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,430
an absolutely free pdf you can get off

394
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,050
the internet and it talks a lot about

395
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,180
the water cycle and recovering that

396
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:55,270
water cycle so if you're interested in

397
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,680
that it's about 75 80 pages worth but it

398
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:58,959
really goes into depth about how the

399
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:02,200
water cycle works so i really suggest

400
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,790
looking that up you know as a PDF it's

401
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,050
really good you might have to read

402
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,760
through it a couple of times but it's

403
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,730
not really like a scientific paper it

404
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:14,200
reads pretty easy so something really to

405
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:16,089
look into you know in our area we're

406
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,120
always told cover crops use too much

407
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:21,610
moisture right well this was kind of the

408
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,470
side-by-side comparison this was really

409
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,830
apples to apples because the planters

410
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,510
rolled on the same day the only

411
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,980
difference was is my neighbor stopped me

412
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:31,150
or my neighbor's hired me and stopped me

413
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,560
and he's like what are you doing four

414
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,120
down pressure on your planter you know

415
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,560
we can't get it in the ground up here at

416
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,330
the top of the hill and we're getting

417
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,029
stuck down at the bottom of the hill and

418
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:41,709
I was like we just a backed her down

419
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:44,470
pressure off the cell it swells mellow

420
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:46,570
and so that's the difference with the

421
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,040
cover crops basically on their side that

422
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,170
was just wheat stubble you can see how

423
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,520
it's browning up and burning up on the

424
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,230
other side where we took wheat stubble

425
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,540
when we planted some millet some daikon

426
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:58,150
radish some rapeseed things to help with

427
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,220
the infiltration we did use moisture to

428
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:02,350
grow that crop but then when the rains

429
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,180
came we're able to keep the rain further

430
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,450
on the side hill and not all down at the

431
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:09,279
bottom so here's the After Effects you

432
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:11,260
can tell pretty much probably which side

433
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,720
had to cover if you look between those

434
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:15,640
those rows it's not too hard to see that

435
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,709
there's still some cover on the cover

436
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,360
crop side and on the side that was just

437
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:21,579
wheat stubble there's basically nothing

438
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,680
left a lot of that that's that heat

439
00:15:21,579 --> 00:15:25,089
heeded the plan up and it burned it up

440
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,770
basically it couldn't pull enough

441
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:28,690
moisture out of the soil fast enough and

442
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,080
over here so is about the difference

443
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:31,030
between

444
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:35,230
and ten bushel corn and the neighbor had

445
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:36,700
an insurance check so you know what

446
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,920
excites me about the whole thing about

447
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,630
covers and about soil improvement we

448
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,400
don't have to spend a lot of money on

449
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:44,290
them yes you have to plant you have to

450
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,150
spend money on the seeding and the seed

451
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:49,260
but we can use a lot of the free

452
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:51,670
elements number one the Sun we're using

453
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,870
capturing all of the rain and snowfall

454
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,750
that we possibly can

455
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,370
we're also using the carbon we're

456
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,870
capturing carbon from the air which is

457
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,330
totally free and I think that in the

458
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:03,040
next few years you they talked about it

459
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:04,360
for twenty thirty years now but I think

460
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,890
that we're really close to getting paid

461
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,630
for carbon credits that you will see

462
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:09,190
that as a big thing for your car if

463
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,620
you're starting to sequester carbon in

464
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:14,740
your soils we will start seeing a push

465
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:16,420
for that we're also increasing organic

466
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:20,110
matter by having that living root in the

467
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:22,600
soil we are stimulating soil biology the

468
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,190
earthworms the fungi the the bacteria

469
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,410
they're all making nutrients that are

470
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,940
plan available a lot of things that we

471
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,310
put on as fertilizers have to be

472
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:31,810
converted with it's biology and if you

473
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:33,280
have the biology working for you there's

474
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,020
a lot of amino acids and a lot of

475
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:37,440
peptides and other things that feed the

476
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:40,600
plant and you don't have to put it on

477
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,160
it all starts through the Sun most of us

478
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,590
don't think anything about the Sun at

479
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,570
all you know the Sun has a huge amount

480
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:49,030
of horsepower 500 horsepower tractors

481
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:51,250
pretty big right well that's five with I

482
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:54,280
think 24 25 zeros behind it four

483
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:56,530
horsepower to put it in another way if

484
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:58,390
there was a nice bridge that was two

485
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:59,980
miles wide and one mile thick from the

486
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:02,530
earth to the Sun it could be melted in

487
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,930
less than a second the sunlight that

488
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:07,000
falls on a square meter could power the

489
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:09,310
desktop computer for over a day so

490
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,930
there's a lot of energy and if that

491
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:12,820
energy doesn't have a green growing

492
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:14,620
plant it's basically like an oil spill

493
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,570
it's a it's a wasted opportunity we're

494
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:17,920
wasting that sunlight so we need that

495
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:20,440
green growing plant to have

496
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,690
photosynthesis and to pump sugars or

497
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,910
exudates into our soil those sugars feed

498
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:27,280
the soil life and then the soil life

499
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,260
feeds our crops so if we don't have that

500
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,520
like this field if we have bare soil

501
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,080
like this you know even though it's

502
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,910
planted to a wheat crop there's nothing

503
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,040
up there it's basically the sun's

504
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,840
working against us it's drying the soil

505
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,620
out it's killing off our microbial life

506
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,840
it's doing a lot of things that are

507
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,580
that are working against us so I'd

508
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,620
rather work with the Sun than against it

509
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,840
you know how effective is your rainfall

510
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:50,090
this is pretty common in our area on

511
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,220
people that are still following you see

512
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,960
that it seals off and it goes down and

513
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:55,280
it sits in the terrorist channel well

514
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,570
that terrorist channel you might grow a

515
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,950
little bit of crop in the terrorist

516
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,510
channel but that water should be across

517
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,520
the whole you know across the whole

518
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:03,740
field and stored down in the subsoil so

519
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,880
that your moisture so that your moisture

520
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,270
is there when you need it later in the

521
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,350
summer

522
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:11,720
you know how effective your snowfall we

523
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:13,340
do rotationally graze my dad still likes

524
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,600
to put up some hay so he does you know a

525
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,360
few lands around the outside of the

526
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:19,309
field and then maybe puts a few swaths

527
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,070
through you know for our for our wire to

528
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:23,870
go so you can see where he actually hate

529
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:26,090
over here there's about an inch and a

530
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,920
half to two inches of snowfall and that

531
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:30,200
actually had about 8 to 12 inches of

532
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,059
residual to hold the snow but it just

533
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:35,000
didn't hold the snow where we had the

534
00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:37,760
stockpile basically there was almost the

535
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,710
foot about 11 to 12 inches of snow out

536
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,450
there you know so that's making the

537
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,040
snowfall more effective because that's

538
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,750
creating a little microclimate it's

539
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,820
still staying warm under there when that

540
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,410
snow still melts it can still do some

541
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:51,200
infiltration so you're actually making

542
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:54,320
more effective you're using water to

543
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,840
improve the soil dad thought that I was

544
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,950
crazy I went and got some of these

545
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,540
moisture probes basically they're an

546
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,190
irrigation probe and we're a hundred

547
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:02,809
percent dry land so he laughed at me he

548
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:04,250
said we can't turn the water on Sun so

549
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,990
what are you gonna do with this I said

550
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,220
well I just want to know that I'm doing

551
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,210
right with these cover crops that

552
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,570
they're actually doing what I think

553
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:13,580
they're doing so the black line up here

554
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,559
is basically the moisture level in the

555
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,690
soil this green band is the optimum

556
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:21,170
optimum growing conditions for your crop

557
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:23,929
and anyway so this this black line as

558
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,880
you can see we put them in it was in mud

559
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:28,280
it was over a hundred and ten percent

560
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,230
almost 120 percent of slow water holding

561
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:34,070
capacity it was wet when we plan it when

562
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:36,530
we put these soil probes in well we put

563
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:38,809
our cover crop in and as everybody knows

564
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:41,510
cover crop season oyster so we started

565
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:43,520
using moisture and moisture and down

566
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,500
here at the bottom of that green band is

567
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,330
when it started turning brown and it

568
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,860
started getting a little sickly so we

569
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:50,450
decided we'd start grazing it and dad

570
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,280
was pretty much laughing at me saying I

571
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,600
wasted my money on these because he

572
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,160
could

573
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,410
what was happening you know I was using

574
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,450
up all my moisture well I was feeling

575
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:59,950
pretty low by the time this band got

576
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:02,560
clear down there it was pretty much

577
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:05,260
getting to be pretty Brown I mean it the

578
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:09,040
top for that blue-white stage is burning

579
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:11,950
up so one night in the evening we got

580
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,450
two inches of moisture in 45 minutes so

581
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,000
it was a horrible rain it just rained

582
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,380
buckets and I was sick to death because

583
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
the cows were out there I thought oh

584
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:20,620
they tracked my field up probably the

585
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,480
tears channels are completely full maybe

586
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:25,720
even washed and terraces out as fast as

587
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,230
it came but as you can see when I got to

588
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,000
the field

589
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,740
it really wasn't tracked up that much

590
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,790
there was a few spots and the channels

591
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:32,710
that had some water but they weren't

592
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,210
full and we didn't have any terraces

593
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:37,090
washed out I couldn't understand why

594
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:39,430
well we'd use that moisture up up here

595
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:41,260
but then when we got that rain look we

596
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:43,420
recharged everything so it helped the

597
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:45,280
infiltration enough that we did use

598
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:47,410
moisture but then we regained that

599
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,790
moisture because it had a place to go if

600
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,170
we would have followed that in that same

601
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,140
time period it probably would have had

602
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,700
90 to 80 to 90% moisture in that subsoil

603
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,960
and then when we got that rain we would

604
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,550
have had like a hundred and sixty or a

605
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,930
hundred and eighty percent I guarantee

606
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:01,330
it we would have had lots of ditching we

607
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,670
would have terraces washed out so we are

608
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:06,010
using moisture but we're creating an

609
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,840
environment where we're increasing the

610
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:10,090
infiltration and getting more water into

611
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,190
our soils we do this by retaining

612
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,540
residue I know this looks crazy too a

613
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,490
lot of people probably because you're

614
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,470
like oh my gosh grazing days you know

615
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,780
most guys want to take it down to where

616
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,610
they see some bare dirt that's not me I

617
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,560
need that residue on top because that's

618
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:26,050
what's gonna keep my evaporation at bay

619
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:28,230
so I am giving up grazing days up front

620
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:31,510
but it comes back to me the next year in

621
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:33,700
little to no chemical use and then I

622
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:35,170
also have a lot better crops that make

623
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,360
it through the dry times because it's

624
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:40,140
got that it's got that covering between

625
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,580
the between the rows

626
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,740
what does grazing look like this is 12

627
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,480
hours of grazing when they go out on the

628
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,950
sorghum Sudan there's a hundred and

629
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,270
twenty pear out there you can't hardly

630
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,360
see them that's about two and a half

631
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:54,340
acres and by the time they come back you

632
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,570
can see them and for me that's time to

633
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,130
move most people would have probably

634
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:59,380
gone another day out there till they

635
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:01,300
take it down even more but for me I want

636
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,530
that standing I want some standing

637
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,180
residue left they stripped all the

638
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,500
leaves and all the good stuff off and

639
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,850
it's time for them to move

640
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,520
so that's what twelve hours are grazing

641
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:11,920
looks like why is that residue key

642
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,540
because that residue regulates your soil

643
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,550
temperature you can't make it rain more

644
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:18,880
but you can keep that evaporation at bay

645
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:21,190
so 130 degrees that's basically like a

646
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,470
lot of bare fallow work ground or Kym

647
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,900
fallow they could get up to 130 degrees

648
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:28,450
in the summer maybe not quite that much

649
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,980
up here but it could in our area if you

650
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,930
can keep it covered you can keep it down

651
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,490
towards that 70 degrees and that 70

652
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:35,530
degrees a hundred percent of that

653
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,060
moisture is used for plant growth so the

654
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:38,710
cooler you can keep that soil you can't

655
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,080
make it rain more but your your water

656
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:44,590
can go further we are limiting

657
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:46,930
evaporation this is the same soil probe

658
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:49,120
that we had it also has temperature

659
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:51,130
sensors every four inches this pink line

660
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,750
up here at the top is the top four

661
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:54,070
inches which is going to fluctuate most

662
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,330
with the soil temperature because it's

663
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:58,060
going to be closest to the top of the

664
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:59,590
soil and on some of our hottest days

665
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:01,750
when we're over a hundred degrees it got

666
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,550
up to 87 degrees there so we're keeping

667
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,980
it more than twenty degrees cooler we're

668
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:07,780
keeping our swell microbiology happy in

669
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,980
that soil and we're also keeping it from

670
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:12,670
evaporating that way

671
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:14,080
I will harp a lot on soil cover and

672
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:16,360
carbon because that's what we're

673
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,730
deficient in we're gonna have to give a

674
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,280
little bit to get the system started so

675
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,840
why is it important because all life

676
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,430
we're all life forms we're all

677
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,220
carbon-based life forms on this planet

678
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:29,200
so you know it's pretty important this

679
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:30,940
is what I want you to take if you don't

680
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,350
take anything else from my talk please

681
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,390
take this home and think about this

682
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:37,120
carbon holds seven times its own weight

683
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,470
in water so basically every little bit

684
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,420
of carbon you're putting in your drought

685
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:42,190
proofing your soil it will hold the

686
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:44,170
water like nothing else will you know

687
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:46,120
there's no tillage equipment or anything

688
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:48,220
else that will do as good as carbon well

689
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,220
and that's why I'm gonna harp a lot on

690
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,540
soil covering carbon carbon is essential

691
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,250
in the healthy soil because it's the

692
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,690
food for the microbiology I think we've

693
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,890
all found that out if you're no tilling

694
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:59,200
for a long time and you have those

695
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:01,030
fallow periods your organic matter

696
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,830
doesn't grow does it it's because the

697
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:04,540
microbiology starts eating it they don't

698
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,340
like to eat on that organic matter

699
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:08,140
because it's like eating cardboard to

700
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,730
them they'd much rather eat exudates

701
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,680
wheat those sugars coming from the root

702
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:13,060
living roots but they will feed on that

703
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,150
organic matter and that's why we don't

704
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,340
see the organic matter

705
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:19,530
if you're not growing plants to increase

706
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:22,380
soil carbon basically they're just going

707
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:24,240
to tear the house down well this is the

708
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,770
difference that soil carbon makes looks

709
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,020
like a totally different soil this is a

710
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:29,940
Holdrege silt loam that's 2.1 percent

711
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,890
organic matter that's a point seven

712
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,020
percent organic matter this isn't

713
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:36,480
perfect by any means but there is a lot

714
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:38,310
more pore space down here this is a

715
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,070
yulie clay that's like our side hills

716
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:42,660
and you can see that's a lot darker got

717
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:44,730
more water holding capacity a lot more

718
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,620
carbon in there than the no-till

719
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:49,680
neighbor so the difference that carbon

720
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:51,120
does make we can change our soils and I

721
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,310
would have never known this how do I not

722
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,380
have a field day on my farm they wanted

723
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:57,240
a slope at night never dug it so up and

724
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,190
I suggest everybody go out and dig a pit

725
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,490
and see what you're doing in your soils

726
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:04,740
on the stuff that my dad had it was

727
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:06,180
pretty good soil really raised good

728
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:07,530
crops you know good corn good wheat

729
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:09,990
crops so he really didn't push the

730
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,610
covers when we first started out I got a

731
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:13,350
lot of side hills and stuff next to the

732
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,940
pasture that was pretty much you know

733
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:17,280
not functioning like it should it was

734
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,200
poorer ground so where we had the poorer

735
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,360
ground where we did the cover cropping

736
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,240
and we did like scat cover crops we did

737
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,280
like a cool season spring one grazed it

738
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,960
out followed by a warm season one grazed

739
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,850
it out and then planted it back to wheat

740
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,410
that's a pretty tight rotation we didn't

741
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:32,790
have a lot of wheat but then after the

742
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:35,160
wheat came off we put a warm season

743
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:37,050
cover back on and grazed it you can see

744
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,630
the carbon that we put in there that

745
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:42,180
those exudates that's 36 inches of

746
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:44,460
carbon this is about 11 to 18 inches of

747
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,870
carbon there where the no-till so we're

748
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,760
actually putting more carbon and that's

749
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:50,580
holding more water so we can we can up

750
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,440
our rotations more again this isn't as

751
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:54,210
far into the system this is about this

752
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,800
is on our fifth year in no-till this is

753
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,860
only the second cover crop because we

754
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:00,510
worked this was a on a crop share and

755
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,340
our landlord didn't think that covers

756
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:03,870
worked until she started seeing our

757
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:06,360
other ground progressed more than hers

758
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,900
so we started doing this on on her

759
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,190
ground

760
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,630
you'd see there's still a lot of

761
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:11,400
problems but what are we doing we're

762
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:14,000
starting to get those we're starting to

763
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:17,610
get that carbon put down into the soil

764
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,020
microbiology is money in the bank and

765
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,620
that's why it's important to take care

766
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,600
of it

767
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:24,470
you know a soil that's rich in carbon is

768
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,240
also rich in fungi and microbes

769
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,070
and all these things are cycling

770
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,960
nutrients and making plan available for

771
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,539
free we don't have to go and we don't

772
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,130
have to pay for it and they also when we

773
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:36,320
do put fertilizer on they stretch that

774
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:38,360
fertilizer dollar even further I'm not

775
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,460
advocating that you severely cut your

776
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,870
fertilizer especially right off the bat

777
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,659
because that would be a train wreck but

778
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:46,820
I am saying that you will if you follow

779
00:26:44,659 --> 00:26:50,169
these programs and you make targeted

780
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:53,929
applied visions or versions of your your

781
00:26:50,169 --> 00:26:56,090
fertility they will go further soil life

782
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:57,559
creates basically the enzymes and some

783
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,360
amino acids that are beneficial to

784
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:00,710
plants that don't have to be converted

785
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,110
by the biology that are planned

786
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:04,940
available this is fungi in our soil so

787
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:07,880
the thing about fungi that's important

788
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,620
is that fungi roots can only go so small

789
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,179
and to get into fissures and cracks in

790
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,690
your soil and then they can't go any

791
00:27:11,179 --> 00:27:13,880
further

792
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,650
but the fungi is so much smaller and

793
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:18,350
more microscopic it can go into small

794
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:20,330
small cracks that are microscopic and it

795
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:22,460
can go find moisture and find nutrients

796
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,620
that the the roots can't and then it'll

797
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:26,150
take it back to the it'll take it back

798
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,429
to the plant because the plant's gonna

799
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,990
feed it sugars to keep the fungi alive

800
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:31,250
because the fungi feeding the plants so

801
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:34,400
it does work together so that's

802
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:36,890
important even in dry times don't be

803
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,710
afraid to put something cheap out there

804
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:41,690
this is primarily a military op but they

805
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:43,429
did put some daikon radish and turnip in

806
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:45,470
there I considered this a failure

807
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:47,090
because I planted it with intentions we

808
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:49,909
were gonna get some rain after harvest

809
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:51,380
at some point it was dry bone-dry when

810
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:53,210
we planted I didn't think it'd come up

811
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:54,830
you know two weeks later three weeks

812
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:57,409
later we had this you could see it

813
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:58,940
coming up only got about you know ankle

814
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,799
the boot top high you know it didn't get

815
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,480
over a foot two foot tall so I

816
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,970
determined it was a failure because I

817
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,770
wanted it for grazing the cows actually

818
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:08,539
the deer and knocked down an electric

819
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:10,100
fence next to this and the cows got out

820
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:11,030
on it they were just going wild and I

821
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,890
couldn't figure out what were they're

822
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:14,510
after and never even went back and

823
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:16,940
looked at it but they they were going

824
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:18,590
after these turnips and this this radish

825
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,510
they're recycling those nutrients that

826
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:23,059
were left over after that wheat crop so

827
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:26,299
we can recover some of those nutrients

828
00:28:23,059 --> 00:28:28,280
this is what a cover crop looks like you

829
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:30,080
don't see much bare soil you see a green

830
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,940
growing plant you know this is millets

831
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,820
this is forage sorghum sorghum Sedan

832
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:36,740
some rapeseed sunflower so I've got a

833
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,059
diversity of broadly sand grasses and

834
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,409
this is kind of what it looks like and

835
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:41,870
this was a wheat stubble this was

836
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:44,000
probably planted or this was probably

837
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:46,610
filmed what about the end of September

838
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:49,250
so if you rain you can do some pretty

839
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:51,169
great things you know grazing I'll say

840
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,580
grazing so easy even a baby can do it

841
00:28:51,169 --> 00:28:55,370
you know most people don't want to hear

842
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:57,020
that um you know grazing can be a lot of

843
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:59,809
work is what most people think but it

844
00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:01,970
doesn't have to be work I highly suggest

845
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:05,090
if you have never been around poly wire

846
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:07,820
or a braided braided wire like poly wire

847
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:09,919
that you experience that because it's

848
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,960
really easy to subdivide and to get

849
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:15,320
better use of your cropland

850
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,299
you know these this poly wire I like

851
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,110
this I like the step in post with a very

852
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:19,880
smallest

853
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:21,860
spike that you can find because when you

854
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:23,720
get into frozen ground or dry ground it

855
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:25,039
goes in the ground if you get too big a

856
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:27,140
spike like you go to some of these

857
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,850
places that are like the local tractor

858
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,289
supply they have cheaper post if they

859
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,940
have a really big spike on the end and

860
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:35,899
they won't go into frozen or dry ground

861
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:38,350
so try to find a one of those portable

862
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:40,640
posts that's got a small spike on it

863
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:43,190
basically that's that's all you need

864
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,200
really really I suggest if you do this

865
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:47,659
spend the money on a fence charger I

866
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,520
mean 500 to 800 dollars on a fence

867
00:29:47,659 --> 00:29:51,230
charger which sounds like a lot but

868
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,940
it'll have enough joules that'll keep

869
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:55,250
the keep the cattle back you know

870
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:56,750
they'll respect it whereas if you go get

871
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:57,890
a cheap fence or they'll be out all the

872
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,419
time and it doesn't take much crop

873
00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:02,510
damage to have a lot of problems with

874
00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:05,270
the neighbor so I'm not so I'm not a I'm

875
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:06,770
totally into electric fence as being a

876
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,649
good thing but you have to have a good

877
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:11,059
fencer integration of livestock on the

878
00:30:09,649 --> 00:30:13,460
farm like we talked about

879
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:15,200
they're basically incorporating the

880
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,000
residue down to the ground where that

881
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,940
microbe the microbes can start breaking

882
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,460
it down their trampling it basically

883
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,780
something that most people don't talk

884
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,760
about is the benefit but they're

885
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,929
stressing the plant they go out when

886
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,909
they wrap their tongue around there and

887
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:30,230
pull it off you know they're pulling on

888
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:31,549
that root and that roots getting a

889
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,960
little stressed so with putting more

890
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:34,730
sugars into the ground they're also

891
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,919
putting some saliva and some bacteria on

892
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,270
there their act and the room and a lot

893
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:39,559
of the things that are in the room and

894
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:41,809
coming out of the back end of the cow

895
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:44,210
start to stimulate a lot of these you

896
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:44,650
know the soil biology I will show you in

897
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,620
a little bit

898
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:49,720
what that looks like on our farm why hot

899
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,610
high stock density I like running a

900
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,230
decently high stock density so I get the

901
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:55,450
trampling so I get the ground cover I

902
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:58,480
get even residue distribution instead of

903
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:01,210
bare spots you know I think that it's

904
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,070
important that you have what you can

905
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,720
manage you know if it doesn't have to be

906
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:07,240
daily moved as if every second or third

907
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,740
day that's fine too but I think that you

908
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,150
need to have them moving across your

909
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,740
cropland because if you just leave them

910
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,900
out on one piece of ground like a

911
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:15,490
quarter for you know 30 days you're

912
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,610
gonna have some serious some pretty

913
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:20,590
serious compaction in places you know

914
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:22,540
who wants to move fence it sounds like a

915
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:24,370
daunting tax doesn't it to go out and

916
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:27,340
move this fence you know and change the

917
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:30,610
fence around well for me on foot I timed

918
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:34,030
it one day and to cross fence a quarter

919
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:35,830
it took what about 35 minutes for me on

920
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:37,570
foot holding the posts and stringing the

921
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,040
wire out if you have a four-wheeler or

922
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:41,290
you know a side-by-side or something

923
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,520
it's way faster than that but um you

924
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:44,470
know it doesn't have to take a lot of

925
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,300
time couple that versus the way we used

926
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:48,220
to look at cows and we used to subdivide

927
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,690
them into groups and put them all over

928
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,640
the country or take us four and a half

929
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:53,200
hours just to check cows and a lot of

930
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,670
times it's a whole day endeavor if they

931
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,590
tore the fence down and they're in our

932
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:59,050
crops or the neighbor's crops so you

933
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:00,640
know it's actually a lot less time it's

934
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,020
a little bit more time to get your idea

935
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,700
of where your watering points and stuff

936
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:06,280
we're going to be but it's a lot less

937
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,500
time than the way we used to run cattle

938
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,030
and most of all why I like being out

939
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,770
there every few days with my cattle

940
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:14,650
cattle are tame and they're easy to work

941
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:16,510
with these are my two year old twins

942
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:18,550
that just they just turn 2 in December

943
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:20,140
and they can come out with me and be

944
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:22,300
around these cattle they don't act like

945
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:23,500
cattle they act like oversized puppy

946
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,850
dogs it'll kind of freak you out a

947
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,290
little bit because they'll follow you

948
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:28,690
around you know looking to move Vince

949
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:30,970
and I'm gonna show you real quick what a

950
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:33,100
fencing what a move looks like on our

951
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:34,540
farm you know people think moving cattle

952
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,580
you have to get behind him and hoop and

953
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:38,740
holler and everything else all you have

954
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:41,050
to do is drop the wire once they see the

955
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,220
first couple go by they're smart they

956
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:45,310
know they're gonna get there next

957
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:47,440
rotation and you know big herds are not

958
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:49,300
hard to move it one person can do this

959
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,830
this happens to be where we had all

960
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,480
three of us there one morning and we

961
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:54,520
just moved him in but you could see how

962
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,320
fast they are the cattle are in really

963
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,640
good shape they've they might be a

964
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,170
little bit bigger than you

965
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,750
we're trying to shrink our cattle down

966
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:04,299
but they are really full they're got a

967
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:06,250
good-good code on them that's something

968
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:07,870
that you can't you know I was talking

969
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,220
with some other people you know the sale

970
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:10,540
barn when they go through the sale barn

971
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,490
they've got a lot better coat there a

972
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:14,950
lot fuller and that's something that you

973
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:17,410
you know you can revenue add revenue to

974
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:19,720
if you're doing this watch forage levels

975
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:22,390
if anything moved with forage on top

976
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,270
don't be like when we first started this

977
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:26,679
dad and I decided that we'd leave him

978
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:28,450
one more day I thought we should move

979
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:31,210
him dad thought we shouldn't so we did

980
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:33,549
it dad's way on this first piece the

981
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:36,190
rest of it we left more forage and the

982
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:38,679
difference on that following was about

983
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:40,480
there almost 30 bushels of wheat the top

984
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:42,460
only yielded about 22 bushel of wheat

985
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,919
because it was so dry and we had

986
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:47,049
compaction and everything else so why

987
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:48,970
leave residue residue holds it up it

988
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:50,230
works kind of like a snowshoe does you

989
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:52,120
know you don't break through the snow

990
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,860
when you got residue cover over the top

991
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,140
those cattle don't really break through

992
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:57,309
down into the soil and pug it up very

993
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:00,130
much they just kind of lightly

994
00:33:57,309 --> 00:34:02,200
incorporate that on the top something

995
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:04,750
else to think about is this isn't wasted

996
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,760
forage this forage feeds the soil so

997
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:08,649
your soil can feed your livestock in the

998
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:11,470
future so it's an investment your future

999
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:13,060
you know what about compaction this is

1000
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:14,760
on my own farm compaction is not a

1001
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:17,350
problem if you keep them moving

1002
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:19,240
basically this is soil bulk density this

1003
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:21,159
is done in a joint Colorado State and

1004
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,440
Kansas State study on cover crops in the

1005
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,389
western region and you can see it's

1006
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,280
statistically insignificant the

1007
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:29,470
differences between fallow grazed and

1008
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,240
ungrazed so basically that's the same

1009
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:33,730
you know long as you keep them moving

1010
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:35,669
this is a penetrometer this shows this

1011
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:38,200
was grazed right before we planted corn

1012
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:40,210
so we'll see how much compaction we

1013
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:42,460
actually put in the ground if it stays

1014
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:44,169
in that Green Zone basically you know

1015
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:46,720
you're able to have your roots move

1016
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:47,649
through so I can do it with one hand so

1017
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:49,510
I'd really didn't have a lot of

1018
00:34:47,649 --> 00:34:52,060
resistance so that's working pretty good

1019
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:52,389
so anyway so that's something to think

1020
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,030
about

1021
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:57,129
I prefer strip grazing everybody has a

1022
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:58,570
different way to set up fence the longer

1023
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:59,980
or narrower the paddocks you're going to

1024
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:01,869
get a lot more of that back and forth

1025
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,280
movement which you thought I think would

1026
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:05,710
be compaction but it does a lot more

1027
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,630
with laying that mat down if you do more

1028
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:09,340
in a square pattern you're more likely

1029
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:10,810
to probably have better you forage

1030
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:12,310
utilization but you're probably

1031
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:14,200
not gonna have that good residue Matt

1032
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:16,420
lay down so we'd like to strip graze and

1033
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,580
that works good for me because I could

1034
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:20,470
put my tank next to a road or I can put

1035
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,270
my net tank at the end of the field

1036
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:23,950
where I've got a well across the road

1037
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:25,750
and just run a hose across the road so

1038
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:28,210
it helps me with water on some of these

1039
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:30,640
things this is the nutrient spread with

1040
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:32,350
strip grazing we'll talk about cycling

1041
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,170
nutrients the free fertility that we're

1042
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:37,150
getting if you put one fence around your

1043
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:38,920
corn stock say it's a corn stock field

1044
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:40,930
you put one fence around there and you

1045
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,590
leave them continuous out there it would

1046
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:45,310
take you 27 years to get one cowpie per

1047
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:48,580
square yard

1048
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:52,120
I think yep per square yard if you

1049
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:54,490
subdivide and you move them say every 14

1050
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:57,610
days it takes you eight years to get one

1051
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:59,440
manure pack per square yard if you move

1052
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:01,390
them 24 different times you don't have

1053
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,610
to have 24 fences set up you just have

1054
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:05,860
to have it divided up so you can move

1055
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:08,890
them 24 times it would take you 2 years

1056
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:10,990
and you can tell down here where we did

1057
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:12,640
it daily you can see the manure paths

1058
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:14,470
that are gonna feed that grass so it

1059
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,290
does cycle nutrients it's your free

1060
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:19,830
fertility you know remember to leave

1061
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:22,210
that soil Armour so many times guys are

1062
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:26,860
probably thinking that they can probably

1063
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:28,540
get it you know the extra 10 or 15 head

1064
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:30,280
on that ground you know and take it a

1065
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:31,870
little bit further down but you really

1066
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:33,520
need to leave that soil Armour so that

1067
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:36,190
you've let those earthworms have a good

1068
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,230
environment lift up biology eat the best

1069
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:39,850
leave the rest don't be afraid to stop

1070
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:42,220
the bottom of the stalk you can see that

1071
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:44,170
there is a pretty significant amount you

1072
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:45,490
know that we did waste on this but the

1073
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:47,020
next year you know you can raise some

1074
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:49,630
really good crops when you put them into

1075
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:51,730
this so you know you're just using the

1076
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,320
that you're capturing some value with

1077
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:55,090
the cattle out there but you're also

1078
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:57,430
capturing the value of the next year

1079
00:36:55,090 --> 00:37:00,280
with that and increased soil function

1080
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:01,630
again I tell you know I've told you

1081
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:03,130
several times but remember to leave

1082
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:04,380
cover you know you that cover is

1083
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:07,360
essential to make the whole thing work

1084
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,950
why I like grazing a lot of people say

1085
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:11,410
oh I've got a cover crop I'm gonna hay

1086
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:13,000
it well just know if you hate it you're

1087
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:15,310
gonna take off a lot of the good that

1088
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,620
you did with that cover crop so so let's

1089
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:20,260
say you run 500 pounds of beef per acre

1090
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:22,450
that's 18 pounds of nitrogen 9 pounds of

1091
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:25,270
phosphorous and 1.0 pounds of potassium

1092
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:27,520
removing so four tons per acre I figure

1093
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:31,119
is probably a dryland yield might be a

1094
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:35,859
little bit low but 200 pounds of in 40

1095
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:37,450
pounds of potassium potassium you take

1096
00:37:35,859 --> 00:37:39,579
that to an irrigated yield that's over

1097
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:41,200
400 pounds in so you're losing a lot of

1098
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:42,430
nutrients when you hay that so you're

1099
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,859
gonna have to make it up with a lot of

1100
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:47,619
added nutrients so something else that

1101
00:37:44,859 --> 00:37:49,750
we get on our farm is we get a really

1102
00:37:47,619 --> 00:37:51,579
nice regrowth on our pasture when

1103
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,380
they're out on cover crops so that helps

1104
00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:56,109
hurt let's grow more range this is in

1105
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:58,660
August the neighbor has buffalo grass

1106
00:37:56,109 --> 00:38:00,430
and weeds and basically bare soil this

1107
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,349
out here you can see some clovers and

1108
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:03,820
some grass so you know we know that

1109
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:06,280
we're making a difference on our on our

1110
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:07,900
ground I'd be a miss to tell you that

1111
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,790
this all happens in one year you know

1112
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:11,290
also many people I get frustrated when I

1113
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:12,760
first started this because you'd hear

1114
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:15,790
these guys talking and made out these

1115
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,740
beautiful wonderful looking crops well I

1116
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:19,930
think 2012 might have been a little

1117
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:21,700
drier up here for you guys for you us 13

1118
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:23,470
was the year that really dry in our area

1119
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,450
so we did everything right with this

1120
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:27,819
corn crop we had really good soil cover

1121
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:29,349
we planted the corn crop in there is so

1122
00:38:27,819 --> 00:38:31,119
dry the corn didn't really even come up

1123
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:33,190
we didn't get hardly a stand so we did

1124
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,900
strip graze the corn off but we did

1125
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:38,050
everything right this is the same

1126
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:39,609
fertility package as here and look at

1127
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:41,589
the difference we've got this is last

1128
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:43,390
year's corn we even have the ground

1129
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:44,859
starting to cycle nutrients you see some

1130
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:47,319
bare soil there you know as soon as the

1131
00:38:44,859 --> 00:38:49,690
corn comes off it needs that residue to

1132
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:52,480
keep it going but you can just see a

1133
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:54,640
lusher and a stronger plant and that's

1134
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,520
the soil biology that's making that you

1135
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,200
know and I like to have fun I planned it

1136
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,540
a little bit of open pollinated corn it

1137
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,750
was a Jimmy red corn so just for fun you

1138
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:06,730
know just to see what it do remember to

1139
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:08,500
leave that soil cover and this is what

1140
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:10,390
it looks like where we have cover crop

1141
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:13,000
between the rows and this was a

1142
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:14,560
harvested this was this Paul's harvested

1143
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,390
so you need to have that soil cover

1144
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,220
leave that soil cover even if you're

1145
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,900
grazing and this is the different soil

1146
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:22,119
cover makes you see the cover crop on

1147
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,980
one side this guy hate all of his corn

1148
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:25,540
stalks off so you've got no residue and

1149
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:28,240
look what's happening to his soil so it

1150
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:30,310
makes a big difference we chose the way

1151
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,500
you know to change the way we farmed the

1152
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:33,839
way we viewed soil you know we disc we

1153
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,849
ploughed we ripped we did

1154
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,289
you know so you know I think that it's

1155
00:39:35,849 --> 00:39:40,499
important that we think about the soil

1156
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:42,739
and put a priority on soil this is the

1157
00:39:40,499 --> 00:39:45,119
difference that the high input no-till

1158
00:39:42,739 --> 00:39:48,509
this is guy that uses a lot of chemical

1159
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,789
and fertilizer in there basically you

1160
00:39:48,509 --> 00:39:53,369
know it is gonna work so all these

1161
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:54,719
little dots that's bacteria you see a

1162
00:39:53,369 --> 00:39:57,150
lot of other life and there it's pretty

1163
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,529
much all bacteria right soil bacteria is

1164
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:01,079
what's pretty prevalent in a lot of

1165
00:39:58,529 --> 00:40:03,390
soils so I'm going to show you on our

1166
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:05,249
side this was the grazing the little

1167
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:07,489
worm-like things a nematode that little

1168
00:40:05,249 --> 00:40:09,839
fast things of protozoa there's bacteria

1169
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:11,009
you've got a lot more cycling of

1170
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,479
nutrients when you've got all those

1171
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:14,460
little guys working for you they're

1172
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:16,079
they're dying they're they're killing

1173
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:18,029
each other they're giving off nutrients

1174
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,069
and this all plan available so that's

1175
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:21,749
the difference we're getting and for me

1176
00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:23,759
this is what's important I'm leaving a

1177
00:40:21,749 --> 00:40:25,170
legacy of good soil management I hope to

1178
00:40:23,759 --> 00:40:27,989
heck but I don't have to tell my three

1179
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:29,460
kids someday that you know you can't

1180
00:40:27,989 --> 00:40:31,109
come back to the farm I'd like to think

1181
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,819
that we'd find a revenue stream or a way

1182
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:34,499
to bring them back you know and that our

1183
00:40:32,819 --> 00:40:37,979
soils will be in a good enough shape you

1184
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:40,109
know that that we can do that so like I

1185
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:41,400
said I taught kindergarten in the spring

1186
00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:43,229
when the kids would get restless and

1187
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,359
antsy we'd go out and we'd have a soils

1188
00:40:43,229 --> 00:40:47,130
unit and as part of our soils unit and

1189
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,229
conservation theme we'd read the Lorax

1190
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:50,729
and in in the Lorax it says unless

1191
00:40:49,229 --> 00:40:52,380
someone like you cares a whole awful lot

1192
00:40:50,729 --> 00:40:54,569
nothing is going to get better it's not

1193
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,069
it starts with you know you your

1194
00:40:54,569 --> 00:40:57,630
neighbors you know just just trying

1195
00:40:56,069 --> 00:41:01,079
something and making it work you know

1196
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:03,390
being committed to it if you are into

1197
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:05,430
this I'd suggest reading there's a lot

1198
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:07,229
of good books out there then that's how

1199
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,969
I got my start I didn't have the

1200
00:41:07,229 --> 00:41:10,680
neighbors that were good at doing this I

1201
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:13,499
just had to read and figure this out the

1202
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:15,269
hard way but grass fed cattle it's not

1203
00:41:13,499 --> 00:41:17,219
really about grass feeding as much as it

1204
00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:19,380
is it talks a lot about mobile

1205
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:21,210
structures like watering fencing that

1206
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:23,390
kind of stuff it actually gave me my my

1207
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:25,529
start in to this whole grazing thing

1208
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,119
holistic management kind of tells you

1209
00:41:25,529 --> 00:41:29,700
some of the things about you know range

1210
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,259
and stuff nature and properties of soils

1211
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,630
that's my Bible that tells you so much

1212
00:41:31,259 --> 00:41:35,400
about soils it is a college textbook but

1213
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:37,229
it doesn't really read like a textbook a

1214
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,960
lot of good info about water cycling

1215
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:42,059
nutrient cycling things like that

1216
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,469
stumble over soil that's about a South

1217
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:46,160
American farmer who took some really

1218
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:49,580
poor and poorly degraded ground and bro

1219
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,500
high productivity good no tell book cal

1220
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:53,030
save the planet water in plain sight

1221
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:55,370
those are both books that kind of talk

1222
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:57,680
about the water cycle and how the how

1223
00:41:55,370 --> 00:42:00,770
cattle can actually help restore our

1224
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,260
soils building soils we're better crops

1225
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:06,590
that's a free PDF file that you can get

1226
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:08,900
from sare teeming with microbes teeming

1227
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:10,370
with fungi and teeming with excuse me

1228
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,380
teeming with nutrients by Jeff blow in

1229
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:13,820
Fell's those are really good books that

1230
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:15,350
talk about a lot of the biology

1231
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,300
happening in our soils you know and how

1232
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:19,460
the nutrients get into our plants so if

1233
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,720
you're interested in that and I think

1234
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,180
the most important thing for me that

1235
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,640
helped me grow as a person with farming

1236
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:27,800
the Dust Bowl that book is a first-hand

1237
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,690
account from a Southwest farmer that he

1238
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,550
was doing everything right for his day

1239
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:33,200
conservation wise trying to grow crops

1240
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:35,090
but he kept having crop failure after

1241
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,480
crop failure so it kind of tells you the

1242
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:40,100
what if we don't take care of our soil I

1243
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:42,800
know that what I said might be a lot to

1244
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,280
you know chew you know or write a lot to

1245
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,320
think about

1246
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,940
but I heard the same thing you know

1247
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,590
years ago from other speakers and I

1248
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,390
thought what do I have to lose you know

1249
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:52,340
and it's really been kind to me and so

1250
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:54,080
that's why I'm here today to to kind of

1251
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,820
pay it forward and help other people

1252
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:58,370
hopefully you have success on your own

1253
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:00,080
farms and ranches like I have but a lot

1254
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:01,790
of its mindset whether you think you can

1255
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,160
or think that you can't you're right and

1256
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,960
