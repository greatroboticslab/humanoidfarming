  "text": "and today I'm gonna be showing you how to convert your sprinkler system into a drip system sprinklers are really inefficient ways of watering plants in general what they do is that they spray water up in the air and onto leaves of plants where that water will then mostly evaporate into the air and very little of it will reach the roots of your plants and so what we're gonna do today is replace a sprinkler system with a drip system and so I well you see what you see behind me this is called drip irrigation tubing and this tube has these little black emitters in it every 12 inches and this tubing when I when we finish hooking it up will drip water right on to the soil right where the plants roots are and will this is a very efficient system compared to the sprinkler it puts the water right where the water is needed okay so the first part of installing a drip system is actually closing off all the sprinklers on your system that sprinkler system generally is divided into stations and you can you can't mix sprinklers and drip on the same station the reason is is that sprinklers put out a lot of water very quickly so a sprinkler head you know might put out several gallons of water in a minute whereas a drip system puts out water really slowly so if you have drip and a sprinkler on the same system in the amount of time that it takes for the drip system to put out a gallon the sprinkler might suit the sprinklers might have put out 10 gallons and so you don't want that kind of mismatch so the first thing that we're gonna do is find all the sprinklers that are in that one station the sprinkler heads and just go ahead and screw the sprinkler head off and then replace it with a cap and so you're gonna do that to all of the sprinklers on that one station and then move on to the next step the next step is to actually convert the sprinkler head that's closest to your garden beds into a system that will allow us to move from the PVC piping here to this kind of drip irrigation tubing so for my system here what I have is the half-inch pipe coming out of the ground and that's attached to the sprinkler head so I'm gonna remove the sprinkler head then I'm gonna attach an elbow and this is an elbow that has a female side and a female side with threading on both sides so that means this is both of these sides can be screwed onto here so I'm gonna screw this on and then into there I'm gonna screw on this adapter this adapter allows me to hook up to my drip irrigation tubing and the drip irrigation tubing will just jam right on to this fitting so I'm going to screw this in here now now depending on what's available at your hardware store you might not find these exact type of fittings but just talk to someone over there and they'll help you find the one that fits right on to your system you might even want to take one of these pipes with you to the hardware store so you can find the exact fittings that will work for your garden once you have your adapter on your sprinkler head the next step is going to be to install the backbone tubing okay so what this is this is tubing that has no holes in it all it's going to do is deliver the water from where we put that sprinkler adapter on two of the places where we want the water to actually come out so this this is just a half-inch it's called 1/2 inch blank irrigation tubing and we're gonna connect that to the starter fitting but before we do that what we need to do is dig a trench and see you see I've already dug a trench starting from where my adapter fitting is going close to all of my garden beds because what I'm gonna do is lay down the tubing in this trench and then attach my tubing that has the emitters to this tubing the important thing when you're purchasing these drip irrigation materials is to purchase all materials from the same brand because each brand has a slightly different diameter of tubing and if you buy different brands they won't all fit together I know it's silly it's annoying but just buy one brand and stick with it and it'll save you a lot of headache later all right so now I have my blank tubing and I'm just gonna connect it to this adapter that I already put on here so all after you to connect it is just push the tubing over the adapter and kind of wiggle it back and forth and once I hit the end I'm this is a snug really tight fitting it's actually really really hard to get these off so this is watertight completely when you're putting this this type of tubing on it really helps to have some gloves with a nice grip to them because your thumbs and your hands will get really tired if you don't have good grip on your hands so now I'm just going to roll out my tubing right down my ditch all the way to the end so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a cut in my tubing and insert this T adapter so when you go to the irrigation supply store or the hardware store you'll find adapters like these for the tubing's you have a T adapter you have an elbow adapter they also sell a straight adapter for mending broken tubing and so what I'm going to do is I'm going to install this T adapter here into this tubing and the way I'm going to do that is very simple I'm just going to take a pair of hand pruners or any other you know sharp cutting tool and just make a cut right here and then insert this T into the tubing and again I just push it in and then again on the other side simply push it in and now I have a tight fitting there once the T is in then I'm going to connect some more blank tubing into the other side of the T and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a cut here right where about the soil is so that the pipe reaches just above there and then I'm going to insert in elbow into that pipe into this pipe here and then put another little piece of pipe onto that elbow and now cut make another little cut so that just my pipe is reaching into the bed and now that I have my little connection on I'm going to use another tee and I'm going to use one of the side connectors not the center piece to connect into this tubing and from here we're going to connect our actual tubing with the emitters in it all right and now I'm going to start to connect my emitter tubing so you can see the emitter tubing it looks almost just like the blank tubing but every 12 inches you'll see one of these little black sort ovals so you can see one is here now we got another one here we've got another one here so they're spaced 12 inches apart and the water will just drip drip drip out of these emitters when you buy this tubing it comes in different versions there are somewhere that the emitters are nine inches apart somewhere the emitters are 12 inches apart somewhere the emitters are 24 inches apart there's also different water ratings for the emitters so you could find tubing that where each of these emitters is going to admit half a gallon per hour or one gallon per hour just choose one and stick with it because that way you'll have even water wherever you're using this tubing so what I'm using again is the 12 inch spacing and one gallon per hour perimeter so to start now I'm gonna take that T piece that I just put in and I'm gonna put my emitter tubing into here and it is a little difficult to put these on okay now I'm just going to unroll my tubing down the length of my bed and when you're unrolling the tubing you do want to actually unroll it if you just try to kind of pull it off this way it'll get all twisted up and it's difficult to put to roll out so actually unroll it down the bed and when you get to the end go ahead and make the cut you want to leave a little bit of excess just in case you want to move you know make any adjustments so I'm going to cut weight up to you that way I got play so the next step is to attach our next lines of tubing the number of lines you attach to a bed is going to depend on the width of your bed so these beds are about three feet wide so I'm gonna attach about three lines of tubing so now what I'm going to do is I took a about an eight inch piece of blank tubing and I'm gonna attach it here to this tee okay and now I'm going to attach another tee right here so this is going to be my I'm gonna attach three lines of tubing this is going to be my middle line now I'm going to attach another eight-inch piece of tubing here and then I'm going to put an elbow on the end so now I'm ready to attach my second and third line of my emitter tubing onto this what I'm gonna do when I'm attaching my next lines of tubing is that I'm gonna cut my tubing here so that my emitters are not lined up the emitters like I said before on this are twelve inches apart and so what I want to do is stagger them so that I get a really even coverage over my bed so you can see this emitter that I've already this tubing that I've already attached has an emitter here so what I'm gonna do is cut this next tube so that the emitters are halfway in between the emitters on this existing line so I'm gonna make a cut just about here so I'm going to cut off this end and now when I attach this second line of tubing my emitters will be staggered so you can see I rolled up that second line of tubing now I'm going to attach my third line of tubing to measure where I'm going to start on this tubing I'm just going to line up with my emitters with the first line because since I staggered on the second line the third line should be set should be cut the same way as the first line so I just line up my emitter and then I make a cut and now attach the third line in to this last elbow here and now I'm just gonna roll out this third line and the front part of this bed is done so now that I have my connection all together here in the front of the bed the next thing I'm going to do is just pin my tubing in place so I know exactly where it's gonna go and so what I'm using are these u-shaped they're called ground staples and what you do is just take that staple and put it around the tube and into the ground and it should hold the pipe in place so I just got a handful of them here I'm gonna go along the bed and just pin the tubing so that is nice and evenly spaced apart all the way down the bed and it's in the position that I want it to be in so here at the end of the bed what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna use one t adapter to close all of these tubes off and so what we're doing is we're creating a loop between all the tubes now there's no start point and there's no end point they all just come together and that means we're gonna have even pressure throughout the tubing and the water will get distributed very easily so what I'm going to do now is I'm just gonna cut the end of this tube off the center tube and I'm going to attach this tee piece here so just make sure we're at the end of the bed and that looks about right so I'm gonna make my cut here and push this on once that centerpiece is connected I'm gonna connect just one of my other tubes to that piece the reason being is I'm going to leave one tube unconnected because before I close this whole thing off what I want to do is flush the tubing out so before I actually connect everything together I'm gonna leave one tube empty on unconnected on every bed turn the water on and let all the any dust or dirt that might be inside these tubes get flushed out that way they're not there to clog the emitters when I turn it on so just gonna make this cut here and close this one off so now what I've done is I repeated that same process that I did on this first vent here lunch my second and third bed I took a branch off of our mainline I connected it up to the top of the bed and laid out three lines of tubing going down the meds spaced them out with my staples and then connected only two of those tubes at the end and left one off once your tubing is all together you need to install your filter and the place that you want to install your filter is right where your valve is so if you had a sprinkler system there's probably some place in your house house where you have a bunch of these valves next to each other under some kind of box and what I'm going to show you now I'm just gonna demonstrate on this free this loose valve how to install the filter so what you'll need is a pipe cutter and using the pipe cutter whatever is coming out of this end of the valve so that's the end that doesn't have the black attachment pieces to it you would cut that pipe off which the pipe cutter and then unscrew whatever is connected here okay and you won't need that anymore what you then do is take your filter and your filter will have an arrow on it that with the direction of the flow of water so the direction of the flow of water is going to be down from this piece that doesn't have the black connectors connected to it and all you're gonna do is screw in your filter here and now that your filter is in you're going to use a piece like this this is a 3/4 inch female-to-female PVC connection it doesn't have threading on one side so it's just smooth on one side on the inside and it has threading on the other side so what I can do with this is I it on to this filter and then on the other side you'll connect back to the PVC pipe that you cut before so for example you have a PVC pipe like this you're going to use this Christy's red hot blue glue and what you're going to do is with it with this glue you're gonna apply a little bit around the end of your PVC pipe and then you're gonna apply another amount here on the inside of this PVC pipe and just glue those together ok and now all the water that comes through here gets filtered by this filter to empty these filters out usually they just come out with a screw and cap like this and so when you open that up you can kind of dust a push push out whatever's been filtered out and also if you need to probably every few years you open this whole thing up and you can you can replace the actual filter piece inside of here ok so once you have that then your your water is going to be doesn't it's not going to have any particles in it that will block up your tubes the other piece that you might need that I don't have to show you is a pressure regulator so when you buy your drip tubing on the tubing there'll be a rating for how much pressure that tubing can handle so maybe this to me you know maybe the tubing says it can handle up to a hundred psi of pressure well if my pressure at my home is only 50 psi then I don't need a pressure regulator to keep this tubing in good shape but if my pressure in my home is say a 120 psi which it might be in certain areas then you'll need to attach a pressure regulator after the Y filter to bring the the pressure down so that it doesn't burst the tubing okay but in most cases all you'll need is the filter as long as you're using this half-inch thick walled drip emitter tubing so now that everything is set up the last step was to turn the water on and flush these pipes down so I've done that you can see the water is coming out here it's also coming out here and we're going to let this run for a minute or so so that all the water is coming is all the piping is getting flushed out and after I let this watch out for a minute we're going to turn the water off and make this final connection and then my drip system will be done so now I've got my water my tubes all connected together and I've turned the water on and you can see here the water is dripping out nicely out of all the different all the emitters and we have good coverage over the entire bed and so now we can start planting thanks for watching this video I hope this gets you started setting up a drip irrigation system at your own home and if you have any questions feel free to
