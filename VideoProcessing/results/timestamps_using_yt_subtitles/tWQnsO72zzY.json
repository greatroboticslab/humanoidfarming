  "text": "Hello. So, Eric here. Today we came to Co or is that the Ou within the Smurb for us to come and survey a new field that one of our clients want to put to uh use. After surveying it, we will be able to choose the particular crop. But key among them was to know the history of the land what they've used it for over a period of time where we are going to source water of course to also make sure the land belongs to them and thankfully they came to meet uh their neighbors in order to make sure everything align with each other and also one of their threat even before we start is cattle invasion. They usually see a lot of cattle. The land has been used from 2012 and then they went on a pause cultivating some crop like tomatoes, okra and what have you. And you also do cava the farm owners are here and then we have key trees like palm tree one of them some few coconuts about eight acres. So from here you can't see all of them but just to give you a very close shot and a good view the land is good. We have some part that is a little slopy and then some part that is very flat when you go uphill. The intention of course is to construct a mini dam that will serve during the dry season if possible. During the rainy season we accumulate water and then during the dry season will be sustainable and surely we are able to uh supply or prod produce throughout the entire season. This is what we do. We start with you from the word go. We come to see the realities on ground. Then we are able to prepare a well customized budget for your case. And we always say we we will not touch your money. We will let you spend the money as we go. We are just a guide who are guiding you through where to pick items that you are needed the quality basic quality standards in order to make your investment a good deal for you. Thank you and see you [Music] again. Hey, hey, hey. [Music]",
