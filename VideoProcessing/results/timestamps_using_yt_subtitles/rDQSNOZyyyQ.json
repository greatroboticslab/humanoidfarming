  "text": "a little happy day outliers in woodworkers mana here with heartwood art do you have a messy garage or shed full of garden tools that you could never find well that's easy and cheap DIY palette project it's gonna solve that problem for you now I'm gonna take you on a short video tour of how I built this but for all the details come on over to heartwood art comm and see each step in the process plus how to fully customize it okay let's dive in and since this palette will be freestanding meaning that it won't be attached to the wall will be adding feet to it to ensure that it can't tip forward so the first thing we'll want to do is stand the palette up to find the most level in that will make less work for you to level it to add the feet later now while the palette is stood up insert your long handle tools to get an idea of best placement for them and determine how many cross rails you'll need to cut so that you can easily lift them out I had an industrial pallet that was 45 by 45 inches and I had to remove the top three cross rails so lay your pallet on the floor and cut those cross rails I use my circular saw guide to make a straight cut and to support the saw as the rails fell out and you can see how to make a guide like this yourself over at hurt wood art okay now let's add the feet I used two of those rails that we cut out and I'm mounting them flush to the back but you can have them stick out in the back a little bit if you want to mine stuck out the front by 11 inches and that was enough to make the pallet tip roof I used number 8 by 1 and 3/4 construction screws and drill pilot holes with a countersink to get the screw head flush or below the plane of the wood ok let's move on to mounting the tools I have several axes and wanted to mount them on the bottom front shelf now because they're so heavy I thought supports running through the pallet would be a good idea I use more of those rail cut-offs for this and because I had a back and front rail parallel that's how I decided to mount them just now that the support rails could interfere with your long handle tool placement so be sure to check that tool placement again before you mount the supports and I attach them with screws into the back rail and then next I built that act shelf I just happened to have torn down another pallet that was the same size and I had a scrap piece that was exactly the right width and length so that's what I used i clamped that piece to the lip of my bench then I glued and clamped a scrap 1x2 for the lip edge and tacked it in with my nail gun using 1 and 1/4 inch brad dales okay this was a little bit tricky I stood the pallet on its side so I could screw the Shelf to the supports from underneath there was nowhere to clamp so I used the pickaxe as a spacer okay now it's time to mark our tools for Dow placement I used these pre-cut groove Dells because they're the same size of the corresponding drill bit and they expand a little when wet with glue down rods tend to be a little smaller than the corresponding drill bit and they're not the easiest thing to cut squarely either so drill your holes and try not to go all the way through then glue your dowels in fit snug using a rubber mallet I like that bottom act shell so much that I decided to build a few more shelves on the front of the right side I made them the same way as the act shelf but since they wouldn't be holding much weight I simply glued clamped and tacked nailed them into the Crossrail from the back now a few of my tools were perfect for hanging so it decided to add angled dowels to the front of the cross rails on the left side you really don't have to angle the drill very much to get this effect and I did drill all the way through so it can insert a little more of the dowel as these would be holding a bit of weight and I also had a few screwin type J hooks and I mounted them on the side to hold these dirt breaker things for lack of knowing what else to call them all it took was drilling a pilot hole first and they screwed right in now on the other side I wanted to hang my ice scraper my two and 1/2 inch construction screws had enough of a smooth shoulder that one of them were perfectly for hanging the handle without marring the surface of it and last I wanted a place to put my kneepads I used another piece of the Crossrail boards I cut out and mounted it to one of the inner structure blocks it was the perfect width to mount inside there and to hold my kneepads now my garden tools get pretty dirty so I decided not to paint my pallet but you certainly could if you want an even more rustic look by giving it a whitewash or using milk paint or such I hope you've enjoyed this quick tour of how to build this garden tool storage pallet project come on over to Marlin art.com and see all the details on it and get more easy bills like this too and I'll see you in the shop",
