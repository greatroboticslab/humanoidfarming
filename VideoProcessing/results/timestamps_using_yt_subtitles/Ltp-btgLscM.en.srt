1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,080
What if I told you there are entire

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,759
states where acres of fertile farmland

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,800
are cheaper than a year's rent in Los

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:10,559
Angeles? Places where you could trade

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,719
your studio apartment for an entire

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,679
pasture and still have change left over

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,720
for a tractor. But there's a catch. Land

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,359
is expensive. Or is it? This isn't just

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,880
about land. It's about escape, about

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,080
freedom, about planting roots,

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,920
literally. And doing on a budget that

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,640
doesn't require a hedge fund or trust

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,559
fund. Stick around till the end because

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,120
there's a surprise bone estate that's so

15
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,800
cheap it didn't just break the rules, it

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,280
buried them under a pasture and build a

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,280
chicken coupe on top. So, let's take a

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,840
ride through the 15 cheapest states to

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,239
buy farmland in America. Places where

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,039
the American dream isn't just alive,

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:53,120
it's growing. Number 15, Oklahoma. In

22
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,879
Oklahoma, the dirt isn't just red, it's

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,120
rich with history, sweat, and

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,239
opportunity. You wouldn't expect a state

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,840
smack dab in tornado alley to be so

26
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:04,559
inviting. But farmland here averages

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,479
less than $2,000 an acre. And with a

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,960
cost of living that practically whispers

29
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,040
sweet nothings to your wallet, it's no

30
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,760
wonder ranchers and smalltime dreamers

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,159
alike are quietly staking their claim.

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,240
The land is a mix of pasture, timber,

33
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,560
and crop land. You got the prairie

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,040
winds, the wild sunsets, and that dusty

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,439
resilience in the air that says, "Yeah,

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,640
I survived the dust bowl." What else

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,960
have you got? Oklahoma isn't glamorous,

38
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,560
but it doesn't need to be. It's the kind

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,200
of place where people wave in their

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,280
trucks, your neighbors know your name,

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,280
and if you've got a cow, someone's at a

42
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,759
vet on speed dial. But don't think

43
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,000
Oklahoma is just cowboys and country

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,479
songs. With growing infrastructure in

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,320
small towns like Ada and Muscogi,

46
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,880
there's an increasing blend of old

47
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,920
school grit and new age homesteading.

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,759
Call it cowboy core with a Wi-Fi signal.

49
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,479
If you like cheap land and just enough

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,880
Wi-Fi to dream big, hit subscribe. We're

51
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,280
only getting started. Number 14,

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,759
Missouri. Missouri is where the South

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,080
kisses the Midwest. You've got rolling

54
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,160
hills, fertile river bottoms, and land

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,239
so affordable it almost feels like

56
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,280
you're committing fraud. We're talking

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,840
around $3,000 an acre for farmland with

58
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,000
real water holding crop growing

59
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,000
potential. This isn't a flashy part of

60
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,640
the country, and that's the charm.

61
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,080
Missouri is quiet, consistent, and just

62
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,280
humid enough to grow a little bit of

63
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,360
everything. Corn, soybeans, cattle,

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,319
heck, even vineyards. If you're feeling

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,599
classy, plus there's no shortage of

66
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,920
barns that look straight out of a

67
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,480
Hallmark movie. If you're into low-key

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,480
living with a side of Midwestern

69
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,959
stoicism, Missouri delivers. And let's

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,879
not forget the tax perks. Missouri

71
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,160
doesn't strangle you with red tape.

72
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,400
AGfriendly laws and low property taxes

73
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,560
mean you can actually make a go at

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,800
farming without your accountant needing

75
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,280
therapy. In a world that feels more

76
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,640
digitized by the day, Missouri's land

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,519
whispers, "Slow down, breathe, grow

78
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,840
something real." Number 13, North

79
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,800
Dakota. You'd be forgiven for forgetting

80
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,440
about North Dakota. Most people do, but

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,560
the state doesn't mind. She prefers her

82
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,480
solitude. And at Solitude, it comes with

83
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,040
some of the cheapest, widest, and most

84
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,440
underrated farmland in the nation. Just

85
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,000
over $2,000 per acre, and you can own

86
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,959
land that stretches so far, your phone

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,959
loses signal halfway through. Yes,

88
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,280
winters here are brutal. They don't call

89
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,360
it character building, they call it

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,400
survival. But those who can handle the

91
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,480
cold are rewarded with rich glacial soil

92
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,000
and crop yields that'll make your inner

93
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,319
farmer giddy. Wheat, soybeans, canola.

94
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,959
This is grain country. It's where amber

95
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,440
waves of grain weren't just lyrics. They

96
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,159
were instructions. There's also a quiet

97
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,040
revolution happening here. Young farmers

98
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,560
returning. Techsavvy AG startups and a

99
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,280
growing energy sector balancing

100
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,239
tradition with progress. North Dakota

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,640
doesn't scream, it nods. And if you

102
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,760
listen closely, the land tells you

103
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,480
everything you need to know. Number 12,

104
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,000
Arkansas. Arkansas is like that distant

105
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,000
cousin who shows up at the reunion with

106
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
a giant cooler full of smoked brisket

107
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,239
and suddenly everyone wants to sit at

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,639
their table with an average farmland

109
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,400
cost sitting around

110
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,960
$3,100 per acre. This state's

111
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,520
affordability is almost as underrated as

112
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,000
its barbecue. Known for its rice fields,

113
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,160
timber, and poultry industry, Arkansas

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,080
offers fertile delta land and a

115
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,759
temperate climate that stretches the

116
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,199
growing season well beyond what you'd

117
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,560
expect. Plus, water is everywhere here,

118
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,040
from the Mississippi River to the

119
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,960
endless streams and bayus, making

120
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,040
irrigation less a headache and more of a

121
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,000
strategy. But it's not just farmland

122
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,600
that's cheap here. It's life. Towns like

123
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,919
Cersei and Jonesboro give you the

124
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,320
infrastructure without congestion. And

125
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,160
if you squint right, part of the Ozarks

126
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,800
feel like a low-key version of Vermont,

127
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,479
minus the snow and the trust funds. If

128
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,120
Arkansas just earned a spot at your

129
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,960
table, go ahead and like the video.

130
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,160
Brisket not required. Number 11,

131
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,479
Indiana. Indiana is a land of

132
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,360
basketball, soybeans, and actual corn

133
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,680
fields, not the metaphors. But it's also

134
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,199
surprisingly cheap for agriculture,

135
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,440
especially in the northern and southern

136
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,280
stretches of state, where prices hover

137
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,280
around

138
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,000
$3,000 to

139
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:32,880
$3,500 per acre. The soil here is prime,

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,479
black, lomy, nutrient-rich stuff that

141
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,440
practically begs you plant something in

142
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,600
it. And with a strong ag economy, you

143
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,840
won't be farming alone. From grain

144
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,919
elevators to farm co-ops, there's

145
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,039
support network here that's as solid as

146
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,160
a Midwestern handshake. And yeah, the

147
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,240
weather could be a little manic. Sunny

148
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:54,639
Tuesday, snow flurries Thursday, but a

149
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,240
consistent crop yields an easy access to

150
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,759
shipping channels like the Ohio River

151
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,400
and Great Lakes make up for the mood

152
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,759
swings. Indiana is where practicality

153
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,880
wins. It's not flashy, but it works. And

154
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,440
in farming, that's what counts. Indiana

155
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,600
is also quietly becoming a hot spot for

156
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,600
agri techch innovation with Purdue

157
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,759
University leading research in precision

158
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,639
farming, soil science, and sustainable

159
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,720
crop management. Even small-cale farmers

160
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,240
are gaining access to cuttingedge tools

161
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,919
and insights. It's where tradition meets

162
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,479
technology. Where old barns get Wi-Fi

163
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,840
upgrades and drones fly over corn fields

164
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,840
like futuristic scarecrows. In Indiana,

165
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,759
you're not just buying land. You're

166
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,280
buying into a future where farming gets

167
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,800
smarter, not harder. Number 10,

168
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,240
Mississippi. If farmland were judged on

169
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,160
solo loan, Mississippi would win in a

170
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,800
landslide. But lucky for you, it's also

171
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,600
dirt cheap. Literally, you can snag

172
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,240
prime land here for around $2,500 an

173
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,639
acre, and sometimes even less if you're

174
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,599
off the beaten path. This is deep south

175
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,520
farmland. cotton, soybeans, catfish

176
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,160
farms, and pecan orchards that stretch

177
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,440
for miles on a Spanish moss draped oaks.

178
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,199
The air smells like possibility and

179
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,080
humidity. Lots of humidity, but the

180
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,240
trade-off, a long growing season, mild

181
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,319
winters, and neighbors who bring you pie

182
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,960
just because they felt like it. There's

183
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,720
also a gritty beauty here. Small towns

184
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,720
with cracked sidewalks and stories

185
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,560
carved into them. people who've seen

186
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,440
hard times but still show up every

187
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,800
Sunday in press shirts and strong

188
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,639
opinions. Mississippi doesn't pretend to

189
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,520
be perfect, but if you want to grow

190
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,280
something honest, it's fertile ground.

191
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,280
Mississippi is also one of the few

192
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,680
states investing seriously in

193
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,919
regenerative agriculture through stateup

194
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,000
supported conservation programs. With

195
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,000
incentives for cover cropping, reduced

196
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,759
tillage, and water management, new

197
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,440
farmers have the rare chance to build

198
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,840
soil health and receive financial

199
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,840
support while doing it. Add in the low

200
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,240
property taxes and access to regional

201
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,479
farmers markets and Mississippi becomes

202
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,639
more than just soulful. It becomes

203
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,879
sustainable. It's a place where the past

204
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,520
and future shake hands over a bushel of

205
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,759
sweet potatoes. If Mississippi stirred

206
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,400
something in you, maybe a memory, maybe

207
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,560
a dream, drop a comment and tell us what

208
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,000
kind of roots you'd put down. Number

209
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,879
nine, Kansas. If you close your eyes and

210
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,199
picture American farmland, chances are

211
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,000
you're seeing Kansas. Golden wheat

212
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,560
fields waving in the wind. Grain silos

213
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,400
rise against a pale blue sky. And road

214
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,039
so straight they look like they were

215
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,519
drawn with a ruler. Land here averages

216
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,440
under $2,000 per acre in the western

217
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,440
regions, which is pretty wild

218
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,680
considering its reputation as America's

219
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,399
bread basket. This isn't hobby farming

220
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,040
territory. This is the big leagues.

221
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,760
Tractors the size of houses. Harvest

222
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,360
that feed cities. And the skies are so

223
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,080
wide they'll make your problems feel

224
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,920
small. But Kansas isn't all work.

225
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,800
There's a surprising depth of culture

226
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,200
here. Farmers who listen to jazz, red

227
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,200
bonut, and can fix a combine with duct

228
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,680
tape and a prayer. If you're serious

229
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,920
about farming and serious about space,

230
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,680
Kansas isn't just affordable, it's

231
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,120
ideal. Number eight, Wyoming. Wyoming is

232
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,920
where you go when you want to disappear

233
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,920
in style. Vast, untouched land that

234
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,160
feels like the last frontier. And

235
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,160
somehow, you can still buy acres of it

236
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,120
for around

237
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,040
$1,600 a pop. Sure, the climate's harsh

238
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,600
and the growing season short, but if

239
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,480
ranching or dryland farming is your jam,

240
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,800
Wyoming is a blank canvas. This is a big

241
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,800
sky country where fences stretch for

242
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,560
miles and no one bothers you unless you

243
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,399
really want them to. If you've ever

244
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,360
fantasized about a homestead where your

245
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:44,000
closest neighbor is a moose, Wyoming is

246
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,720
calling. Wyoming's agri economy might be

247
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,120
small, but it's fiercely self-reliant.

248
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,200
And that's becoming a serious advantage.

249
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,600
With growing demand for grass-fed beef,

250
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,839
raw milk, and locally sourced produce,

251
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,320
small Wyoming farms are tapping into

252
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,680
niche markets with big payoffs. And

253
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,240
thanks to the state's lenient

254
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,640
regulations on direct consumer sales,

255
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,760
farmers here can sell straight from the

256
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,080
barn door. No middleman, no nonsense.

257
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,080
It's a freedom to grow what you want,

258
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,640
sell how you want, and live how you

259
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:17,839
please. There's also something primal

260
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,560
here. Wind that scour your soul. Silence

261
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,120
that isn't empty, it's sacred. Farming

262
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,519
in Wyoming isn't easy. But for those who

263
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,880
crave solitude in space, it's not just

264
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,519
cheap, it's priceless. Number seven,

265
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,560
Texas panhandle. You might not think of

266
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,800
Texas as cheap. After all, Austin real

267
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,120
estate is basically a tech bros monopoly

268
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,800
board. But swing your compass toward the

269
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,800
panhandle and you'll find some of the

270
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,920
most affordable agricultural land in the

271
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,040
country. We're talking

272
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:52,160
$1,500 to $2,500 per acre, depending on

273
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,040
the quality and water access. The region

274
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,200
is flat, dry, and fierce, but ideal for

275
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,399
wheat, cotton, and cattle if you've got

276
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,880
the guts. And let's be real, it's Texas.

277
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,360
The attitude comes free with the soil.

278
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,920
Panel towns like Amarillo or Heroford

279
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,000
may not win tourism awards, but they got

280
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,079
infrastructure, community, and a kind of

281
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,480
grit that makes people proud to say we

282
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,040
grow food here. Texas farming isn't just

283
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,800
an economic decision. It's a lifestyle

284
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:23,519
with swagger. Number six, New Mexico.

285
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,680
Yes, you heard right, New Mexico. The

286
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,240
land of enchantment, isn't just red

287
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,640
rocks and green chili. Head south and

288
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,160
east and you'll find expensive farmland

289
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:37,519
that costs as little as $1,200 an acre.

290
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,079
That's not a typo. The catch, water.

291
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,079
It's dry out here, desert dry. But with

292
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,480
smart irrigation and some creative crop

293
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,279
planning, you can make it work. Think

294
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,160
pecans, chili peppers, even vineyards if

295
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,640
you get fancy. The climate is forgiving.

296
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,120
The winters are light and the sun sets.

297
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,079
They'll ruin you for life. New Mexico

298
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,640
has a vibe, a mix of indigenous history,

299
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,560
ranching grit, and artistic soul. If you

300
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:04,880
want cheap land in a state where people

301
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,720
still believe in magic, this might be

302
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,160
your strange and beautiful promised

303
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,880
land. Number five, Colorado, Eastern

304
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,200
Plains. When people think of Colorado,

305
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,040
they think Aspen Veil and million-dollar

306
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,360
cabins filled with ski boots and

307
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,200
Patagonia. But swing out east of the

308
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,440
plains where the land flattens, a

309
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,760
tourist vanish, and the prices drop like

310
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,160
a barometer before a thunderstorm, and

311
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,560
you'll find a whole different Colorado.

312
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:34,079
Farmland here under $2,000 an acre in

313
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,079
places. Sure, it doesn't come with

314
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,920
mountain views or a yoga studio down the

315
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,160
road, but it does come with endless

316
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,160
space, fertile ground for wheat and

317
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,560
millet, and skies that look like they

318
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,959
were painted with cowboy prayers. This

319
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,440
is where farming is still a way of life,

320
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,519
not a real estate investment portfolio.

321
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,399
The towns here are quiet, the people

322
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,079
tough, and the seasons unapologetic. But

323
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,240
if you're chasing the kind of solitude

324
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,800
that feeds the soul, and not just your

325
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,720
social media feed, Eastern Colorado

326
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,480
delivers, and it does it at a bargain

327
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,320
price. Number four, Michigan Upper

328
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,079
Peninsula. Yes, Michigan, but not the

329
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,760
lakefront latte sipping and arbor

330
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,639
version. We're talking the Upper

331
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,880
Peninsula. Rugged, remote, and wildly

332
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,240
affordable. You can scoop up farmland

333
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,480
here for under $3,000 an acre. Sometimes

334
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,360
far less, especially if you're open to

335
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,440
forested plots or mixeduse land. The up

336
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,920
is a different world. Dense pine

337
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,680
forests, cold winds off Lake Superior

338
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,839
and towns where everyone knows each

339
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,200
other's truck by sound. But what you get

340
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:40,079
in isolation, you gain in purity, clean

341
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,920
water, wild game, soil that grows

342
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,519
berries like it's trying to apologize

343
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,279
for snow. Farming here is

344
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,600
unconventional, short growing seasons,

345
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,160
unpredictable frost lines. But if you're

346
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,639
into specialty crops, maple syrup, or

347
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,040
just raising livestock, somewhere the

348
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,880
stars still shine at night, Michigan's

349
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,440
up might be the Northern Promise you

350
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,839
didn't know you needed. Number three,

351
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:06,399
Tennessee. Tennessee is what happens

352
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,639
when affordability meets vibe. Lush

353
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,320
green hills, moderate climate, and a

354
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,800
music scene that'll make you forget your

355
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,279
Wi-Fi isn't working. But here's the real

356
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,440
reason you're here. Farmland averages

357
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,160
around

358
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:22,959
$3,200 an acre in many rural areas. Less

359
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,240
in place as a GPS it gets. The land is

360
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,959
good. Real good. Think hay fields, beef

361
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,959
cattle, tobacco, corn, and increasingly

362
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,760
organic and hobby farms springing up

363
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:36,800
like mushrooms after rain. There's also

364
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,639
water, streams, rivers, springs, more

365
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,959
than enough to keep your soil happy and

366
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,959
your crops hydrated. Tennessee is where

367
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,360
you can run a tractor during the day,

368
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,199
play a banjo by the fire at night, and

369
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,360
still make the farmers market Saturday

370
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:51,680
morning. It's affordable, yes, but it's

371
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,720
also magnetic. A place where people

372
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:57,040
still slow down, wave at strangers, and

373
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,160
swear by the weather more than the news.

374
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,920
Number two, West Virginia. West Virginia

375
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,560
is the whisper in the mountains no one's

376
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,720
listening to, but maybe they should be.

377
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,560
Tucked into the Appalachian region, it

378
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,639
offers some of the cheapest farmland in

379
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:14,880
the east. On the $2,500 per acre in many

380
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,160
rural counties, and while the terrain is

381
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,240
hilly, the soil is surprisingly rich.

382
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,839
This is farming with an echo.

383
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,079
Generations have worked these hollers

384
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,120
and hillsides and it shows in the way

385
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,440
fences lean just so or how every barn

386
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,560
has a story and probably a moonshine

387
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,320
still in his past. It's not easy farming

388
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,040
but it's authentic. If you're looking

389
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,839
for remote, scenic and dirt cheap, West

390
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,000
Virginia calls softly. The land is yours

391
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:45,040
if you've got the patience and maybe a

392
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,360
mule. It's less about profit, more about

393
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,920
passion. A place to dig in, live

394
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,480
off-rid, and feel every season down to

395
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,519
your bones. Before moving on to number

396
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:59,120
one, as promised, here's your bonus

397
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,959
mention. Bonus mention, Alaska. You

398
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,320
weren't expecting this, were you?

399
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:07,040
Alaska, the final frontier, the frozen

400
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,800
edge of America. But peel back the snow

401
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,040
and mystery, and you'll find a land

402
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,360
that's not just wild, but shockingly

403
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,160
affordable. In some remote areas,

404
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:19,440
farmland, or at least farmable land,

405
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,759
goes for under $1,000 an acre. And

406
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,399
sometimes the state will literally pay

407
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,639
you to live there. It's not a myth. It's

408
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,560
the permanent fund dividend. The

409
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,279
government hands you a check just for

410
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,360
sticking around. Now, let's get real.

411
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,040
Alaska isn't for the faint of heart.

412
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,000
Farming up here is like dating someone

413
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,600
who's gorgeous, but emotionally

414
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,000
unavailable. It's going to be hard. The

415
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,639
growing season is short. The logistics

416
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,040
are a nightmare. And bears are a very

417
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:49,600
real, very furry problem. But what you

418
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:53,120
lose in convenience, you gain an epic

419
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,000
freedom. Midnight sun farming. Check.

420
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,079
Green houses that look like sci-fi

421
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,160
domes. Yep. Farming in Alaska is like

422
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,639
running a marathon in a snowstorm.

423
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,120
Insane, but impressive. But here's the

424
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,079
twist. Thanks to warming temperatures,

425
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,400
hello, climate chaos, parts of Alaska

426
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,360
are becoming more agriculturally viable

427
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,760
every year, what used to be perafrost is

428
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,720
slowly thawing into possibility. And

429
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,160
there's a quiet group of off-grid

430
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,400
homesteaders, permaculture pioneers, and

431
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,480
husky owning maniacs out here who are

432
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,240
already proving it can be done with

433
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,880
innovation, resilience, and maybe a

434
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,919
solar panel or 12. Alaska might just be

435
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,160
the future of radical farming. So yeah,

436
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,160
Alaska didn't make the main list, not

437
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,000
because it's not cheap, but because it

438
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,320
doesn't follow the rules. It's a

439
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,559
different beast. It's not land for

440
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,559
everyone. But for the few who crave the

441
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,440
edge of the world, who want to farm

442
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,400
under the Aurora and live life 10° off

443
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,960
center, Alaska isn't just a bonus, it's

444
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:56,160
a dare you to know you need it. Now on

445
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,679
to the best place to buy. Number one,

446
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,600
Arizona. Southeastern counties.

447
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:03,600
Surprised? you should be. Arizona might

448
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,240
seem like an oven with a cactus problem,

449
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,480
but in the southeastern counties, places

450
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,280
like Coochis and Graham, you'll find

451
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:14,160
farmland selling for as low as $1,000 an

452
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,160
acre. It's dry, yes, but that's not the

453
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,080
whole story. This is high desert

454
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,400
farming, and it's ancient. The

455
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,799
indigenous people figured out long

456
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,600
before climate smart agriculture became

457
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:28,160
a hashtag. With modern irrigation, you

458
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,480
can grow alalfa, pistachios, wine

459
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,520
grapes, and even cotton. And the best

460
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,160
part, it rarely freezes. Your growing

461
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,799
season is long, your sunlight plentiful,

462
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,240
and your winter is practically

463
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:42,400
non-existent. But more than that,

464
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,039
southeastern Arizona offers a kind of

465
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,039
surreal tranquility. Purple sunsets,

466
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,799
mountain silhouettes, and land that

467
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,039
feels like it's been waiting centuries

468
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,280
for someone to care for it again. It's

469
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,160
not just the cheapest. It might be the

470
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:59,520
most poetic. The land is raw. Yes, but

471
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,559
it's ready. And maybe so are you. So

472
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,120
there you have it. 15 states, thousands

473
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,440
of acres, and endless possibilities.

474
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,080
From the icy plains of North Dakota to

475
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,679
the sunburnt soil of Arizona, there's

476
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,799
still corners of this country where you

477
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:17,200
can buy not just land, but a new life. A

478
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:20,240
life measured not in square footage, but

479
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,559
in sunrises, not in profit margins, but

480
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,760
in peace. This isn't just a list. It's a

481
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:27,919
reminder. You don't need a high-rise

482
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,000
apartment to feel successful. You don't

483
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,120
need five bars of signal to be

484
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,760
connected. Sometimes all you need is a

485
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,200
patch of earth, a little rain, and a

486
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,360
reason to wake up early. So the question

487
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:44,080
isn't can you afford land in America.

488
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,400
It's can you afford not to chase it?

489
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,960
Because out there, beyond the noise,

490
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,120
beyond the traffic, beyond the concrete,

491
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,240
your field is waiting. Just pick a

492
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,240
direction and
