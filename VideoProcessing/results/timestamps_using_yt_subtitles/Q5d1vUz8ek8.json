  "text": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to another episode of mugs brew you here in my farm lab we're gonna do this with a lot less emphasis on the Edit and a lot more emphasis on the information and today's information is going to be about irrigation not just any irrigation I'm setting up a drip line system but I'm not gonna be installing it today I do have a little bit of something I am gonna do in the lab today I'm gonna replace one of the times of my broadfork that I recently fabricated turns out I can't to thin but first off if you haven't already seen any of my content welcome to my channel I am more glue I'm gonna be dedicating the next few episodes on this channel to our garden that we busy developing and that is where the stripline irrigation is gonna be going I may put the link up there it's not there yet means we haven't installed it if it's there means we have installed it however if it isn't there it may just mean that I forgot to come back from the future into the ponds to put my tag up on the top of this and talk to you guys these guys are terrible things I put this little energy to them properly so I always worry about you know they're flying around my neck oh yeah but we run into them at least once a week in the in the banana fields in the summer anyway that's that's digressing from where I'm going I'm trying to tell you guys about this irrigation system that I'm setting up and I got it down yet why are we setting up an irrigation system well the primary reason I suppose for me is time and efficiency efficiency both in time management and in water efficiency water use efficiency farm work is considered one of the lowest paid jobs so let's just work at minimum minimum human cost per hour is 20 rand and if you're gonna water for an hour twice a day you're gonna be using two hours of your time strictly on watering there's two hours equals 40 round a day now this is probably like three bucks or something in the states I don't know but for you guys that's crazy cheap but let's just roll with this calculation for a second yeah you forty rounded day ten days four hundred and thirty days you're looking at thousand two hundred grand every three months is 3,600 and now this whole set up by the filter cost me less than three thousand six hundred Rand so what I'm trying to say is that that time saved on watering pays itself off in three months if you come and look at my garden from the top and I will zoom out here to the next section where you can check it from the top we've got a draw an image of our garden and I've got this into four blocks and you can see here could be four blocks block block block block storage water both five thousand liters of water they're plumbed up in series of years so they're both gonna come into it we're gonna put off filter are difficult to in line over here which is gonna run down here into our garden and then it runs along here this for Timo comes down into the middle hostel our lemongrass and Homer Inga's and then basically splits the garden down here and we got two taps on this but back to the photo so this filter this is a basic dust filter what the flow is in one way comes around here and has to go through this disk system before it comes out the other side of the filter obeah and what I want to show you is on this filter I don't know if you're gonna get great focus but you can see this ribbing so teeth on these things when we tighten this up and if it closes up all together what you end up with is a hundred and thirty micron filtration through this disk so that's gonna hopefully stop any of our metals from clogging up you know what it comes down here we're gonna get to our first forty mo 32 reducing tea we're gonna come out of here and that reducing tea into a 32 mo are 32 mullahs hanging around our sub main up and down so that way and this way along these beds on that sub main we're gonna manage it through these ball valves so the set up of six beds across this is gonna be managed through the single ball valve I said it would be easy you just drill a little 8 mo hole and you stick this little tip of key through one of those holes in there and then you tighten up this nut over here tighten up the nut so that it comes up against ends up against the plastic closing it off problem with the system that I'm finding is that you can't just push this little paper key through one of these through one of these holes over here because I've never owned one of these things [Music] that's it looks like it's it it's in anyways it looks like I needed a tin mole bit on the end of my drill give me so that's basically it put two drop lines into each bed running the length of the beds which are 10 meters but now the strip line I haven't opened it - hang on a second here let's pull this guy yeah girl Susan brighten up so that's what our drip lines are like and you can see underneath is sort of like a square underneath that hole a Sackman oblak some who I liked so there's really the square in a Neath that hole and inside that you can see that little molded inline emitter and there's actually a molded in my little filter inside there to help minimize any other block because we might get thanks I could cross you guys at legions for supplying this so that's the basic setup each blocks can be controlled by single valve six bits per block and that's what we're going to do there but I probably fixed my broadfork [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] as well I just want to give you guys a any of you not as well this up they like me a little took the secret to welding to teaching the welding demons and the most important thing is camouflaging yourself so you can see I'm wearing green to camouflage the metal and blue to matte blend in with the UV are so make sure that your shirt is the same colors metal you're working on and you're wearing a blue jacket [Music] [Music] so is the basic tech we've just got to put it on both sides of the year so it doesn't walk what I'm gonna do now is go ahead and tack the other side a couple of times and then run a deep world on to this to close it up [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] anyways guys that's started for me in this so let's go outside have a look and see and we're gonna put this drip irrigation and then that's gonna be it that's gonna wrap up for us and I'll finish off in the garden here with a man cave man cave garden let's go check this and basically this is where we're gonna be flipping out soon we're gonna be changing out these onions turning these onions drying them re composting these systems this row cover here is over some lettuce which is nearly done this side over here we got our peppers which are producing our cabbages which are coming along nearly done we're gonna pull these out and make some SAR crafts our spinach we've just taken a massive you look fees and on this side here we're gonna put in these what sunflowers corns and beans coming in our onions are just about done the side too so they'll be coming out soon and over here we've got some more spinach and more cabbage planted up over here umm yeah so this is the garden these are our four plots and you're gonna see us up here now No [Music] okay guys and that's it that's gonna be a wrap for us for today this is how we have been watering we use two of these 10 meter watering caps for each of our 10 meter beds um it's just been a tedious job you know coming out here twice a day putting all that water arcs we finally made the investment and we've gone ahead and bought this drip line we're gonna install it in the coming weeks and like I said we're gonna start flipping out these beds around me here we'll show you we'll bring you along for the installation process the harvest of this garden and that's gonna start up the season it's gonna be our next season our summer season and our next season here on YouTube so I'm quite excited for this new season for this new chapter in the garden with the drip line irrigation and yeah that's about it but today guys then thanks see you guys next week Friday for another proof [Music] [Music] you you",
