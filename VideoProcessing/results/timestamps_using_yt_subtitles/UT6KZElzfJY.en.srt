1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,880
if you really want to grow a seed crop

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:08,120
like there's definitely ways to work

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,880
around isolation issues um or looking at

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,880
specific crops that have a fairly narrow

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,119
isolation distance um but yeah we love

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,640
working with Urban farmers and urban

7
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:22,439
Gardeners of all kinds um I would say

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,800
honestly if we think about crops that

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:27,679
are going to do really well I mean I am

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,039
always a fan of you know Peppers that

11
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:33,000
produce abundantly we have this really

12
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,360
cool variety called resilient shashido

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,960
um I love a shashido pepper and these

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,640
are hearty plants they produce a ton of

15
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:42,600
fruit so you have that really amazing

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,879
sort of like bang for your buck in terms

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,879
of space utilization
