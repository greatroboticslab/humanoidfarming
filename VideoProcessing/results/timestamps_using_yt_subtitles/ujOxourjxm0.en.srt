1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,600
in the springtime it's everything has to

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,840
do with weather and conditions it once

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,840
it dries up and we're out of the heavy

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,080
frost so let's say the middle of april

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,000
we'll start planting potatoes and it

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,880
takes four to six weeks to plant the

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
crops after that if it's dry we're into

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:24,240
irrigation to keep the crops healthy

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,320
and in the summer time we keep the

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,000
program going and then we start harvest

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,000
usually the first of august as soon as

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,320
the potatoes are mature enough after two

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,960
weeks then we start harvesting and we go

14
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,040
right to the middle of october and then

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,960
we're hopefully we're done we're we're

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,960
down to regular hours in the winter time

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,719
we do maintenance and we check all the

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,879
equipment over for the following year

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,239
and it never seems

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,600
like we have a data we have nothing to

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,760
do there's always something we have lots

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,270
of equipment to check out so before

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:58,039
we're done it's spring again

24
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:58,039
