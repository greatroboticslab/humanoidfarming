00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,839
Hello and welcome everybody to our

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:10,480
Commlands one tile challenge. This is

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:14,280
going to be episode 16. Um we went ahead

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,119
and fast forwarded a little bit to April

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,480
and

6
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:21,000
well well that that that caused some

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,800
more problems for us.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,680
Um we we will have to uh look into how

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:32,360
we're going to solve our issues moving

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:35,680
forward. um especially with mowing our

11
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:38,559
grass. But if you haven't yet,

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,879
definitely look down in the description

13
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,719
and check out some of the other content

14
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,120
creators that are doing this challenge

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:50,160
with us. They are doing awesome. Great

16
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,320
bunch of creators. Definitely worth

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,680
checking out their videos. If you've

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,199
enjoyed what we've uh done so far on the

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,920
series, consider smashing that like

20
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,280
button and hitting the

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,800
subscribe. But without further ado,

22
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,240
let's go ahead and get into the rest of

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,960
the video. All right. Oh, it sold 50

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,560
chickens. So, we got 250 bucks for it.

25
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,360
But, I mean, that doesn't really cost a

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,360
whole uh cover a whole lot.

27
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,799
Um, wow. So, they they produced a whole

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,799
another pallet worth of eggs. Nice,

29
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,000
nice, nice, nice, nice. We're going to

30
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,400
have to worry about where we're going to

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,520
put all our eggs pretty soon. All right,

32
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,479
but we got four more pallets of lettuce

33
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,360
ready to

34
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:45,520
go. So, yeah, we're definitely running

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,520
out of storage area pretty quickly.

36
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,840
Um, but we do want to go ahead

37
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:56,079
And honestly, I think I'm just going to

38
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,079
keep the time down at

39
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,680
three. That way, we we have plenty of

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,240
time to work in a month instead of

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,560
keeping it on five.

42
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:12,160
Um, get our mower out. So, we're going

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:16,160
to go ahead and Oh, wow. I did not

44
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:18,000
expect the trees to pop up so quick.

45
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,760
Oh,

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,080
[Music]

47
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:28,599
we I I did not expect to see any kind of

48
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:32,480
growth visually for a

49
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:32,480
while. Oh man.

50
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:42,920
Um that's I mean great. Uh we we have

51
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,879
trees, but that means we can't get the

52
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,840
harvester into that other

53
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,800
field if we did throw down plant uh

54
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,920
beans. So, I thought we were going to

55
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,599
have a little bit more time. Let's go

56
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,360
take a look at that field. Uh we'll

57
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,280
we'll try and get a cut on that one

58
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,400
first.

59
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:08,040
Um but yeah, I was definitely not

60
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,040
expecting that.

61
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,000
Maybe we can get in

62
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,120
between all them all the

63
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,440
trees. Yeah, that might be an issue when

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,280
they get a little bit bigger to try and

65
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,879
get into that other field. I mean, we

66
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,280
still have that open wall on the other

67
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,280
side,

68
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:34,159
but

69
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:37,560
yeah, this is going to be even a pain

70
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,560
just to cut.

71
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,799
Um, but we might have shot ourselves in

72
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,400
the foot by putting a crop down

73
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:52,879
here. Yep, cuz I can't even just bounce

74
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,879
off the

75
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,400
tree, man.

76
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:04,760
Well, I wonder if we can go in from the

77
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,319
side and

78
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:11,519
just don't want to get too close. I

79
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:14,560
think this might actually be our best

80
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,560
direction to go ahead and

81
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,120
cut. That means I'll

82
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:25,840
get a pass in one direction and a pass

83
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,199
in another.

84
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,840
We don't have a whole lot of room to

85
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,840
turn around down

86
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:37,120
there. So, we'll take a look to

87
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,759
see. We probably should be closer to the

88
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,759
trees over

89
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,479
here. Yep. And that's

90
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:49,680
about about where we'll be able to get

91
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:49,680
without running into our

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,720
crops. Yeah.

93
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,720
You

94
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,520
know, don't think I thought this one

95
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,600
through. Might have to look at maybe

96
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,280
getting a skinnier mower just to go

97
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,280
ahead and get in here.

98
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:11,039
Um,

99
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:17,759
man. All right. Well, in the

100
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,160
meantime, we'll go ahead and cut our

101
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,240
grass

102
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:27,600
field. I was not expecting for

103
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,600
those kind of mistakes to be

104
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,280
there.

105
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,280
So, it

106
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,840
happens. But we are going to go ahead

107
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,840
and cut our

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
grass.

109
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,800
And so that'll limit our income quite a

110
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,840
bit cuz I'm not going to be able to cut

111
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,280
in

112
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:00,880
between any of the grass besides what we

113
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,400
have. But in the same turn, that means

114
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,479
we're going to have trees a whole lot

115
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,440
sooner than I thought we were going to

116
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:13,240
also. So that's good thing. It's both a

117
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,240
blessing and a curse.

118
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,400
But I am excited to have the

119
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:24,160
treats. My tractor running away without

120
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,160
me cuz I hit the wrong

121
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,440
button. All

122
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:37,000
right. Back it up a little bit.

123
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,199
All

124
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,440
right. Yeah.

125
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,479
So, I'm glad that

126
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:05,039
uh we're able

127
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:05,039
to get the trees up a little bit.

128
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,319
Um, not

129
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,319
[Music]

130
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,639
sure. Not sure what we really want to do

131
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,639
about all that.

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,599
Um, I think our lines disappeared on

133
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,759
where we want to cut, but I think I can

134
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,160
just run along the edge of this and be

135
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,080
just fine if I keep my back tire along

136
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,440
the

137
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:47,120
edge. But yeah, so was not expecting

138
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:48,520
for those trees to sprout up.

139
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,039
Not this soon.

140
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:55,360
Anyway, so I think what we're going to

141
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:58,319
need to look at is a mower that can get

142
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,599
in between those. That way we can still

143
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,400
Well, we're going to need more than just

144
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:05,199
a mower, aren't

145
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:05,199
we? We're probably

146
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,000
need We only got

147
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:16,080
16,000,

148
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,080
man. All

149
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,520
right. So, I'm going to go

150
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,919
ahead. We're going to look at our

151
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,919
options real quick. See what what can be

152
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:33,320
done. And we'll decide what we should

153
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:37,039
do. Uh let me set this mower off

154
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,039
real can't mow

155
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:44,150
backwards. These are all 20,000 and they

156
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:47,330
still stick out a ways afterward.

157
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:47,330
[Music]

158
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,680
Huh. Unless I just mow in reverse, but

159
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:57,360
don't think we're going to be able to do

160
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,360
anything with that grass for a little

161
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,360
while.

162
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,720
Okay, I might

163
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,720
uh search the modhub

164
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:15,600
uh off camera and take a look at what we

165
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,399
can do cuz I really don't want to lose

166
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,440
that profit down there cuz that's going

167
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:25,519
to be a ton of money. I mean, not a ton,

168
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,959
but a decent It's a decent sized field,

169
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:32,440
so I I assuming we'd probably at least

170
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:36,399
get 10 grand off of it every

171
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,800
cut if we converted it to silage. So, I

172
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,760
mean, we get a little about 20 grand off

173
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,760
of this one when we cut

174
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,360
it. So, that is unfortunate.

175
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,519
Well, I mean, I don't think that one's

176
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,480
nearly as big as this, but

177
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,480
yeah, he's five, six

178
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,519
grand ladder. We need

179
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:18,440
to That's actually pretty decent spacing

180
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:22,800
on those trees, at least at the moment.

181
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,800
Um, I'm trying to think. Trying to

182
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:31,279
think. So, we might possibly

183
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:32,600
start cutting some of those trees out

184
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,600
while the others

185
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,600
grow.

186
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,519
Um, just

187
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,519
to try and get a little bit of

188
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,519
wood going.

189
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,800
I mean, I might give them a little bit

190
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,800
more of a growth

191
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,600
stage. That also allows us

192
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,600
to continue to get

193
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:06,480
wood if we throw down a lumber

194
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:08,079
mill. Oh, we forgot to drop the the bar.

195
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,079
What are you doing, donkey? What are you

196
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,079
doing?

197
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,959
Yeah, I'm just going to circle the

198
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:20,959
wagon and we'll drop back in right

199
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,959
here. All right, there we go. Yeah, I

200
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,920
think what we might do is go ahead and

201
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,760
look

202
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,519
into how much it is going to be to put

203
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:38,040
down our sawmill

204
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:40,880
production. And then

205
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,720
once maybe once the trees hit one more

206
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,680
growth stage, we'll start chopping a few

207
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,760
of them

208
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:51,240
down. And

209
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:56,480
then from there, we will be able

210
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,480
to kind of weed out and replant as we

211
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:08,399
need. No, I lowered that. Oh, I lowered

212
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,560
it once and then raised it back up

213
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,320
because I got off track.

214
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:16,959
Okay.

215
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:22,079
Yep. So, I think we'll take a look into

216
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:25,200
that once we get this mode. Um, so I am

217
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:27,000
going to go ahead and jump into mowing

218
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,680
this. I know since we didn't get it

219
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,440
fertilized, we're going to we're going

220
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,680
to take a hit on how much we're actually

221
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,480
getting off of it. If you can look down

222
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,000
in

223
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,079
the bottom corner where the map is, you

224
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,920
can see our yield is

225
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:47,120
changing from that nice dark green that

226
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,360
we were getting to a lighter green

227
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,680
because of

228
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:55,000
the fact that this field needs both lime

229
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,000
and fertilizer.

230
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,399
But it happens

231
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,399
and we

232
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:11,959
are going to go ahead and get this mode

233
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,800
and we'll catch back up to

234
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:19,360
you. All right, so we just finished up

235
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:22,160
mowing here, but I think we might have

236
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,160
figured out a solution to our mow

237
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,160
problems.

238
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:33,120
Um,

239
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,240
now it is going to cost us a little bit

240
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,920
more

241
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,800
money,

242
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,279
but we should be able to earn that bag

243
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,120
off of the first

244
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:48,880
cut. So, I think we're going to run up

245
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,880
to the

246
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,760
shop. We got a friend over there eating

247
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,000
our grass.

248
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,959
All right. But yeah, so I think if we

249
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,480
run up to the shop, we might be able to

250
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,399
get a mower small enough to go in

251
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,399
between the

252
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:04,399
trees.

253
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,160
Um,

254
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:12,480
but the only other question is, are we

255
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,240
going to be able to get the wagon in

256
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,560
between the trees to pick up the grass

257
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,560
that we

258
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,240
mow? Um, that's going to be another

259
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:41,680
one. But let's let's

260
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,680
let's get up here.

261
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,800
Uh, you guys are running in a little

262
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,839
late to work.

263
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:57,480
I've noticed that uh the traffic on here

264
00:14:51,839 --> 00:15:00,240
is very very much uh based around the

265
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,079
hour. At least maybe that's just when I

266
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,839
come to the shop and see the traffic.

267
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:07,839
But all

268
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:07,839
right,

269
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:14,959
so we're going to go into mowers here

270
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:19,160
and went ahead and added a couple of

271
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:22,959
mods. So, this one is an option, uh, the

272
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:25,760
iMac, but it only has a 1.8 working

273
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:28,880
width. So, I'm not sure if that's what

274
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:32,240
we want to go with, especially since

275
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,880
this lizard mower here has a 3.4 working

276
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,320
with, which is almost what we're we're

277
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,519
currently working with. Um, but it goes

278
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:44,959
directly behind the

279
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:48,320
tractor and it can go 3 km faster than

280
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,320
the iMac. So, I think this might be what

281
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,320
we go

282
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,320
with.

283
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,040
Um, you know what? We're going to go

284
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,079
ahead and buy it. Uh, does it cost us

285
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,079
anything to change the

286
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:07,240
color? Let's

287
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,240
see. Cuz

288
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:19,600
No. Okay. Awesome. So, we can change the

289
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:21,720
color as we feel the need to. Um, what

290
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,040
color are we

291
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,720
feeling? You know what? It'll kind of

292
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:34,199
Oh, no. That's way too bright.

293
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:36,480
[Music]

294
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:41,680
Um, you know what? We'll just keep it

295
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:45,079
with the classic red. But all right. So,

296
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,079
we'll buy that.

297
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,600
Now I guess our other option if we

298
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,600
can't

299
00:16:51,880 --> 00:17:00,079
get that might actually be pretty close

300
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:00,079
to width of those trees.

301
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:08,240
um about the width in between those

302
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,199
trees. And once it gets bigger, uh we

303
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,600
probably should have went with the

304
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,679
smaller one, but decisions were made.

305
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:19,039
So, we will probably face that problem

306
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,799
when we get around to it. Granted, when

307
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,880
they get bigger, I'm planning on

308
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,120
thinning them

309
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,280
out,

310
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,520
but

311
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,520
should Let's see. How close are we going

312
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,320
to be? Oh, yeah. Now we're going to be

313
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,640
great. Okay,

314
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:42,400
so that being

315
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,400
said, what do our lines

316
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:52,320
Oh, yep. We're going to be doing this

317
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:52,320
one by hand. That is some funky looking

318
00:17:52,520 --> 00:18:00,400
lines. Yep.

319
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,400
So, I'm not sure why, but

320
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,280
yeah. All right. But yeah, it our other

321
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,679
option is Okay. And it looks like we

322
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,320
might be able to get right up next to

323
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,960
the

324
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:20,400
trees and get that median in

325
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,400
between. But if we can't

326
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,480
uh get our

327
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,360
uh our forge wagon in between here, I

328
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,320
guess what we could probably do is push

329
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,320
all of it with the bucket.

330
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,240
And

331
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:45,039
uh this is going to be a pain, but we

332
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,720
could push it all with a bucket and get

333
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,720
it down that

334
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,400
way. So, I think we'll go ahead and

335
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,840
finish off this strip

336
00:18:55,400 --> 00:19:02,080
here. Uh just to make it easier to turn

337
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:04,240
around and then we should be fine to go

338
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,360
ahead and mow this. Now, that'll allow

339
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:11,000
us to

340
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:12,840
uh at least make some money on this

341
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,039
field.

342
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:17,039
Uh why these trees are

343
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,799
growing. But yeah, and then we should be

344
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,720
able to fit just fine in between here

345
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:30,760
because this is our narrowest

346
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,760
section. If I could just drive straight

347
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,600
because these trees were planted in a

348
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,200
straight line. I just have to be able to

349
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:46,559
uh mow in a straight line. All right,

350
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:50,400
but yeah. So, this is our narrow section

351
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:54,480
and we fit just fine at the moment. So,

352
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,480
that's not going to be a bad

353
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,480
thing. But

354
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,520
now, but now we're going to run into the

355
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:13,720
issue of being able to either a

356
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:17,200
fertilize to keep

357
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:19,200
our score up a little bit on precision

358
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,160
farming as I know since I didn't

359
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,160
fertilize the land

360
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:28,200
uh or our

361
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:30,840
other grass

362
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:34,080
field last time before

363
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,320
cutting. Oh, whoa. What just happened to

364
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,320
that

365
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:45,240
tree? Does this delete trees as

366
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,240
well? Um

367
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:49,749
[Music]

368
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:01,400
Um, I'm going to go ahead and turn real

369
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,520
mower off on

370
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:07,000
that. I don't want to be losing trees

371
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,760
like

372
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,280
that. I mean, I want to be able to cut

373
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:17,039
the grass,

374
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,039
but that tree had a lot more potential

375
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:23,440
than than that little bit of grass that

376
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,440
we cut right

377
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:34,480
there. All right. Yeah. So, we'll get

378
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:34,480
this cut and then we will see if we

379
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,000
can't end up

380
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:55,559
uh and see what issues we're going to

381
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,120
get with

382
00:21:55,559 --> 00:22:00,280
uh picking it up the grass. But yeah, so

383
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,440
we

384
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:06,000
will skip you guys ahead until we get

385
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,799
this mowed and then we will see you guys

386
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,760
once I get

387
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:11,240
back. All right, guys. So, we just

388
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:15,000
finished mowing this.

389
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:19,600
um did kind of a

390
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,520
uh weaving pattern between the trees to

391
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,760
try and get a little bit more cuz even

392
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,840
after we turned off the real mower, we

393
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:32,080
still ended up cutting down a tree

394
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:35,360
somehow. I'm not sure why, but that was

395
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:38,799
not in the mod description on this that

396
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,480
it does remove stumps or any kind of uh

397
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,880
tree deletion.

398
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:48,080
So, little weird about

399
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,080
that, but we are going to go ahead

400
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,880
and we're going to go ahead and wind row

401
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,960
at least this field and then we'll pull

402
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:58,200
out the

403
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,679
uh porch

404
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:05,440
harvester

405
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:05,440
to see if we can't get a

406
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,120
uh decent amount of grass picked. up

407
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,440
between the two

408
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,240
fields.

409
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:21,840
Now, one of the things I did say earlier

410
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,840
is that our pH and

411
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:30,799
our fertilization was bad on these

412
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:34,720
fields. Uh, which it is. Um, well, yeah.

413
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:38,159
Yeah, our pH is non-existent in spots,

414
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:41,440
so that's not very good. I mean,

415
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:45,120
granted, back here it's fine, but if we

416
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:48,559
look at our pH map, it's not looking

417
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:51,760
pretty at all. Um, at least on this

418
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:55,480
field. So, we are going to need I think

419
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:58,440
last time it was three bags of

420
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:02,720
uh

421
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,720
lime to get that done.

422
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:10,440
Uh, so we will have to get I say bags,

423
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:15,480
but pallets of

424
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:18,480
lime to get that all

425
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,480
situated.

426
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:26,960
Um, and we're going to have to get that

427
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:29,799
down today. Now, as far as spraying, we

428
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,600
might be able to save that

429
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:36,360
until next month. That way, it realizes

430
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,360
that grass is

431
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,360
here.

432
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:48,480
Um, this if we do it this month, why

433
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,840
shortly after it's harvested, it's going

434
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:56,279
to lose its mind and we're going to end

435
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,279
up putting down way too much fertilizer.

436
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:05,880
Now, if we do wait till next month, we

437
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:09,919
might be able to afford the pulse

438
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,919
modulation and throw that on

439
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:15,440
there. But that'll definitely be dipping

440
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,919
into our profits from the silage in

441
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,919
order to do

442
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:26,000
so, which isn't necessarily a bad thing

443
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:27,600
because we do want that for the future

444
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:33,520
anyway.

445
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:33,520
just to help us out as far

446
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:44,360
as saving a little bit of money on

447
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,720
fertilizer.

448
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,520
So, wouldn't be a bad thing to go ahead

449
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,799
and get that. At least I believe that's

450
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:57,120
what it'll what it'll be.

451
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:59,320
um that or we might uh sell a couple

452
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,039
more pallets of

453
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:06,159
lettuce as we are getting four pallet

454
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:09,600
around four pallets a month which that's

455
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,600
a lot of lettuce.

456
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:20,559
Um and we'll see where that puts us. It

457
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:22,880
might put us right there at being able

458
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,880
to do

459
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:27,840
it. Well, actually, what we have eight

460
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,760
pallets sitting there cuz we skipped a

461
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,679
month. So, yeah, we might we might go

462
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:37,120
ahead and sell our uh lettuce off and

463
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:42,360
put pulse the pulse modulation, but

464
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:46,159
that's uh that'll mean that we can't

465
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:49,279
um do lime and fertilizer. We can't

466
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,520
afford that. So, yeah. Yeah, I think

467
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,279
what we'll do is we'll save our money

468
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:57,400
this

469
00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:57,400
month and go ahead and

470
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,240
uh put down the

471
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:11,039
lime and then next month we should be

472
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,039
able to

473
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:22,039
afford the pulse modulation as well as

474
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:25,919
um our liquid

475
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:29,360
fur and get that thrown down. Now, for

476
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,720
this other field, we're we're still

477
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,559
going to have to use

478
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:37,120
our dry fertilizer to fertilize the

479
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,120
grass over

480
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:42,000
there, just because we're not going to

481
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,919
be able to get the sprayer in between

482
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,039
those trees at all.

483
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,279
But we should be able to run probably

484
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:54,080
every

485
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:56,720
other lane in between the trees and get

486
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,600
fertilizer spread out there. It's not

487
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:02,000
going to be

488
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:05,279
as evenly distributed as far as the

489
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,480
nitrogen values go, but it should still

490
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:12,679
take care of the task of getting our

491
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:15,240
nitrogen up as far as our field. Okay.

492
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:20,960
So

493
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,960
yeah. Yeah, it is not looking pretty for

494
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:30,200
us. So if we don't get our values up

495
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,799
nitrogen

496
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:38,440
wise, we're missing out on a lot of our

497
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:38,440
bonus that we get from

498
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,559
uh precision

499
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:52,159
farming. I think I probably should have

500
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,919
done a second headland down there before

501
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,679
starting the down and backs. So, I think

502
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,840
when we get down there, I'll do a second

503
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:01,240
headland on the bottom and

504
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,440
then we

505
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:09,320
will finish window rowing this and

506
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:12,799
then I will bring you back once we

507
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:15,640
uh are picking up the other field just

508
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,720
so you can see how that's going to work

509
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:23,039
out. But yeah, so we will see you once

510
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:25,360
we get done with that.

511
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,320
All right. So, we finished wind rowing

512
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:31,600
uh on the field up there. Now, we do

513
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,679
want to check to see how well this is

514
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,880
going to fit in between the trees. So, I

515
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,559
wanted to go ahead and bring you guys

516
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:41,600
back in for that.

517
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:45,120
Um that way you guys can see whether or

518
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:47,840
not our problem was solved as far as

519
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,880
picking it up. At least for the little

520
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,720
bit. It looks like we will clear the

521
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,399
branches.

522
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:59,880
Um, and hopefully these trees only get

523
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:02,799
taller and the branches don't get

524
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,279
lower. I mean, that's how nature works,

525
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:07,000
right? Is

526
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:08,520
uh things grow

527
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,520
up.

528
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:15,520
But yeah, and see this is where we

529
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:19,919
deleted the other tree by accident. So

530
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:23,200
that's why I left a lot of grass around

531
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:27,039
each tree is I did not want to risk

532
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:30,039
bumping into the trees and making them

533
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,039
disappear.

534
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,919
So thankfully it was only two trees that

535
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:43,440
we lost, but that's still two trees that

536
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:43,440
we lost and the potential of our

537
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:49,799
wood cuz right now each of these trees

538
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:57,960
um yeah each tree at the moment is 350

539
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,960
lers of wood.

540
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:09,919
So,

541
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:15,080
but it does look like this is working

542
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,840
for

543
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:20,320
now and we are almost done picking up

544
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:24,200
this field.

545
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,919
Although, if it is only going to

546
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:30,720
be, it looks like it might

547
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,880
be two trailers worth of grass off this

548
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,440
little

549
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:39,919
bit. It might not even be worth risking

550
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,919
losing the trees to go ahead and

551
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
mow,

552
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:49,840
but we'll have to see.

553
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,640
Yep. It looks like it might be two

554
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,919
trailers worth.

555
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,919
Uh, see if I can sneak out this

556
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:03,679
way. Now, if they get bigger, it might

557
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,679
it might still be worth

558
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:13,799
it.

559
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:13,799
Um, but yeah.

560
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,200
I

561
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:27,039
really really don't like losing profit

562
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,279
like that though. So I think what we're

563
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,880
going to do because I don't want to run

564
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,799
over our

565
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,559
crops. Just definitely want to avoid the

566
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,840
crop destruction. I think I'm going to

567
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:43,080
use the bunker up here and go ahead and

568
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,080
fill that.

569
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:53,200
Um, so we'll have 12 pallets next next

570
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,200
episode of Lettuce at about $1,000 a

571
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,240
pallet. That'll

572
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,240
uh be 12,000 in lettuce. So that that

573
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,440
won't be too terribly bad.

574
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,440
Um, plus whatever we're going to get off

575
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:12,360
the silage. So, you're looking

576
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:16,120
about possibly making we'll say

577
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:18,279
30,000 next month.

578
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:20,600
Um,

579
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:23,720
possibly.

580
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:29,399
Now, that being

581
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,399
said, in order to put down our

582
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:37,279
uh lumber

583
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,279
mill, so that's going to be

584
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:47,840
about I think 12,000 10 or 12,000 to go

585
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,360
ahead and put down the lumber mill that

586
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,039
we want.

587
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:59,720
Um it was one of the only ones that I

588
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:59,720
found that will do the prefab walls

589
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:06,720
um and still be a decent size to fit on

590
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,720
our farm.

591
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,800
So, I think that's the one we're going

592
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:16,079
to end up going

593
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:17,240
with. Uh, and then it's another 30,000

594
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,240
for

595
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,240
our

596
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:26,440
concrete plant.

597
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,780
So, we will have to save up for that as

598
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,359
well as the

599
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:37,480
[Music]

600
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:40,720
additional 40,000 to get our

601
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:42,240
um sprayer where we want it. So, I'm not

602
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,480
sure which one we're going to do first.

603
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,480
I

604
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:54,440
know if we can make about 40,000 every

605
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,440
couple of months, that'll be great.

606
00:34:54,919 --> 00:35:04,440
But I am so like I'm still on the fence

607
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:08,119
on which one we should do first. Should

608
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:12,480
we should we go ahead

609
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:12,480
and get the lumber

610
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:18,079
rolling or should we go ahead and get

611
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:21,520
our sprayer situated the way we need it

612
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:23,640
to be? I think we might end up getting

613
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,280
the sprayer done

614
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,160
first just

615
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,640
because that's going to be something

616
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:35,040
that's going to be a little bit more

617
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,040
useful in the

618
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:43,119
future. Or well, actually, no, they're

619
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,119
all going to be pretty useful.

620
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:52,440
Um, at least getting the sprayers. uh

621
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,720
fixed with uh pulse

622
00:35:52,440 --> 00:36:00,079
modulation. Um and

623
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:03,520
then possibly around planting season.

624
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,440
Oh, and we are full. Okay. So, yeah, a

625
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,960
little bit over two trailers. So, it

626
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,480
might still be worth it to mow.

627
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,920
Um if they grow up a little bit bigger,

628
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,560
hopefully we're not going to run the

629
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:18,839
risk of deleting the tree just because

630
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,839
we simply bumped it with a mower.

631
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:24,000
Uh we're going to have 3 months before

632
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,160
that grass is ready to mow again. So

633
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,160
we'd be looking at mowing again in

634
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:35,119
July.

635
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,119
So that's going to

636
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:40,800
be good little ways

637
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,680
away and maybe be able to get another

638
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,800
growth stage out of these trees before

639
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,000
that cut.

640
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,680
I don't think I am going to go ahead and

641
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,960
mow those just yet. I might

642
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:59,079
save that for next

643
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:02,079
episode if I decide to cut it even at

644
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:02,079
all.

645
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:08,720
Uh now

646
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:12,040
cows. Cows is another thing that we

647
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:16,240
wanted to invest in.

648
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:19,480
Now, we don't currently have enough

649
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,000
money to deal with cows

650
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:25,920
either. We have what we need to feed

651
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:31,599
them, but the cow pin itself and then

652
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:35,520
buying the cows is quite pricey.

653
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,839
And unless we just stick with a super

654
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,079
small

655
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:45,280
pin and maybe fit only 20 cows, I'm not

656
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:48,440
sure how good 20 cows is going to be as

657
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:54,640
far as milk production. I think we are

658
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:54,640
producing way more food than 20 cows can

659
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:04,960
eat. And that would just leave us for

660
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:08,880
the most part with that secondary grove

661
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,200
of trees just sitting over there cuz one

662
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,200
of the

663
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:19,480
uh one of the cowpens that I installed

664
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:22,119
is a lot smaller.

665
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:25,440
Um it's about the size of the chicken

666
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:28,079
coupe and it can fit about 20 cows in

667
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,480
it.

668
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,960
And then there's another one from that

669
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,960
mod that

670
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,760
uh it's still

671
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,680
a it doesn't have a pasture, so we can't

672
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,640
really

673
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:51,599
extend how much there is. It pretty much

674
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:54,400
only relies on the food that we give it.

675
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,400
So, no meadow

676
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:59,680
grazing. And it holds 40

677
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:08,160
cows. And so that that might be an

678
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,280
option. And then we just continue to

679
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:15,960
grow trees over

680
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:15,960
there in the grass over there.

681
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:25,680
But I I

682
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,680
mean 40 cows is still 40

683
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:36,520
cows. So that might be the way forward

684
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:39,720
is just go ahead and forego the

685
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:44,160
pin for cow for

686
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:46,079
uh taking the 40 cows and producing milk

687
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,880
already.

688
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:51,599
Now, that is something that we would

689
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,520
possibly be able to afford. Let's let's

690
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,240
go ahead and take a look why we're

691
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,920
dumping.

692
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:01,920
Um, all right. So, yeah, what I was

693
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,920
talking about here

694
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:11,920
is But it's a breeding barn, so milk

695
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,920
production wouldn't

696
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,200
happen, man.

697
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,839
H I don't

698
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:30,640
think What about this one? So, this

699
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:32,880
would be 36,000, which is right in our

700
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,880
price

701
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:39,200
range. I know I don't have it at the

702
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:42,079
moment, but we'll be able to put that

703
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,599
down right over here.

704
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,400
Still want to give us a little bit of

705
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:49,040
space to get in and

706
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,040
out of our

707
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,640
silo and then space to get up to our

708
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,929
[Music]

709
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:05,200
house. That's

710
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:07,960
tough. So, we would have to almost put

711
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,960
it right up against the trees right

712
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:12,640
there and we'd still be able to go in.

713
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:15,520
So, what about this one? Okay, that's

714
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,520
about the same

715
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:21,400
size that has. So, for an

716
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:25,720
extra

717
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:28,720
$3500, we can get five extra cows in

718
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,720
there.

719
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,680
H. And that would actually allow us to

720
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,119
have Yeah, that that's not even worth

721
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,119
it.

722
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:47,280
Um, that'd be 50

723
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,280
cows or

724
00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:52,720
40,000. And of course buying the cows as

725
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:54,680
well. But yeah, I didn't even think that

726
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,960
these

727
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,960
were. Yep. Okay.

728
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:08,560
Um, and I'm not sure

729
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,560
if I do have

730
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:13,200
a mod on here to

731
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:22,040
add milk. Oh, but it's 30,000. Okay.

732
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,319
Yeah, I

733
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:29,680
think I think it'd be worth it just to

734
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:32,000
go ahead and buy the one that allows for

735
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,000
uh

736
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:40,280
milk and versus buying that

737
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:43,079
extension. So, I'm not

738
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:46,400
thinking unless we just buy

739
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:48,880
calves and then add the extension in a

740
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,680
little bit later once they're raised up

741
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,680
a little bit.

742
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,040
But I was thinking even if we just buy

743
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,040
10 cows, 10 adult

744
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:07,240
cows, that

745
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:10,720
would that would help us out

746
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,720
milkwise a lot

747
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:17,319
more than just selling the silage

748
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:17,319
outright.

749
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:27,640
So that is something to think

750
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:30,079
about that. Do we want to go with

751
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:33,040
buffalo the water buffalo or do we want

752
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:37,160
to go with cows? I know buffalo milk

753
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:40,160
sells for a ton more but the cows

754
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:42,960
themselves produce a ton more milk than

755
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,960
what buffalo

756
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:48,800
does.

757
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:51,319
Hm. A lot of decisions to make around

758
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:56,599
this farm. So, we're definitely going to

759
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:56,599
be looking at those in the future.

760
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,839
But I am going to go ahead and get this

761
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,839
all picked up

762
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,720
and we'll get it

763
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:20,800
compacted and we will see you guys once

764
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:23,079
I am done with that so we can spread

765
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,319
some lime out on this

766
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:28,880
field. Right. So we will see you all

767
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:32,880
then. All right. So, we just finished

768
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:35,599
compacting our silage. So, get that

769
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,599
covered.

770
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:38,960
Um, and

771
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:45,520
then we'll get our roller put

772
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:48,640
away. I almost think we should put the

773
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,480
roller clear in the back. So, we don't

774
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,480
use it nearly as much as we do the

775
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:56,160
mower.

776
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:59,200
So, I think that's going to be what

777
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,200
we're going to want to

778
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:06,400
do.

779
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:10,000
So, get this put away and then we will

780
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,160
grab our fertilizer spreader. I think it

781
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,680
should be empty. And probably our pallet

782
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:19,240
forks and go get some lime.

783
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:23,359
Uh hopefully we

784
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:23,359
can get all the lime we

785
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:27,800
need quick, fast, and in a hurry. And

786
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,920
then we'll get

787
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,920
that thrown down.

788
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:39,920
Um not sure with

789
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:39,920
this. No, it

790
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,960
took

791
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,400
four I want to say four pallets of lime

792
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,400
last time we did this

793
00:45:50,839 --> 00:46:01,359
field, but that was also with the old uh

794
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:03,560
spreader. So, we will want to probably

795
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:07,440
take a look at

796
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:09,240
that. Actually, I think what we'll do is

797
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,040
so I

798
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:14,880
know our trailer

799
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:16,920
is probably going to be needed. So, I

800
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,680
think we'll take

801
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:21,839
our spreader down to the other end of

802
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,839
the

803
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,319
farm so we can start as soon as we get

804
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,240
down

805
00:46:27,319 --> 00:46:35,359
there. And then we will grab our trailer

806
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:35,359
and bring that up with us

807
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:43,440
to the shop to go ahead and purchase our

808
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:43,440
lime.

809
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:49,280
Um

810
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,280
although

811
00:46:51,160 --> 00:47:00,400
h we need four pallets, don't we?

812
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:01,920
So, I wonder even if we go ahead and

813
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,319
uh that's probably not going to be a

814
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:06,440
good place for that. Yeah. So, we'll go

815
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:09,839
ahead and place this down

816
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:11,560
here. I wonder if we take our box

817
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:15,240
instead of the whole

818
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:18,800
trailer, will that be something that

819
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,800
will be

820
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:27,680
useful? as we don't quite have a

821
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,680
hole.

822
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,920
Uh yeah, we don't have

823
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:43,720
a whole bucket of stones at the moment.

824
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,839
So, we can just pile that there.

825
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:49,240
Um, but can

826
00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:53,359
we just trying to

827
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,359
see is there a way

828
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:59,359
to open

829
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,359
it? So if I lower

830
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,160
it is there going to

831
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:12,720
be X? Nope.

832
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:18,319
Okay. But there is tension belts. So,

833
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:21,119
what we can do is we will Oh, pick that

834
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:22,880
back up real quick. Turn off that. We'll

835
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,760
grab our pallet forks and we'll run up

836
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,760
to the shop and grab our lime. We should

837
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:30,319
be able to fit two in the back and use

838
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:34,400
that as a counterwe

839
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:37,920
uh and have the other two on our forks.

840
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,319
I think that's what we can do and get

841
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:44,200
that

842
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:47,839
done. And uh if I

843
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:50,839
can. Yeah. Okay. So, we are going to go

844
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:53,559
ahead and drop off our

845
00:48:50,839 --> 00:48:57,480
bucket. We'll need that next month when

846
00:48:53,559 --> 00:49:01,280
we go to sell our

847
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:02,680
silage. Did get a little over 170. Why

848
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:06,720
is

849
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:06,720
that? Okay. What did

850
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:16,480
I Ah,

851
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:23,960
okay. So, up and

852
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:28,800
down. Oh,

853
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:30,800
okay. Good to know. We can lower the uh

854
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,680
tailgate on it.

855
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:36,520
Nice. Okay, so we're going to go ahead

856
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:40,000
and run and grab

857
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:42,319
our lime that we're going to need. I

858
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,559
believe four pallets should be fine for

859
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,559
this

860
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:50,839
field, but we

861
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:55,720
will definitely see and

862
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:55,720
hope. Four pallets is

863
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,599
What?

864
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:08,079
$1,800. So, we can afford it at the

865
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:14,480
moment. If we're only putting lime down

866
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:16,280
every three cuts on the field, that's

867
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:20,040
not too terribly

868
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:24,000
bad. I know it would increase

869
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:25,000
our yield a little bit more if we threw

870
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,200
it down

871
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,480
every every cut,

872
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:33,520
but that's

873
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:36,359
just I don't think that's going to be

874
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:42,559
costefficient uh compared

875
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:45,079
to what the difference is in yield.

876
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:48,720
So, we

877
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:48,720
will lower this

878
00:50:52,119 --> 00:51:00,640
down and disconnect it. And then run to

879
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:03,760
the shop real quick. I don't get stuck

880
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:07,640
on the pallet forks tripping over them.

881
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:10,920
And we will grab some lime.

882
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:15,400
Okay. So, we

883
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:18,400
need four pallets of lime. Yep.

884
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,400
$1,800.

885
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:28,079
Okay. So, we should be able to get two

886
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:31,440
in the back. Granted, we're going to

887
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:31,440
have to grab them one at a

888
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:39,960
time. And

889
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:43,680
then then we can have those just readily

890
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,680
available to load

891
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:50,760
into our fertilizer

892
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:55,440
spreader. I don't think I got that in

893
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:55,440
the right place. There we go. All

894
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:04,000
right. And is it being ready? Well,

895
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,160
honestly, we might be able to fit all

896
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,240
four of them in here. And then we just

897
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,400
have all of them ready to go right next

898
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,400
to

899
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:19,599
it. Now, not sure how

900
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:21,680
heavy or what that's going to do to our

901
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:24,640
tractor trying to lift that much and

902
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:28,480
take it down, but I think we should be

903
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:28,480
fine. I don't think we're going to tip

904
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:33,520
backwards. Can I

905
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:43,760
Maybe push it. Yeah. Oh well. Well,

906
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:46,559
yeah. So, we'll get this all loaded and

907
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:50,200
we'll get down there and I will see you

908
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:53,680
guys once we are down with the

909
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:55,920
lime. All right. So, we brought the lime

910
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:59,680
down. I did go ahead and just bring it

911
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,760
on the forks just to save a little bit

912
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,280
of time there.

913
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,359
Um, so we're going to go ahead and get

914
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,359
this filled

915
00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:11,599
up. Uh, we do want to go ahead and make

916
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:14,680
sure uh that we are running into our

917
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:17,680
market, but we want to go ahead and set

918
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,680
up

919
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:24,400
our our

920
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:27,480
lines and then we'll build this up.

921
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:32,160
Should be about 1,000 lers if I remember

922
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:32,160
correctly. Yep. Okay. Awesome.

923
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:37,160
And then we will hop into the field.

924
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:40,640
Spread out some

925
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:42,880
lime. I do want to get a running start

926
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,880
on

927
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:53,920
this just because it seems

928
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:56,720
to prevent getting those deep blue areas

929
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,480
as much as long as we are driving

930
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:02,079
already.

931
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:04,680
So definitely making the field look a

932
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:08,400
whole lot better

933
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:08,400
limewise. But that's

934
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:13,520
already half a pallet gone right

935
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:28,480
there. All right.

936
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:32,240
So, we are definitely going to end up

937
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:34,240
using a lot more lime than I initially

938
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:38,000
predicted. Hey, at least it used the

939
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:38,000
same pallet twice.

940
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:47,440
Okay, but I think getting a running

941
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:51,000
start on distributing the lime is the

942
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,000
way I want to go.

943
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,920
Um, that way we're not piling lime up at

944
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,920
the

945
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:08,520
start. But I guess I let our field get

946
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:12,760
so bad limewise that it just cost us one

947
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:17,440
pallet to do the

948
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:17,440
first first pass on the

949
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:23,160
field. Just not the greatest.

950
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:30,880
Um, so we're gonna end

951
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:33,520
up probably having to get another two

952
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,520
pallets, I

953
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:36,960
think.

954
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:45,280
Um, yeah, I think I will jump ahead and

955
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:48,720
I will let you guys know how many more

956
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:51,119
pallets we had to buy. If you would

957
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:53,280
like, please drop a guess down in the

958
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:56,960
comments and see how many pallets of

959
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:59,599
lime this field is going to take and I

960
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,760
will let you know once we get back. All

961
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:05,599
right, so we just finished lying the

962
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:07,880
field. I'm not sure why there's that red

963
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:10,160
line right there in the middle,

964
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:13,520
but not a whole lot we can do about

965
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:14,960
that. um ones on the border, I'm pretty

966
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,599
sure, just because that grass right

967
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:19,520
there is not mowed and so we couldn't

968
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:24,160
get the lime down. So, I did go ahead

969
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,160
and buy another four pallets.

970
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,160
Um

971
00:56:28,839 --> 00:56:35,799
and yeah, so we used about five and a

972
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:39,839
half pallets

973
00:56:35,799 --> 00:56:43,480
total to lime the field.

974
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:47,599
So, not as efficient

975
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:50,160
as our spreader that we had before, but

976
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:55,040
honestly, it kind of saves us a little

977
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:58,000
bit of time um to do this. So, now that

978
00:56:55,040 --> 00:57:00,000
all the lying is done, we are going to

979
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,480
go ahead and get everything put away.

980
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,480
We're going to

981
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,520
get Yeah, we're going to put the mower

982
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,599
away. We're going to put the fertilizer

983
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:13,359
spreader away.

984
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:15,720
Um, and then yeah, we should be able to

985
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:20,160
see you guys

986
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:21,160
next in the next month and we should be

987
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:24,160
able

988
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:27,280
to put down some liquid fertilizer. We

989
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,280
definitely should be able to

990
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:36,119
afford once we sell off our lettuce and

991
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:38,680
silage again, should be able to afford

992
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:44,520
to upgrade

993
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:44,520
our sprayer a little bit.

994
00:57:47,319 --> 00:57:53,760
um in order to put that uh pulse

995
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,079
modulation on it.

996
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:59,200
So, that's what our goals are moving

997
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:01,680
forward is to go ahead and get our our

998
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:04,119
sprayer upgraded for the fertilizer. And

999
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:07,119
then we will look at doing

1000
00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:10,400
uh the weeding upgrade a little bit

1001
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:13,040
later on in the season, probably when we

1002
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,040
get closer

1003
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:18,520
to planting down crops again.

1004
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:27,119
But yeah, I think I will leave the Oh, I

1005
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:29,440
need the pallet forks. So, we'll go

1006
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:31,720
ahead and grab our lime and bring that

1007
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:36,720
up and put that in the

1008
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:36,720
shed in case it rains.

1009
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:44,760
And then

1010
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:47,680
we Yeah, we'll get everything put

1011
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:49,839
away. But definitely thank you all for
