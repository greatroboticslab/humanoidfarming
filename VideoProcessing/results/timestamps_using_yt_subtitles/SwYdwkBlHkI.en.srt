1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:08,120
things I wanted to talk about today are

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:12,300
how to get started in homesteading and

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:17,970
self-sufficiency you can't really just

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:22,740
jump in and expect things to work it

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:24,660
just it does not work that way and so I

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:31,170
wanted to do this series kind of like

7
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:33,739
some tips how I got started not only in

8
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:38,579
a home setting and self-sufficiency

9
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:41,510
there's some light but basically how to

10
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:44,190
become debt-free and about six years

11
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:48,450
it's taken me you know could take you

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:50,460
longer it could take you shorter but

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,480
when I started I had a plan and that

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:59,840
plan is what is crucial and let me kind

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:04,670
of back you up to the beginning and

16
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:09,210
hopefully that'll help you so I bought

17
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:11,340
property a house with some land with the

18
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,040
intentions of eventually a home setting

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,369
and becoming self-sufficient and also

20
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,409
becoming debt-free and when I bought the

21
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,119
land it was never a homestead before is

22
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,189
actually a vacation home the guy toonder

23
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,080
for 20 years it's on a lake and

24
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,500
basically they come out and spend

25
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,680
weekend or two a year and for the most

26
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,450
time it was not lived in and they mowed

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,970
the grass and that's really about all

28
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,229
they really ever did and actually

29
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,640
according to some of the neighbors they

30
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,310
didn't really weather grass that I

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,750
wasn't either but doesn't either here

32
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,869
nor there

33
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:51,000
so things that I think are crucial to

34
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:54,810
allowing me to get to where I'm at in

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:58,259
such a quick manner or that first when I

36
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:01,020
bought the house I did not do anything

37
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,740
at all for the first year and that

38
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,910
wasn't intentional because I wanted to

39
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:11,250
walk the property and keeping a high on

40
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:13,470
what was in bloom and what I was seeing

41
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,230
for the first year because

42
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:20,190
it changes as the seasons change you

43
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:22,020
know everything else changes also and I

44
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,550
was trying to also put together an idea

45
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,290
like where I wanted to have a chicken

46
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,580
coop where I wanted to have goats and

47
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,130
where I was going to put rabbits and

48
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,740
where the garden was going to be at and

49
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:34,610
you know all these things and my

50
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,830
original plans had to change because

51
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:41,730
during that first year I found like nut

52
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:43,260
trees that had I just acted on a whim

53
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,660
and did what I wanted to do from the

54
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,000
start without taking that year break and

55
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,380
paying attention I would have cut down

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,230
nut trees that are a natural source of

57
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:58,410
you know food I would have cut down wild

58
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,300
blueberries and blackberries that are

59
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,130
also a source of food you know I

60
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,170
probably get a gallon or more of

61
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,750
blueberries and blackberries from the

62
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:10,590
wild plants not counting what I've

63
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:13,370
planted myself in the nuts and there

64
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:18,000
were some fruit trees three different

65
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:21,060
mulberry trees that you know had I had I

66
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,350
done my plan originally without knowing

67
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,300
they were there I probably would have

68
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,540
cut them down because they just look

69
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:33,540
like trees that weren't on very well and

70
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:35,370
also I found two plums up close to the

71
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:40,590
mailbox that really look like they were

72
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:42,209
dead until till that first spring when

73
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,760
they come to life and I was like oh it's

74
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:47,850
something growing on there and as time

75
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,420
went on I realized it was a plum natural

76
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:54,150
wild plum tree and I Mary come pump so

77
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:55,830
anyways that's what I did I took one

78
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:59,670
year and I didn't do anything I just

79
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:02,459
observed observed the property I would

80
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,470
take walks at least once a week

81
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,940
sometimes almost every day I would just

82
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,190
take a walk and I take a piece of paper

83
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:11,519
and I kind of like sketched out the

84
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:15,030
property and when I find places I would

85
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:17,340
mark it on my paper and literally it got

86
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:21,330
to be so much that I started taking a

87
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,760
GPS and dropping waypoints B just so

88
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:25,740
that I could find

89
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,580
hey there were nuts on the ground here

90
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,129
where's the nut

91
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:33,210
yeah you know go back and look go back

92
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:34,650
and find the nut tree and you know that

93
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,430
kind of helped a lot and I'm glad I did

94
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:42,000
that because it totally changed my

95
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:43,919
original layout of the property and it

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,169
allowed me to plan where to put the

97
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,259
rabbit hutch without destroying any

98
00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:51,930
natural food or where to put the chicken

99
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,280
coop or where to put the goats or you

100
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,069
know where to put the garden where to

101
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,050
put the orchard all that stuff once I

102
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:59,669
knew what was here naturally that was

103
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,629
edible then I could plan around that

104
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:05,849
without destroying it all right so

105
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:09,000
that's the first tip live on your land

106
00:05:05,849 --> 00:05:11,400
for a year and observe it through all

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,409
the seasons that's the first tip the

108
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,949
second tip I want to talk about is have

109
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:21,449
a game plan and basically what I did was

110
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:23,819
I kind of knew what I wanted and I'm

111
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:25,590
just like everybody else I'm kind of

112
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,800
impatient at times and I want everything

113
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:33,389
yesterday but homesteading is expensive

114
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:36,419
so you need to have a plan in a budget

115
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:38,009
for homesteading I'll get it

116
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,210
you know where all this is gonna talk

117
00:05:38,009 --> 00:05:41,279
about that but there's gonna be more

118
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,659
things too so I started with a

119
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,889
spreadsheet and I started with simple

120
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:45,240
stuff like where am I gonna put the

121
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:47,520
garden I thought the garden was pretty

122
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,319
important right off the bat that was one

123
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,870
of the first things I did and then right

124
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,879
after that was chickens and really

125
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,250
knowing what I know now I probably would

126
00:05:53,879 --> 00:06:00,900
have went with rabbits next instead of

127
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:02,669
the chickens but no matter to kind of

128
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,490
touch on why that happened though is

129
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:07,589
pound for pound when you look at the

130
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,009
cost to raise rabbits and the food they

131
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:13,379
eat before they're ready to harvest is

132
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:15,289
much less so than what it is for a

133
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:17,520
chicken so chickens you got to have like

134
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:19,680
six months before they even start laying

135
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,659
eggs where rabbits you know you can

136
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,310
harvest them after a few weeks after

137
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:25,379
they're born they don't really eat a lot

138
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:27,440
as much or you know not as much as

139
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:29,729
chickens they're easier to maintain and

140
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,099
pound-for-pound the rabbits beat

141
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:33,779
chickens every time and I'm still firm

142
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:36,839
believer and act five or six years now

143
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:38,789
on the homestead I'm a firm believer

144
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,210
that I probably you know doing it over

145
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:44,500
again I would have got rabbits but

146
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:46,210
for I got chickens all right so having a

147
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:47,949
plan what I did was I created a

148
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:50,620
spreadsheet and I put down goals for

149
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:53,099
each year and then I estimated what each

150
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,849
one of those goals would cost me to do

151
00:06:53,099 --> 00:06:59,199
and I'm gonna tell you right now

152
00:06:54,849 --> 00:07:00,970
homesteading is not cheap like unless

153
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,620
you bought an existing home set if

154
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,180
you're starting from like I did a your

155
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,699
home setting from scratch which means

156
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,400
there wasn't a chicken coop on the

157
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:11,740
property there wasn't goat barns there

158
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,660
wasn't rabbit hutches none that stuff so

159
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,919
you're starting from scratch let me give

160
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,509
you some figures and these aren't

161
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:17,889
exactly you know if you want the exact

162
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:20,860
figures I'll tell you these are just

163
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:22,870
estimates what I know to be true it cost

164
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,870
me about twenty four hundred dollars for

165
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:28,419
me to build my chicken coop and run by

166
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:32,080
myself that's what it cost me in

167
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:34,960
materials and you know time was you know

168
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,460
quite a bit of tongue it was it was

169
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:39,099
actually spread out over a month because

170
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,860
it rained almost every day that month so

171
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:44,259
I would get an hour to you know more

172
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,810
work done every day over a month but you

173
00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:48,639
know if if I was going to build it and

174
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:50,259
have a really good solid weather week

175
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,599
probably would have taken me four or

176
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:54,130
five maybe six days to build it the

177
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:56,289
rabbit hutch cost me about three hundred

178
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,789
dollars to build so another reason why I

179
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:59,710
would have started with rabbits way

180
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:01,360
cheaper to get started the rabbit hutch

181
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:06,940
is way cheaper to build than a chicken

182
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:09,370
coop is and and they produce more faster

183
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:13,169
so that's another reason why I would I

184
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:17,740
serve the rabbits the goats the goat is

185
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:20,620
surprising how much its cost I've got

186
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:25,539
two of the three sections of the goat

187
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:27,550
barn done and the goat the fencing the

188
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:29,440
goat barn that I've got done already the

189
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:34,060
fencing and the goats have cost me

190
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:39,969
almost eight thousand dollars now eight

191
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:41,469
thousand dollars five goats you know so

192
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:47,020
although that's expensive I think the

193
00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:49,959
rabbits so the rabbit hutch you know 300

194
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,480
dollars and in the rabbits I paid about

195
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,529
a hundred dollars for three rabbits give

196
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,269
or take

197
00:08:53,529 --> 00:09:00,819
so I had $400 in the rabbits and the the

198
00:08:58,269 --> 00:09:03,519
first chickens that I got the chicken

199
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:05,259
coop and run cost me $2,400

200
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,560
I didn't pay anything for the chickens

201
00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:11,379
so you're looking at $400 vs. $2,400

202
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,499
plus I had to feed them chickens for six

203
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:16,059
months before I ever got the first egg

204
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:17,860
where the rabbits only had to feed for

205
00:09:16,059 --> 00:09:21,240
two months and I already had nine

206
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:24,100
rabbits ready to go in the freezer so

207
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,579
that's kind of how that worked the

208
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,579
garden

209
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:32,170
I've probably got four or five thousand

210
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:34,029
dollars in my raised bed garden and you

211
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:36,399
know materials cost money soil

212
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:38,589
amendments cost money the fence cost

213
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,350
money to keep out the deer all that

214
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:43,660
stuff cost money so what I did though

215
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:45,730
was instead of doing all at once I broke

216
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:49,300
it down into every year I created a

217
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:51,459
budget you know what I had income wise

218
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,740
what my bills cost what was left over

219
00:09:51,459 --> 00:10:00,759
how much of that that I was going to put

220
00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:02,680
into the homestead part and then another

221
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:05,110
section of that I put into paying off

222
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:07,300
excess debt because I was working on

223
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:09,639
multiple goals I wanted to homestead

224
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:11,110
that was one goal I also wanted to be

225
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:13,480
debt-free within a certain amount of

226
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:15,790
time that was a second goal and then I

227
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,370
had all these projects to do around the

228
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:22,930
homestead to get you know all this stuff

229
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:24,160
done without getting deeper in debt so

230
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,529
that's the other thing you got to do you

231
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,189
got to not get deeper in debt do this

232
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:32,230
with cash money so you know these people

233
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:34,720
that I see that are posting all the time

234
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:36,040
like how much money can we make off our

235
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,399
homestead of this is our first year

236
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:43,779
should not even be your first work

237
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:46,059
because you should keep your job as a

238
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:49,209
way to finance your homestead until you

239
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:52,689
get an income coming in so that's gonna

240
00:10:49,209 --> 00:10:53,079
be the third tip is you need a source of

241
00:10:52,689 --> 00:10:56,949
income

242
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:59,139
Wow your homesteading weather you know

243
00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:01,899
if you're married and you're a couple at

244
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:03,899
least one of you should work maybe both

245
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:05,740
of you should because that first year

246
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,360
you're not going to be doing anything

247
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,370
you're just going to be observing right

248
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,870
because we are following step one you're

249
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,279
just gonna observe what's on your

250
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:15,760
property so that you don't go mess

251
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:19,420
something up another thing was only a

252
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,089
homestead I had a bunch of dandelions

253
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,649
that only grow in one spot of my yard

254
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:26,529
and that's where I had originally

255
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,880
planned to put the garden had I put the

256
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:29,649
garden there there would not have been

257
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,839
dandelions for me to make the underlying

258
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:33,519
jelly with kind of the same way with red

259
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,010
buds now there's a lot of Red Bud trees

260
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,320
on my property but a lot of those trees

261
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,700
would have got cut down because I had

262
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,529
originally planned to put the orchard

263
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,440
somewhere entirely different than where

264
00:11:41,529 --> 00:11:47,709
it was and my original goal was to go in

265
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,990
and cut down all the trees that was

266
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:52,060
currently there and then build a new

267
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:53,290
orchard in its place and if I would have

268
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:57,670
done that I would have cut down several

269
00:11:53,290 --> 00:12:00,399
nut trees several red buds you know

270
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:03,970
there was just other other reasons why

271
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,910
so that first step is the most important

272
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:10,390
the second step is figuring out a way to

273
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:13,899
finance your goals without going into

274
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:18,459
more debt keeping a job you got to keep

275
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:21,190
a job the the way that I bought this

276
00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:23,140
property and have done everything that

277
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:25,180
I've done so I come here I did the

278
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,670
gardens I did the rabbits I did the

279
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,949
chickens I've done the bees I down the

280
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,680
be expansion I've done over 70 fruit

281
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:34,000
trees I've done hundreds of berries so

282
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,740
many berries I've lost track I don't

283
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,540
even try to count them no more the fruit

284
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,310
trees are simple I can just go one two

285
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,570
three four or five so that you know on

286
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,550
down the line until they're all counted

287
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,230
berries I've got them everywhere I've

288
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:49,959
planted berries I don't even forgot

289
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:53,620
about berries but all that stuff takes

290
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:55,899
time and you might say you know it's

291
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:59,410
probably gonna take me about two days to

292
00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:00,699
build the chicken coop and it you can

293
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:02,890
have bad weather and it'll take you a

294
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:07,420
month and if you are really tight on

295
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:08,740
your schedule then you're not gonna stay

296
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,300
within your schedule and you're gonna

297
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,850
get aggravated because things are

298
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,890
over-budget and you didn't get

299
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:17,730
everything you done you wanted to do so

300
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,899
make sure you include some down time

301
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,450
over a lot on the amount of time that

302
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:22,640
you

303
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,810
it's gonna take I've seriously gotten

304
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,250
any more where if I think something's

305
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:29,330
gonna take eight hours I just multiply

306
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:31,790
by ten and that he's surprised how often

307
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:32,840
had actually works out so you know I

308
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,420
thought it was gonna take eight hours

309
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:38,480
but it ended up taking Haiti and that's

310
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:40,010
pretty realistic and that's not a lack

311
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,530
of experience that's just dealing with

312
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:44,180
things like weather and just stuff that

313
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:47,810
can go wrong on you know on the

314
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:49,010
homestead an animal gets sick I've had

315
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:53,360
to happen numerous time they just

316
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:57,170
totally mess up my plans for that day or

317
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:02,530
the next couple of days so that's

318
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:07,430
another tip what else can we talk about

319
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:09,500
getting out of debt I did something so

320
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,500
when I started to do this a lot of

321
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:16,040
people started telling me about Dave

322
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:19,400
Ramsey and I never followed his I never

323
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:21,110
followed his like the way he does it but

324
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,260
what I found out was the way that I did

325
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,940
it was pretty close

326
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:31,280
instead of doing snowball I did

327
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:35,600
Avalanche and I kind of did it on my own

328
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:39,950
and I created a spreadsheet to help me

329
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:41,930
track my expenses and budget and what

330
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,820
I'm spinning out and my goals and all

331
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:45,950
that stuff so I got some spreadsheets

332
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,170
all linked to in the description if I

333
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:50,120
don't forget if you hear it in the video

334
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:54,800
and it's not there remind me I've

335
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:56,450
actually got blank ones ready to go you

336
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,480
guys have the goats they're like going

337
00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:00,950
crazy because they hear me talking

338
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,780
they're just gonna have to wait that's

339
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:04,400
kind of like what I wanted to discuss

340
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,260
this is gonna be a multi-part series

341
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:08,780
because I can already tell I'm at 16

342
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,060
minutes now and I try to keep my videos

343
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,400
you know relatively low so through

344
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,600
editing but there's gonna be a second

345
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:17,350
part to this video this is only the

346
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:21,290
first part I have several series planned

347
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:23,360
I basically just touched on the three

348
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,670
things that I felt is super important

349
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,370
for you to do if you want to get into

350
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:30,890
home setting and self-sufficiency and do

351
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,540
it without failing because I'm gonna be

352
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:37,139
honest with you I am now

353
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:42,269
all my sixth year and if all goes well I

354
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:44,190
will be 100% debt-free and about between

355
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:46,139
12 and 17 months kind of hard to tell at

356
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:49,170
this coronavirus the only thing I want

357
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:51,630
is my house everything else I pay cash

358
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,940
for or I charge it to a card and I pay

359
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:56,220
the card off that month so you can do it

360
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,730
you just have to stay focused and you

361
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,079
have to have a plan and you have to know

362
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:03,240
what you want to do that's for what I

363
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,529
really wanted to say was you have to you

364
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,120
