00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,160
hello my name is Matt Lacroix I'm the

3
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,009
marketing manager for Massey Ferguson

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,020
hey equipment and if you haven't met the

5
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:35,000
best silage cutter Baylor's in the

6
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:38,420
market let me introduce you to the RB

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,280
Series loading mesh into your RB series

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:43,790
is really easy we have a convenient

9
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:47,449
ladder that folds down you can hop up

10
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:50,329
onto the platform a storage roll goes

11
00:00:47,449 --> 00:00:52,519
here and under the side shield here we

12
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:54,949
show that in a minute but to load the

13
00:00:52,519 --> 00:00:58,070
mesh all you have to do is flip your

14
00:00:54,949 --> 00:01:00,350
mesh over in there now let's go up here

15
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,659
and see how the mesh system works so you

16
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,840
have your mesh in the holder cradle you

17
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:06,950
flip it over into its working position

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,140
your out your mesh through these bars

19
00:01:06,950 --> 00:01:11,299
and you go across this foam roller here

20
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:13,159
this foam roll or may look like you're

21
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,439
gonna take it to a kid's pool actually

22
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,350
it has a very good use and what it does

23
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,240
it spreads the mesh evenly across the

24
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,210
entire Bell width now that we've loaded

25
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,320
our mesh the ladder folds about easily

26
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,229
with your platform

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,570
and since safety is always key remember

28
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:31,760
your tailgate shut off valve is here we

29
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:34,040
have it in the lock position now so will

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,570
not open and close before you unlock it

31
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,970
since we're in this area we'll talk

32
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:41,240
about the split gearbox here the split

33
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:43,909
gearbox is original design to us and

34
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,380
what it does it evenly transfers the

35
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:47,840
power from your pto

36
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:50,090
to each side of the baler therefore

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,740
you're equally driven on both sides the

38
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,940
pickup on the RB series is very

39
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,650
heavy-duty let me show you some key

40
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:57,140
features that makes this a really great

41
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:59,510
pickup so you have a wind guard roller

42
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:00,830
here helps keep that prop mat compressed

43
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,770
as you go in and along the wind row

44
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:05,360
we've got offset teeth on the ends now

45
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,820
you may ask probably have offset teeth

46
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,739
the reason being is we have these augers

47
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,299
back here these augers going to move the

48
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:14,090
crop over because the pickup is wider

49
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:15,250
than the bill chamber so it's going to

50
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,720
move the crop over

51
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,760
so these teeth are offset so it

52
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,379
constantly feeds that auger is there

53
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,360
waiting to the next set of teeth comes

54
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:24,080
in and from this angle you can see the

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,299
front of our rotor

56
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,250
these are silage cutter round balers so

57
00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:30,470
that means the rotor is gonna spin and

58
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,819
pull crop across the knives

59
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,380
now when we look at service in a little

60
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:35,209
bit we'll get to see a better view of

61
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:36,950
the knives so once you've loaded your

62
00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:38,100
mesh upfront you need to put some

63
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:40,230
tension on that mesh

64
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,270
so it doesn't free will you can use this

65
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,920
handle here and you have two different

66
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,270
lobes depending on what size mesh you

67
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,370
load into it since these Baylor's are

68
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:50,280
four feet wide you can use a 48 inch or

69
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:53,520
52 inch these Baylor's hold three rolls

70
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,820
of mesh to storage one being used to

71
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:58,440
very unique features of our RB series is

72
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:01,350
protection of your knives when they're

73
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:04,320
engaged also the Hydra flex floor and

74
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:06,150
the drop floor our knives are controlled

75
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,700
by hydraulics they're hydraulically

76
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,740
controlled up and the hydraulically

77
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,140
protected if you come across an

78
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,820
obstruction such as a rock in the field

79
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,860
as you're going through the field your

80
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,780
window may not be perfect even all the

81
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,790
way across so you'll have different

82
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,130
amounts of crop coming into your pickup

83
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,800
that's why we have the hydro flex floor

84
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,450
this floor moves up and down as the

85
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,240
windrow density changes throughout the

86
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,370
field now if you ever do come across an

87
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,790
obstruction they cannot fit through

88
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:35,520
there

89
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,680
and it gets plugged don't worry no do

90
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,930
you get out of the cab from the monitor

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,240
in the cab you can automatically lower

92
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,610
the floor what will happen is the knives

93
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,370
will disengage themselves the floor will

94
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,650
come down you reengage your PTO the

95
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,690
material that is lodged will go into the

96
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,550
bell chamber then you raise the floor

97
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,880
back up re-engage your knives and away

98
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:56,730
you go

99
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:59,100
all of us have had to dig out of the

100
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,060
chamber that's plugged in August and

101
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,550
it's super hot

102
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,140
this will keep that from happening now I

103
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,000
have the tailgate locked out

104
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,490
always make sure safety first you lock

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,050
out your tailgate before you service

106
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:13,580
your knives or any part of your bill

107
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:18,210
chamber as you can see here we have four

108
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:19,890
endless belts for positive traction now

109
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,510
let's look into the knives these

110
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:24,540
Baylor's come standard with 17 knives

111
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:27,570
you can engage zero knives eight knives

112
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,070
nine knives or 17 now if you want a

113
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,530
different combination other than those

114
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:35,190
you have to come back here and manually

115
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:37,580
remove the knives now if for some reason

116
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,260
you want to keep the knives out always

117
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,390
you can get these optional blanks to put

118
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,780
in there let me show you how the process

119
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:48,450
is done to remove your knives slide this

120
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,580
back and there's a holder on the front

121
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:51,490
and back as you can see it holds in the

122
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,979
front and the rear and the

123
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:57,610
a magnet that holds it and lined up for

124
00:04:53,979 --> 00:05:01,750
you and to put a blank in goes in this

125
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:06,669
way this goes on your front bar and once

126
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:09,550
you get on that bar slides in place the

127
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:11,800
RB series comes with 17 serrated knives

128
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,840
and since these are serrated if you do

129
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,900
need to sharpen them you'd do that from

130
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,580
the backside only and I would suggest go

131
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,770
ahead and get ordering 17 more knives so

132
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,449
you can keep a fresh set with you at all

133
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,759
times and there is storage on side the

134
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:27,300
baler for that this is the knife locking

135
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,259
handle here it is in the lock position

136
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:33,880
and then we move it to the unlock

137
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:35,380
position to remove the knives when you

138
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,449
look at the back of the baler here you

139
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,599
may see these circles and wonder what

140
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:42,759
those circles are for when you actually

141
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:45,490
are using these Baylor's in the field

142
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,110
you run the tailgate and float the

143
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,880
reason we run the tailgate and float is

144
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,470
as the bail grows that tailgate sinks

145
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,500
down as you can see and it moves down

146
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,570
and that keeps constant tension on the

147
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,300
springs on the side to keep your chains

148
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,639
lubricated we have a reservoir here a

149
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:04,630
pump down here and it automatically

150
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,880
pumps oil into your lines we have a

151
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:09,099
combination of brushes and pads on your

152
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,919
chains to keep them lubricated and

153
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:13,930
running smoothly to make sure your mesh

154
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,349
is applied effectively we have a powered

155
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:19,300
mesh roller so what this does it powers

156
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:22,960
the mesh into the chamber to get it

157
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,490
started quickly and effectively while

158
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,319
we're here we can also look at our mesh

159
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,030
tensioning system there's a couple of

160
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,949
changes you can make in here to make

161
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,949
your mesh tighter or looser depending on

162
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:35,139
