  "text": "hi I'm John duet with the North Dakota State University extension service I'm an area livestock specialist and I'm pleased to welcome you to our program on background and Cavs in 2015 each fall our Ranchers have to make some production and marketing plans and typically about half of them we their Cales and feed them for a period of time to heavier weights which we call backgrounding the fundamentals factors which go into the profitability of this uh Enterprise vary quite a bit from year to year we've had recent years of extremely high grain prices we've had years of rising rapidly Rising cattle prices during this backgrounding phase but today 2015 we're faced with fairly cheap abundant feed and a cattle market which has been on the downslide so I think to get things started here and getting a little insight into the economics and what the potential is for backgrounding this year I'm going to ask a few questions of our livestock marketing Economist Tim Petri who's stationed at the NDSU campus in Fargo so Tim I guess you know this Market's really been moving a lot mostly down what are your price expectations for the 550 lb kind of vaccinated calf coming off the cow going into the market today yeah sure I agree that we really have had a volatile Market with last year record high increases and then the last couple of months we've had a big downtrend uh Main causes for the decline being a contra seasonal downward fed cattle market caused by many factors including a backlog of heavy cattle and record weights also record high pork production you're going to hear record a lot today record high pork and poultry production and a stagnant export market so uh yeah price expectations is a very good question uh somewhat difficult to answer probably due to the wide ranging prices for the same weight and greater C at the same Market uh again due to many factors such as are they weaned or unweaned uh or preconditioned do they have health programs and so on so uh I expect another 20 to $30 range like kind of happened last year and in prices at the same Caves at the same market and so uh as we can see in the chart we have a more normal seasonal pattern this year with declining prices in the second half compared to last year when they went up every year so keep that in mind um we are expecting calf prices to be about 25 to 30 Cent per lower than last year so for example a 550 steer last year that brought 280 is closer to $200 even to 210 this year of course every Market has good news and bad news for those selling caves the bad news is we're below last year and probably below earlier expectations of a few months ago but the good news is we still have the second highest price prices ever but for those buying Cales it's still going to mean that they're going to have to come up with a lot of money I think we'll sell a lot of steer Cavs in that 195 to 210 area and again like always heers are really discounted this time of the year $20 or for the lower end even more so uh that puts them in about 175 to 190 sometimes we see some preferences for the real light C especially when we have a good winter wheat crop down south and they need some great in animals I would think with the price of wheat this year not looking too optimistic there'd be some interest in grazing what do we see on the slide on the weight classes between lights and Heavies okay yeah well we really haven't had a good test to light caves yet because we have such good conditions out in North Dakota and there hasn't been much weaning or light caves brought to Market uh but for sure the price slide is a lot less than it has been the last couple of years there are several reasons for that um most of the calves coming to market now are not weaned or preconditioned and our balling calves that's typical of an early Market again not many being sold you mentioned winter wheat and that is the big one uh winter wheat planting is way behind schedule particularly in Texas and Oklahoma and it's dry down there and so that market has not materialized yet with the weather pattern where we they are expecting rain and we hope that we get it but so far that is not materialized and and so uh the market is really encouraging producers to wean and precondition Cales looking at the charts for instance for last week uh average 550 steers were about 205 but the 750 to eights were only $10 behind at 195 so uh last year the market was $40 differ so we need that winter wheat crop to really materialize to to get any spark in those lighter calves well you you've given us a pretty good indication where she's trading in this early market and also said they were're kind of seasonally normal starting to slide down as the the runs of Cavs come to town can we expect some uh when we could hit a seasonal low and when can we expect some recovery or is this all guessing game well that's a good question and yeah Cals do usually reach a seasonal low in November when all the cattle come off of pastures and the big runs hit the market as the chart shows the market is already declined since August about 20 to 25% so the big seasonal decline is behind us in fact it's one of the largest in history declines here in the last couple months so um some weakness still may occur especially in those unweaned calves without a health program or uh you know that are the less optimistic calves there but uh uh and you know there's a lot of volatility and certainty in the market which causes buyers to be a little bit more reluctant on those uh calves that don't have a health program and so on but if we can get some rain in the winter wheat belt and get some seasonal strength back in the feeder in the FED cattle market that is which is possible that would support prices uh however we're not going to go back to last year's prices for sure and cyclically we are on the downtrend so we need to keep that in mind well we know backgrounding works really well when you're in a rising market because then the price cattle get more valuable every day you got them and you feed them and take care of them uh big question now is what are these six s 800 pound feeders going to be worth come January February March because if we had a good idea on that then we'd kind of know how this is going to pan out yeah that's always the $64 question and while calf prices tend to increase after the first of the year the heavier weights often do decline after the first of the year would be a normal seasonal pattern however the range in prices for those heavier weight cattle do narrow because they have been weaned they have had a health program and so on uh January to March feeder cattle futures are trading below cash prices now in fact just a couple of weeks ago they were a lot lower they've rebounded $10 to2 so we've got January Futures in at about 180 now and the March Futures in a little dollar or so lower than that um still below the CME cash settlement price which is all 650 to 850 Cavs so the Futures is still discounted to the current cash market so I think uh as a first step we do have to look at the Futures Market as a Target uh hopefully we can get some strength as I mentioned before back in that fed cattle market and we can do better than that but also keep in mind that there's always risk in a volatile market so producers need to ke keep that in mind as well well we got a little idea where the cattle are trading where they might be going using the Futures a bit of a guide feed is fairly cheap interest is kind of low fuel cost is down quite a bit what would be your cost of gain Target for Cavs doing that two to two and a half a day in a backgrounding program yeah okay feed prices do vary quite a bit across the state and we do have a wide variety of feed stuffs and speakers later are going to discuss some of those uh it even depends on if you're selling corn to the elevator versus buying corn there might be a 30 Cent difference there so that obviously affects our uh bottom line but you know I think now we should look at the low 50s for a cost of gain some certainly with lower feed costs and lot costs and so on will do it in the 40s a few might even be up in the 60s but let's shoot for those lower $50 range is a good starting point well that is kind of with those kind of cost of gain projections and uh kind of our uh slide on the weight classes narrowing up this year when you put it all together what's the budget show there a little room here to make some money background and gavs yeah absolutely on my website I have an Excel spreadsheet that producers can use plugin their own information there's also a calf web break even budget there so in the example you see on the screen now I just brought in a 550 weight calf at $25 and then a 750 calf out at $175 and January March whatever you want to use I have a 2 and 3/4 pound of gain uh corn at $3 again corn is kind of all over the board my example shows about a $50 per head return and interestingly enough I went back to last year at this time when calf prices were a lot higher 280 Cavs we're projecting 230 out came out to $50 last year at this time so the market does try to I think encourage some backgrounding and and some return there and very similar to last year but you know it looks like we can background calves as we all know however there are many factors that affect calf prices and there is risk and we've seen that in the last couple years but that's how it looks right now well thank you Tim for sharing those uh insights into the economics maybe backgrounding this year is there anything else you want to pass along as we close well uh you know uh again going back to that wide range in calf prices uh if you look at the bottom level and and add value to some calves that helps heers are always discounted this time of the year and uh sometimes are really a nice Market class to background because every 50 pounds we gain prices on steer Cav so uh you know just uh look for some of the best opportunities there for making some money thanks",
