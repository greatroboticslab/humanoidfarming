  "text": "everyone welcome to the afternoon sessions The forers Forum my name is David trinkin I'm on the faculty of the pl Sciences unit University of Missouri it's my pleasure to moderate the first uh three hours worth of sessions to begin with I would like to introduce my colleague Dr San Jen goo who is state vegetable extension specialist as well as a faculty member at Lincoln University in Jefferson City before Dr Goo arrived in Missouri I don't think many missourians at least heard of the concept of vegetable grafting much less tomato grafting since his Ral it's been kind of a standard best management practice and today he's going to give us an update on some of the research he's been carried out in in grafting Dr Goo thank you div I give one presentation before I mean this morning for the seminar and uh let me let me get this started uh this morning I talked about uh uh hold on let me let me move to the other one you can see the outline over there just for today whole day so this morning I talk about uh the introduction part and what why and then we talk about how and this afternoon I'm going to talk about uh my research at the linol University um before you before we start um for those who were not able to make to my presentation I do have a handouts which is actually our newsletter articles and my two assistants Sean and C going to uh distribute them to you there to be two and there should be three articles but I'm still working on the third one so the first one is introduction about vegetable grafting uh the second one is about tomato grafting uh this morning I discussed in detail about how to do grafting in general not only for tomatoes but also for pepper for for eggplants for watermelon cucumber and curbage stuff so if you are interested in my presentation uh send me email so I can send you a pdf version um so um just give you a pre-warning this afternoon's talk will be my research update and it will be really dry so you'll see a lot of figures in the graphics stuff so it's not going to be so colorful with pictures like this morning and also um I wasn't able to get all the data analyzed for this year um we made some mistake there and by not including the controls so so the result will be primarily from last year but um uh you you find what we did last year so how many of you have uh attended my seminar this morning okay um so how many of you think you are very confident with the grafting part already one hand two hands three hands pretty good so like I said today and this afternoon will be research update I will not give you a lot of information about the general General uh grafting technology stuff uh it will be just some research okay again my name is sanin and sanin with linkoln University extension uh I have been with I've been in Missouri for almost five five years now time F time just passes fast okay um what we did last year we did two research at least to research projects number one is the grafting compatibility study with heirloom tomatoes because we I introduced the idea to our Farmers about uh tomato grafting they always ask me questions whether you know if I have a heirloom can I just go try them you know do you have any research data to see where they're going to take because you put two things together there is a good chance they will not attack so that's the reason behind this research of course people are interested in U in in uh High tunnel uh or field airom tomato production especially for organic or for or for farmers markets um so that's why I did this research and uh um for those who those of you who don't really know about grafting yet um I can tell you some Advantage number one it'll have a uh disease especially Sor born disease resistance because of the root stock and number two if you choose a good roof stock you usually have a enhanced Vigor and your yield usually be enhanced to be increased uh and also uh High tunnel has been getting popular and we use high tunnel for season extension especially in win uh in early fall or uh early spring or later spring so we want to catch maybe two more months time to produce more warm seeding vegetables as well as some of the cold seeding vegetables so grafting uh with correct roof stock you do enhance your s on um code hardness so just some background information for you okay um for this research what we did uh this is just introduction part we don't have to go through this again um what we did last year we choose about 21 uh heirloom tomatoes and we grafted them on two root stocks uh bufort and a maxi for so we use the tubing grafting method we tried all those um aom Tomatoes you can see some of them like a Kentucky beef steak Branny wine uh pink heart I like this one actually so what we did briefly we used the tubing Masters this shows you how you do it and for those of you who went to my talk this morning is should look familiar uh this picture was from uh those pictures were from Dr uh revert from uh can Kansas State University and basically what you do you grw your your roof stock and your s on the similar size you cut your roof stock and either before about or up below or uh over the cuton Lance I prefer this one because later you don't have to remove suckers and put a tube on it this is called a tube graphing method because the tubes were designed specifically for this method and you slide this tube in and then you cut your cion different angle 45\u00b0 and you slide this in make sure the two surfaces contact each other and that'll be it of course later you have to move into a growth chamber to to heal them um so basically for this uh in clamation process for day one to three you keep to close to 100% darkness and close to 100% humidity and after 3 days you slowly reduce darkness and keep relatively high humidity and then after 7 to 10 days they are as normal if they take uh one lesson I learned from this year was uh the temperature even though it's not listed here the temperature plays very important role in the survival I guess um you don't want to keep your temperature before 80\u00b0 Fahrenheit and the uh room temperature will be actually very nice uh the story was for for my my observation was before a meeting um I grafted something for some kids and uh I just dropped them in my office and then they came back 7 days later they all survived without any cover so that gave me the hand that the temperature is very very critical uh my office temperature in summer time is about 70\u00b0 or lower so the this survived really well and humidity maybe just less than 50 so keep that in mind okay um we did the greenhouse research this is my growth chamber we did just build some frame and cover with some plastic that's it I do have a a household humidity fire inside uh this is just show you the picture of the grafted uh transplant and those are survived transplants so those Greenhouse study and I graph them and to see uh the survival whether they are successful or not so here's the result like I said it's all graphic stuff and this is my heirloom variety and this is my survival rate rate with one is 100% so this is on Buford the roock bford you can see the lowest one is The Branding one red is actually not too bad 80% by the way I gravitated all this by myself it took me a lot of time so most of them close to 100% take so it was really really good and for Maxi for however I did this some difference and uh you can see this mortgage lifter and the um I don't I don't even know how to read it the h55 they were particularly low I tried to find out why it was this low I guess I probably was just too tired I don't know so uh however if you see the statistics you see even those 90 80% on bord survival and the 72% on Maxi for by uh the uh statistic analysis they are not significantly difference so even though there are some exceptions there uh we will see in general uh there's not there was not at least in the greenhouse uh setting incompatibility issue so which means you can grab them they can take really well and they can grow and then whether they going to be okay in the field or not we don't know because earlier just like a just like the uh uh the grips you grab them they look really well you plant them some of them you know they they will die or slowly reduce the Vigor after 10 15 years so we did the greenhouse study just to see whether crafting is successful or not and then we plant them in the field to test them in the real um environment especially in the open field and last year was a good year to test because it was hot and dry uh so we we planed those successfully um survived uh graphity transplants in the field this is how we did it in OB field it was really dry and we we measured the grow and yield and yield dat is not available yet I believe because last year we just didn't have a Tomatoes until later in the growing season and when the weather was cold and we harvested a lot Green Tomatoes not not red ones so we we measured the uh stem diameter and then we measured the stem diameter above and below the graph Union trying to find index to see uh to measure the uh compatibility so so here's one picture showing this any wi pink graphy Buford you can see the roads and here is graft Union here is graph Union here's graph Union and some of the plants we actually planted a little bit too too deep uh however you don't see a lot of roots growing out above the graph Union you know which was okay we don't want any rules come out from from the S part okay um I split this this graph Union and uh you see the picture here uh you do see a kind of a diagonal line here showing the graph Union but even those here so in this so this one is non grafted you see visually you don't see a lot of difference so which means they they do really well if you see the the connection here this is a scon this is your root stock there's no obvious stop stop there even though you can see something there so I draw a line there just to show the graphity unit over there and for stem diameter we always tell people that if by choosing the good roof stock uh your growth the your s growth rigor can be enhanced so we measure the stem diameter you can see on bu for or Maxi for all those stems were bigger than the non-gravity control so with does show the difference on the on your on the thickness of your your your stamp that's one way to say you have a enhanced Vigor uh then for the diameter ratio above and below of course non-ra will be zero I mean it will be one and for bord and maxfor the graph Union actually did something to the plant see above the graph unit is a little bit thicker than the lower one even though visually by your bare eyes you don't see the difference if you measure with measure them with the caliber you actually see the difference so we do see some difference over there and the conclusion here is um um well here is uh well this is about the the greenhouse trial uh we had a better luck with maxford than Buford and then we know I just said that we had a bigger or thicker uh stems for the graphic ones so the most important conclusion for this part is a grafting compatibility seem not to be an issue so at least in the tested 21 varieties so if you have a heirloom tomato I'm I'm thinking I'm about maybe 90% sure you will not have incompatibility if you for for for uh Tomatoes you know the reing incompatibility is so important uh just because uh if you think about it you do grab you you grab the watermelon or cucumber or Melon you know if you add some bitterness to your watermelon I don't think people like it but for tomatoes I don't think it's a big challenge so um then again that last year we we did some uh um uh airom trial with graft with grafting in the high tunnels and uh we I have two High tels one is double layer poly uh the other one is single layer poly so we did some research on that and uh the with some uh what we want to do to find out uh if grafting will enhance the heirloom tomato production in high tunnels and number two to find out whether single layer versus double probably will do some diff do something to the earum tomatoes especially graphite ones in the High Time and uh I I placed one sentence here tomato gravity and the high tunnel could be a perfect combination uh the reason behind that you know people started to do uh High tunnels uh well largely because the NCS got involved they get they get they got involved with the the cost share program so we have seen a lot High tunnels everywhere almost in the middle west so when people try to use new high tunnels they don't have a at least they don't maybe just beginners like I don't know but their soil is kind of new they don't have a lot of soil born disease problems but in the future since high tunnel is a little bit cost costly to build to maintain and it give you more money so you tend to produce more of your cash crop like tomatoes and the rotation is limited in the high tunnel and you want plan you want to apply more manures or compost so sooner or later your soil disease will build up your soil salinity May Will May uh May build up if you're not careful enough so by doing that you cause a lot of trouble for your production and then and you cannot use mes bomide anymore because it's banned for it environment to damage so you cannot use f Fant to do that the new one not be uh as well as the one we used before like M bomide or they may have some environmental issue as well or simply because you are organic or all natural farmer you don't want to do anything with that so but doing hype doing but but adapting the grafting technology you can avoid those uh fumigation part so that we we did we use two s variety we have an ananas in the German pain two big fruit uh type variety um pretty good quality and uh we graft them into bufort emperador and Maxi for this year I wasn't able to find this variety and for some reason seed companies don't carry over uh seeds over years anymore I don't know why so I couldn't find this one uh for roof stock I have a bu for and this and for the combinations for German pink I do have a self-grafted German Pink as control I have a non-grafted grafted on itself as control but for ANS I didn't have enough seeds so that's the uh uh combination of grafting grafted tomatoes and um I can tell you I didn't take this picture I didn't really um it's a little fuzzy but this is German pink and this this is anus Nora it's very tasty variety and same thing we do the tubing graphing method we graphing the greenhouse last year we were late so we planted them in May usually we be in this area we will plant them in the high tunnel late week of March or early April but we were late uh we were not getting the seeds in time for some reason the seed company agreed to send me the seeds they forgot to do it so anyhow and then the first batch of the the grafting graphed stuff uh it were killed with one weekend uh my I guess my technician was not on campus and the student worker didn't do a good job they just they just cooked in when they were in the chamber so in the green house with sunny light with black stuff on it they were killed so um people ask me did you fire fire your uh student worker as no I didn't give give him another chance uh another story so this is my highight tonal 30 by 96 uh with Rich vent and uh this is single layer this is double layer it's uh it's a li men's brand yeah remember we're in zone 5B and uh like I said we plan them late and then we ran right into this heat uh uh weather so for quite a few while we didn't have a uh we didn't have a harvest because it was too hot but however we kept them there or kept them going until later fall so um we do have some data for last year and this is how my plans look like I do have automatic system to to drop the curtain down and up and also a controller to control the r event so I had a pretty good system um to automatically manipulate my temperature just because I cannot be there every day neither did my technician so you know this is a When I Was preparing this talk yesterday um I used one previous presentation I have a the extreme hot and dry summer in 2011 but it wasn't true anymore this year was even bad so I removed that word but still tells you you know in late June to to almost the early part of August we have a really really to this part as well really bad uh weather and know we know that I think I have another line here you know pretty much here 75 uh you see the plant growth for tomatoes get influenced about 97 I think pollination will will stop and if about 1202 degree the whole plant may just may just not grow so this is especially true for for heirloom tomatoes which primarily is just in indeterminate so you can see I do have some heat tolerant varieties there unfortunately this is my variety trial part that's not the the grafted part but other just like this for a long time no fruit because pollination was was impossible so we do see some temperature difference between the two high tunnels the single layer versus double layer basically in the early in the early in the morning well in in the morning the the the single ler has higher temperature and then the night at night you you double at a higher temperature this is May uh and then the pr is the photosynthetic activity radiation you see the difference between the two uh ler system you know in the high tunnels so if you um if you think about um maintaining the Heat in a high tunnel you may think about using double layer but in the in zone 6 b or above I don't think it's necessary just give you some um environmental factors there to help explain the uh explain the result so for the yield this is single layer you have a we have a green uh German pink German pink on German pink and then on three roof stocks you see pretty much similar from U August here the basically you don't have I didn't have any Harvest and then we I do have a some Harvest starting in the late uh where early part of October until uh the frost came well not a frost the freeze temperature came in um I was actually in Pennsylvania for a meeting where my technician students are Harvest those tomatoes so you see really you don't see a lot of big difference for double year you do you do see some difference here for this one the green line is the German pink on bufor and we always see the the Maxi Fort will uh transfer the most Vigor to your s but u under that condition you know it is so hot bu for is less vigorous variet roock variety actually didn't did better than others and uh for this one you can see the non- graphit one overall perform the worst so we still see some difference in double year poly for for for the ananas you see the the similar chain but you don't see a lot of big difference here so for the double year uh this ones on this EMP paror roof stock did a little bit better than others similar to this one so if put this in together for for the an German pink we see very difference uh between uh the root stock treatment you know different root root stock and S of combinations for example this one the double layer seem to be better for this one as well but others may not so so it varies depends on the variety but for ananas the other variety you see the double or did better so we do see the difference between the two type of high tunnel when you graft those Tomatoes uh so this is result know generally speaking I don't see a lot of difference between the grafted ones and non-grafted ones even though for for uh I think for for NS nor uh one Ro stock vary performed better and we see the difference you know the the non-grafted tend to be lower yield but because the heat last year it didn't show the potential difference so I cannot see the significant different um and but in the field in in the in the greenhouse I did see that the graphed ones were more vigorous here is the arrow so temperature was different between the single double e or high tunnels so basically the tick home message for you is uh grafting can enhance Vigor number one number two uh the Double year will be better and the weather you know the three for whether the the grafting had a benefit or advantage on this trial uh you I cannot tell you but this year we may have a better result however well this year we tried the same variety on S on different root stock 1 2 3 4 five however we when I was trying to analyze data found out the control uh were not included there I mean we were data was there but were for the arrange data were not there so wasn't able to do the stats analysis statistic analysis so I'll present the data probably at the great PLS conference in January and also going to post the result on our website so you get this sooner or later okay um this is a just quick update and again this is just a result research results I think I have a couple minutes for questions first yes I saw where you're doing melons and cucumbers has anybody done this or is it does cantaloupe fall in the same category as watermelons uhal yeah his question is um um whether people have been doing research or or or demonstration with uh curbage stuff like watermelons cucumbers and I haven't done this yet I have collected uh uh three cucumber uh roock varieties which can also be used for watermelon and the melon so I'm going to do some research with cucumber the English cucumber type this year uh Dr hin Jaw from un University of Florida she's been doing uh melon cantaloup grafting study and there's another USD guy doing watermelon so there's big uh special crop research initiative Grant um it is looking at different aspect of grafting so uh that Grant started last year I'm I'm assuming results will start to come out next year but in China they grabbed all watermelons and cucumbers and melons in the uh uh in the greenhouse and high tunnel settings they are doing great yeah simar cucum it's a similar process as melons and cucumbers yes yes for for all cubits the graphing message will be similar and uh the result may vary because if you're talking about watermelon and melon you're talking about the sugar content so the sometimes if you're not careful and choose the wrong variety variety the the the quality may be may be reduced however the research done by USD people with watermelon they found out know if you grafted them it enhance the shelf life other questions question um what about as far as like other online Resources with little you know uh you know the indepth specifics of grafting and planting schedules and that kind of thing is there like any more like online resources or books that you might suggest for vegetable grafting in general um there are quite a few Publications for Farmers is extension Publications um there are some research projects as well uh I know in in in heart science in heart technology there are some Publications on grafted tomatoes and there is a review in heart science on grafted watermelons and Artic cbits so uh our I don't know how good you are with uh scientific journal but at least you can try if you want to you want to do the uh uh scholar.google.com uh you can get a lot scientific information there",
