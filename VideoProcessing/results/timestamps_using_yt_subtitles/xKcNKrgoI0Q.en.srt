1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,080
you know i've got a serious question for

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,080
you guys

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,880
does this bucket make my trash look big

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,560
okay i promise that's the only bad joke

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,080
that i can think of right now for this

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,920
video but if i come up with more

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,199
i'll make sure i include them but what

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,320
we're talking about in this video here

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,320
is going to be sizing

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,640
attachments appropriately for your

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,080
machine all right so this is a 72 inch

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,800
heavy duty bucket

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,000
on a john deere sub compact tractor okay

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,719
and so what you're typically going to

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,360
see

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,079
on a 10 25 r you're gonna have a few

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,719
options you know like a 49 51 53 that

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,040
i've seen

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,719
the most common being a 49 and a 53 not

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,800
even sure they make the 51 anymore

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,760
but regardless this is a 72 inch heavy

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,760
duty bucket here

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,440
obviously it should hopefully look a

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,800
little bit disproportionate to the

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,239
machine itself and so

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,440
you know there's a common sense factor

27
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,280
to all of this and that's kind of the

28
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,399
overarching theme here but we'll go

29
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,280
ahead and get to the nitty gritty as

30
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,199
well and give you

31
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,320
several ways to look at this on how you

32
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,160
can size your

33
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,239
your attachments or your implements

34
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,840
appropriately to match the tractor

35
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,080
you know so something that's drastically

36
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,760
too small can be just as annoying and

37
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,360
frustrating and inefficient as something

38
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,960
that's drastically too large

39
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,040
yeah there may be certain applications

40
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,880
where something that's on the very small

41
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,520
side or on the very large side

42
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,799
would really come in handy but you know

43
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,000
the majority of the time

44
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,280
something like that isn't going to work

45
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,960
very well and it's going to make it a

46
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,920
worse experience for the operator

47
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,560
rather than getting something

48
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,000
appropriately sized and as usual if you

49
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,439
like what you see here consider hitting

50
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,799
that subscribe button right underneath

51
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,240
the video make sure to read through the

52
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,920
description as well a lot of helpful

53
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,840
links down there links to my website oh

54
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,520
yeah that's goodworkstractors.com i can

55
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,880
help you with a tractor like this

56
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,560
with an attachment for the front of the

57
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,000
back put together a whole package

58
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,560
i can help with financing and shipping

59
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,640
too okay so sometimes you really have a

60
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,159
size restriction that is going to

61
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,159
determine the size of attachment that

62
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,280
you want and so a good example of this

63
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,240
are folks that are going to be going

64
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,079
through the woods you know whether

65
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,119
they're creating a trail or maintaining

66
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,640
a trail or

67
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,920
they need to get back to food plots that

68
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
they have through the woods on the other

69
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,280
end of their

70
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,680
uh you know of their homestead and you

71
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,360
just

72
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,880
you can only fit much through there

73
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,640
right so it can be the same thing that

74
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,000
said versus an open station and a cab

75
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,520
tractor if you only have this

76
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,400
this tiny little area to get through you

77
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,720
want to have a small and compact of a

78
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,000
setup to navigate through the woods and

79
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,200
and i can tell you with first-hand

80
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,640
experience you know getting

81
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,480
some of those larger tractors with

82
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,000
larger attachments is definitely

83
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,280
a lot more of a pain in the butt than

84
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,640
navigating through the woods with a

85
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,239
smaller machine

86
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,360
so you look at these box blades here for

87
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,560
example you know these are going to be

88
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,640
great for great

89
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,000
uh those pass and and through your woods

90
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,280
and everything else but

91
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,560
you know if you can barely get your

92
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,840
tractor through there then why would you

93
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,879
want to have a bunch of extra width

94
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,000
hanging off either side that's

95
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,160
potentially going to hit

96
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,040
a stump or a tree that you didn't see or

97
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,080
it's clearing

98
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,599
you know brush instead of just

99
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,239
maintaining that pathway that you want

100
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,920
there so

101
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,000
that's another reason to kind of

102
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,440
consider the right size attachment for

103
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,560
yourself and just another angle to look

104
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,239
at it

105
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,680
for whatever reason snow pushers like

106
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,160
what you see here are going to be one of

107
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,120
those

108
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,000
um examples of an attachment that i get

109
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,000
a lot more

110
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,959
pushback on on the appropriate size

111
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,640
versus most other attachments

112
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,480
and i've got a hypothesis that it has

113
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,080
something to do with wanting to get

114
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,760
back out of the cold and into a warm

115
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,400
house as fast as possible

116
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,000
that makes a lot of sense but with snow

117
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,120
pushers what it really comes down to

118
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,680
is weight transitioned into traction you

119
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,440
know

120
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,599
by way of your tires making contact with

121
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,959
the ground and that's the struggle with

122
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,760
something like a snow pusher you know

123
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,519
and why

124
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,519
i am probably more on the conservative

125
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,239
side of not really recommending these

126
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,159
really

127
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,519
wide you know pushers that are two foot

128
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,400
wide or three foot wider than your

129
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,000
machine

130
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,640
although i get a lot of requests for

131
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,159
that and so not only is that attachment

132
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,280
that much wider meaning it's that much

133
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,120
more weight in itself

134
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,879
but it's also going to trap that much

135
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,480
more snow in here that you're also going

136
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,519
to have to push and it's just that

137
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,440
factor of

138
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,200
you know i wouldn't say it's your engine

139
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,200
that really has the problem with pushing

140
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,599
that snow but it's more of a factor of

141
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,560
the tractor the tires making contact

142
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,920
with the ground there

143
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,159
and having that traction to be able to

144
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,920
push that snow along

145
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,159
and so for that case i am typically

146
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,360
going to recommend a snow pusher for

147
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,879
example that is

148
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,480
roughly the width you know kind of like

149
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,080
the same way that your bucket is going

150
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,000
to be sized appropriately just

151
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,200
just a hair bigger than your machine

152
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,720
typically i'm going to do that with the

153
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,079
snow pusher as well there's certain

154
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,519
exceptions to the rule of course

155
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,400
but that's a pretty common one right

156
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,519
there okay so while these are facing up

157
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,199
these actually mow

158
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,120
laying down like this okay these are

159
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,160
brush hogs rotary cutters choppers

160
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,639
shredders

161
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,199
whatever it by whatever name you want to

162
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,560
but

163
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,840
i think we all know this goes on the

164
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,120
back of a tractor right here it's going

165
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,880
to be mowing fields

166
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,479
you know something that you you mow once

167
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,720
a month once a year once every couple

168
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,160
months something along those lines

169
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,440
and these are a really good example of

170
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,800
something for the back of the machine

171
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,320
that is typically

172
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,080
typically going to match up with the

173
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,040
width of the tractor as well so

174
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,400
over there you're going to see these

175
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,680
smaller guys these are for your sub

176
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,479
compacts i can get them in green i can

177
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
get them in gray

178
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,360
kind of like how you see this gray one

179
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,040
right here so they're all going to match

180
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,320
up with the machine i will sell these

181
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,320
for the subcompacts that are they're

182
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,560
four foot wide okay 48 inches wide which

183
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,639
is

184
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,240
pretty much matching the width of those

185
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,360
subcompacts you go to a 60 inch like

186
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,360
what you see right here

187
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,039
this is going to be more for your 3

188
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,320
series now even your 2 series though as

189
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,680
well which those aren't going to be 60

190
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,240
inches wide but they'll be within a few

191
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,840
inches

192
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,400
of overhang on either side which is

193
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,120
appropriate you know 72 inch for the 4

194
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,720
series or the

195
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,000
the large grand l series as well that

196
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,960
kind of thing so you kind of get the

197
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,400
drift

198
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,080
now there are some exceptions to this

199
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,680
rule we talked about the 2 series there

200
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,320
you know those are really what are they

201
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,919
52 53 inches wide and we're going to put

202
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,199
a 60 inch brush hog on there

203
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,199
but let's take an example here let's

204
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,600
talk about the john deere 3025e

205
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,440
okay this is a 25 horsepower tractor

206
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,240
okay it's going to be about 60 inches

207
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,479
wide

208
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,440
now an old rule of thumb an old rule of

209
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,000
thumb okay

210
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,520
is five pto horsepower per foot of

211
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,280
implement okay so five

212
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,720
so this is four foot wide over here so

213
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,880
you would want um

214
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,479
four times five so that's 20 horsepower

215
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,560
to be able to run a four foot

216
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,680
and this is five foot here okay so you'd

217
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,240
want 25

218
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,759
horsepower to run a 5 foot brush hog now

219
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,160
we're talking at the pto not at the

220
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,680
engine

221
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,039
so that makes a little bit of a

222
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,440
conundrum what are you going to do there

223
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,120
right

224
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,120
you're going to get some feedback online

225
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,560
about well hey this says it needs 30

226
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,280
horsepower in order to run this

227
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,199
attachment

228
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,440
it's only 25 horsepower at the engine

229
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,800
machine what's going on there so what

230
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,039
i'm going to do i'm going to run a 48

231
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,560
inch on there and not cover my tracks

232
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,720
or am i going to run a 60 inch here and

233
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,000
see what happens and roll the dice

234
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,199
don't take my word for this but i'd

235
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,560
encourage you to go ahead and look on

236
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,440
the forums that are out there like green

237
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,440
tractor talk

238
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,720
or the kubota ones as well or any you

239
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,280
know any of the tractor forms that are

240
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,400
out there

241
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,720
you're going to see this question has

242
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,000
been asked a lot already and

243
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,960
you know if you don't see it go ahead

244
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,319
ask it again you're going to get

245
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
opinions from folks that have already

246
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,199
done it but

247
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,880
what i'm typically going to do i'm going

248
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,160
to recommend the 60 inch for those and

249
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,000
i'm going to say that because the

250
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,280
majority of the time the majority of the

251
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,440
scenarios that you have

252
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,319
a 60 inch is going to be just fine it's

253
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,400
going to be

254
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,599
the one off situation or maybe the guy

255
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,240
who is going to be doing this

256
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,319
commercially

257
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,440
on new properties all the time with

258
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,440
different

259
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,560
varying levels of growth you know really

260
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,880
heavy dense

261
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,479
stem counts or you know six foot tall

262
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,319
grasses that are super thick and

263
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,160
could bog down anything there's going to

264
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,440
be certain scenarios where

265
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,720
this is not going to be the right one

266
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,800
but for most folks that are going to

267
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,520
maybe mow the same pasture the same

268
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,880
field

269
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,400
you know at their at their place at

270
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,599
their homestead you know a handful of

271
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,039
times a year

272
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,199
a 60 inch is going to be fine in a

273
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,080
situation like that now don't get me

274
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,520
wrong you're going to get different

275
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,400
opinions from that but this is just my

276
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,000
take on it

277
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,520
and i am typically on the conservative

278
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,039
side

279
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,720
you know so i had the sprayer home today

280
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,840
on my 1025r

281
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,360
hitting the lawn up getting some

282
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,960
pesticide on there getting some growth

283
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,160
regulator a little bit of fertilizer on

284
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,160
there too all sorts of stuff

285
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,440
but anyway it got me thinking you know

286
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,720
i'm always talking about ballast weight

287
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,240
and if you haven't done so yet make sure

288
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,599
you read the ballast weight guys you'll

289
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,479
watch the ballast weight videos that

290
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,599
i've done

291
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,880
very important to have that

292
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,080
counterweight in the backside of your

293
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,039
tractor when you're using your loader

294
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,720
it's a very big

295
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,879
safety issue and people have died by not

296
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,039
having the appropriate ballast waste so

297
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,479
you can't overstate the need for it but

298
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,960
it got me thinking you know i hate

299
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,280
paying

300
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,479
for dead weight it's the just the worst

301
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,800
thing you can do right but

302
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,919
sometimes you need to but what if has

303
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,599
anybody done this have

304
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,120
has anybody used a sprayer for ballast

305
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,120
weight you know of course this doesn't

306
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,800
weigh that much in and of itself but

307
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,000
you fill it full of water or you fill it

308
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,039
full of solution whatever it is that

309
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,680
you're going to be using on a regular

310
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,120
basis

311
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,039
and you have it there and it's not just

312
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,800
that dead weight but it's an actual tool

313
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,720
that's on the back side here so any

314
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,560
feedback on this anybody using those

315
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,319
pros and cons i'm just curious it kind

316
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,280
of came to me today i don't know what do

317
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,039
you guys think

318
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,639
as you can see this thing is quick hitch

319
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,319
compatible okay it's got a handheld

320
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,759
sprayer if you want to use it it is

321
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,120
boomless which i like i didn't want the

322
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,280
big booms that are hanging out here

323
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,880
so boomless it goes all the way up to 30

324
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,839
feet feet i think it is for the spraying

325
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,360
path or you can

326
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,680
taper it down to a lawn so you can do

327
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,399
food plots all sorts of stuff with it

328
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,000
this is a 55 gallon it's pto driven

329
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,279
everything you need

330
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,800
oh and if you're curious about one of

331
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,839
these ag spray sprayers right here i can

332
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,320
sell one to you as well

333
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,120
i can even ship it to you go to

334
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,800
goodworkstractors.com

335
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,240
okay so let's take another example what

336
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,720
we're staring at here is a six foot

337
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,760
72 inch wide landscape rig all right so

338
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,120
let's talk about

339
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,880
another way that you might want to

340
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,040
determine the proper width of your

341
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,880
attachment so something like this this

342
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,480
is like it's literally a rake it's just

343
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,959
kind of following along on the top of

344
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,839
the ground

345
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,040
raking up debris as you drive around so

346
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,800
there's not really a lot of

347
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,120
strain or stress being put on the

348
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,560
machine it's simply just following the

349
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,360
contour of the ground you're not trying

350
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,240
to

351
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,519
dig out roots or dig out earth really

352
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,120
even you know you're just simply

353
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,640
raking up the loose debris that's on top

354
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,399
of the surface of the ground

355
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,760
and so i don't really have any issue

356
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,680
recommending a 72

357
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,440
inch landscape rake for a john deere

358
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,120
1025r i think it's

359
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,480
a piece of cake for i don't think it's a

360
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,839
challenging job i don't think it's an

361
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,839
oversized attachment for it at all

362
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,720
i'm trying to wait out that beep there

363
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,720
in the background

364
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,000
so anyway the point being now if we're

365
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,760
talking a 72 inch rototiller for a john

366
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,680
deere 1025r and i keep talking about the

367
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,360
1025r it's just an example you can do

368
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,519
this with any model that you want

369
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,399
but i'm never going to recommend a 72

370
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,800
inch tiller

371
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,399
for a john deere 1025r so you can look

372
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,079
at it from the working width

373
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,839
aspect of it you can look at it from the

374
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,880
weight of the attachment itself the

375
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,120
1025r

376
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,320
whether it picks up 700 pounds on the

377
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,959
three-point i can't remember off the top

378
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,600
of my head

379
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,320
but a 72-inch tiller probably weighs 700

380
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,399
pounds

381
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,320
anyway so if it even lifts it off the

382
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,399
ground it's barely going to handle it

383
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,760
not to mention you know 700 pounds is

384
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,519
about half the weight 50

385
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,040
of the weight of the tractor itself and

386
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,040
so it's just going to throw it around

387
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,560
same thing with a 72 inch brush hog or

388
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,000
even a 60 inch brush hog

389
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,519
you know certain attachments weigh so

390
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,040
much compared to a landscape rake this

391
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,880
probably weighs a couple hundred pounds

392
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,959
where those huge attachments on the back

393
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,399
end they're simply gonna make

394
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,079
even if they do work they're gonna make

395
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,000
the operator so uncomfortable

396
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,079
it's gonna be just a a terrible

397
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,079
experience and if we get beyond that we

398
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,760
talk about the five pto horsepower

399
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,120
per foot of implement while you just

400
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,160
don't have it or anywhere

401
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,760
near it with a six foot tiller

402
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,120
let's look at it from another angle here

403
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,800
okay and so sometimes you're going to

404
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,240
have something for the front end

405
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,000
like pallet forks it could be something

406
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,680
for the back end too but we're just

407
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,880
going to use pallet forks as an example

408
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,040
here where

409
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,320
the width is just kind of it is what it

410
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,079
is right you know whether it's a light

411
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,120
duty frame like this or a heavy duty

412
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,040
frame or

413
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,399
anywhere in between or above and beyond

414
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,839
but the point being is that sometimes

415
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,040
you're more concerned with just the

416
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,360
actual weight of the

417
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,800
attachment of the implement versus the

418
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,040
width of it and that's the case with

419
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,880
something like this right here these are

420
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,480
really light duty forks okay i call them

421
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,079
the ultralight forks they're

422
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,519
they're rated for 900 pounds they're

423
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,200
perfect for subcompacts

424
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,800
honestly i've done a video lifting over

425
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,880
2000 pounds with these things they're

426
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,720
they're built very well okay but they

427
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,000
shaved out a lot of material here

428
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,079
they took off the headache rack there's

429
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,160
no steel up here the point being is that

430
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,200
it saves a lot of weight about 130

431
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,760
pounds away

432
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,360
they're great for smaller tractors that

433
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,720
don't have a lot of loader capacity to

434
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,240
begin with and i can get these for skid

435
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,480
steer quick attach i can get them for

436
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,760
custom attachment styles too that just

437
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,880
have to be ordered or the john deere

438
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,560
quick attach of course

439
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,000
you know or you can get the larger

440
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,600
frames as well okay but

441
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,360
you size them appropriately based on

442
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,079
your lift capacity for your machine that

443
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,160
you have

444
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,440
so that's another way to look at it but

445
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,000
the point being the last thing you want

446
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,160
to do

447
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
is have some huge heavy think about this

448
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,160
so a john deere 10 25 bar lifts what is

449
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,079
it 840 pounds to full height at the base

450
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,160
of the loader okay

451
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,519
this right here weighs 130 pounds less

452
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,279
but it still weighs

453
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,040
about 200 pounds just for a round number

454
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,120
so you think about that

455
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,959
you're lifting 200 pounds with your

456
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,279
loader or you get the bigger heavier

457
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,720
duty set and you're lifting 330 pounds

458
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,079
and we're talking just lifting up pallet

459
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,639
forks you haven't even started to do

460
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,800
actually

461
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,240
any work with it yet you're not lifting

462
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,120
anything besides just the pallet forks

463
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,639
themselves so

464
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,880
why would you not want to save as much

465
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,839
weight as you can with the pallet forks

466
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,519
you know with the tool

467
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,200
that way you can put it in to the work

468
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,639
that you want to get done

469
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,320
if you think about it you know when you

470
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,440
get a front end loader on your tractor

471
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,200
this is going to set the kind of the

472
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,279
table okay for

473
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,880
how you properly identify the size of

474
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,639
attachment but you get a front end

475
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,560
loader which has a bucket on it okay

476
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,240
now typically almost all of those

477
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,480
buckets unless you kind of custom

478
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,600
order it or go against the grain that

479
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,120
bucket is going to be

480
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,720
maybe the width of the tractor or

481
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,560
perhaps just a hair bigger you know

482
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,440
maybe two or three inches larger on

483
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,839
either side

484
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,399
so a four foot tractor like this again a

485
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,320
49 or a 53 inch bucket option

486
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,560
well this is about a 48 inch tractor

487
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,600
right so a 49 or 53 you're talking a

488
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,279
half an inch to

489
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,440
a couple of inches overhang on either

490
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,040
side just enough to cover the tracks

491
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,880
if we talk about belly mowers underneath

492
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,120
the machine as well something like a 10

493
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,480
25 r you're going to have a 54 inch or a

494
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,920
60 inch okay so

495
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,519
you have a couple options there and it

496
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,560
depends on the attachment right but you

497
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,959
can see there's nothing that's going to

498
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,959
be

499
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,240
you know eight foot wide attachment here

500
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,440
on a 10 25 r

501
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,360
nothing that's going to be a little

502
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,720
three foot belly mower on the on the

503
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,160
back or underneath the thing

504
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,519
you know you're not going to have a a

505
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,800
three foot snow blade on the front

506
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,880
because who wants something that doesn't

507
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,000
cover the tracks right

508
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,199
so if you get something that doesn't

509
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,639
cover the tracks well that can be

510
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,040
annoying for a couple of reasons right

511
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,959
so

512
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,639
for instance if it's a belly mower and

513
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,079
you're trying to mow along the borders

514
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,959
of your lawn and the edges of your lawn

515
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,720
that kind of thing and

516
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,320
and you have a mower that doesn't extend

517
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,519
uh beyond the tires then how the heck

518
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,440
are you supposed to get up there to it

519
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,639
same thing if it's a finish mower even

520
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,639
and the same thing can be said with a

521
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,160
bucket okay or an attachment that goes

522
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,680
in your front end like a snow pusher for

523
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,040
example if you're or a plow even if

524
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,360
you're pushing snow along

525
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,079
you know if you're driving over 10 inch

526
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
deep snow

527
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,040
instead of just plowing it along or

528
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,680
moving it out of the way well what good

529
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,880
is that

530
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,320
you at least need to have something

531
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,360
that's going to cover the width of your

532
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,959
machine

533
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,199
and if you think about it engineers

534
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:23,279
should be kind of designing tractors all

535
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,040
around you know from the footprint of it

536
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,639
to the hydraulic system and the engine

537
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,440
size and everything else to kind of work

538
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,639
together

539
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,639
with the attachments that's going to be

540
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,480
going to it because the tractor itself

541
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,760
isn't going to do a lot of work because

542
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,199
you have to have something on the front

543
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,360
underneath or on the back in order to

544
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,399
accomplish the work that you want to do

545
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,320
so it's that kind of thing that you

546
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,360
don't really even you don't even realize

547
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,800
when you're shopping for a new

548
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,160
attachment or you're shopping for a new

549
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,680
tractor and you think hey

550
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,199
it all kind of just came together here

551
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,079
and well i guess i don't have to worry

552
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,680
about it because it just

553
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,120
it just matches up with the width of the

554
