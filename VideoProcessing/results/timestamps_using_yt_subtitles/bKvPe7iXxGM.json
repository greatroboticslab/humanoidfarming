  "text": "[Music] hi this is leo bartolon i'm extension cropping systems specialist based in minot today i'm gonna talk into how we can build and increase our resilience into cropping systems as you may know notice this cropping season was very tough on north dakota especially in the north central region we got extremely drought we under d4 for a long long time and the crops were suffering a lot during this time if we look at medium term and long term into the cropping systems there are some options that we can take into account to diminish the problems with the dry conditions so one of this is how to increase organic matter in our in our cropping systems so we have an environment that is very challenging to grow crops and to increase organic matter but with the right decision into the crop rotation we can increase the organic matter so one thing that we should do is increase no till so reducing the tillage we can conserve more water into the soil and then reduce the evaporation because we can leave the soil surface soil surface covered for a long time and then we can increase our water storage another important thing to do is how we fit cover crops in our cropping systems so it's very challenging here in north dakota to introduce the cover crops especially in the north central and western part of the state but there is a lot of options that we can rely on to increase the use of cover crops especially in the late summer and in the fall and then the cover crops can grow in that period before the frost and then we have the benefits of living plants growing in the short period of time so these benefits will translate it into increase over time the soil structure we need living roots into the soil to increase soil aggregation soil structure and then over time not a short period of time but it takes time so we can increase our water storage capacity so there is a lot of options that have been researched for north dakota for grover crops you can look at our publications so try to fit the cover crops in your system another important thing that we have saw this season here in the dry conditions so a lot of farmers try to seek moisture during the planting time seek moisture i mean plant deeper than the recommendation so we have seen a lot of problems doing this practice you know we should plant like two inches depth and a lot of farmers trying to plant three inches depth and we saw a lot of problem for emergency uneven fields the soil was crusted it's a practice that should be avoided and another issue that prevents your cropping systems to be more resilient is one thing related to speed of planting we came across with several fields with a speed planting problem so it developed the growth in the soil surface that prevent the proper emergency of the crops especially soybeans the most common problem up here in the region there is not an easy fix for building resilience into the cropping systems but there is a medium and long term very feasible options to build your resilience into cropping systems so my final message is try as much as possible to feed cover crops into your into your rotation scheme for you get this all this beneficial in the medium and long term thank you [Music]",
