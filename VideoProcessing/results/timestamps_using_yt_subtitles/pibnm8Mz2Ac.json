  "text": "hello my name is ire Manuel the lead maker for the gravity fed model and gas and kit prototype in this project we are collaborating with students from background Secondary School who are the members of the school science and Innovation Club our project is at a completion stage we are now documenting it for us critical making is about making things that are aimed at solving challenges of the community our intended beneficiaries are the vulnerable refugees to support them with this gravity fed model irrigation kits so that they can be able to grow basic food crops in times of reliable rainfall and also during dry seasons this will help them to improve on their nutrition the overall well-being so in a sense that our making is a small contribution towards the sustainable development goals of UN yeah so we would love to produce as many of these kits as possible thank you",
