1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,600
hey uh my name is Jim Horman and we're

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:06,279
going to talk about the biology of soil

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,599
competion we've had a few problems here

4
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:11,480
this morning but I understand this may

5
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,519
go off at noon so I'm going to speed it

6
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,840
up just a little bit you know when we

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,720
talk about ideal soil composition uh

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:23,279
roughly 50% of the the soil is what we

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,960
call solid material about 45% of that is

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,439
the mineral portion and in an ideal soil

11
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,759
we have about 5% organic matter a lot of

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,399
farmers don't know this but uh as much

13
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:37,040
as 50% of the soil can actually be PO

14
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,800
space however when we compact the soil

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,840
uh a lot of times we don't have that

16
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,320
much so let's take a look at a compacted

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:45,200
soil look at some different bulk

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,879
densities if you look at an uncultivated

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,480
undisturbed wood lot typically the bulk

20
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:55,160
density is anywhere from one to 1.2

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,399
grams per a centimeter cubed and and

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,600
what we're looking at is we're looking

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,039
at the weight uh uh and basically the

24
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,520
weight over a volume of of soil and so

25
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,040
that would be ideal if we had 1.2 gram

26
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,759
per centimeter cubed that would be an

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,040
ideal soil we have

28
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:16,520
about 50% uh Poe space in that but as we

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,720
get into cultivated Clays and cultivated

30
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,200
Sandy loms you'll notice that the bulk

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,040
density increases and that means we have

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,119
less room for air and water to move and

33
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,159
so if you look on my right hand side

34
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:32,479
there at the bottom once we reach a bulk

35
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,680
density of 1.6 grams per cimeter cubed

36
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,399
it starts to become root limiting that's

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,560
somewhere around 250 pounds per square

38
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:42,759
inch we get up to 1.8 and then the roots

39
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,719
are totally restricted and you can't you

40
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:46,560
uh The Roots can't get through there so

41
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,439
that's real important on a lot of our

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,640
soils we're actually uh limiting the

43
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,079
roots and how deep they can go so let's

44
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,520
take a look at at what is typical in our

45
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,600
soils we generally talk about the plow

46
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,439
layer and this may be anywhere from 7 to

47
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,320
8 to 9 Ines deep

48
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:06,000
and you'll notice that we have as we

49
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,920
light as we plow that soil uh the buk

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,720
density goes down it's like around 1.4

51
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,120
and then we reach this limiting layer

52
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,120
there about seven eight nine inches deep

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,319
where it's very hard for the roots to

54
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,160
get through the soil we've seen this in

55
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,239
almost all the soils that we've we've

56
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,120
looked at uh there's a a limiting layer

57
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,319
there and a lot of times especially on

58
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,680
corn Roots they'll go off at a right

59
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,519
hand angle also on soybeans so what

60
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,319
we're doing with the cover crops and the

61
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:35,319
noil as we're trying to break up these

62
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,879
compaction zones the very fine Roots can

63
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:40,440
get through uh ples of weakness and they

64
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:43,239
can uh decrease that bulk density so

65
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,480
that uh uh our main crop the green crops

66
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:48,760
can get deeper into the soil to get

67
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,920
moisture and also nutrients soil organic

68
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,000
matter if you look at some of the

69
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,159
characteristics why we want to increase

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,440
soil organic matter contact look at the

71
00:02:54,159 --> 00:03:00,599
bulk density of soil organic matter it's

72
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,800
about 6 compared to say 1.45

73
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,040
somewhere in that range for where we

74
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,440
have a tiled soil so soil organic matter

75
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,879
has less density in the soil has more

76
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,640
room and more space for air and water

77
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,840
storage and here's an important

78
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,040
characteristic every pound of so organic

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,480
matter can hold 18 to 20 pounds of water

80
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,000
that's why we like to say that s organic

81
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,840
matter acts like a

82
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,680
sponge and here's a a picture of that

83
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,080
you can see the little black areas in

84
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,360
there if you look at s organ matter uh

85
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,879
it's it's not nearly as dense the color

86
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,799
tends to be light to dark brown and it

87
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,200
has room to store water and also to

88
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:45,519
store uh nutrients you also notice that

89
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:49,040
the surface area is is quite large so

90
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,040
that allows uh water to get trapped uh

91
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,560
in between those particles it also gives

92
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,480
structure to our soils when we looked at

93
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,720
a compacted soil uh the density could be

94
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,599
between 1.6 to

95
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,680
1.8 compacted soils kind of have have a

96
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,000
much higher density less room for air

97
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,319
and water storage they tend to act like

98
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,200
roads or Road payment they a lot of

99
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:13,720
times result in flash floods it was

100
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,040
interesting this year we had a drought

101
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,280
we had a couple of onein rains but the

102
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,440
majority of that water ran off the soil

103
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,240
surface even though the soil was

104
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,759
extremely dry it's because we turn that

105
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,600
soil into Road payment I like to say we

106
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,440
turn it in whenever you do excessively

107
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,720
till the soil you turn it into a road

108
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,280
payment we've all probably seen a farmer

109
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,600
maybe your neighbor really till the soil

110
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,240
what happens when they till it and get

111
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:44,160
it very fine as soon as it rains it

112
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:46,520
turns into concrete and so dense soils

113
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,919
also have less microbial life and that's

114
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,400
really important for nutrient management

115
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:53,960
here's an electron microscope of some of

116
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,160
the clay minerals this is where the the

117
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,400
water and the nutrients can be trapped

118
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,440
generally um this clay mineral will put

119
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:04,199
in organic film around there and the

120
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,960
nutrients get trapped in between the

121
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,039
soil organic matter and and the minerals

122
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:11,039
that are in the

123
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:13,840
soil three soil compaction factors we

124
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,120
all know that heavy equipment uh due to

125
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,720
its weight will compact the soil but did

126
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,400
you know that rain and gravity will also

127
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:24,880
compact the soil we can have

128
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,400
rainfall uh when it comes down it can

129
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,600
reach a terminal velocity of 35 miles

130
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,639
hour and almost looks like a any uh

131
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,840
nuclear explosion when it goes off so

132
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,319
that can move Soil and Water but it also

133
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,240
tends to have a compacting factor is

134
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,479
there a visual way to measure soil

135
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,120
compaction and actually you can go on

136
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:48,199
your farm and you can probably see this

137
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:51,240
uh if you look at a fence row and look

138
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:53,680
at the elevation difference between your

139
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,880
field and where that fence row is we've

140
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,240
measured this in Ohio some said that

141
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,120
this was due to wind others said that uh

142
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,280
uh a lot of the soil had eroded and uh

143
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,720
had piled up in a wind R but actually

144
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,000
we've measured this on the Le side of a

145
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,160
uh woods and we saw anywhere from a 6 to

146
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,039
9 inch elevation difference if 50% of

147
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,160
that is void space that equals an

148
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:20,319
additional three to four and a half

149
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,800
inches of additional water that we could

150
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,039
store uh in that soil if you really want

151
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,479
to see this if you've got a a wooded

152
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:30,240
area you can see the difference here in

153
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,039
northwest Ohio

154
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,199
uh a lot of times the woods is uh the

155
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:38,720
woods that we had were actually uh very

156
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,000
low and uh that's where the water stood

157
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,240
now often the water is standing on the

158
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,199
Headlands uh and we can see water

159
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,880
standing there it's because that soil is

160
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,880
much more compacted here's the water

161
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,800
available uh the available water

162
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:55,280
capacity of soil organic matter that

163
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,240
first inch of additional soil organic

164
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,919
matter can gain you anywhere from one to

165
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,479
almost two Ines of additional water if

166
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:06,440
we get it up to 5 in or 5% soil organic

167
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,639
matter you can see we're gaining on a

168
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,879
sandy soil 2.5 on a Cy Loom four inches

169
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,680
and on a Cy clay Loom three inches of

170
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:19,599
additional water so it starts off at one

171
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:21,720
to two inches of water per foot of soil

172
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,479
and after we get up to about 5% organic

173
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,440
matter we're down to about a half

174
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,680
2.8 uh inches of additional water for

175
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,120
for every 1% organic matter that we're

176
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,400
adding to that soil this is extremely

177
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,520
important in dry weather or in climates

178
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,759
that don't have uh a lot of uh uh

179
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,479
rainfall here's what happens we've

180
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:45,319
talked about this where we've got a

181
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:48,240
compacted or killed soil it tends to set

182
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:51,599
up like the road where we have good

183
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,000
vegetation throughout the the year we

184
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,680
increase that por space so it slows down

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,560
the water runoff and it increases water

186
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,479
infiltration here's what happens if we

187
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,840
speed up or double the velocity of

188
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:09,159
water the relationship is two to the six

189
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,360
power for every time you double the

190
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:13,560
velocity of water this tells you how

191
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,479
many more nutrients that that water can

192
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,039
carry the faster the water flows the

193
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,919
more energy it has so if I go from one

194
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,440
to two mile per hour I can carry 64

195
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,319
times more nutrients if I get up to 16

196
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,960
to 32 mile per hour in a flowing stream

197
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:32,599
I can carry a thousand times more

198
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,959
nutrients with that water so what we're

199
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,599
trying to do now is we're trying to slow

200
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,880
the water down so that it drops its load

201
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,320
keeps the nutrients in the soil rather

202
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,279
than running off we have a lot of

203
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,440
problems with hypoxia and nutrification

204
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:48,800
hypoxia is too much nitrogen and

205
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,080
phosphorus getting into uh the Gulf of

206
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,839
Mexico nutrification is mainly where

207
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,880
we've got too much phosphorus causing a

208
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,480
lot of uh algae

209
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,800
wounds for water uptake if you're

210
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:03,000
looking at where the roots absorb most

211
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,800
of the uh water it's in that top half if

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,560
you look at each one of these lines is

213
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,839
about six inches so 40% of the water uh

214
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,160
by that plant is absorbed within the top

215
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:17,040
six inches the next six inches will

216
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:19,720
absorb about 30% so 70% of the of the

217
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,279
water is absorbed in the top foot this

218
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,160
kind of explains why corn can actually

219
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:28,160
do quite well with maybe only 8 to nine

220
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,240
inches of rooting depth before the roots

221
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,760
start going off a right hand angle it

222
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,399
actually has almost 70% of the water but

223
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,519
if we can get those roots to go a little

224
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:41,040
bit deeper especially in a dry year we

225
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:43,920
can gain another 20 to to as much as 30%

226
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,360
more water as we get into that subsoil

227
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,079
same thing goes for nutrient extraction

228
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:51,880
exact same relationship 40 30 20 and 10

229
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,120
and you can see the depths there so the

230
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:56,680
same

231
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,399
relationship also when we look at a soil

232
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:01,160
there's a big difference between no tail

233
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,480
with the cover crop where we have live

234
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,920
plants notice the temperature difference

235
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,000
it's about 87 to 85 degrees over here

236
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,120
where we have conventional and maybe we

237
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,399
have started to try to do no till you'll

238
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,240
see that there's at least a 20 to maybe

239
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:19,560
as much as a 30 uh degree increase in

240
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,360
the temperatures this year when we had a

241
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,839
drought here in Ohio we measure soil

242
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,839
temperatures up around 130 to as high as

243
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,519
140 degrees Fahrenheit and what impact

244
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:34,800
does that have notice here the soil

245
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,519
bacteria start to die at 140 degrees

246
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:40,320
Fahrenheit we get our best moisture

247
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,760
somewhere where the soil is around 70 to

248
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,720
95 degrees once it gets over 95 notice

249
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,240
we're only using at 100 degrees

250
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,160
Fahrenheit 15% of the moisture is used

251
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,959
for growth 85% of the moisture is lost

252
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,320
through evaporation and transpiration so

253
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:59,360
if we can keep that soil covered with

254
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,600
live plants and keep a nice layer of

255
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,200
residue on there we can conserve

256
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,480
moisture and that's the key thing that I

257
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,440
wanted to talk to you about also for hot

258
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,399
dry Summers how much more water do we

259
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:13,200
need when the temperature goes up at 75

260
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,920
degrees Fahrenheit we need about one

261
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,600
inch of water per week raise that by 10

262
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,519
degrees we need two inches raise that by

263
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,040
another 10 inches and now we're up to

264
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,480
four inches of water a week so your

265
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,480
water requirements double for every 10

266
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:30,440
Dee increase in temperature heat and

267
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,279
drought together they're linked together

268
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:35,920
they quickly increase yield losses in

269
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:39,200
your soil this information came from Dr

270
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,160
elwin Taylor out of Iowa if we look at

271
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,000
the soil and look what's going on when

272
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:47,480
we do subsoil tillage where we ex add an

273
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,320
extremely large amount of oxygen into

274
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,600
the soil it acts like a furnace almost

275
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,639
like a wood stove you might say adding

276
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:59,360
oxygen to the soil actually causes the

277
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,880
soil organic matter to go up into the

278
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,079
atmosphere so we start to lose soil

279
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:06,240
organic matters and the more aggressive

280
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,320
your tillage the more soil organic

281
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,399
matter losses you're having matter of

282
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,720
fact in the last uh 15 25 years once

283
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,399
tillage starts you'll see that you will

284
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:21,000
lose uh as much as 50% organic matter in

285
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:25,079
some places we've seen as much as

286
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,959
6% losses in soil organic matter notice

287
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:30,079
though that once we started doing

288
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,120
permanent side and adding

289
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,000
we can start to add organic matter back

290
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,199
to that soil but you notice that we

291
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,720
didn't reach the same level you might

292
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:39,880
want to think about that why didn't we

293
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,199
get back up to where we were and the

294
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:44,120
answer to that is quite simple it has to

295
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:46,600
do with the amount of roots and how tall

296
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,680
we let that grass grow we tend on our

297
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,279
permanent sides will cut off uh the top

298
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,519
growth top growth is related to root

299
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,360
growth the more root growth you have the

300
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:57,760
more healthy that plant is the more

301
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,959
organic matter you're going to add to

302
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,040
your soil matter of fact most of the

303
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:05,839
organic matter in the soil comes from

304
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:07,959
the roots as much as 65 to 70% of the

305
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,120
organic matter comes from Roots so the

306
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:13,000
more Roots we get into the soil the

307
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,560
higher Are soil organic matter levels

308
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,560
let's talk a little bit about compaction

309
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,240
here's the typical tire and you'll

310
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,160
notice as you're putting weight on that

311
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,920
soil the forces are down and then what

312
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,480
actually happens is the soil uh moves to

313
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,680
the side and we'll actually get uh kind

314
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,560
of a lip there around that r you'll see

315
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:35,000
that the soil is actually forced uh

316
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,880
upward and so what happens then if we

317
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,519
take say a disc and we try to take that

318
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,279
lip off and we try to fill in that hole

319
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,240
you always notice when when this happens

320
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:47,000
that you never quite fill it in and why

321
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,720
is that because we're losing the void

322
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,160
space when you break up the soil and you

323
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,199
lose all your soil structure you have

324
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,959
less room for air and water and so what

325
00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,120
we're doing is we're breaking this soil

326
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:02,560
down and the mineral portion uh is very

327
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,519
solid very dense and so what we need to

328
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,360
do is now lift it up uh and keep it in

329
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,519
shape we need to have better soil

330
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,880
structure and one of the ways we can do

331
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,519
that is with a root you might see this

332
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,040
root here it's expanding the soil where

333
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:20,240
that uh man is pointing you'll notice

334
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,959
that when this big oil seed radish these

335
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,240
can get as big as your leg and get

336
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,920
anywhere from three to four feet deep in

337
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,000
the soil although mostly the tuber is at

338
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,959
the soil surface but it does is as it

339
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,480
goes down and it expands it's forcing

340
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,759
the soil down forcing it to the side and

341
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:40,720
it's physically lifting it and so what

342
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:44,320
Roots actually do is they actually

343
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:47,720
compact the soil but they reate uh

344
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,440
reorientate the uh clay particles and

345
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,079
then what they do is they form

346
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,440
Aggregates so we're going to take some

347
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,279
of the polysaccarides and the exodites

348
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,279
that come from these roots and we're

349
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:01,600
going to form uh nice aggregates which

350
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:04,120
will um give us some structure back to

351
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,560
our soil so that our soil

352
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,600
doesn't collapse on us and it's not

353
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,519
quite as

354
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,839
dense here's what the bacteria do 90% of

355
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,680
the bacteria are linked to the clay uh

356
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,120
40 to 60% of the soil microbial biomass

357
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,399
is associated with this clay and that's

358
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,560
how we form something called a ma a

359
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,560
microaggregate and what we do is we take

360
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,079
these microaggregates which are less

361
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,759
than 250 microns and we're going to form

362
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,000
macroaggregates now if you want to know

363
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,160
what a macroaggregate looks like when

364
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,160
you go home just take your shovel in

365
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,959
your lawn dig up some soil uh in your

366
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:45,079
lawn and then Shake uh the the turf a

367
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,920
little bit and you'll see these what I'd

368
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:50,480
say p siiz small pieces almost the size

369
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,160
of a small piece of gravel little pads

370
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,120
those are the macroaggregates that are

371
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,839
forming so what we're doing is we're

372
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:59,160
allowing that soil to start to set up so

373
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:02,120
it has more structure so it has more

374
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:05,040
room for air and water and and by that

375
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:07,680
by doing that we can store more uh air

376
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,839
and water in that soil and it's less

377
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,279
dense and one of the key uh uh fungus

378
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,240
that we have in the soil are these

379
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:19,720
micral fungus they actually infect 80

380
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,959
percent of our plants and they give off

381
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:25,279
something called gloman or glomulin some

382
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,199
people call it that's what gives us some

383
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:30,399
of the uh glycoproteins and and some of

384
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:33,440
the it's a structure that helps to

385
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,600
cement soil together to form these U

386
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,759
macroaggregates and here's what microp

387
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:43,480
fungus look like you'll notice on the

388
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:46,279
top we have this brown uh root the um

389
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:49,440
the fungus are actually either white or

390
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:53,560
yellow and in a handful of soil we can

391
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,800
have as much as 20 to 25 miles of these

392
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:59,240
filaments going into the soil what these

393
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,839
fungus do is they bring back water

394
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,360
nitrogen and phosphorus to the plant in

395
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,319
exchange the plant is going to feed that

396
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:11,120
micro risia some of its carbohydrates as

397
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:14,039
much as 25 to 40% of the total

398
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,319
carbohydrate reserves in the root go to

399
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:18,839
feed these fungus if they're available

400
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,520
it's a very beneficial relationship and

401
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:24,160
then when these fungus die they give off

402
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,559
U the this glomulin that's inside their

403
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,160
cell structure it's kind of sticky it's

404
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,280
kind of like a glue that helps to glue

405
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,559
our soils together so we want to keep

406
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,760
these micro risia healthy they need to

407
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,360
have live plants ear round in order to

408
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:43,160
do that killage and excess fertilizer

409
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,559
tend to kill off the micro rizio fungus

410
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,880
and here's what happens this shows that

411
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:50,160
sticky substance being surrounded it

412
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,960
surrounds uh those soil particles and

413
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,039
that's what gives us those nice

414
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,600
macroaggregates that we were talking

415
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:59,080
about building soil structures like

416
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,880
building a house uh it starts with other

417
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,320
nature we've our Carpenter is our plants

418
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,799
and we're going to start with this sand

419
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:08,760
silt and Clay the roots are kind of like

420
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:11,000
how we would frame up a house um some of

421
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,679
the nails and the lag screws uh this

422
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,600
humus is very hard very tough It's been

423
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,799
around for hundreds thousands of years

424
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:21,280
it's been broken down so it sticks

425
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,960
around but what we're really uh lacking

426
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,880
in the soil is some of that gluman or

427
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,799
some of that active carbon some of the

428
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,240
polysaccharides are missing the nitrogen

429
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,880
offer also act like braces and then that

430
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,320
surface residue that's kind of like the

431
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,880
roof on your house so here's a picture

432
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,640
of a house and see how we start let's

433
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,240
take a look at how we build this out we

434
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,919
start off with the foundation we add the

435
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,880
wood and so look around the room where

436
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,039
you're maybe you're sitting at notice

437
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,159
that there's a lot of space in in a

438
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:52,080
building like this or in a house the

439
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:54,400
reason we have that is because the wood

440
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,320
or the soil organic matter in the soil

441
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,400
is giving structure and the nitrogen and

442
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,440
the sulfur are acting like bra

443
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:04,240
and now we've got room for air and water

444
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,000
to move the black screws i' like to say

445
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,120
is how soil organic matter attaches to

446
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,600
the clay particles and a lot of times

447
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,600
we'll have phosphorus we'll have some

448
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:16,159
other uh nutrients in between there that

449
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:18,440
will give uh that'll attach that clay

450
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:20,880
particle and that organic matter

451
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,360
together the humus again is like nails

452
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,320
and then this glomulin kind of acts like

453
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,400
the glue or house wrap it helps to

454
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:31,840
insulate this house and then the roof uh

455
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,840
is is uh uh helps to keep on a roof on a

456
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,919
house will help to keep out water what's

457
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,360
interesting in the soil the roof

458
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:43,559
actually acts to help keep out too much

459
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,240
oxygen imagine what would happen if we

460
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:48,280
had a tornado come through on your house

461
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,200
and every other year took your roof off

462
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,120
we get too much water in there and that

463
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,080
water would start to rot out uh the the

464
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,919
wood and pretty soon this whole house

465
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,440
would cave in in the soil if we get rid

466
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,799
of the residue we get too much oxygen

467
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,919
into the soil and it burns up the soil

468
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,600
organic matter and the whole house

469
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,720
starts to Compact and starts to Decay

470
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,440
and everything falls in it works the

471
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:17,679
exact same way uh in the soil too much

472
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:20,280
oxygen uh oxygen and carbon dioxide are

473
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,960
um uh opposed to each other when one

474
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,760
increases the other decreases so carbon

475
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,960
dioxide is heavier than the oxygen so

476
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,440
they're inversely related so if we get a

477
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,960
heavy rain where we have a

478
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,799
microaggregate you're not going to get

479
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,440
as much water infiltration and a lot of

480
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:38,960
the water will run off one of the things

481
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,440
that farmers have talked to me about is

482
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,280
saying you know I've been in noil for

483
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,880
five or 10 years and some farmers will

484
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:50,320
say that my soils are cold and wet other

485
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,559
Farmers who've been in noil will say my

486
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,600
soils are warm and moist so which one is

487
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,799
right actually let's take a look at this

488
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,919
probably when you started into noil did

489
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:02,159
you get rid of of all the soil

490
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:05,080
compaction and so that's probably one of

491
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,640
the reasons why our soils are cold

492
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:09,799
compacted soils hold more moisture so

493
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,760
coming out of the winter we're going to

494
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:15,679
have water which holds the cold it hold

495
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,919
the cold and the Heat and so your soils

496
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,120
will tend to be wet and they'll also

497
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,039
tend to be cold as you start to get into

498
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,600
no till and you start to break up that

499
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:27,200
soil and get more macro pores to get the

500
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:29,240
water to drain from your soils that soil

501
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,880
will start to warm up quicker matter of

502
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,120
fact you've probably seen this in your

503
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:37,039
own home window panes a lot of times are

504
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:40,159
triple uh double or triple and they use

505
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,440
air as an insulation so now when you

506
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,159
start going let's say you've been in

507
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,360
notel for one to two years we're

508
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,760
starting to get more residue at the

509
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,679
surface what is the color of residue

510
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:54,919
when it breaks down it actually turns

511
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,760
black and does black surfaces warm up

512
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,120
the soil or do they cause it to get

513
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,880
colder they tend to draw Heat

514
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,080
and so they'll actually help to warm up

515
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,159
the soil so as we get more residue on

516
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:08,440
top the soil your soils will start to

517
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:10,360
warm up and then as you get a thick

518
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:12,120
layer residue a lot of farmers think

519
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:15,320
that this is not a good thing but it

520
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:18,159
actually is what happens is think about

521
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,720
a compost pile if I have one to two

522
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,880
inches of residue on my soil surface

523
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,559
what happens in the middle of that

524
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,360
compost pile there's biological activity

525
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:29,279
and that will actually warm up the soil

526
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,799
most farmers who are doing doing no till

527
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:34,120
with cover crops are fighting to keep

528
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:36,559
residue they have so much microbial

529
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:38,240
activity and so many earthworms they're

530
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,159
are actually fighting to keep the

531
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,880
residue rather than trying to break it

532
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,000
up if you're having a hard time with

533
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,559
residue if it's causing problems to your

534
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,360
tires we see a lot of that here in Ohio

535
00:22:47,559 --> 00:22:51,120
chances are that you don't have a lot of

536
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,360
microbial activity or a lot of Earth

537
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,400
wors in your soil and you need to make

538
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,919
it get your soil more healthy here's

539
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:01,159
where we're measuring soil compaction we

540
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,919
can actually do this uh in the field and

541
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:05,720
we're finding out that right next to

542
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:09,120
that route uh the soil compaction levels

543
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,600
uh decrease by as much as 30% why do our

544
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,120
soils compact well look at your crop

545
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,000
rotation typically we uh at least here

546
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:18,840
in Ohio we're drilling most of our

547
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,360
soybeans drilled soybeans are planted

548
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,840
very close together they have a very

549
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:25,640
poor root system I would rather see

550
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,720
soybeans planted in 15inch rows or

551
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,520
spaced a little wider apart they have a

552
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,120
much healthier root system and they can

553
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,360
help to break up some of this soil

554
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,720
compaction also if you look at corn it

555
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,799
has a very thick root and it tends to be

556
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,240
limited by the plow layer we saw that in

557
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:43,000
Minnesota last year we visited Minnesota

558
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:44,480
their plow layer was down there about

559
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,480
eight inches deep that's where they

560
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,760
plowed every year those roots could not

561
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,159
get through them even though they had

562
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,520
beautiful soils they were only reaching

563
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,960
about 125 to 140 bushel corn y that's

564
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,240
some of the prettiest soils I've ever

565
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,640
seen dark rich black but the soil was

566
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,760
compacted so that was limiting their

567
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,799
yields what percentage of the time do we

568
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,640
have live Roots typically in a corn

569
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:10,880
soybean rotation only maybe four months

570
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,120
out of the year maybe as much as five

571
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,799
months about onethird of the time if we

572
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,279
can add a cover crop to that we can

573
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,679
greatly increase the amount of soil

574
00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:20,159
organic matter that we have in the soil

575
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:22,520
and one of the things that people have

576
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,240
asked me is why does no tail really have

577
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,600
more live Roots than conventional

578
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,840
pillage the answer is not really it's

579
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,559
not until you add the cover crop that we

580
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,679
start to gain soil organic matter so

581
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:36,720
what's missing in noil is those live

582
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,880
Roots soil compaction is a biological

583
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,840
problem it's related to a lack of living

584
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,960
Roots uh in the soil so I've got about

585
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,080
15 minutes left let's start looking at

586
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,399
some things that we can do to get rid of

587
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,039
this soil compaction so if we're looking

588
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:54,760
at subsoiling here's some research that

589
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:57,840
was done uh in Ohio subsoiling yield

590
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:58,880
gains or losses if you have conventional

591
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,880
tillage

592
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,360
with subsoiling we found out that the

593
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,080
corn yield gained about one to three

594
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,159
bushel or about 3% about a 3 percentage

595
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:11,600
increase on soybean yields it was just a

596
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:14,840
little bit more we gained anywhere from

597
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:16,880
two to five bushels or about a 10% yield

598
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:19,679
increase what happened when we had

599
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,120
long-term noil it actually went the

600
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,679
other way by the same amount our corn

601
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:28,720
yield loss we lost anywhere from one to

602
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:30,760
three bushel or about 3% so being uh

603
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,799
yield losses were around

604
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:36,039
10% so what does subsoiling do if we're

605
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:38,720
comparing subsoiling versus covered

606
00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:40,679
crops uh the subsoiler what does it do

607
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,960
it gives you immediate change in soil

608
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:44,799
structure is down as deep as what you're

609
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,799
going to subsoil it if you're going down

610
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:50,360
eight inches deep however those changes

611
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:53,880
are not permanent and it actually leads

612
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:56,279
to Greater Reliance on tillage in the

613
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:58,399
future because we're losing that soil

614
00:25:56,279 --> 00:26:01,080
organic matter it will increase

615
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:03,480
infiltration in that top 18 Ines because

616
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,760
you're fluffing up the soil it leaves

617
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,120
the soil susceptible to compaction later

618
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:11,840
the first trip across that field you're

619
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,520
going to compact that soil 80% of that

620
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,200
soil will Rec compact almost immediately

621
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,279
with the first

622
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,919
trip what can cover crops do well the

623
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,320
change is a little bit slower but it's a

624
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,919
little deeper we can go three feet deep

625
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:29,799
or even deeper with really deep rooted

626
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,760
cover crops and fil uh increases the

627
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:34,240
infiltration but it may take a little

628
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,720
bit of time generally cover crop Roots

629
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,159
can go through about one foot of soil of

630
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,840
compacted soils per year so if you have

631
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,880
a very heavily compacted soil it may

632
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:49,760
take a little bit of a Time think about

633
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:52,320
your grain carts and your uh uh your uh

634
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,520
combines a typical combine's going to

635
00:26:52,320 --> 00:27:00,159
compact that soil 18 inches deep about

636
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:02,520
26 tons of of uh compaction for axle

637
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,520
load it'll compact it down to8 inches

638
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,760
deep one of the things that cover crops

639
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,760
do is they protect the soil from erosion

640
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,000
they add nutrients in organic matter

641
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,520
they tie up the nutrients they fit into

642
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,960
a continuous noil system they really

643
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,640
make the noil work much better and they

644
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,200
help to protect against soil conection

645
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,760
if you want to think about this just

646
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,200
imagine if you had two bricks and you

647
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:27,200
put a sponge in between them what

648
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,480
happens is as you add organic matter if

649
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,360
you were to compress the those bricks

650
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:34,360
them bricks would come back apart the

651
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,159
sponge helps to uh alleviate some of

652
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,080
that compaction it doesn't allow those

653
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,640
bricks to get too close together so if

654
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,799
you're imagine These Bricks bricks are

655
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,559
made out of clay they have a negative

656
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:46,919
charge if we take these two bricks and

657
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,080
we get rid of the organic matter now

658
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:53,480
you've put a positive ion in between

659
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:55,600
there something like calcium or potash

660
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:57,000
that's going to set that uh those two

661
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,760
bricks up and it's going to set up like

662
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,279
a brick wall that's what happens I like

663
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,919
to call it cement mix that's what

664
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,240
happens when we till the soil

665
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:07,200
excessively we need that organic matter

666
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,919
in there to con cushion the

667
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,279
soil here's some of the soil resistance

668
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,440
and here's the rankings and we'll start

669
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:17,440
from the bottom I'm going to go back

670
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:19,720
subsoiling deep RI full surface tillage

671
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:23,279
you're adding a lot of oxygen into that

672
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:25,960
soil it will help you but the problem is

673
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:28,519
it's a short-term solution we can mboard

674
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,880
plow or chisel plow and then when we

675
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:34,120
finally uh will create a fine um seed

676
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,440
bed but the problem is again the more

677
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,240
you disturb the soil the more organic

678
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,200
matter you're losing is and so you're

679
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,120
going to be dependent on that system

680
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,279
year after year after year we can

681
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:47,159
subsoil with white Spanx uh space Shanks

682
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,000
and that will help so we're not doing

683
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,159
quite as much disturbance we can get

684
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,360
into strip till where we only K up just

685
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:54,640
a

686
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:56,640
small portion of the field and then we

687
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,640
leave the rest of the field untouched

688
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,760
and that will help we can do shallow

689
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,519
tillage things like the airway and the

690
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,519
Phoenix hero a lot of people call this

691
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:06,960
vertical tillage the problem with this

692
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:09,000
is now we've changed our compaction

693
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,880
layer we've seen this time and time

694
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,240
again as we do the shallow tillage your

695
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,760
your compaction layer rather than being

696
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:20,240
8 to nine inches deep now may be only

697
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:22,840
two three four inches deep however far

698
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,120
that you go down the bottom of that tool

699
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:28,399
creates a compacted Zone we can do

700
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,360
intermittent uh intermittent not till

701
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,559
which is tillage every other year

702
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,559
typically in a corn soybean rotation

703
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,240
they might till the soybeans and then go

704
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,279
to Corn because the corn has such a

705
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,519
thick root it really benefits from

706
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:42,559
having well a rated soils or we can

707
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:44,600
start to go to continuous noow tail

708
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,039
where we get light residue on the soil

709
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,159
again now we're building up that organic

710
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:50,519
matter we'll have less compaction we get

711
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,880
more residue that's bever with no cover

712
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:54,600
crop once we add the cover crop now

713
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,679
we're starting to cushion that soil and

714
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,240
then the best situation is where we have

715
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:02,240
continuous noow till cover crop and

716
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:04,440
control traffic now we're limiting uh

717
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,760
that zone that we're compacting to a

718
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,679
very small portion of the field and if

719
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:13,399
we do that year after year uh now we can

720
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,519
make uh our soils much healthier and

721
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:18,360
have a lot less compaction how to

722
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:21,320
establish cover crops uh add diversity

723
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:23,320
to your soils you can reduce your crop

724
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,399
maturities basically on corn we're

725
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:28,200
looking at a shorter maturity if you can

726
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:30,279
reduce that by 5 to seven days that will

727
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,080
really help you we can also grow

728
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:35,120
soybeans grow an earlier maturing

729
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:39,159
soybean one of the key points uh is we

730
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:41,720
need to give that cover crop time to uh

731
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:44,720
establish before winter sets in most

732
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:47,159
cover crops need anywhere from 60 to 90

733
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,679
days of growth and so one of the ways we

734
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:52,559
can do that is we can intercede we can

735
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:56,080
either fly it on or broadcast it a lot

736
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:58,679
of our Farmers uh are now um investing

737
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,679
in these Highway applic

738
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:02,639
they have a 90 foot boom on them and

739
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:04,240
they're using an air seeder with drop-

740
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:07,559
down tubes that they'll go in between

741
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:09,279
the corn and they can seed cover crops

742
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:11,720
uh into their corn or even into their

743
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,240
soybeans and get them started and then

744
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:15,360
when they harvest them a lot of times

745
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,279
these cover crops may be two three

746
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,559
inches tall starting to grow that gives

747
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,399
them a head start going into winter when

748
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:24,679
you let that cover crop grow longer in

749
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:27,000
the spring and intercede uh our next

750
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:30,799
crop into it we'd like to do this with

751
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,279
uh soy beans we'll use cereal Rye we'll

752
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,639
let that cereal Rye grow in the fall let

753
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,039
it grow in the

754
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:41,080
spring uh in Ohio we have a problem with

755
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:43,480
excess moisture so if we let it grow it

756
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,600
uh through respiration it will allow a

757
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,279
lot of that uh uh through transpiration

758
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,720
it will allow a lot of that water to uh

759
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,320
uh get out of the soil by by putting it

760
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,000
up into the atmosphere so we can

761
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:58,360
actually get onto our Fields anywhere

762
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,840
from seven to 10 days earlier we let the

763
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:03,200
cereal Rye grow up plant our soybeans

764
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:05,519
into it let the soybeans come up then

765
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,919
kill the cereal Rye if we kill the

766
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:12,240
cereal ride too early it'll lay down and

767
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:14,360
then if we have some uh wet weather that

768
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,320
soil will stay real sticky and then it

769
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:20,120
may not dry out till uh late June or

770
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:23,480
even July so what we like to do is let

771
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:26,600
it grow up either drill or plant our

772
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,039
soybeans or uh into that cereal Rye it

773
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,960
will not uh hair as much and it won't

774
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,000
tend to bind uh as much and so it's much

775
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:37,639
easier to do that we can also use

776
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,440
legumes uh things like uh winter peas or

777
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:43,039
um crimson clover and we'll plant those

778
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,679
with oil seed radish and do that before

779
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,880
corn and that's been very very

780
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:50,480
successful we've seen as much as six to

781
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:54,200
eight bushel yield increases on our

782
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,679
soybeans and with our corn uh uh varies

783
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,360
quite a bit depending on how good your

784
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,519
soil structure is but we're seeing uh 10

785
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:05,120
15 bushel sometimes even more yield

786
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,799
increases by doing this practice here's

787
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,760
some of the best cover crops to fight

788
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:12,799
soil compaction grasses have a very

789
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:16,320
fibrous root system I'm a real big fan

790
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:19,960
of soron sedan grass uh you can let your

791
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,760
sorum sedan grass grow a little bit uh

792
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:24,799
in Ohio we tend to plant it after wheat

793
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:27,200
our wheat we have winter wheat so our

794
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,320
wheat will come off in July we plant the

795
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,200
Sorghum sedan grass if you can let that

796
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,519
sorum sedan grass get about 3 feet tall

797
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,399
and either Harvest it in some cases guys

798
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:39,039
don't have livestock so they'll just mow

799
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:42,559
it off when you mow sorum sedan grass

800
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:45,279
you get anywhere from five to nine times

801
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:48,200
more Roots being grown and so it really

802
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,159
tillers out and it's all about roots in

803
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:52,440
the soil that really helps to keep your

804
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,760
soil really gives good soil structure to

805
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,080
your soil annual Ry grass is another

806
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:58,880
really good one it can be a little

807
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,720
harder to manage cereal Ryan oats can

808
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,000
also be used uh very fine Roots they can

809
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,840
find those Plains of weaknesses they can

810
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,320
really help you with soil compaction

811
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,159
they also go uh fairly deep in the soil

812
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:13,079
anual white grass will go five to six

813
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,440
feet deep uh unless there's H water or

814
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,359
limiting layer seral Rye tends to go

815
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,800
about 30 to 36 inches in uh similar

816
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:23,000
numbers for oats we can also use Z

817
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,440
brascas things like the oil seed radish

818
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,839
or the turnips oil seed radish

819
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:33,000
especially the some of the uh uh daon

820
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:35,079
varieties such as um um tillage radish

821
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,240
or the groundhouse radish they get a

822
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:39,599
fairly good size root system they're

823
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:42,240
white they're very sweet the earthworms

824
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:45,079
absolutely love them and uh they do a

825
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,720
very good job in loosening up soil

826
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:48,839
matter of fact if you're going to plant

827
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,280
oil seed radish never plant them by

828
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:55,119
themselves on a hill with greater than a

829
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,480
3% slope we've actually seen some of the

830
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,160
uh soil on these slopes start to move

831
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,680
with if you get a heavy rainfall we like

832
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,240
to um plant them with another grass or

833
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,320
plant them with another legume uh to get

834
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,760
more roots and to have more biomaster

835
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:13,200
for legumes uh you want a large root

836
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,680
Network hary vet cow peas red clover and

837
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,000
winter peas are some of the ones that

838
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,079
we're using that gives you the

839
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,520
relationship if you've got a problem

840
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:24,240
with surface compaction buckweed is

841
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:27,040
excellent and also filia that's a new uh

842
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,440
one that came out of France uh they work

843
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,839
quite well buckweed is very beneficial

844
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:35,359
for insects and it also helps if you

845
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:37,680
have low phosphorus uh it has a lot of

846
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:40,599
organic acids in it so it will release

847
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,440
phosphorus into the soil so if we're

848
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:44,599
looking at U and I'm I'm getting low on

849
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,720
time so I'm going to go through this

850
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:49,560
fairly quickly I've got about six more

851
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:51,160
slides if you look at the New Concept

852
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,960
that we're looking at we're calling it

853
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:57,000
Eco faring or ecological farming we're

854
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:59,480
trying to keep uh the soil covered with

855
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,400
live plants year round again if you only

856
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,440
have plants out there four

857
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:05,760
month side of the year you only have

858
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,880
about a third as much fuel and energy

859
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,640
going into that soil the plants give

860
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,839
energy to the microbes and the microbes

861
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:16,040
keep those nutrients recycling it also

862
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,079
improves your soil if we can keep those

863
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,680
year round we've got 100% of the fuel

864
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,240
and energy going into that soil here's

865
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,400
what happens under conventional tillage

866
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,920
you have a smaller microbial population

867
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,560
we've got this brown combine Rusty

868
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,280
combine you notice we have a lot of

869
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,040
carbon dioxide going up into the

870
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,760
atmosphere here where we have the

871
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,800
eco-farming we're not disturbing the

872
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,400
soil we have a much larger microbial

873
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,520
population and they're going to keep

874
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,800
more nitrogen and phosphorus recycling

875
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:46,440
in the soil and here's the relationship

876
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,800
every 1% organic matter can give you as

877
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,560
much as

878
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:53,040
$850 of nutrients that's going to tie up

879
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,920
per year a th000 pounds of nitrogen and

880
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:59,200
roughly 100 pounds of phosphorus poach

881
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:02,319
and sulfur that adds up to about $850

882
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,359
for every 1% soil organic matter how do

883
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:06,040
we lose these well when we do tillage

884
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:08,200
you'll see these whirlwinds there that's

885
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:10,680
the carbon dioxide going on and you'll

886
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:13,119
notice that we we can't tie up as much

887
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,720
of the uh nitrogen and the phosphorus

888
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:19,319
because we have less organic matter in

889
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:22,240
the soil uh anywhere from 50 to 75% of

890
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:24,560
the phosphorus is tied up organically

891
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,920
and right around 90% of the nitrogen is

892
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:28,880
tied up in an organic form here where

893
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,119
we're doing the eco-farming we're

894
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,040
carrying those nutrients forward these

895
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,000
plants that are alive in the winter even

896
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,760
though the soil may be cold uh it's much

897
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,119
warmer down below it be around 50

898
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:43,040
degrees there they can uh below the

899
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,359
frost line they can actually take up

900
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,520
nutrients all winter long and they're

901
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:50,040
turning that into H soil organic matter

902
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:52,440
something that will turn into here's

903
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:55,440
what happens when U we do too much

904
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:57,560
tillage tillage to the soil microbes is

905
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,200
like the worst hurricane the worst Earth

906
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:03,000
Quake worst Force fire and the worst

907
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,400
tornado all wrapped up into one event it

908
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,119
really disturbs them they don't like to

909
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,920
have uh this disturbance you'll have a

910
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:14,400
much healthier microbial population if

911
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,880
you uh uh stop doing the tillage and

912
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,200
where do we lose these nutrients most of

913
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,839
them are lost in the winter they're lost

914
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,760
to the air and the water because we

915
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:24,800
don't have plant roofs there to absorb

916
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,319
them so a lot of times in late winter

917
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,520
early spring with the snow melt a lot of

918
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:31,160
the nutrients are lost here where we

919
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,800
have the Eco farming we're keeping those

920
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:37,119
nutrients tied up and we're carrying

921
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,599
them forward to the next crop finally in

922
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,480
summary I think I might uh might have a

923
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,560
minute or two for uh questions soil

924
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,160
compaction is related to the biology of

925
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,280
the soil and how the soil was managed

926
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:51,800
organic matter and microbes influence

927
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,640
soil compaction if you have cold no till

928
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,079
soils it's probably a result of soil

929
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,280
compaction and poor soil structure if

930
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,680
you can add cover crops and no tilt to

931
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,520
that system you'll actually uh improve

932
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:05,760
your your soils and they should be warm

933
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,160
and moist that's an ideal place to plant

934
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,359
corn and soybeans active living roots

935
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,680
and the microbes are acting and working

936
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:14,880
together to improve your soil structure

937
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:17,200
that equals this ecological farming that

938
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,280
we're really promoting notel Plus cover

939
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:24,720
crops so I think I have maybe a minute

940
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,720
to go we may get cut off any questions

941
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,680
I did that pretty quick that's about as

942
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,440
fast as I've done that so uh if we get

943
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,440
cut off that's

944
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:42,760
fine all right well sorry for some of

945
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,680
the technical problems we had and delays

946
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:46,319
but uh hope you guys enjoy your

947
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:49,280
conference can somebody tell me about

948
00:39:46,319 --> 00:39:49,280
how many people we have

949
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:55,280
there 230 well great I wish I could be

950
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,760
with you

951
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,760
but okay I'll see if I can answer

952
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,760
it

953
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:23,400
hello how do we get cover crops to grow

954
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,800
all year I is that what you're talking

955
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,319
about okay one of the one of the

956
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,440
benefits as you go a little further

957
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:33,400
further north is especially serial Rye

958
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:36,240
it originated in uh the mountains of

959
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:37,720
China those roots are active all year

960
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,520
round even though they may not be

961
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:43,280
growing snow actually protects a lot of

962
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:45,560
our cover crops you may have a much more

963
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,520
beneficial growth to some of these cover

964
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:50,400
crops what's really detrimental to cover

965
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,160
crops is the wind and so if you can

966
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,839
protect that um that the crown of these

967
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:57,560
cover crops and keep some residue over

968
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,119
there even though it looks like they're

969
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:01,359
not doing you may not see a whole lot of

970
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,160
top growth they can do a lot of benefit

971
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,880
from just the roots growing down through

972
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:09,240
the soil serial Rye is a a really good

973
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:12,640
one uh after corn uh probably in South

974
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:16,520
Dakota I mean it grows uh up into Canada

975
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,520
so that's probably one of your best

976
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,200
ones other

977
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:30,839
questions oh well good

978
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,839
sure we can do

979
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,760
that okay

980
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:12,800
in a dry spring yes there can be um and

981
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:14,839
what you want to do is if you have a dry

982
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,359
spring and you see that it's that you're

983
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:19,559
going to go into a drought you want to

984
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:21,319
conserve moisture uh what you want to do

985
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:22,720
is you want to build your organic matter

986
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:25,720
but you don't want to hurt that next

987
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,359
crop so and it's hard to predict this

988
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,599
but if you see that the soil is is

989
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:32,000
excessively dry and you're getting a lot

990
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,640
of uh transpiration going on you can

991
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,640
kill that cover crop early you guys

992
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,680
don't have as much problem here in Ohio

993
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:42,200
we have seven out of 10 years it's wet

994
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,920
and so we're trying to dry out our soils

995
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,720
you probably need to manage your soils a

996
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:50,280
little differently you might want to

997
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:52,520
kill that cover crop uh uh early and in

998
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,359
order to conserve moisture and then

999
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:58,160
plant into it uh when the conditions are

1000
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,640
right but uh it should make the soil

1001
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,240
much more mellow uh that's at least what

1002
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,800
we've seen here Ohio especially when

1003
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,880
we're using these oil seed radish we

1004
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,599
used to worry about we'd have too big of

1005
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:11,839
a hole there but you'll also find and I

1006
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,280
didn't tell you this covered crops will

1007
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:16,119
give you more moisture because you're

1008
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,640
going to trap more snow uh we've seen

1009
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:22,400
this time and time again if you put up

1010
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:25,680
it's almost like a a snow fence it it

1011
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,359
traps the snow on the soil so it's not

1012
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:31,800
blowing across your fields and you'll

1013
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:33,839
actually gain some uh moisture by having

1014
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,880
a a cover crop that's maybe a couple

1015
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:39,400
inches tall it'll trap that snow there

1016
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,400
and you'll gain uh basically what you're

1017
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,920
losing all the recent uh information

1018
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:48,119
that's come out says that cover crops uh

1019
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:50,000
are really adding uh water to the soil

1020
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:51,760
and even though we're losing some from

1021
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,440
transpiration if we see that that's a

1022
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:58,000
problem just kill them

1023
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,000
early does that make sense

1024
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:05,440
oh well I I I'll tell you a quick one

1025
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,240
until we get cut off here a story from

1026
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,680
Nebraska we had some guys this idea of

1027
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,599
phow soils that's the stupidest idea we

1028
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,760
ever come up that's my personal opinion

1029
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:17,559
I'm just going to tell you that uh in

1030
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:20,040
Nebraska some guys started doing noil

1031
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:22,359
long-term noil with cover crops they

1032
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:25,160
found out that they were they were using

1033
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:27,559
two feet of irrigation per year they

1034
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:30,359
reduced it down to six in

1035
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,200
per year by going to Noel and cover

1036
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:34,480
crops the reason being is they were

1037
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:36,599
trapping more snow and they were adding

1038
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,960
organic matter to their soil so now they

1039
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:42,760
can store more uh more water remember

1040
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,960
that that chart that I give you was the

1041
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,839
inches of water per foot of soil so if

1042
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,400
you can get these cover crops to go very

1043
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:52,559
deep into the soil and add a couple

1044
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,400
percentage points of organic matter to

1045
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:58,040
each foot of soil you can greatly

1046
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,559
increase your water storage capacity and

1047
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,520
then if you have that residue on the

1048
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:03,680
surface you're not going to have as much

1049
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,960
heat you're not going to have as much uh

1050
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:09,280
evaporation going on you're going to

1051
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:12,680
store a lot more water in your soil rain

1052
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:16,280
makes grain but that also uh going along

1053
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:18,880
with that uh ex uh more water holding

1054
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,640
capacity in your soil is going to equal

1055
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,880
higher

1056
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,839
yields uh I wish I could be with you

1057
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,599
folks but uh I've got another meeting

1058
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:30,200
here in Ohio yet ton night that I have

1059
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:32,559
to do so uh thank you for inviting me

1060
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:36,800
it's been a

1061
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,800
pleasure thank you
