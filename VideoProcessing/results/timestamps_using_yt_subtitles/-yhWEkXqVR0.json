  "text": "Water scarcity affects more than 40 percent\nof the global population. Water scarce regions in particular struggle\nwith crop failure, soil degradation and, if it rains, with floods. Land-based rainwater harvesting is one solution\nto the water scarcity problem. It entails the collection of water and\nsubsequent storage in reservoirs or directly within the soil profile. This rainwater harvesting method can be classified\ninto micro-catchment and macro-catchment harvesting. In micro-catchment rainwater harvesting,\nrain falls onto a small catchment area and flows directly to the adjacent cropped basin, where a single tree, bush\nor row of crops is planted. The purpose of this is to store water\nin the root zone, to provide enough water for the plants\nthroughout the growing period. There are various ways of implementing\nmicro-catchment rainwater harvesting. One is strip catchment tillage, which consists of alternating rows\nof cultivated crops with rows of uncultivated grass. The grass acts as a catchment to collect rainwater\nand then drains it to the crops next to it. Contour or keyline barriers are constructed\nperpendicular to the slope. Their function is to intercept rainfall,\nencourage infiltration, and to reduce soil erosion. Barriers are built from vegetative material\nin trashlines, stones or soil. Other cross-slope systems are swales\nand living terraces. Basin systems are closed diamond\nor square shaped catchments, surrounded by low earth bunds. Water falling into this basin is channelled\nto the lowest point, where ideally food trees are grown. In macro-catchment rainwater harvesting, the catchment area lies\noutside the application area. This means the rain is not collected\nwhere it is used. The land cover of the catchment area\ncan be manifold, including cultivated land,\nroads or settlements. Often, the catchment area is located\non a hill or mountain slope. To provide water in dry periods, the collected water can either be used\nfor groundwater recharge or stored in open or closed systems\nlike farm ponds or underground tanks. There are three broad categories of\nmacro-catchment rainwater harvesting systems. The first are hillside systems. Here, water flowing downhill\naccumulates on barriers, where it is used for crop irrigation\nand groundwater recharge. In stream-bed systems, structures such as sand dams or check dams are constructed across temporarily flooded channels. They are built from upstream to downstream\nto reduce the force of the water flow, to infiltrate water\nand to control erosion. Ephemeral stream diversion systems divert\nwater from seasonally flooded channels to large, low-lying areas, where the water infiltrates\nand provides enough moisture for crop growth. Land-based rainwater harvesting contributes\nto the reduction of soil erosion and flood occurrence, while also enhancing groundwater recharge. Where climate change and mismanagement\nthreaten the availability of water as a resource, rainwater harvesting systems can help\nincrease agricultural activity and thus food availability.",
