2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,800
what is a pest

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,599
you're annoying neighbor or sibling

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,599
no

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,679
a pest is an organism that eats or

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,039
damages crop plants that are grown in

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,400
agriculture

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,240
for example

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,240
slugs eating lettuce in my garden

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,240
pests can be controlled using pesticides

11
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,599
or by introducing other species also

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,239
known as biological control

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,120
pesticides are natural or synthetic

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,640
chemicals that are sprayed on crops

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,800
they include

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,920
insecticides that control insects

17
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,800
fungicides that control fungi

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,559
and herbicides that control weeds other

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,640
plants that are not supposed to grow

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,199
with the crop

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,079
pesticides can be sprayed all over a

22
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,079
field using industrial machinery like

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,520
tractors or planes

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,760
or in specific areas by humans

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,000
why do you think this person is wearing

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,400
so much protection while spraying crops

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,640
with pesticides

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,280
pesticides can be toxic to other

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,680
organisms not just the organisms they

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,040
aim to control

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,159
one example of this is ddt

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,960
dgt was used as an insecticide in the

33
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,040
mid 20th century to control mosquitoes

34
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,040
which spread malaria

35
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,960
a potentially fatal disease amongst

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,240
humans

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,439
however ddt was found to accumulate in

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,880
food chains

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,000
also known as bioaccumulation

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,240
the molecules of ddt did not break down

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,640
but instead were stored in the bodies of

42
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,200
organisms and passed on when those

43
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,920
organisms were eaten

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,640
the ddt became more concentrated in the

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,560
higher levels of the food chain

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,159
the effect on birds of prey was

47
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,159
catastrophic

48
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,719
it caused them to lay eggs with thin

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,399
shells that broke easily when the birds

50
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,560
incubated them

51
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,039
this led to a fall in the birth rate of

52
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,640
birds of prey and a massive decrease in

53
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,360
their populations

54
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,879
the use of ddt was eventually banned as

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,959
a result

56
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,360
through the process of evolution and

57
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,680
natural selection some pests become

58
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,239
resistant to pesticides

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,879
they survive and reproduce

60
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,280
the overuse of pesticides has led to an

61
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,680
increasing number of those organisms

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,599
which means that some pesticides are now

63
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,920
useless

64
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,640
apart from using pesticides which is

65
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,640
also known as chemical control

66
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,920
farmers can use biological control

67
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,200
mechanisms

68
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,200
can you think what that could be

69
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,239
biological control is the use of a

70
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,000
natural predator of the organism you

71
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,440
wish to control

72
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,959
for example aphids or green flies are

73
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,599
herbivores that feed on many human crops

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,200
aphids are eaten by ladybirds

75
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,120
ladybirds could be added to an

76
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,879
environment to control the number of

77
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
aphid pests

78
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,319
sometimes this method of control works

79
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,319
well

80
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,560
however the introduction of a new

81
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,959
species to an environment can have

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,440
unexpected effects

83
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,480
one example of this the hawaiian cane

84
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,480
toad

85
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,560
it was introduced in australia to

86
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,360
control the population of the cane

87
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,560
beetle a pest that damaged sugarcane

88
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,120
crops

89
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,799
however the hawaiian cane toad had

90
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,159
little effect on the cane beetle

91
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,360
population

92
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,680
instead cane toads reproduced rapidly

93
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,840
and spread across australia as they had

94
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,920
no natural predators

95
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,879
it's now considered a pest species

96
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,959
itself

97
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,840
and has been blamed for the extinction

98
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,519
of some endemic species

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,760
so now you know how pests can be

100
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,720
controlled to allow farmers to grow the

101
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,080
maximum amount of crops possible
