  "text": "what if I told you that using cardboard in the garden is a terrible idea it doesn't kill weeds effectively it doesn't feed the soil and it does absolutely nothing to improve your soil Health after years of trial and error I've developed a system that not only eliminates weeds but builds living thriving soil without a single piece of cardboard My Method uses cover crops as a natural sheet mulch with roots still in the ground creating a weed-free garden while boosting biodiversity improving soil structure and drainage while Scavenging for nutrients bringing them to the soil surface locking them in and making them plant available for healthier plants and bigger harvests with no fertilizer cardboard just Smothers the ground but cover crops feed the soil their Roots break up compaction support soil microbes and add organic matter where it matters the most below the soil surface in this video I'll show you exactly how to build the ultimate no dig Garden using cover crops as a sheet Mulch and why cardboard belongs in your Rec cycling bin and not in your garden hey what's up everybody welcome back to Chef's Harvest Farm if you're new here I'm Chef Mikey I'm a former executive chef turned Urban Farmer and I turned my backyard gardening hobby into a thriving no till Farm where I grow food sustainably for local chefs and restaurants here in Knoxville Tennessee over the years I've tested just about every gardening method out there made mistakes fought the weeds and figured out what actually worked over the past 8 years I've developed a cover crop system that improves improves crop Health eliminates weeds and builds healthier soil without chemicals or cardboard but it didn't start this way when I first began gardening in my backyard the soil is nothing more than hard compacted clay like concrete that's why I started with typical raised beds thinking nothing would grow in my native soil but after years of trial and error I developed a system that transformed this into Healthy Living soil and I'm confident it can improve almost any soil no matter how bad it is so how does it work it all starts with one simple shift stop thinking about how to feed your plants and start thinking about how to feed the soil I farm using nature as the model in a forest nobody's fertilizing the trees yet they Thrive leaves fall creating a natural mulch the soil is never exposed which is why you never see erosion animals add nutrients plants break down and nothing is ever removed it's a self-sustaining system you never see an entire Forest wiped out by pest because there's balance where predators and prey exist in harmony in contrast when we only grow vegetables we create a buffet for pests with nothing to keep them in check that's why I use multi-species cover crops they don't just improve the soil they create an ecosystem underground and above more plant diversity means more microbial diversity healthier soil fewer pests and stronger crops with higher yields it's Nature's Way of keeping things balanced and at work I mimic this process using cover crops and compost the result healthy living soil that grows thriving crops without synthetic fertilizers constant maintenance are fighting against nature Step One is preparing your garden PLT and this is where most people get it wrong why because they're impatient the key here is letting time do the work this isn't the fastest way to build a garden but in my opinion it's the most effective I start by laying down a silage tarp and not any tarp it has to be either a silage tarp or greenhouse plastic and here's why these tarps are UV treated to withstand the harsh rays of the Sun and they're nonwoven which means that they trap in heat and moisture which is exactly what you want the tarps I buy are 105 ft long and 24 ft wide I cut them in half to create garden plots that are just over 50 ft long this keeps all my garden beds uniform at 50 ft now the size of your garden isn't what's important what really matters is that all of your garden beds are the same size that could be 50 ft 100 ft or whatever works for you in your cont context but here's a tip I wouldn't recommend buying a tarp any larger than that they're extremely large heavy and hard to move even when they're cut in half but why does a bed size matter so much in a moment I'll explain exactly why this simple detail can make or break your garden success now these tarps are most effective In The Heat Of Summer but I've even starting Gardens using this method in the middle of the winter if you want to speed things up methods like flame weeding before you tarp can help too but here's the real secret to making this work and it's a part that most people Overlook it has to be wet under the tart set up some sprinklers run them for an hour before you tarp the plot this creates a steamy environment that breaks down plant material fast plus it tricks weed seeds into germinating only to suffocate because there's no sunlight no oxygen and they're under extreme heat if it's too dry under the tarp you'll pull it back months later thinking the job is done only to find stubborn weeds waiting to take over now how long should you tarp I highly recommend tarping for up to a year for the best result but if you're in a hurry you can get decent results with as little as 90 Days In the Heat of the summer if you want to speed everything up even more use greenhouse plastic instead of a silage tarp in the middle of summer you can get results in as little as 30 days but if you can I still recommend tarping for about a year trust me you'll thank me later once you pull the tarp back don't make the mistake of thinking the job's done if you you see weeds like Bermuda grass don't ignore them the tarp won't always kill them completely I'll go in and dig those weeds out that the tarp didn't kill roots and all otherwise all that hard work will be wasted step two is planting the cover crop I broadcast the seed directly on top of the soil when I first started I use winter Rye which is a great choice if you're just starting out but there's a couple key things you need to know to get it right first timing is everything winter ride must be planted by mid- October oober in my climate and here's the catch you won't be able to plant anything in those beds until May of the following year why because winter Ry can't be terminated easily until late April or early may you have to wait for it to form a seed head but here's the critical part you need to terminate it before it forms viable seeds this is called the milk stage because if you squeeze the seed head you'll likely see a milky substance inside this means the plant is at the end of its life cycle and ready to die but if you wait too long and it drops seeds you'll be fighting winter Ry seeds forever and trust me you don't want that headache if you want something a little bit easier to manage peas and oats are a great option if planted by mid-september they can winterkill naturally no termination required but this timing is key for the winter kill if it's not fully mature by the time winter hit it will not winter kill and you'll have to terminate it using other methods in the spring we'll dive into termination methods in a moment but over time I've learned that diversity in cover crops is where the real magic happens now I use 13 species cover crop mixes inoculated with mic rise and nitrogen fixing bacteria to create the most biodiversity possible the challenge with multi-species cover crop mixes that they all mature at different rates so if you don't manage them properly some will drop seeds and become weeds it took me years of trial and error to get this right once I've chosen my cover crop I simply broadcast the seed right on on top of the soil I like to time this right before a good rain or even during a rain I heavily overseed using nearly a 50 lb bag of seed on a plot that's only about an eighth of an acre that's enough seed to cover a full acre if drilled why so much because when you broadcast seeds some won't germinate some will get eaten by birds and rodents and some will wash away by the rain plus I want it as dense as possible to block out sunlight smother weeds and add maximum organic matter and nitrogen to the soil if needed I set up sprinklers to ensure good germination and healthy establishment then I just let time do the work as the cover crop grows their Roots scavenge for nutrients deep in the soil pulling them to the soil surface they attract diverse microorganisms each playing a role in the soil ecosystem creating a symbiotic relationship with plant roots and fostering micro risal fungi connections this helps plants uptake nutrients and water more efficiently making your garden more resilient it's like building a living support system underground once the cover crop reaches maturity it's time to terminate it I use a simple tool a toost tied to a rope to crimp the cover crop down tied to a rope and I'm just going to take it up I'm going to go like this I'm just going to step on it and I'm just going to keep moving all the way down and crimp the whole thing right down to the ground and I'm going to start on like the edges I'm going to go down the edge and crimp it in and then I'll go down this Edge and crimp it in and I'm going to leave the sprinklers in place and crimp the whole thing going in One Direction so I'm going to go down one way and then I'm going to walk back and then I'm going to go back down and crimp it and I'm going to walk back and then I'm going crimp it back so it's all face in One Direction so that this way when we pull the tarps over we pull the tarps Over It All in One Direction and it doesn't get snagged on anything but here's a tip always crimp it in the same direction that'll make the next step a whole lot easier after crimping I pull the tart back over the plot for two to three weeks this ensures everything is terminated and all the weeds that are trying to come back are smothered out but before I tarp again it's super important to run the irrigation to create that steamy effect just like we did earlier this helps break down the cover crop material into a nutrient-rich sheet Mulch and it will force any weed seeds to germinate under the tarp which guarantees a weed-free start after a few weeks we pull the tar back to reveal a beautiful sheet mulch with the roots still attached fostering a thriving soil ecosystem but before we plant our cash crops there's a couple more critical steps so to recap we've prepped our garden plot by tarping and eliminating weeds planted a dense cover crop to build soil health and let time do the heavy lifting then we crimped the cover crop tarped it again to create a nutrient-rich sheet Mulch and now we've got a living thriving soil ecosystem ready for the next step now that we have our sheet mulch With Our Roots still attached it's time to measure and build the garden bit before we start building building out the garden bids I want to quickly tell you about something that's been a total GameChanger for my farm finances I actually get paid to grow cover crops through USDA Grant and my secret weapon for securing those funds is Farm raise they help farmers manage bookkeeping for their schedule F keep track of farm finances and most importantly they alert you to USDA funding opportunities and help guide you through the process if you've ever felt overwhelmed by Farm grants or didn't even know where to start Farm ra makes it simple and if you need extra help they can even connect you with experienced Grant Riders right now you can get 20% off farm raay with my code Chef M20 don't wait you could be missing out on free money that's sitting there waiting for you right now I make all my garden beds exactly the same size 30 in wide 50 ft long with 18in walkways this isn't just about Aesthetics it's about efficiency I keep every single bed the same size at both of my Farms why because it makes everything 100% interchangeable my drip lines insect Nets silage tarps shade cloths and frost blankets are all exactly the same size no guessing no hunting around for the right piece I can just grab whatever I need and it fits perfectly every time no wasted time looking for the right piece now the exact size of your garden beds isn't what's important what matters is that they're all the same size once you realize how much time this saves you'll never go back to Mark the beds I use Simple Wood staks from the construction aisle at Home Depot or Lowe's then I grab a yard stick measure out my beds and walkways and for perfectly straight lines I tie tomato twine from one steak to another outlining the garden beds and walkways like a grid this might seem like an extra step but straight uniform beds make every part of farming easier from planting to harvesting to irrigation and let's face it the real reason y'all watch my videos is because the garden looks clean organized and aesthetically pleasing once the beds are marked I fill them with about 6 in of fresh manure-based compost here's the thing not all compost is created equal you've got to do the research ask questions do trials before adding large amounts of compost to your garden some compost has little and no nutritional value and worse it can be contaminated with herbicides or pathogens one of my guys delivered 20 yards of compost and so I'm going to show you how I'm going to test it for persistent herbicide potential so I'm going to fill a few of these up with uh with compost I'm going to take it home with me all right so I'm back in my grow room I got my little things of compost here and then I've got sugar peas and then I've got some beans too so I've just got the little pots that I filled up over there and then my compost one two hook them down into the compost a little bit and then I'm going to go water them in if they grow all good we're good to go and if not then and will be concerned but I've never had it happen that that it wasn't good I just uh I'm sharing best practices with you and then so this is just like a heat mat and a grow light right up there and then we'll check back in a few days and see what they look like all right y'all so I'm back in the grow room here it's a few weeks later this is what you want it to look like and if they like grew kind of distorted or like wonky kind like misshaped leaves crinkly or like just stunted and really didn't grow well at all then you would be concerned so this is the best test that you can do to test your compost for herbicide contamination I'm looking all good so we're going to go and use this compost or actually we already did this compost feeds the soil and acts as a nutrient-rich mulch keeping my garden beds practically weed-free All Season yes it's a lot of work to get to this point but the payoff never weeding or fertilizing your garden is priceless the compost adds biological diversity to the soil ecosystem feeding the beneficial microbes and creating a thriving environment underground this method feeds your soil boosts plant health and keeps weeds in check all season long and there's no need to worry about erosion because your soil Is Anchored In by the cover crops root system holding everything in place the dead plant material sits on top of the soil acting as a natural protective barrier on top of that it's covered with a thick layer of compost shielding it from the harsh effects of the sun wind and rain it's a living system designed to mimic the forest just like we talked about earlier using nature as the model Nature's been growing plants for millions of years without cardboard synthetic fertilizers or human intervention now for the walkways I usually put down wood chips right away to suppress weeds and retain moisture but in this particular plot we left the cover crop residue as the walkway for the summer because we direct seated winter squash here why because winter squash Vines out and covers the ground choking out any weeds that might try to come back there was no need to walk in the roads no extra maintenance and as you can see we had a great yield of winter squash without adding any additional fertilizer after harvesting the squash we tarp the plot again to suppress any leftover weeds added more compost and filled the walkways with wood chips now it's ready for garlic and soon no dig potatoes if this blew your mind or if you've got questions drop a comment below I'd love to hear what you're thinking and what works in your garden thanks for watching grommies remember to always work with nature not against it and I'll see you in the next one",
