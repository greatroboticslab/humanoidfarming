00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:14,860
[Music]

2
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:20,400
thank you

3
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,680
g'day hey going so we're back again it's

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,720
Richard from off-road touring off now in

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,180
this video it's not so much a how-to

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,279
video it's more of a video of what you

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,380
need to turn your Jerry can into a

8
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,579
gravity fed system so when you are at

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,620
Camp you can actually leave your Jerry

10
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,540
can in the back of your car or if you've

11
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,579
got a wagon lock myself or in a canopy

12
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,219
I've got a list of bits and pieces you

13
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:42,960
need to actually turn that into that

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,719
system and I'll walk you through those

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,120
now and show you exactly what you need

16
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:50,039
to our setup it'll only cost you around

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,300
thirty dollars to do it so it is a

18
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,520
pretty cheap option rather than having

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,320
to Lug that out and the dog's waiting

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,579
for its ball to be thrown all right so

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,360
that should keep the dog happy for a

22
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,280
minute

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,199
now firstly we'll start from the end of

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,719
the Jerry can so obviously at the bottom

25
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,159
here you have a water Outlet there or

26
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,020
you can even fill it from it if you want

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:09,900
to once this is done I'll show you that

28
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,320
but you can take this off here a little

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,979
plug at the end so what you do need is a

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,560
20 mil BPA thread and it has a 13 mil

31
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,420
Barb on it so you'll find this in the uh

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,400
this is from the gardening section in

33
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,040
your local hardware store

34
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:29,460
so that just screws straight into there

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,200
so I've also got some uh Teflon tape now

36
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,340
I probably don't really need Teflon but

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,920
it doesn't hurt just to do a couple

38
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:36,540
wraps around it just to minimize the

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,479
chances of that leaking so what I'll do

40
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,240
now I'll um put the tape on it

41
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,220
and I'll take that little plug out hang

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,340
on a minute I'll get the ball in a sec

43
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,780
and then we'll uh show you the next step

44
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,000
now I know I said it's not really a

45
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,500
how-to video but that Phillips head

46
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,579
there that I have there is not really

47
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,979
adequate

48
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,960
and if I want to strip the uh

49
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,360
cap out so all I've done we're going to

50
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,920
use this shifter shortly but that

51
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,140
actually the back end of that fits an

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,640
egg not too bad

53
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,640
so I'll just unscrew that now

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,099
and then I'll uh Chuck a bit of tape on

55
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,260
here and I'll fit that in but this comes

56
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,540
in handy for when you want to tighten up

57
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,739
your thread into the Jerry can but

58
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,060
obviously you don't want to do it up too

59
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:22,800
tight because

60
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,020
it wouldn't take much just to strip out

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,060
that there but I'll put the tape on now

62
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,220
I won't film all that bit it's not that

63
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:31,680
exciting but uh I'll Chuck that in now

64
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,200
and get that bit set up

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,020
so earlier on I mentioned about this

66
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,120
thread here so your 20 mil BPA and I'll

67
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,519
talk you through the other

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,760
um parts that you'll need as well so

69
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,800
I've got myself a two meter uh garden

70
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,019
hose so it's already come with the brass

71
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,360
fittings and it's all crimped there nice

72
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:54,300
and tight So that obviously reduces the

73
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,099
chance of the hose leaking at all

74
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:58,500
and then I grabbed an inline tap now

75
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:01,500
that's got a uh from memory I think that

76
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,120
had the 13 mil thread on it as well now

77
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,440
the beauty of this is once it's all

78
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,019
connected I'll show you but that does

79
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,060
screw into the um the fitting on the end

80
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,420
there and that gives you your

81
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,360
tap and a hose clamp

82
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,220
and the tape

83
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,060
so just bottom screwing that in there

84
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,560
now

85
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,040
um You might be wondering why I didn't

86
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,420
get the food grade hose which in my old

87
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,519
camper trailer and stuff I definitely

88
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,019
use food grade but this jewelry can is

89
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,120
predominantly for

90
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,500
washing up or showering and things like

91
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,379
that it's we don't use it just for

92
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,560
drinking water we prefer to buy the uh

93
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:39,120
600 mL bottles and then we if for

94
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,440
waistbander away we actually squash the

95
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,580
bottles down screw the lid on so you

96
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,500
don't have big plastic bottles

97
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,480
everywhere but just for drinking water

98
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,879
we don't always use these of course if

99
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,560
we need an emergency we have got it but

100
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,200
that's why I've just used the garden

101
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,000
hose before any of you wonder why

102
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,860
I haven't used it it's because we

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,739
normally do it with the uh

104
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,080
oh with the water bottles that you buy

105
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,099
and they're relatively cheap now yep and

106
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,940
I'll just throw the ball to the dog

107
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,940
again I'll be right back

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,580
so I'll just nip that up

109
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,720
all right so I've got that all threaded

110
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,359
in there now I'll just hit the Jerry can

111
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,740
in the car where I'm going to actually

112
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,600
um

113
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,759
have it positioned and I'll cut this

114
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,919
hose to length make sure I cut it off

115
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,080
the right end of the hose of course

116
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:33,120
and then I'll uh

117
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,800
show you what the next step is or the

118
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,600
next part that I need which will be this

119
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,860
hose clamp here so I'm just going to

120
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,860
measure that up and I'll be right back

121
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,199
just got the old trusty layer them in

122
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:48,060
there

123
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:49,740
so that's about the length I'm going to

124
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:51,180
need I've just got the tap diamond in

125
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:54,580
there at the moment

126
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,120
and I'll uh give this a quick cut

127
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:58,500
[Music]

128
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,940
all right that should be the perfect

129
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,100
length there I'll grab that Jerry can

130
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:05,180
back here and I'll uh

131
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,180
connect the hose to it

132
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,080
all right so hang on

133
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,080
foreign

134
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:29,280
I've got but this is just one I had

135
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,320
sitting at home so basically I've just

136
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,919
cut the hose off there

137
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,479
I'm going to slide that on

138
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,639
like that

139
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,960
and

140
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,340
I'll get the screwdriver out the

141
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:44,220
Leatherman

142
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:47,820
tighten that up but before I do do that

143
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,419
I'll show you this hose fitting so

144
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,419
oh

145
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,720
hang on Scout

146
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,160
so got this fitting here

147
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,320
which comes with the uh which comes with

148
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,600
the hose obviously

149
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:05,460
it's already connected to it

150
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,900
so that's that's good and then I can

151
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,139
just screw that

152
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,660
tap on so nice and simple

153
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:14,460
just an inline tap there and the other

154
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,300
luxuries as well if you want to you can

155
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,520
even

156
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,960
get a connection get a connector and

157
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,180
leave it in your car or if it's mounted

158
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,100
permanently into canopy Etc you can

159
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,419
actually fill that up from the bottom up

160
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,860
but of course you want to be keeping an

161
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:28,800
eye on the top and not make sure that

162
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,740
you don't uh overfill it but

163
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,139
I'll uh go ahead and tidy uh tighten up

164
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,699
that hose clamp now and uh

165
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:37,139
do a test run

166
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,780
and see how it all goes make sure I've

167
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:41,880
got no leaks I've got that hose clamp on

168
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:45,479
the hose is on

169
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,639
and I'll just pop this uh

170
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:50,340
tap in now and then I'll fill it with

171
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,900
water and see how we go

172
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,880
so those of you with a Keen Eye will

173
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:56,160
notice that I've swapped Jerry can so I

174
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,259
swapped it out with the 18 liter Pro

175
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,300
quip for the 22 liter so the beauty of

176
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,919
this is quite simple to swap from Jerry

177
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,139
can to Jerry can depending on your trip

178
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,759
and how much room and all that sort of

179
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,520
stuff so it's quite a versatile little

180
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,440
uh setup so

181
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,479
as you can see it all works well I'll

182
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,919
probably leave water sit in it for a day

183
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,900
or two and I'll swirl it around and make

184
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,180
sure that I don't have any leaks but

185
