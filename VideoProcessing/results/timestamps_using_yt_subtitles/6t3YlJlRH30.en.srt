on the economy so there's a couple of

38
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,920
things that we really discuss in this

about the sector if you want to connect

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,040
with farmers connect with agronomists

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,159
for example and today we have an

45
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,959
autonomous

46
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,120

47
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,640
number of times onto the show how they

48
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:16,400
provide support to the farmers and today

49
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,160
we're going to unpack that in our

it's a pleasure it's a pleasure so like

66
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,720
i said you know we've had uh quite a

67
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:03,280
number of conversations in our episodes

68
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,599
around the important role that uh

69
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,599
agronomy or agronomists provide to uh

70
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,120
farmers but just tell us about what is

71
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:16,159
it that you do within seacoa limited

72
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,400
thank you molly so what happens is as an

73
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,360
agronomist at cidco limited

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,200
i'm tasked with the role of availing a

75
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,440
product knowledge to our farmers you

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,519
know making it in such a way that they

77
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,760
can understand it making it in such a

78
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,760
way that they can also use it to add

79
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,519
value in their farming enterprises

80
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,680
because now we are taking farming as a

81
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,000
formidable business so we would want to

82
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,760
then follow up with technical backup to

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
make sure that our farmers are realizing

84
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,480
the much needed value from the seeds

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,840
that we sell in cidco we are mostly a

86
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,720
seed business so we sell a wide range of

87
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,799
seed crops and a wide range of varieties

88
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,799
of those specific seed crops so our

89
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,879
farmers would need technical assistance

90
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,120
in terms of selection what they should

91
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,680
do then on top of that we also do

92
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,239
trainings we do demonstration plots

93
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,879
where we will be also going out to make

94
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,200
sure that the team understands and the

95
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,200
farmers understand what they need to be

96
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,680
doing for them to realize value out of

97
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,400
the genetics that they have then we also

98
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,160
avail extension services like what we

99
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,280
are doing now to make sure that out

100
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,320
today people understand so we integrate

101
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,800
traditional and digital marketing uh

102
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,759
efforts to make sure that uh at least we

103
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,680
are also adapting to what uh you know

104
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,320
videos brought where we cannot meet as

105
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,400
regularly as we want but also just to

106
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,240
provide information to our farmers in

107
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,160
terms of the farming activities that

108
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,240
they should be doing and should be

109
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,560
tasked with

110
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,320
right so when should a farmer start

111
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,720
engaging or having a relationship with

112
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,800
an agronomist is it before they start

113
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,199
planting or during their production

114
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,840
cycle

115
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,479
farmers basically need to change their

116
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,039
mindset and they need a mindset shift

117
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,919
whereby we need to then um concentrate

118
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,000
that it starts with you acquiring the

119
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,479
right skills or the right basic

120
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,639
knowledge before you venture into any

121
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,120
cropping program so we wouldn't want a

122
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,360
situation whereby the farmer is coming

123
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,120
in at a later stage and maybe some

124
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,039
mistakes have been made some of them

125
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,120
they cannot be rectified so you would

126
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,600
want the farmer to be in a position to

127
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,520
engage an agronomist or a technical

128
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,520
expert in the field that they want to

129
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,240
get into so that they can get the

130
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,000
information uh beforehand in terms of

131
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,000
what they need to prepare what they need

132
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,479
to look out for as well as the

133
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,720
profitability since we said that farming

134
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,720
is a business so you need to know how

135
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,479
profitable is it and you need to

136
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,360
understand the markets that are

137
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,600
available so all this can only come if

138
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,400
you plan in advance and you do it before

139
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:53,120
you venture into the enterprise

140
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,560
fantastic so i'm glad to mention all

141
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,880
these topics you know because yes

142
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,319
farming is a business right um and we

143
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,639
need to take it seriously because we

144
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,039
have experts like you who give proper

145
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,600
good professional advice so you said

146
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,960
planning in advance now let's take it

147
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,039
into a detail

148
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,440
i'm a farmer maybe i want to start my

149
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,680
new season so maybe i might i'm probably

150
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,440
a seasoned farmer right i just want to

151
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,960
start my new season and make sure that

152
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,560
whatever challenges that i experienced

153
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,800
in the previous season do not occur in

154
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,880
the next next season furthermore i'm

155
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,639
also a farmer who maybe just wants to

156
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,120
start

157
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,120
at what type of discussions would you be

158
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,199
having with these two different farmers

159
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,000
a new entrant and a person that's trying

160
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,000
to perfect their season so maybe give us

161
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,680
an insight in terms of the type of

162
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,280
conversation you'll have with the farmer

163
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,880
that's just starting out

164
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,639
versus the type of conversation that

165
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,880
should be having with the farmer who

166
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,800
just wants to perfect his or her season

167
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,880
going forward

168
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,360
okay so i would basically say that both

169
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,759
farmers still need to plan because if

170
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,840
you fail to plan you plan to fail but

171
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,759
i'll start with the seasoned farmer yeah

172
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,479
with the season farmer you're speaking

173
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,199
about someone who has already

174
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,199
understood the art of uh of farming in

175
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,880
terms of the enterprise that they are in

176
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,880
if they are into field crops maybe they

177
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,120
are doing mains they are doing multiple

178
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,960
cropping if irrigation allows they also

179
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,560
understand that uh

180
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,800
the times of seasons that they need to

181
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,440
come in but oh they need to also

182
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,520
constantly check on the new trends that

183
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,720
might be existing so in their planning

184
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,440
process they need to engage the

185
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,800
agronomist get recent information in

186
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,560
terms of the

187
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,960
the trends the varieties that are

188
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,639
available the new problematic diseases

189
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,240
that they are most likely to face

190
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,160
because we have said that they've been

191
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,919
in farming and they've been doing it

192
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,560
they need to understand how they can aid

193
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,039
on their profitability and also reduce

194
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,560
their input costs so that farming also

195
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,319
remains a viable business for them

196
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,479
because if they're going back it means

197
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,840
they've seen value in it but they need

198
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,919
to understand from a planning

199
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,000
perspective how they need to manage

200
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,080
certain things there might be an advent

201
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,319
of new problematic diseases or insect

202
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,960
pests but if they don't engage the

203
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,120
relevant uh stakeholders to provide this

204
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,199
information to them they might not be in

205
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,879
the know and get into their next

206
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,280
cropping program assuming it's the same

207
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,599
as the previous one when we have seen

208
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,240
clearly that climate change has really

209
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:16,000
uh changed a lot of things and

210
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,800
no one sees them is identical to the

211
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,919
other so the season farmer keeps needs

212
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,000
to check and also plan in advance after

213
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,319
that the assistant farmer also needs to

214
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,080
do the checklist whereby they are

215
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,319
looking at the good economic practices

216
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,360
that they need to employ uh such as the

217
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,080
land preparation the planting time the

218
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,560
management and all sorts so at least if

219
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,880
it's a seasoned farmer they understand

220
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,479
what they need to do and also they're

221
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,240
also going to be doing it

222
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,720
timelessly they just need

223
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,080
some refreshers and reminders but if

224
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,880
you're going to be dealing with a

225
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,200
first-time farmer you need to drill down

226
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,640
the basics and also make sure that they

227
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,360
understand that

228
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,519
it's not an overnight victory it's

229
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,760
farming is not uh one of those

230
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,920
professions where you can just get into

231
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,320
it and uh you wake up tomorrow you're a

232
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,760
millionaire you need to put in the work

233
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,680
and you also need to invest in uh in the

234
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,920
acquisition of uh

235
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,839
of information and technologies that are

236
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,519
also going to advance so for a

237
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,200
first-time farmer they might just hear

238
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,200
the neighbor saying oh no i made a lot

239
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,640
of money but there's a lot of work that

240
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,080
goes into it

241
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,160
that our first time farmer needs to

242
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,360
understand and appreciate and in some

243
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,680
instances um you find that it might take

244
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,839
a season or two for you to realize

245
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,600
profit maybe you're running at a loss

246
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,160
maybe you are recovering the course that

247
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,920
you have put into the into the farming

248
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,920
venture so all of this you need to

249
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,240
discuss at the beginning

250
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,240
once you have done so the first time

251
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,800
farmer needs to understand the principle

252
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,279
of soil management whereby we are

253
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,920
talking about them understanding what

254
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,200
their soil requires and coming in with

255
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,200
the correct

256
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,279
nutrient management principles for the

257
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,040
crop in question otherwise you would

258
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,120
find that our farmers would just assume

259
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,040
that fertilizer is fertilizer they go on

260
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,279
the market they just buy they come in

261
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,519
then they don't get the sad result but

262
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,000
the first cut of hope for a first-time

263
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,480
farmer uh my knowledge is that is for

264
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,959
them to make sure that they

265
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,200
understand and do soil analysis it's a

266
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,920
test that they need to do for them to

267
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,399
get custom-made nutrient management for

268
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,000
their farm after that they also get into

269
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,000
the good agronomic practices that we

270
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,079
were mentioning for the season farmer

271
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,120
but for them they need to go into

272
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:35,920
greater detail and understand the why

273
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,079
the why i'm doing it why am i coming in

274
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,760
with this type of land preparation why

275
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,240
should i also control weeds within the

276
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,399
first six to eight weeks why is this

277
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,640
insect pest a problem and how can i

278
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,800
manage it before it reaches levels where

279
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,800
it's going to reduce my yields so all of

280
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,399
these things they come into play for a

281
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,279
first time farmer a first time farmer

282
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,440
has more more work to do and they need

283
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,680
to understand that even when the crop is

284
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,200
established and it's looking lush green

285
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,040
it's not the time when they should bring

286
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,680
in their friends to just drive around

287
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,680
the field and and not go inside the

288
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,480
field to check otherwise some of these

289
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,240
problematic diseases barley they start

290
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,160
from inside the field then spread

291
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,160
outwards so if you're just going you

292
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,079
know taking a drive around the field you

293
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,079
won't really get the feel of what's

294
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,320
really happening so there's a lot that

295
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,399
the first time farmer needs to do they

296
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,279
need to invest their time to make sure

297
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,600
that they understand the venture

298
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,760
yeah like she's spoken like a true

299
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,120
expert you know the advice that you're

300
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,040
giving is so practical and simple and i

301
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,440
can see that you really enjoy what you

302
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,240
do because the passion just really comes

303
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,680
out

304
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,120
and shines through your face um wendy

305
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,600
the next question i want to ask

306
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,480
basically is with the farmers that

307
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,200
you've dealt with you know um how have

308
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,839
they bounced back through the very harsh

309
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,920
climatic conditions that we've

310
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,160
experienced um you know late last year

311
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,000
and early this year we've had some heavy

312
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,279
rainfalls in various regions in the

313
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:08,079
country um you know how they bounce back

314
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,440
um uh uh you know just basically keeping

315
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:14,639
their enterprises afloat

316
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,720
well that's uh now changing the mood eh

317
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,519
you know it's not a smiling issue

318
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,880
climate change is really a menace

319
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,959
amongst us

320
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,360
the past uh three to five years we have

321
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,600
seen a lot of unforeseen weather

322
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,600
burglaries that have been going on where

323
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,680
you find that in some instances it's a

324
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,920
false start to the season where you

325
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,560
think the season is started it's october

326
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,560
well ending end it's uh mid october when

327
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,320
the season usually starts you get rains

328
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,560
for three days then it goes for two

329
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,120
weeks without raining three weeks or a

330
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,519
month so that that will be a false start

331
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,000
then you get a premature termination of

332
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:53,120
the season mid-season dry spells that

333
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,320
prolong for example um in zim we had

334
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,040
about

335
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,279
four weeks with no rain in february

336
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,920
which is not a norm so some of these

337
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,079
changes are also uh things that have

338
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,120
caused in red havoc amongst our farmers

339
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,560
in terms of their uh operation and yes

340
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,560
are talking about the heavy rains as

341
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,800
well because the misconception that is

342
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,920
they ball is that climate change is

343
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,560
associated with no rain or drought but

344
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,120
climate change just means that the norm

345
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,279
what we are used to has been shifted or

346
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,839
changed a bit so

347
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,959
heavy rains also go into climate change

348
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,560
and the heavy rains that were

349
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,959
experienced in south africa in

350
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,200
mozambique the rays that the persistent

351
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,040
rains that we received in zim we got

352
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,120
persistent rains and a bit of flooding

353
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,839
in some instances so

354
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,079
those scenarios the farmer would not

355
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,920
have prepared for because according to

356
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,560
the weather forecast which is the main

357
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,560
guide that provides information into

358
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,680
what this isn't going to be like they

359
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,079
don't get to see some of these um

360
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,920
scenarios in advance maybe they get to

361
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,000
see them three to five days before

362
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,399
they're okay but that means the farmer

363
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,839
is ready if it's planting planted but

364
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,320
then if the rain's coming and they are

365
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,760
heavy that crop is going to be swept off

366
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,760
and if the

367
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,000
uh the farmer has already planted their

368
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,240
crop and did not do maybe some

369
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,839
conservation agriculture principles or

370
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,839
water management drainage system uh

371
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,480
principles you find that

372
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,240
flooding may also occur in the field so

373
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,880
it's difficult to really plan for

374
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,079
climate change the best we can do is to

375
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,839
mitigate the effects how so you need to

376
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,600
then

377
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,440
understand uh from the guidance that you

378
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,399
get from the meteorological services

379
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,160
department which is the one which is um

380
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,399
which governs and understands the

381
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,959
climatic issues that face that are going

382
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,399
to be characteristic of that season if

383
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,399
they tell you that you're expecting a

384
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,720
number to above normal rainfall then the

385
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,519
three to five day focus are the regular

386
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,839
guides that you need to be uh partaking

387
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,839
in if you know that maybe your area is

388
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,959
prone to flooding then you come in with

389
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,040
contour ridges you come in with um

390
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:04,000
drainage inside the field so that the

391
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,160
water gets to wash off and not uh flood

392
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,880
inside the fields if it's an area that

393
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,639
tends to be dry drier than other areas

394
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,720
then you know that water

395
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,040
is important you also need to come in

396
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,360
with your port hauling your chai bridges

397
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,440
different uh practices that are going to

398
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,440
conserve as much moisture as possible

399
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,600
mulching all those principles need to

400
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,639
come in so

401
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,120
i would say we have seen a lot of uh

402
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,519
disgruntlement uh amongst our farmers

403
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,040
both commercial and communal where even

404
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,199
for the commercial farmer in some

405
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,440
instances even when they think they want

406
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,600
to irrigate they don't get enough rain

407
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,920
to fill their water bodies so irrigation

408
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,160
is also then affected then the communal

409
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,440
farmer thinks that uh maybe since i have

410
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,759
done um

411
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,920
i've done my my ca my conservation

412
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,160
agriculture uh there's minimum soil

413
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,000
disturbance and oh when the rains come

414
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,480
in they're still come in and they flood

415
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,560
the field because there's no deep

416
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,360
speculation of the water into the ground

417
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,920
so it's not easy for our farmers really

418
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,560
climate change it's not easy for us as

419
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,600
well as an industry whereby we are also

420
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,279
tasked with availing uh crops that are

421
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,279
also tolerant to some of these

422
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,399
challenges that might be faced

423
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:19,120
be it the the the prolonged dry spell

424
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,279
you need a drought tolerant variety that

425
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,040
is going to remain maybe at a particular

426
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,639
stage for a certain time and then come

427
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,560
back and resume growth when the

428
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,639
conditions are allowing and then you

429
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,920
also need maybe earliness a variety that

430
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,240
matures earlier so that it escapes the

431
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,800
effects of of climate change by by

432
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,040
maturing before the dry spell commences

433
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,360
so there is a lot that the industry is

434
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,600
trying to do to mitigate the effects of

435
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,079
climate change but the farmer needs to

436
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,320
also take its upon themselves to make

437
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,279
sure that they are also doing some

438
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,600
mitigation measures in their own right

439
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:55,839
wow thank you for going very much in

440
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,160
depth into that and you've brought in

441
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,759
something that uh you know is quite an

442
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,680
ongoing debate in the agri industry

443
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,640
especially when you talk about um

444
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,679
disease resistant seeds um drought

445
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,839
tolerant

446
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,240
seeds etc you know and the ongoing

447
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,160
debater is that you know um there's

448
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,480
certain countries and the certain

449
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,640
organizations that have laws and

450
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,400
policies around uh the different types

451
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,240
of seeds that are meant to be sold you

452
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,120
know so the debate is about where the

453
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,880
farmer should use gmo seeds non-gmo

454
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,480
seeds open pollinated seeds hybrid seeds

455
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,400
what's your opinion around this and

456
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,520
maybe if you could just maybe touch on a

457
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,080
little bit based on gmo non-gmo hybrid

458
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,000
open pollinated the difference

459
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,720
the difference between all of these for

460
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,240
our audience to understand in depth the

461
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,640
different varieties that are out there

462
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:48,160
so what's your opinion around the use of

463
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,280
these various seeds um and um and you

464
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,000
know

465
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,280
you mentioned mitigating the risks so

466
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,919
when when we are experiencing severe uh

467
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:01,360
climate climatic conditions should we

468
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,200
then move over to maybe hybrid seeds

469
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,400
versus open pollinated so what's your

470
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,559
opinion

471
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,799
around this topic and also maybe bring

472
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,960
in your experience on what you've seen

473
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,840
on the ground

474
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,520
thank you very much for that question i

475
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,880
would say you've really put me on the

476
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:20,720
spot today but i'll do my best

477
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,400
so what happens you know with the the

478
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,799
different types of seeds i'll start with

479
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,960
the open pollinated seeds which also

480
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,400
speaks to the land races particularly

481
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,559
looking at um

482
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,640
maize it being a staple crop in most

483
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,880
african countries you'll find that there

484
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,960
are some land-waste varieties that have

485
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:40,480
existed for a very long time on the

486
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,000
market and they've been farmer retained

487
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,600
it's like the seed that the farmer is

488
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,480
going to return over and over and over

489
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,559
again

490
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,039
but uh initially it was enough for you

491
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,120
to have that seed because that was in

492
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,679
the advent of agriculture and

493
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,240
as a technology it was a good

494
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,360
technology for us to have those language

495
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,679
varieties but over time as you know that

496
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,240
agriculture is not constant it's also

497
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,960
dynamic like any other sector over time

498
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,600
it was realized that the yields that are

499
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,240
obtained from opv's open pollinated

500
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,120
varieties or farm saved varieties over

501
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,480
years

502
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,480
they they tend to be lower compared to

503
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,160
the need that was arising from the

504
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,400
increase in population that was being

505
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,600
experienced so there was a need for us

506
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,200
to reach food security and food security

507
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,360
then feeds into food

508
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,880
surplus for us to then export to our

509
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,919
other countries that might still be in

510
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,240
need so as africa we have not really

511
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,520
mastered the um

512
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,080
the

513
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,400
ability to produce what is enough for

514
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,480
ourselves enough for us to then sell to

515
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,240
other countries so there was a need a

516
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,280
gap there that existed that then

517
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,760
prompted breeders to come in with what

518
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,720
we are turning hybrid seed because with

519
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:57,280
hybrid seeds now you are now getting

520
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,840
more value out of the same amount of

521
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,159
seeds that you will have established for

522
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,480
example in the in some

523
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,280
varieties like hungry king which is also

524
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,880
an opv or the eight line variety that

525
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,200
our farmers do or the colorful names

526
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,679
that we've seen you'll find that the

527
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,480
number of rows

528
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,720
tends to be around eight six to eight

529
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,960
and then the number of

530
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,280
uh the length of the cup as well tends

531
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,600
to be shorter so it tends to produce

532
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,919
less grain when we are talking about

533
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,080
farming being a business where you need

534
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,799
to push in terms of the grain that you

535
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,039
get which comes from the huge components

536
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:38,000
that that also include the number of

537
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,360
rows of the plants the size of the cob

538
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,960
and also the

539
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,400
the weight of the grain that you're also

540
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,520
going to get so the hybrid seeds came in

541
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,000
and it outweighed the opvc in terms of

542
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,000
these characteristics then we also saw

543
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,240
that over time there was the development

544
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,720
of problematic diseases like your gray

545
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,360
leaf spots you find like mainstream

546
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,080
virus and all those so in those land

547
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,039
race varieties or pv varieties there was

548
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:07,440
not much that could be done to safeguard

549
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,080
the grain from from the challenges that

550
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,240
were caused by these new diseases and

551
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,480
new strains of diseases that might have

552
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,679
been existing before but with the hybrid

553
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,280
seed you are able to introduce new genes

554
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,039
that you are going to say because of

555
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,200
this particular gene we are now

556
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:25,280
self-guided against this problem because

557
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,919
of this gene we are now safeguarded

558
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,880
against gray leaf spots so now we have

559
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,720
hybrid seeds that is resistant which

560
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,960
means it will not be affected by grain

561
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,280
spots it will not be affected by leaf

562
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,880
rust if it's leaf rust some

563
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,679
whatever problematic diseases might

564
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,600
exist so hybrid seeds have resistance

565
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:47,360
and tolerance to problematic diseases

566
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,559
that the op v seed might not have so

567
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,200
um

568
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,919
you are seeing that the opv sit

569
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,400
so far it might have lower use it might

570
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,039
be susceptible to diseases it might also

571
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,000
not be drought tolerant because when it

572
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,679
was developed climate change had already

573
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,280
started the climate has been changing

574
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,679
for like it always changes but the rate

575
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,679
at which it's changing now was not the

576
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,640
same as what happened when those

577
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:17,520
varieties we were failed so you find

578
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,080
that uh the hybrid seed is able to

579
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,240
withstand long periods of dry spells

580
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,880
challenges that come with climate change

581
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,640
falling in the fields from wind excess

582
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,080
wind or excess rain

583
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,840
more than what the opvc will do then

584
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,080
moving

585
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,000
from the opv seat i think uh

586
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,200
concurrently i've also mentioned what

587
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,039
the hybrid seat would also be doing but

588
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,080
just to add on in terms of the hybrid

589
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:47,600
seats you find that it comes with a wide

590
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:49,600
range of options where you find that um

591
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,520
based on the pharmacy agroecological

592
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,240
region where they are also doing their

593
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,880
cropping there are varieties that mature

594
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,360
very early 90 to 120 days there are

595
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,600
varieties that take 115 days there will

596
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,159
be varieties that take longer in the

597
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,480
field but also giving higher yields like

598
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:10,640
uh maybe the late maturing varieties

599
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,880
that will give 160 to 150 260 days but

600
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,440
giving very high yields so there are

601
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,559
options with hybrid seeds that don't

602
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:21,200
exist with opg seeds because with opv

603
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,440
it's only one seed the the huge

604
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,200
potential is the same no matter what you

605
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,120
do no matter what you increase even with

606
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,720
soil analysis and the good agronomic

607
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,960
practices we were mentioning you are

608
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,200
unable to reach a certain level there is

609
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,280
a there is a ceiling to what you can do

610
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,520
with your opv but with hybrids there are

611
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,320
a lot of options then moving away from

612
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,480
that uh so that i don't over explain on

613
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,320
this particular question alone but it's

614
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,279
you put me on the spot

615
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,480
so no worries

616
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:52,960
so for gmos um it's an interesting topic

617
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,200
really uh where

618
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,640
there's a lot of misconceptions that

619
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,559
exist one

620
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,640
there is a lack of uh knowledge

621
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,919
amongst our farmers who are the

622
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,320
implementers or the people who are

623
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,159
supposed to take on the new technology

624
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,320
so

625
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,799
uh in some instances it might appear as

626
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,919
if it's bringing in negative side

627
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:18,480
effects uh to to get into the gmo

628
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,480
technology in farming but

629
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,799
sometimes it's because of the ignorance

630
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,120
or lack of adequate knowledge on how it

631
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:28,000
works because currently you'll find that

632
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,400
there are some gmo maize seeds that are

633
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,039
available on the market in zimbabwe we

634
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,679
have not adopted gmo technology yet i'll

635
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,240
tell you why but in some countries the

636
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,559
gmo technologies have been adopted but

637
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,960
having been adopted you find that

638
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,799
they come in with a reduction in cost of

639
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,960
production where

640
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,279
where a farmer is able to go in because

641
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,600
they see this gmo they can spray a

642
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,159
particular product without the risk of

643
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,240
damaging the crop and it becomes cheaper

644
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,919
for them increasing then on their bottom

645
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,600
line which is the yields because

646
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,679
profitability is what you are looking

647
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,440
for since farming is also a business

648
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,279
even at the communal level farming

649
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,200
should be a business a person should

650
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,880
just think of should not just think of

651
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,799
producing enough for them and then their

652
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,760
family they should think of producing

653
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:16,080
excess so that they can sell and also

654
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,720
make a living out of farming so this is

655
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,159
what we are talking about so this uh

656
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,640
basically the technology that's what

657
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,520
that's what it does it allows you to do

658
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,679
some things that you maybe were not able

659
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,000
to do if you're going to be applying a

660
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,720
chemical that was going to

661
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,600
also affect the crop but affecting all

662
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,400
the other weeds like your glyphosate

663
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,679
which is a herbicide if you're going to

664
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,799
apply it

665
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,679
in gmo maize you find that uh you can

666
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:48,320
apply it over the crop without risks so

667
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,960
gmo is a technology that people need to

668
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,440
understand in my opinion i think it has

669
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,760
a chance in the place but we just need

670
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,840
to understand how far we can go with it

671
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,840
what we can take and what we can live

672
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:02,000
for example here in zimbabwe we try to

673
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,360
carry out a bit of a survey on one of

674
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,600
our farmer uh interactive interactive

675
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,159
sessions or meetings where we put we

676
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,559
gave them a questionnaire about gmos so

677
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,120
the first question was do you like do

678
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,640
you like gmos or do you accept them then

679
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,200
everyone are saying no

680
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,720
then the next question was uh is gmo

681
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,960
technology good and everyone was saying

682
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,120
no then the third question was saying

683
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,559
what is gmo technology

684
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,720
all the answers that we were getting

685
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,000
there were wrong so what it means is

686
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,240
people don't understand what they are

687
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
saying no to so we really need to just

688
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,559
get more information so that

689
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,320
more informed decisions can be made

690
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,880
wow wendy thank you so much for

691
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,760
unpacking the the difference between gmo

692
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,760
open pollinated and hybrid and i think

693
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,200
you know we should have you back onto

694
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:52,240
the show where you could unpack what gmo

695
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:55,120
technology is because um i myself i'm

696
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,080
not vastly experienced in that space um

697
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,760
and

698
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,840
like you said with this server it just

699
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,440
shows that even us as farmers have

700
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,679
limited knowledge around us and maybe

701
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,480
just consumers because you know this is

702
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,720
how maybe shops have just been able to

703
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,039
um capitalize on the marketing adverts

704
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,200
around gmo versus non-gmo but it's

705
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,120
important that we understand why we

706
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,039
should vote for something and why we

707
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,960
should go against something you know and

708
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,200
especially at farm level how does this

709
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,080
impact a farmer on the ground because

710
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,240
again all the risk relies on the farmer

711
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,720
at the end of the day however i wish we

712
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,399
had more time um you know to unpack

713
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,080
these things and hopefully maybe we

714
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,080
could get you back onto the show once

715
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,640
again but thank you so much for also

716
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,559
just breaking the the the importance of

717
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,320
why we as farmers should have a

718
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,840
relationship with an agronomist a

719
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,679
relationship with an individual like

720
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,279
yourself to understand the various

721
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,440
varieties that can take us through

722
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,360
seasons understanding the geographic

723
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,080
locations in which we farm in and the

724
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,480
best varieties that will obviously

725
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:56,720
ensure that we meet our yield at the end

726
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,960
of the day but just before i say goodbye

727
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,919
to you wendy maybe just give us the top

728
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,480
two or three advices that you believe a

729
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,880
farmer should like look out for prior to

730
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,279
starting their season

731
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,159
prior to starting the season what i

732
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:15,039
think our farmers should really uh take

733
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,720
into account is the fact that whatever

734
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,640
they are growing do they have a market

735
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,720
for it because if you're going to be

736
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,279
establishing a crop and don't know the

737
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,039
ends the end user or where you're going

738
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,640
to be selling it it means you might end

739
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,960
up producing something that you will

740
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,279
fail to sell at one point there was a

741
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,960
farmer who did horticulture and then

742
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,640
they heard about brussels sprouts you

743
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,799
know they are very small eating cabbages

744
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,799
for a niche market and then they had a

745
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,559
friend saying no i made money with them

746
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,039
then they went on to establish about

747
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,200
half a hectare only to realize that the

748
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,480
local markets people don't understand

749
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,960
them they think they're underground

750
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,600
cabbages so you really need to make to

751
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,279
invest in understanding your markets uh

752
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,279
that's one thing that i want our farmers

753
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,679
to understand then you also need to

754
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:59,919
understand the principles of farming

755
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,640
which fit into the umbrella team good

756
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,960
economic practices that term has been

757
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,039
used extensively but i think the

758
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,039
understanding of which still needs to be

759
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,880
unpacked where a farmer needs to know

760
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,120
from the land preparation soil

761
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,760
management insect pest management it

762
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,440
goes into that so it's like a full mojo

763
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,840
that you really need to understand

764
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,440
before you start not to start saying at

765
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,960
a later stage you're starting to see

766
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,120
some issues fast in your field that's

767
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,799
when you want to come in to remove your

768
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,080
measures that would be too late so you

769
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,120
need to plan

770
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,360
planning in advance will ensure security

771
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,200
and success

772
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,520
fantastic thank you so much wendy for

773
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,480
your time and uh for your insights more

774
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:42,640
so continue to help farmers uh in your

775
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,039
regions uh whether it's working within

776
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,840
zimbabwe or south africa but trust me i

777
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,919
think this conversation uh taught a lot

778
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:52,159
of farmers something new maybe gave them

779
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,159
a refresher course you know because

780
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,600
sometimes you do tend to feel that we

781
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,080
know everything we've experienced

782
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,919
everything uh and therefore why should i

783
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,039
be seeking advice but thank you so much

784
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:05,279
for your insights and um hopefully you

785
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,840
can come back onto the show next unpack

786
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,480

thank you very much we are tasked with

790
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,559
wheat production so we really need to

791
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,399
make sure that everything goes well

792
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,799

thank you that was wendy matsura

795
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:30,240
everybody uh she's an agronomist at

796
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,720
seedco limited and we spoke about her

797
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,039
role as an agronomist agronomy uh the

798
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,720
purpose of agronomy why farmers should

799
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,640
work with agronomists especially from

800
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,799
the seed companies where they procure

801
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,559
their seeds i mean there's so much to

802
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,559
learn and unpack and have an

803
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,960
understanding in terms of what are the

804
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,600
what right seeds are best what seeds are

805
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,440
best for your for your farm are they the

806
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,360
right seeds are they the right varieties

807
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,440
that you should explore in this coming

808
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,840
season in the next and she unpacked the

809
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,480
importance of planning before a c before

810
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,559
you start a season whether you're a new

811
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,880
ancient farmer or just an experienced

812
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,120
farmer continuing with their production

813
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:09,600
because every single year we experience

814
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,279
and encounter new pests and diseases so

815
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,840
it's important to make sure that you

816
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,399
have the planning from the onset with an

817
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,000
agronomist to mitigate against those

818
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,080
pests and diseases and i like what she

819
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
said about climate change that climate

820
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,760
change has always been there climate

821
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,640
change does not necessarily mean it's

822
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:29,279
drought or we're experiencing minimal uh

823
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,960
rainfall but climate change could be

824
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,279
extreme weather conditions could be

825
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,919
extreme rainy conditions it could just

826
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:39,279
be anything that is just changing in the

827
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,919
climate within those months um something

828
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,840
different to what you were previously

829
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,559
exposed to and that is what climate

830
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:48,880
change is we can't stop it but obviously

831
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:52,080
we have to protect our farms our

832
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,240
businesses against it and mitigate

833
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,559
against those risks if you have any

834
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,640
