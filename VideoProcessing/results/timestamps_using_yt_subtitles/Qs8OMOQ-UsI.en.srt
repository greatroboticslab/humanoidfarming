1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,640
let's do something special turn on the

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,470
light 2.5 billion people can't do that

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,599
because they only have access to wood

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,260
and charcoal for lighting heating and

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,570
cooking

6
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,429
even though charcoal is necessary for

7
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,770
their existence the production methods

8
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,590
used wastes most of the wood and lead to

9
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,449
deforestation famine and pollution while

10
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,100
wind and solar energy will be wonderful

11
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:25,140
replacements for charcoal by the time

12
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,750
they can be implemented all that will be

13
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,609
left is literal ash that's where the

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,619
clean and efficient charcoal kiln comes

15
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,420
in by recycling the pollutants as fuel

16
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,250
and improving the overall efficiency of

17
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,079
the production methods the amount of

18
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:39,210
wood or plant matter needed to make

19
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,340
charcoal and the pollution Jerr aid will

20
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,340
be significantly reduced thanks to its

21
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,320
simple continuous process design this

22
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,000
kiln will be easy to build easy to

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,399
maintain simple to operate and

24
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,020
inexpensive to manufacture by

25
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,390
implementing this method we will reduce

26
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:58,730
pollution and deforestation while

27
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,730
improving the lives of the impoverished
