1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,860
scientists have figured out the best and

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,960
healthiest way to produce plants

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,000
it is a cutting-edge grafting technique

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,519
that was enhanced over conventional

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,080
procedures and published in a nature

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,940
Science magazine

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,580
grafting is when you take the root of

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,980
one plant and attach it to the Chute of

9
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,619
another plant people have been doing

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,019
this for a long time to help apple and

11
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,720
citrus trees grow better and stay

12
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,760
healthy but there was one type of plant

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,640
that they thought they couldn't graft

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,719
they're called monocotyledons or monocot

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,180
plants

16
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,180
that's a fancy name for plants like

17
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,000
bananas date palms and grasses like

18
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,860
wheat and oats but a scientist named

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,200
Julian Hibbard from the University of

20
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,020
Cambridge and his team found a way to do

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,420
it they transplanted unique tissue from

22
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,800
a plant's seeds onto two plants of the

23
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,680
same species

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,899
the two plants grew together as one

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,239
plant as a result of this

26
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,399
to ensure that the roots and stem were

27
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,180
interconnected and could share food and

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:08,100
water they even utilized special lights

29
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,140
the new grafting method worked on a lot

30
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,979
of different types of monocot plants

31
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:17,340
like bananas pineapple onions and even

32
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,380
tequila agave the scientists also tried

33
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,299
grafting a wheat plant to an old plant

34
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,939
which could protect the wheat from

35
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,860
getting sick this new way of grafting

36
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,720
could be especially helpful for a

37
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,220
special type of banana called the

38
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,619
Cavendish banana

39
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:35,100
most of the bananas we eat are Cavendish

40
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:37,680
bananas but they can't grow from seeds

41
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,439
Farmers must continually reproduce the

42
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,299
same plant because bananas are unable to

43
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,420
Bear children on their own

44
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,220
this uniformizes the bananas which is

45
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,759
undesirable because if one banana

46
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,560
becomes ill they could all become sick a

47
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,619
banana plant can be shielded against

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,619
ailments like Panama Disease by grafting

49
00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:00,780
a more resilient plant onto it but if we

50
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,119
graft the Cavendish bananas to healthy

51
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,759
root stocks the bananas will be able to

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,659
avoid getting Panama disease and stay

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,000
healthy

54
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,979
that's all for today guys

55
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,680
I hope you learned something new about

56
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,140
Innovative grafting technique and how it

57
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,120
can help plants stay healthy don't
