10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,960
imagine you are in a meeting at an

11
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,200
office building

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,039
your boss is speaking about next week's

project

14
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:56,079
then everyone takes a break for lunch

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,520
but you do not go to a restaurant or

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,520
instead

18
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,760
you exit the room

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,799
inside the walls of the building are

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,360
thousands of plants

some produce salad greens

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,080
you grab a small plate

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:25,040
go to the wall

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:30,000
and pick the ingredients for your lunch

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,840

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:24,720
it is not the first vertical farm

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,280
vertical farming is already happening in

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,120
some countries

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,160
the country with the most vertical farms

is the united states

46
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,280

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,200
countries

is one of the biggest planned projects

60
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,120
the jammu tower will be a tall glass

62
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:24,400
it will be 51 stories tall

63
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,400
it was designed to have offices and

64
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,879
apartments

65
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:34,560
but it is also designed to grow plants

66
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:38,480
each window will be filled with them

67
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:43,599

but

80
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:29,919
people can also rent rooms there

81
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:34,479
each person living in the jianmu tower

82
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,479
will have their own garden

83
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:42,240
but these are not just any gardens

84
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,400
they are vertical gardens

85
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,479
and the whole tower is one big vertical

86
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,360
farm

87
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,240
vertical farms are different than

88
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,600
traditional farms

89
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,080
traditional farms need soil to help

90
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,360
plants grow

91
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,840
but vertical farms use methods like

92
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,280
hydroponics

93
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,560
these methods give water and nutrients

94
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,560
to the plants directly

95
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,560
they do not need soil

96
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,680
vertical farming also lets farmers put

97
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,160
plants anywhere

98
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,720
in a vertical farm

99
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:34,240
farmers hang plants above and beside

100
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:38,320
each other on a wall

101
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:41,680
sometimes they use special lights to

102
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:45,360
help the plants grow

103
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:49,199
others like the john moo tower

104
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,400
hang plants by windows

105
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:56,800
the tower is so high

106
00:05:52,400 --> 00:06:02,000
the plants get plenty of sun

107
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:05,520
doing this also has another benefit

108
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,440
when plants take in sunlight

109
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:13,360
they also take in heat

110
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,880
this helps control the climate in the

111
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,240
tower

112
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:24,720
so the tower will use less energy

113
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:28,080
vertical farms can be very efficient

114
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,720
traditional farms can only grow food at

115
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,400
some times of the year

116
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,319
but vertical farms can grow plants all

117
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,720
year

118
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:44,800
some vertical farms trap rain water

119
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,759
they can recycle the water they use

120
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,960
so droughts or reduced rain

121
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,720
do not affect the farms

122
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,120
the jiam mu tower will even get moisture

123
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,720
from the air

124
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,960
but vertical farms are a very good use

125
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,599
of space

126
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,479
they use far less land than a

127
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,520
traditional farm

129

he told spectrum news

131
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:24,000
with the area of growing

132
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,440
you usually expand out

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,160
but with this

134
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:32,080
you are expanding up

135
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:35,759
you use less water and land

136
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:41,360
and you create less waste

137
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:42,599
it is a more sustainable way to farm

138
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,319
today

139
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:50,240
environmental experts encourage people

140
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,680
to use land efficiently

141
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:58,479
they want people to use natural

142
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:02,479
resources in the best way possible with

143
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:06,000
the least amount of waste

144
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:10,840
land efficiency will be especially

145
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:15,199
important as the world's population

146
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:19,599
grows dixon de palmier is a former

147
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:24,080
professor at columbia university

148
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:26,000
he invented the modern idea of vertical

149
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,560
farming

150
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,680
he talked to the website big think

151
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,680
we expect the human population to

152
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,120
increase

153
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:42,479
so over the next 40 years

154
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,240
you might have three billion more people

155
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,760
to feed

156
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:51,120
and you look around for the land

157
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,360
where that food will come from

158
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,839
and you do not find it

159
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:59,360
it is not there

160
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,120
so the biggest problem facing the global

161
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,839
population

162
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,440
is

163
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:08,800
where will the food for the next three

164
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:12,480
billion people come from

165
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,760
so it could come from some place other

166
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,920
than a traditional farm

167
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,480
the question is

168
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,600
could vertical farms

169
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,040
solve that problem

170
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,040
efficient use of space is important for

171
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,800
another reason

172
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,720
it helps fight climate change

173
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,399
according to the world health

174
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,600
organization

175
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,360
over 50 percent of the world lives in

176
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,399
cities

177
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,920
but most of our food does not come from

178
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,440
cities

179
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:53,200
it comes from the country

180
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:57,279
this means that people living in cities

181
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:00,880
must ship food into the city

182
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:04,160
the food must come from even farther if

183
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:08,079
it is not in season

184
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:11,279
some fruits like avocados can travel for

185
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,959
thousands of miles before people buy

186
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,640
them

187
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:19,399
this uses a lot of fuel

188
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:23,279
food producers must also use

189
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:26,640
preservatives to keep the food fresh

190
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:32,120
this damages the environment

191
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:32,120
it also adds to climate change

192
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,760
vertical farming might help reduce these

193
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:45,360
problems

194
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:49,279
a traditional farm cannot fit in a city

195
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:53,920
but a vertical farm can

196
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:56,560
the john mu tower shows that even if you

197
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:01,839
live in the city

198
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:07,200
there can be a farm in your home

199
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:11,600
much of the food people eat in the tower

200
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:15,680
will come from the tower itself

201
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,200
they will not have to go anywhere to get

202
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,279
it

203
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,120
they will not have to ship as much food

204
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,880
in

205
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:30,640
and the food will be grown without

206
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:34,320
pesticides or preservatives

207
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:38,079
it will be better for the people

208
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:41,680
and the environment

209
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:45,360
vertical farming can even help in places

210
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:48,090
where people cannot grow food

211
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,200
fukushima is a city in japan

212
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:53,600
[Music]

213
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:58,000
it once had several nuclear power plants

214
00:11:53,600 --> 00:12:01,839
in 2011 there was a big earthquake

215
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,279
the earthquake caused a tsunami

216
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:07,760
this huge wave hit japan and caused

217
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,800
terrible damage

218
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,560
the power plants in fukushima melted

219
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,120
down

220
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,440
this contaminated the area with

221
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,760
radiation

222
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,639
people could not go there without

223
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,519
getting very sick

224
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,420
people in japan were very scared of the

225
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,839
radiation

226
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,560
[Music]

227
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,920
they did not want to eat food grown

228
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,800
anywhere near fukushima

229
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,639
so the government funded vertical

230
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,360
farming

231
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,839
these new farms were safer than

232
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:47,279
traditional ones

233
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:51,639
they allowed people to have fresh food

234
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,639
without fear of radiation

235
00:12:53,519 --> 00:13:00,880
vertical farming is not a perfect

236
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:05,440
solution to these problems

237
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:09,200
a vertical farm can cost a lot of money

238
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:13,519
to build and run

239
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,120
some vertical farms use lights to grow

240
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,240
plants

241
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:21,200
they also keep their plants in

242
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:25,200
controlled climates

243
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:29,920
this uses a lot of energy

244
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:32,839
it can even lead to more pollution

245
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,320
making climate change

246
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:39,680
worse but many people believe that they

247
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,959
can overcome these problems

248
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:45,360
they believe buildings like jammu tower

249
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,800
will help

250
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:53,040
carlo rati even believes that buildings

251
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:55,040
like this are the future of cities

252
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,720
he writes

253
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,839
this approach will be a big part of the

254
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:05,279
design of future

255
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:07,760
cities it is an answer to one of today's

256
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,279
most difficult building design

257
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,639
challenges

258
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,920
that is

259
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:17,399
how do we bring the natural world into

260
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,399
building design

261
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,959
would you live in a place like the john

262
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,199
