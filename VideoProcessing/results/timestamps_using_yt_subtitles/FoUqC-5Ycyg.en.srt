00:00:07,709 --> 00:00:16,200
thanks Nate to cut the glass let's go

2
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:16,200
hey guys want talk they're good tire

3
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,189
obviously on this tire so in this video

4
00:00:25,089 --> 00:00:29,470
I am gonna show you how to remove the

5
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:31,960
who you'll find a pump jar find it all

6
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:47,859
and hopefully patch it and get it

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:49,809
working as good as new guy he's not I

8
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:50,980
got the wheel off of the tractor the

9
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:52,510
first thing you need to do is obviously

10
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:55,000
Jack the tractor up somehow

11
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,010
this is why I do I usually just tilted

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,760
on its axis fairly and it's just a

13
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:02,219
minefield tractor push up the side rest

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,689
against something in the back there and

15
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,990
you know a couple of steadies underneath

16
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:10,630
and that we even get this wheel off okay

17
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:13,000
so on most lawn tractors you just saw a

18
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:16,540
plastic cup over the hop here so simply

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,890
a first cause option is cooler off she

20
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:24,360
just prized off okay so in this case all

21
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:27,070
we have here is the here's the axle is

22
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,280
retaining clip and that water so all we

23
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:32,049
need to do is just forced us quite out

24
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,840
so we're using something like a a small

25
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:39,659
screwdriver like this

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:42,079
just leave a lot and push it over and do

27
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,280
a boozer like i just off there

28
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,439
once you do that take the wash it off

29
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,090
and that we all can then be way Koval

30
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,310
hopefully yeah you may find that yours

31
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,929
use me of our attaining not you know

32
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,100
it's just a normal mop on there or it

33
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:54,899
may have a split pen

34
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,500
realize you were just off to you know

35
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:01,679
remove this poppin similar situation and

36
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,600
and just get the wheel off okay so it

37
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:12,810
should just be a simple case of sorry

38
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:13,860
jiggling the wheel off so just okay it's

39
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,900
obviously the first thing you need to do

40
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,690
is a complete tie up so you can either

41
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,549
use our compressor or in this case I'm

42
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,799
just use my my basic or pump yeah that's

43
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:30,360
perfectly adequate for a track that they

44
00:02:22,799 --> 00:02:32,310
are so come pop okay so obviously get

45
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,379
adopt a substantial pressure to where

46
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,440
the air walking over the wall there's

47
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:39,569
opposite hällnäs tear somewhere so we'll

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,910
get up to pressure and although it's the

49
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:43,500
move the next stage okay so what we want

50
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,079
to do now is we need to get some sort of

51
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,260
solution soapy solution so all I've got

52
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:52,139
years on old just a little spraying off

53
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:54,750
our flasher many like household it sort

54
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:58,590
of displease that you get or you can buy

55
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,810
one you know bonito ever um a little

56
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,480
water in it and quite a lot of air

57
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,880
philia liquid or you know any sort of

58
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:07,620
detail gent and what what I do is just

59
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,319
spray it all over the tire and just to

60
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,739
see where we can see the leaking so it's

61
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,329
basically a homemade leak detector will

62
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,130
spit all over the tire and then

63
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:19,620
hopefully you'll see the air bubbles

64
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:23,639
come out and then out that way we'll be

65
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,889
able to find a leak so just you know

66
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:29,359
don't hang about just spray a lot a lot

67
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:29,359
of this on keeps fill in the tail

68
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:37,069
so you should soon see the week you know

69
00:03:35,629 --> 00:04:00,720
yes

70
00:03:37,069 --> 00:04:08,180
he says yeah see you there commas

71
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:08,180
picking up see the bubbles there

72
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,199
[Music]

73
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,500
so that's what you're looking for you're

74
00:04:20,139 --> 00:04:29,680
looking for our you know obvious escape

75
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:31,870
of here and then the tire see you there

76
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,009
okay so again just clear it quickly see

77
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:37,630
the big bubble here but we'll check

78
00:04:33,009 --> 00:04:38,050
again see familiar souvenir that's the

79
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,150
idea

80
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,590
so keep my eye on it what I'm gonna do

81
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:51,490
is dry this off in the market with a

82
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:54,990
marker that was marked at the seahorse

83
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,990
of just mark a couple of white marks

84
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,789
yeah see the hole there that took my

85
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:05,860
finger yes it was a tool kit here the

86
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:07,840
repair kit yeah they're all type 2 here

87
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,490
which he just pierced through the hole

88
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,789
and just got a robbed and that cleans

89
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:16,840
the area we've got two here whoever

90
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:18,789
thread through the actual plugs these

91
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,830
are the clothes that affect fillets are

92
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:22,660
rubber strips yeah I was I'm sorry glee

93
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,840
alright good in the inside I thought it

94
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:28,449
was a rubber off string or something

95
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:30,639
effectively they thread to do this to

96
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:32,320
you force it through the tire and then

97
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,289
pull us over and it leaves it the plug

98
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,880
and then you turn off and that's that's

99
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:39,159
effect where I'll show you how we did I

100
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,380
know okay so what you want to do firstly

101
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:43,360
I want to get this draw tool obviously

102
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,039
will establish where the hallways so

103
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,590
what do is just stab the stroll through

104
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,419
the hole and just you know pool and I

105
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,909
notice they sort of fail the area

106
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:56,639
unclean the area so now maybe saw me out

107
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:56,639
comes open we do that spot so just

108
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:06,509
get it and twist that who out quickly

109
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,509
[Music]

110
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,370
and again pull it out and just repeat

111
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,870
this process you know five or six times

112
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:18,340
they've got a nice clear haul hoping you

113
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:22,750
got close up here's a handle here's a

114
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:25,080
tool go in there and see that stick out

115
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,080
slowly

116
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:37,070
[Music]

117
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:38,900
so effectively failing the all okay so I

118
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:42,970
do know is the move when he steps on

119
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,970
this packaging I saw just pull this out

120
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:52,010
no we need to do is just thread this

121
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:53,650
through this eyelet here you see this

122
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:57,430
ila

123
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,430
just thread this through

124
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:08,360
it's pretty tough courses quick sake

125
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:12,270
usually robbery so it's really Stefano

126
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:16,560
let's get it roughly halfway okay so how

127
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:18,090
this works is top edge of the eye it's

128
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,110
obviously sealed so that allows you to

129
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:24,690
force down into the tire but the top

130
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:28,380
edge of the eyelet if you can see it's

131
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:31,010
not joined so once you give that plug

132
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:34,800
into the tire and pull forcefully back

133
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:36,750
you know and the tool we are this

134
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,470
obviously is opening and wheeshes a tool

135
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,940
but leaves the plug in the tire and all

136
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:45,360
them and see that and they're not so

137
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,580
faithfully it trim the plug pump it up

138
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,620
check for leaks

139
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,720
and that should be us demonstrate that

140
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,430
no here's what we're gonna do we're

141
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:55,380
gonna this is just the droll oh just

142
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:58,110
mark them with a Wohlers so we're gonna

143
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:01,050
take this out and we're gonna twist this

144
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:03,900
end a short distance and then yank it

145
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:06,230
out quickly I wasn't sure you know take

146
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,230
this out

147
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:17,539
[Music]

148
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:19,809
finger wall with us push your hand will

149
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:23,929
go if you can see that it's probably I

150
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:25,639
don't know halfway in and then we need

151
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:31,489
to do is just yank there so forcefully

152
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:35,449
and quickly like that well that leaves

153
00:08:31,489 --> 00:08:39,459
your with is using the plug stock and

154
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:41,569
the wall I'm associate marked that mark

155
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:45,620
that's what we need to do you know it

156
00:08:41,569 --> 00:08:48,680
was just trim knees all the little off

157
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,930
the tread wear with our craft knife and

158
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,209
we'll probably take it up again spray it

159
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:56,389
with solution and just make sure the

160
00:08:53,209 --> 00:08:59,600
week's gone okay so just got one of

161
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:01,339
these craft knifes what do you know is

162
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,720
just trim these off hopefully when

163
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:05,269
you're doing this these nurseries are

164
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,730
sharp so don't there / they tell you

165
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:09,529
again and we'll be back to square one

166
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,269
but all I'm doing here is this I've got

167
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:15,670
I just bore the tread hold on the one

168
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:15,670
end of the clog and just gently

169
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,310
so just gently cough just pumped up

170
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:31,660
yeah we'll just split some solution I

171
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:33,850
know yeah and see it's totally sealed

172
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:46,400
[Music]

173
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:48,500
look it's a puncture fixed I'll get this

174
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,990
up to pleasure and we'll get the wheel

175
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:57,350
back on one more okay look wheels off

176
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:58,310
just use all that grease er doesn't

177
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:00,020
bother you don't have any of it

178
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:04,720
I'm just doing it because it feels off

179
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:04,720
and then simply set the wheel back on

180
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:13,070
okay sobs they want to get the wheel

181
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:16,880
back on washer on start clip in the

182
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:19,660
groove these up here I walk on pliers to

183
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,660
