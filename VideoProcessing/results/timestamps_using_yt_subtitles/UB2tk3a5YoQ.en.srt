1
00:00:05,509 --> 00:00:10,760
we're now almost one week after we

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,429
seated and behind me we've got a field

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,459
that's

4
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:18,160
and even to say the least now one

5
00:00:15,459 --> 00:00:21,640
possible reason it could be uneven is

6
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,039
rats we do have a rat population here at

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:27,550
Erie I've got dr. grant singleton with

8
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:30,390
me who specializes in rats to tell us a

9
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,610
little bit more about our rats indirect

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:37,180
there I'm also thinking over here

11
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:42,370
looking around here there's an area with

12
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:44,799
a rat fence Oh to our to my left and now

13
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,390
that that can be good because if you do

14
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:49,150
have a rat problem last year there was a

15
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,040
rat problem just here it's good to have

16
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:53,559
what we call a trap crop where you plant

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,260
an area early about two to three weeks

18
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:58,989
early and then have traps with more will

19
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:01,600
capture traps entrances like this or the

20
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:04,449
rest they'll go in but can't get back

21
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,270
out again the other thing is yeah

22
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:12,130
where and when should you conduct direct

23
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:13,990
control the when is now because the main

24
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:17,140
we know from the breeding ecology of

25
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,490
rats for every female rat that to remove

26
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:20,520
at this time of the season it's

27
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:23,020
equivalent to removing about sixty rats

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,500
come the ripening stage of the crop

29
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,780
particularly after the fellow period the

30
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,610
rats there's a big disturbance during a

31
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:32,920
fallow period and the working of the

32
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,540
soil so the rats then get move out get

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,760
moved to the edges and they aggregate

34
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,370
and that's the best time to manage them

35
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:43,270
and so along these areas where there's

36
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:46,270
cover also here in the missus farm you

37
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,950
have irrigation canals underneath and so

38
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,799
the entrances of those canals because

39
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:52,950
they're good habitats for rats as well

40
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:56,009
so they need cover and they need areas

41
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:59,100
are not being disturbed now we have here

42
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:02,729
trap either rat and trapping is is used

43
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:04,350
often when I talk to farmers and will

44
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:06,299
show that they will enter into the trap

45
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,090
here and he will force his way through

46
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,400
and the right thing yeah trap is big but

47
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,080
see how they sort of crunch down and

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,480
rats can do that as well the only thing

49
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,640
that limits our rat so they can

50
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,890
dissipate their shoulder shoulder its

51
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:22,049
width of their head which indicates as

52
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,630
though how big the hole is they can get

53
00:02:22,049 --> 00:02:26,730
in and with a mouse and push your finger

54
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,890
in a mouse and get into a hole we're a

55
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,890
rat it's more sort of a probably of a

56
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:34,319
large thumb so it's usually about 12

57
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,090
millimeters if you got a hole bigger

58
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,920
than that then the rats can get through

59
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,750
and so often you know you don't need a

60
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,190
very big opening here the rats will

61
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,250
force their way through hey when we

62
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:46,920
first seeded I came and I were most

63
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,079
concerned about rats what we didn't

64
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,730
think about was birds what do we know

65
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:53,280
about birds and their interactions with

66
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:55,109
suited rise in agricultural system there

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,500
were two approaches one is they will

68
00:02:55,109 --> 00:03:00,780
will spread something to feed the

69
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:03,600
animals just prior to the crop coming to

70
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:07,170
the stage of seed the other approaches

71
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,450
is is going more here in the Philippines

72
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:12,150
and elsewhere in Asia often its is using

73
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:16,470
of what you've got here the flags to

74
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:18,269
this caused a bit of disturbance not by

75
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,380
the hedge scene not far from here where

76
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:21,329
they have they're all like a little

77
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:23,549
windmill the little ratchet on it making

78
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:25,970
a noise and that's to persecute the

79
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:29,700
birds away as well so it's looking at at

80
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:32,880
noise as a deterrent but really we don't

81
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:35,099
know much at all about the bird problem

82
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,720
and again one of the big questions is

83
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:39,840
where are they breeding were they

84
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,340
aggregating and tried to see if we can

85
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,120
prevent the problem before it does

86
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,120
escalate
