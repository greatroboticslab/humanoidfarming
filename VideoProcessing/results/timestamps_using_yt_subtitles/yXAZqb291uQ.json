  "text": "hey folks it's Josh Danny rich farmer welcome to the farm blog today got my best kid helper here she's filling buckets of water we're gonna go up and what are the goats and check on them got a few chores to get done here around the house I've got to put a light on my gate so when folks pull up to my gate I have a power gate that's powered with a mighty Mill gate opener and I really like it but the biggest thing is we can hit the button from the house up here but you can't tell whether the gates moving or not after dark so what we're gonna do is we're gonna install a motion light on it and you guys might have seen the video where I installed some motion lights on the house back here and they turned out to be really really good so come on along with just do some chores here we've got to work on the rock wall behind the house got to pick up loads of rocks and sticks and also we still got the Stoney Ridge farm shirts for a limited time mrs. Stoney Ridge is modeling one you'll see them in the video so if you want to get a shirts for a limited time only there'll be links down in the video description or you can go onto bonfire comm and search the word Stoney and you'll be able to find them so let's go have some fun all right [Music] so first let's give you a little update on the lights okay so I'll put some lights here on the house and now I'm in between my house and my garage and I'll put these lights they're called litem lights home brand Li t om they really worked well I liked them a lot I put them all the way around the house there's a couple up there it's really bright you probably can't see them and I really liked them a whole lot they really did a good job and the company actually saw that I installed those lights and they said Stoney Ridge farmer we've got a newer version of that light we'd like to send it to you and let you show it on the vlog so here's the newer version I I've got the box with all the specs on it but this is the light that we're gonna put on the gate and we're gonna put one down here on this sign that I have posted that says smile your own camera that way when people pull down my road that thing lights up and they're like maybe maybe I shouldn't be here get all the water's ready they're ready somebody nice-looking shirt you got there thank you self-promotion it's not nice it's not a nice thing to do on YouTube everybody hates that Josh so pretty out right now so beautiful we got some new rock put down on our road up to the goats and it looks very nice very nice got a baby goat to catch and we get to watch miss the Stoney Ridge catching ready ready to catch him better and I think he's a little calmer poor little bit don't have any top two goats only have bottom teeth the bigger issue we have here guys is we have too many goats in too small an area and it's taxing on the goats its taxing on us and we need to sell some goats so if any of you guys are local and you're interested in buying some goats we're gonna sell off probably four or five six of them something like that because I think we're at about 20 goats right now we just don't need that many goats so we've got the ladder all loaded up in the back here we're gonna go down to the gate and we're gonna install this light right here so while the gates closed in here here's the product that I'm installing it's the light tom 30 LED motion light this is what it looks like pretty pretty neat little design there so I'll post a link down below if you want to get some for yourself the other ones work great I haven't used these yet so I'll be honest with you I don't know exactly how they're gonna work but I know they're really bright because we use them in the living room as motion lights when we walk through the living room at night and it worked really good let's get busy so the challenge here is to mount this light somewhere on the back of this wooden sign because I don't want to screw it into my metal gate this thing will light up and let us know hey I hit the button I'm up at the house I hit the button and the gate started moving because the light came on and I'll know trying to figure out the smartest way to mount this thing so if you look it's just a little loop a little hook right there and the screw is right here and it just hangs OH that screw pretty simple we'll see they're not to be perfect just needs to be perfect timber dropping screws in the driveway is not a good thing okay well we got to turn it on here's how you turn it on little button right there find that sweet spot there we go so since it's on a moving target I want to make sure it's nice and secure you know a moving target meaning the gate moves all the time a mounting system on this is really really really simple and I guess if you're mounting it up to the side of your house it would be just fine or a tree which is what we're gonna do next I'll worry about it shaking loose and getting on my nerves and not being level and not being pretty right I think that'll work so we'll try it out tonight I don't know if I'll try it out on camera tonight but we'll let you know in the future vlog how it's doing I think it'll do just fine so when you live in a country like this we don't have a lot of neighbors and people used to come down here and park so before all the trees were gone right here people would come down here and park and do things that they shouldn't be doing and you know people still ride down here from time to time that aren't welcome so having some lights it's probably the best security measure you could ever do around your house or around your farm or anywhere having lights when those lights come on criminals they don't stick around so right here's my fairly threatening smile you're on camera sign if you guys didn't know it Amazon's got a plethora I would say a plethora of signs like this that are just threatening to keep people off your property signs it's a closed-circuit camera system all sorts of stuff and we've also got some cameras up here if you can see them let's see right there yeah so we've got some cameras up here we keep track of everything that goes in the road and out of the road so if you come down here on my property and something comes up missing I got your license plate but that's it so let's back up to this tree I'm just gonna back the Gator right up to it good thing about John Deere Gator has this plastic bed which you know plastic bed wouldn't really sound too appealing but I can bump into something with it and not dent it so that's kind of nice we're gonna bump right into that tree here we go so for this next light install we're gonna use a deck screw a nice heavy-duty deck screw they'll just hang up there just like that pretty simple beauty cool just that simple just that simple to install super awesome I don't illuminate that sign right there we got the sign kind of flopping loose of this tree can grow a little bit and I also left a little bit of room for tree growth on that screw I left it hanging out a little bit further got my own little department of homeland security here I think about living out here in the country like this is when seconds count the cops get here in minutes we got to pretty much defend ourselves and take care of ourselves out here beautiful beautiful day today guys the grass that we planted in the fall is coming up so pretty look at this look at that what a great stand of grass we did all the right things the only thing we could have done differently is the soil is really acidic here so we probably could have put a little bit of lime down but once the soil gets compacted a little bit we'll be able to bring a big lime truck in here will spread lime probably three tons to the acre maybe even four tons of lime to the acre this is what you call a lead in a lead into tomorrow's vlog so I've got two more loads of gravel coming out I had five loads brought out and this is the result of the gravel truck I'll get the drone out and I'll show you a little bit of tractor work here on the driveway and give you a little bit of driveway science if you want to know a little bit about how to maintain and keep a nice driveway so 32 more tons of rock brought out tomorrow and I want to expand this a little bit as you can tell I've got a lot of vehicles I want to be able to come through here with a big ol trailer and turn around and not have any trouble last hole I'm gonna drill my dogs are out here eating deer turds like grazing on deer turds right now I think the puppy loves to poop on the porch at night so we keep them up on the porch at night since my dogs ate my neighbor's cat we keep them up on the porch at night and I just totally look forward to cleaning up doggie diarrhea later on because they're 20-something deer every night in this field and they're out there the dogs are out there grazing on deer poo here's your farm reality right there dogs grazing on here you know it's not a good job unless you're bleeding when you get done so hopefully I have some blood drawn here in a minute oh well piece of heaven right there you got my light these lights are so small I can put them in our pocket really nice then a little bit loose tighten it back up a little bit nice nicely done the solar panels are right here this is Wes this is south so I want to get just enough Sun and then when I walk in here to access my tractor and everything like that I'll be able to see so we're gonna do another one just like this on the other side that's it we give you an example of what it looks like lit so that's the light that's how much light this thing puts out I think it's 30 LED lights in there very nice danger bush hog danger right there that thing was sticking out of the ground yeah if you go to clear land this is the kind of stuff that you're gonna be finding when you clear your land people just use any old gully as just a dumping ground and cinder block pieces Pepsi is that Pepsi free this is what you find just garbage so there's a lot of garbage out of here it's a shame back in the day people didn't go to the dump and people didn't have trash service they had a hole that's what they did they threw it in there some of you folks remember grandma's old hole we used to throw all the trash in post me a comment down there she's picking up the heaviest biggest rock she can find tell her to get the little ones and I'll get the big ones synlawn listen she's not listening stubborn springtime's here we're gonna start planting soon so look forward to that getting our garden veggies all planted up in the house you know getting them started and then come about April 20th is when we'll put them in the ground that's probably the last frost date that we'll have up here and that'll be cool and we'll get some things going guys don't forget I've got starting Ridge Farm shirts they're here for a limited time only I think they're only available for 15 more days or maybe 12 more days jump on it get your shirt if you want one if you don't want one don't worry about it alright thanks a lot guys come on back and see us here on the farm sure enjoyed having you we'll see you next time all right bring-bring [Music] here at sweet add some way supposed to be snow Tyrion [Music] thanks a lot for watching this today
