1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:08,080
right there so what are we seeing

2
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:11,679
there imagine if this could be a plant

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,880
growing healthy like that in a

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,119
container imagine if you could enjoy

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:20,240
your fresh vegetables grown directly in

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,800
containers instead of a small backyard

7
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,119
garden so welcome to the

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,519
channel as we're going to

9
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,720
start there's that subscribe button

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:32,759
which is found somewhere at the bottom

11
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,079
of the video of your screen consider

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,840
subscribing so that you you keep on

13
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:41,320
getting useful information from back

14
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,600
gardening so what are we seeing

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:47,239
here this is a kale

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,760
plant not

17
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:55,000
planted directly in the garden but

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,760
instead planted in a

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,960
container so yes your kale plants can

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,079
survive very well in containers as you

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,040
you can see

22
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,680
here and this

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:12,159
kale was planted some time back it has

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:16,360
taken about 2 3 months now it is of this

25
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,240
size and if you consider the size of the

26
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:22,479
leaves and

27
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,280
consider the size of the leaves of the

28
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,759
kale plants glowing in the garden are

29
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,799
they any

30
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,119
different you can see that these ones

31
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,159
are even slightly

32
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,280
bigger but still from a kale plant grown

33
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,799
in

34
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,880
containers so it is possible to actually

35
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,320
propagate your kale plants fully in

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,600
containers so that you continue enjoying

37
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,880
your favorite vegetables if this is your

38
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,960
favorite vegetable for me it is my

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:55,360
favorite vegetable because I like so

40
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,119
much and I have to find several ways of

41
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,840
propagating as much as possible of this

42
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:01,840
vegetable which we call a

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,520
KS so this

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,360
container of course it's of average size

45
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,480
you don't need a very large container to

46
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,560
propagate your kale plants at Home in

47
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,120
your

48
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,280
backyard an average size of container

49
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,280
like this one can give you around two

50
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,280
plants per container but in this case I

51
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,080
just planted one plant and then the

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,440
other one was transplanted there later

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,360
to see how it will Thrive and as you can

54
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,760
see the effect of the shade

55
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,160
of this bigger plant on that other small

56
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:38,080
one has been uh very detrimental that

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,440
other smaller plant is not thriving very

58
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,480
well because of the fact that this other

59
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,400
bigger plant here was having a lot of

60
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,280
shade or was putting a lot of shade

61
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,920
beneath it and therefore the smaller

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,400
plant was not getting adequate amounts

63
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,239
of sunlight or light to facilitate the

64
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,080
process of photosynthesis within it

65
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,040
so in case you don't have enough land to

66
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,760
do a backyard

67
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,560
garden it's also possible that you do

68
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,680
container gardening just in your

69
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,280
backyard so that you grow your own

70
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,680
vegetables the way I've demonstrated

71
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:20,000
with this uh kale plant growing in a

72
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,319
container and of course remember for me

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,879
I always uh try as much as possible to

74
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,799
go organic so no chemical fertilizer

75
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,599
used here no insecticide no pesticide

76
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:34,000
used on this plant it's

77
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:37,239
organic with enough organic

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,959
manure incorporated into the soil to

79
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:42,319
ensure that the kale plant actually gets

80
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:46,319
all the nutrients it

81
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,840
needs from the soil where it's growing

82
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,000
within this

83
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,319
container what are some of the benefits

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,680
of uh propagating your plants within

85
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:59,079
containers one of the biggest benefits

86
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,560
is that you can actually move your

87
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:03,760
container around in case you want to

88
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,200
change the location of the container

89
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,159
from an area maybe which is not

90
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,120
receiving enough sunshine to another

91
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:11,120
area which is receiving enough direct

92
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,000
sunshine it's possible to move your

93
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,000
containers around within your

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,000
backyard and then the amount of water

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,479
that you need to uh irrigate your

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,120
containers is also not much because much

97
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:27,199
of that water will be retained within

98
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,280
the soil and some of it of course will

99
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,479
sip through to the bottom of the

100
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,919
container

101
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,120
where you have perforated holes to

102
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,759
ensure enough enough thorough drainage

103
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,160
through the soil within your

104
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,600
container and another big Advantage is

105
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,160
that uh management of pasts and diseases

106
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,800
is also very easy when you propagate uh

107
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:51,000
your vegetables within

108
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,520
containers it's not like in the garden

109
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,440
where the past could actually crawl

110
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,840
through from one plant onto another

111
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,199
easily with containers it's easier to

112
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,360
inspect the each of the plants and

113
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,039
then carry out past and disease

114
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,560
management practices because you usually

115
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,800
not have so many uh containers of

116
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,080
vegetables in your backet but just a few

117
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,639
to ensure that you have enough supply

118
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:20,880
for yourself and maybe possibly for your

119
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,759
family then another Advantage is that

120
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,280
each of the containers that you are

121
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:28,240
going to use it's possible to propagate

122
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,680
a number of plants within each of the

123
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:35,160
containers as long as as you time them

124
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,199
adequately remember if the plant grows

125
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,720
big and then you transplant another

126
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,840
plant onto that same container then the

127
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,160
shedding or the putting of The Shed from

128
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,560
that bigger plant onto the newly

129
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,440
transplanted plant on the container will

130
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,639
be quite detrimental and therefore it's

131
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,960
good that you transplant all plants onto

132
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,680
a a particular container at the same

133
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,440
time so that they grow at the same rate

134
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,639
and therefore they don't have uh that

135
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:06,360
competing factor for Sunshine once one

136
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,120
of the plants actually becomes bigger

137
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,960
than the other

138
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,560
one so those are some of the advantages

139
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,560
of actually propagating your vegetables

140
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,400
within containers in your backyard and

141
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,000
if you consider a small space like this

142
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:24,800
if I arrange like uh five containers or

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,840
even up to 10 containers those will be

144
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,400
enough containers to carry my vegetables

145
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:33,800
for consumption just locally as compared

146
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,319
to that Garden there where have planted

147
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,280
so much of vegetables actually those are

148
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,160
in excess to a good extent because I

149
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,800
usually share them with my neighbors

150
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,360
here but then if it's just for your own

151
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,360
consumption uh a few containers maybe

152
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,440
about 10 or about 8 to 10 sometimes even

153
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,319
up to 15 whichever the number that you

154
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,919
like can be suitable for you to

155
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:58,280
propagate enough vegetables for your own

156
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:01,639
consumption so it's not only KS which

157
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:04,560
can survive in container as shown here

158
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:07,599
you can try with any other plant that

159
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,280
you are so much um interested in or your

160
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,840
favorite plant that you may be

161
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,599
interested in

162
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,440
and within the comment section uh give

163
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:21,639
me uh mention of uh the plants which you

164
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,160
may have tried propagating in containers

165
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:25,520
or which you are currently propagating

166
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,160
in containers or which you may be

167
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,560
interested in trying to propagate in

168
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,879
containers so that we continue giving

169
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:36,120
each other tips on some of the practices

170
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,560
of growing plants within your backyard

171
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:41,319
for your own consumption and sometimes

172
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,000
even you can supply some of the excess

173
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:47,199
to the local market if it's within reach

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,840
or you can even Supply some to your

175
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,840
neighbors if they also consume the same

176
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:57,840
vegetables or same plants like you

177
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,120
do so give me a mention of uh your

178
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,639
favorite plants which you may want to

179
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,960
try out in containers or which you are

180
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,800
currently propagating in containers in

181
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,680
your backyard or which you may be

182
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,440
interested in propagating in containers

183
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,919
in your backyard at a later stage and

184
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,080
remember don't forget to subscribe to

185
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:18,919
the channel so that you keep on getting

186
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:21,360
updated content with the concepts of

buad

188
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:30,039
gardening thank you so we'll see in

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,039
another video again at a later time
