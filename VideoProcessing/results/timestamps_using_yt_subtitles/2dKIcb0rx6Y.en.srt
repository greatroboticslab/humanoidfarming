2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,519
the global food system accounts for 34

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,240
of greenhouse gas emission at the same

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,799
time agriculture is the most affected

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,720
sector by climate change climate change

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,039
is affecting crop yields

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,160
and is making small farmers more

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:24,400
vulnerable so it is not a sector that

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,560
can be ignored when talking about

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,039
climate change

11
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:32,160
350 billion dollar of investments

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,559
are required annually to transform the

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,680
food and agriculture sector

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,640
to become greener and more resilient

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,559
so far

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,640
about 30 percent of our agribusiness

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,640
projects have had climate finance

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:49,680
components we plan to increase this

19
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:52,160
proportion to 50 by 2025 and 75 by 2030.

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,239
many climate-related investments are not

21
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,960
immediately obvious from a commercial

22
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,719
perspective private sector clients need

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,039
to be nudged into making these

24
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,600
investments for example we are going to

25
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,479
use blended finance to help the coffee

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,880
company performing invest most of solar

27
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,520
systems the second challenge is that

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,400
many clients do not understand their

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,080
carbon footprint and the climate risks

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,159
in their business and in their supply

31
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,000
chain we have seen some clients

32
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,479
starting a carbon inventory or a climate

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,960
risk vulnerability assessment but this

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,960
is still new and adb will need to help

35
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,040
many clients for example by providing

36
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,119
project preparation technical assistance

37
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,520
the third challenge is the fragmentation

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,600
of the supply chain small older farmers

39
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,640
dominate agriculture in asia and the

40
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,159
pacific

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,799
they are 420 million small farmers with

42
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,840
an average land holding of half a

43
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,240
hectare it means that farmers are

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,000
extremely vulnerable to climate risks

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,040
and other shocks like

46
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,040
the covenant pandemic it also means that

47
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,360
those farmers are extremely hard to

48
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,920
reach even for governments and this is

49
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,079
where agri-business investment combined

50
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,479
with technical assistance is a very

51
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,200
powerful tool to help those farmers

52
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,080
become greener and more resilient

53
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,920
the most effective way to increase the

54
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,200
sustainability and the resilience of the

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,360
food system

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,920
is really to consider farmers as

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,000
businesses and make investment in both

58
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,000
their physical capital and their human

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
capital
