1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,439
that's been one of my biggest fears

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,279
since we've had this house out here is

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,960
like a cow's gonna chew through an

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,519
electrical line and kill himself and

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,000
then i gotta deal with that

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,870
grow your guard and find your tribe let

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,309
your hearts

8
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:21,309
[Music]

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,560
hello everybody and welcome back to the

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,320
terraform homestead today we're coming

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,199
to you with a new series all about our

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,880
solar system this is not a how-to video

13
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,040
this is not an in-depth detailed

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,320
demonstration of exactly what we've done

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,840
if you're looking for that there are a

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,600
bunch more resources out there on the

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,760
internet that are much more educated and

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,680
detailed than i can be in this video but

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,399
this is what we did to get our system

20
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,559
set up in a series we set up our systems

21
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,559
uh one for ourselves one for our camp

22
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,559
and with that enjoy this episode

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,239
today

24
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,760
i have been

25
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,280
uh procrasti working all day which

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,440
basically means

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,280
procrastinating on the project you're

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,600
supposed to be working on

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,439
by working on another project

30
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,880
so you don't feel bad about not doing

31
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,200
anything i was supposed to be cleaning

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,759
the rv uh we've got a couple people

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,119
showing up in about a week um i think

34
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,520
i'm pretty sure

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,040
work wires you never know um

36
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,880
so i was supposed to do that today but i

37
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,479
just did not feel like it worked way too

38
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,560
hard the last couple days

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,360
and wanted to do something more fun

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,960
so

41
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,640
i spent the morning planning and

42
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,000
researching and designing and all that

43
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,200
kind of stuff

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,799
and spent about three hours at home

45
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,439
depot today

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,200
um and got all this wood

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,880
got all this wood

48
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,119
and

49
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,119
got

50
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,720
this

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,560
new electrical system i'm really excited

52
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,680
about this we got our

53
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,799
second

54
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,520
tesla battery delivered yesterday

55
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,200
so that will put us at 500 amp hours

56
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,119
which is really cool lithium ion

57
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,880
batteries awesome stuff

58
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,479
and now that we will be having not just

59
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,959
the tiny house

60
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,000
but the rv

61
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,000
and then our pump house

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,720
um so we'll have to be running

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,120
electricity way way out there um to run

64
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,160
that that well pump decided it was a

65
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,239
good time to upgrade to what our

66
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,800
electrical system will be

67
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,400
finally like done done eventually this

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,959
will hold this whole area will be a

69
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,710
workshop um so we'll end up building the

70
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:43,249
workshop around the electrical box

71
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:43,249
[Music]

72
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:59,249
[Music]

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,120
got it into its spot

74
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,800
and up on blocks we have termites out

75
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,879
here so anything

76
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,879
wooden has to be elevated off the ground

77
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,920
so that's why with the cinder blocks

78
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,400
and in addition to that i've got

79
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,760
some of these uh pieces of rebar cut and

80
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,840
kind of hooked

81
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,959
that i will be driving

82
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,280
into

83
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,440
the ground here and then i have these

84
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,400
long carriage bolts and then i just put

85
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,959
a washer in here um to kind of help

86
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,799
further anchor this bolt in then now i'm

87
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,879
going to fill these four with concrete

88
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,560
and this will be locked into place one

89
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,319
of the things that

90
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,920
don't really think about out here in the

91
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,440
desert it's got these black hinges

92
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,560
and they've been sitting in the sun so

93
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,040
now they're literally too hot to touch

94
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,360
um so i gotta get my gloves

95
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,599
to get these guys on

96
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,480
doors are in and look at that so now i'm

97
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,640
gonna get

98
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,159
the roof in the floor in

99
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,360
and the backboard in to mount everything

100
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,959
i'm very upset right now with this cloud

101
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,840
this cloud

102
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,439
was

103
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,400
over there

104
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,359
and it's been raining the entire time

105
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,560
but it decided to go around behind the

106
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,160
mountains

107
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,600
and then over here

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,360
so we got no

109
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,360
rain whatsoever on the property

110
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:40,560
nice windy hot day great for filming um

111
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,880
i have got in

112
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,000
our line and i'm about to start

113
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,400
trenching

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,800
so going from the tiny house to the

115
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,880
electrical box um and that's going to

116
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,280
make it so they don't don't have these

117
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,360
janky extension cords going everywhere

118
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,880
that's been one of my biggest fears

119
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,720
since we've had this house out here is

120
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,400
like the cow's gonna chew through an

121
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,640
electrical line and kill himself and

122
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:13,120
they're not gonna kill that so

123
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:15,120
[Music]

124
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,240
today is the hottest day we've had so

125
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,880
far i think our high is 101 today

126
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,199
so this little cloud is providing just

127
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,840
the tiniest bit of relief

128
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,639
so it's 101 out and then i'm just on top

129
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,280
of this motor basically and it's just

130
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,280
it's hot it's hot out here in the desert

131
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,919
no one ever told me that getting my

132
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,800
grounding rod driven in

133
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,800
this is no joke in hard soil

134
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,479
i feel like the soil is the bait of my

135
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,639
existence with all the electrical and

136
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,800
plumbing that we have to do out here

137
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,440
okay we've got

138
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,320
almost all of it done just got this last

139
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,080
little

140
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,800
bit here by 10-15 feet

141
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,680
and then we'll be done and then

142
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,120
get to what i'm good at laying pipe kind

143
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,680
of how it's gonna be i need some more

144
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,560
parts before i can finish this out um as

145
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,000
always

146
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,800
never get everything in the first run

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,120
but

148
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,479
this is going to run

149
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,720
all the way down there

150
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,280
there's that post running some big gauge

151
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,960
wire um i think i got eight gauge wire

152
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,840
i'm pretty sure that's gonna be way

153
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,919
better than this janky ghetto fire

154
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,319
hazard that we've been living off of

155
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,720
the 30 amp plugs go in here

156
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,479
i got this this wire big enough

157
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,600
that or the conduit big enough that i

158
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:35,039
can run six eight gauge wires through it

159
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,080
and so i'm gonna have a tee off here

160
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,840
and then

161
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,560
not right now but once i get the ditch

162
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,720
witch trench here

163
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,800
to this little spot

164
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,680
and then kind of

165
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:53,039
45 it out to the water tanks here's the

166
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,919
makings of the electrical closet so this

167
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,880
is our second tesla battery

168
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,440
um

169
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,680
the other one's currently being used uh

170
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,000
with two of them there that will give us

171
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,039
500 amp hours

172
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,199
at

173
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,639
24 volts which is plenty and should be

174
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,720
hopefully enough for the big house and

175
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,039
everything we want to do out here

176
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,120
so eventually this whole area right here

177
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,880
will become my workshop

178
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,440
and then i'll mount the solar solar

179
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,400
panels on top and

180
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,560
kind of thought about right in here

181
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,240
doing a like a covered garage kind of

182
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,080
thing just so we can get a little extra

183
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,400
rainwater but that's probably a little

184
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,280
ways out so the solar panels right now

185
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,800
they're

186
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,319
terribly mounted

187
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,400
not oriented right but eventually

188
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,319
they'll be mounted on the roof here

189
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,039
coming into the pv box

190
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,520
that will go to the charge controller

191
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,430
batteries inverter breaker box and then

192
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:53,360
breaker box goes to everything

193
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:55,039
[Music]

194
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,520
i've got everything

195
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,639
mounted and now it's starting to wire

196
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,800
everything up

197
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,919
be a quick tour so

198
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,120
we'll have an inlet here and i still got

199
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,680
a drill

200
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,000
that will go to this which is a pv

201
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,160
combiner box that basically takes

202
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,759
all the panels and then combines them

203
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,520
into one cord

204
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,440
that goes into

205
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,080
our charge controller here

206
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:22,240
that splits off and goes down to our

207
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,960
batteries which these are two

208
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,400
250 amp hour 24 volt

209
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,560
tesla batteries

210
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,680
these will be connected um so we'll have

211
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,959
500 amp hours worth of power that goes

212
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,120
into

213
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,000
our inverter 4000 watt

214
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,839
pure sine wave inverter that goes to our

215
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,460
breaker box here okay so i've got

216
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,200
everything hooked up

217
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,600
[Music]

218
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,480
there we go

219
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,080
and we'll flip this guy

220
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,600
and i'm gonna run over to the tiny house

221
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,440
and see if it's working

222
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,760
it would help if i plugged in the tiny

223
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,760
house

224
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,720
and we have electricity to the tiny

225
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,680
house that's not a ghetto uh extension

226
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,200
cord

227
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,720
super excited that this worked the first

228
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,880
time we are set up we are pulling about

229
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,800
800 watts right now in

230
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,000
uh so i've got

231
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,000
over here a string of 600 panels or 600

232
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,240
watts worth of panels

233
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,880
and up there there's another 600 watts

234
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,360
worth of panels those guys come in and

235
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,600
plug into these two slots here

236
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,360
uh it gives me another four slots to put

237
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,040
in um

238
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,600
and i've got

239
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,519
on order about 1200 more watts worth of

240
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,240
panel to plug into this the power

241
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,279
stations pretty well finished up i've

242
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,720
got

243
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,519
everything hooked up here everything's

244
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,680
live everything's working added on

245
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,519
a outlet up here so i think i'm going to

246
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,600
build a bench right here as a work table

247
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,600
for a little bit until i get something

248
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,480
to get the workshop more built

249
00:09:53,600 --> 00:10:00,880
we have out here and see maybe our

250
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,320
percentage and then this is a cutoff for

251
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,160
the inverter so

252
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,920
that way i can turn everything on turn

253
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,399
everything off from the outside and not

254
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,560
have to worry about getting into

255
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,480
the locked cabinet if i need to shut

256
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,040
something off quickly really excited

257
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:19,270
really happy for this um this is a big

258
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:25,500
upgrade from doing it the other way

i hope this was inspiring to you solar

261
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,040
is becoming so much more accessible and

262
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,720
diy friendly for those of you interested

263
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,720
in maybe getting involved with us and

264
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,880
getting some off-grid experience some

265
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,360
diy experience learning how to use some

266
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,120
tools learning how to build a house um

267
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,360

residency program we're gonna be ramping

269
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,000
up our summer program very very soon and

270
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,079
are starting to take some applications

271
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,160
spaces are very very limited so be sure

272
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,440
to get that application in as soon as

273
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,519
possible

274
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,140
thank you guys for watching i hope this

275
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:10,690
was inspiring go build something cool
