started our precision farming department

and have grown it to now two and a half

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,880
people we've got two full-time guys and

7
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,119
one intern

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,039
that do our precision farming and with

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,480
me today is adam hinkle our precision

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,480
farming specialist at rochelle

11
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,719
been kind of a separate department for

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,480
about three years now

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,000
it's where we've taken it from being

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,480
somebody that can handle it part-time to

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,079
needing a full-time person and now at

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,520
least two full-time people it's a

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,120
separate whole separate division or a

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,120
whole separate department

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,760
um but eventually to become more

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,440
mainstream as it comes new on the

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,960
equipment

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,800
you know technicians are involved more

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,879
and more just like an option on a

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,719
tractor was a couple years ago now it's

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,080
part of the equipment so they'll be

26
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,680
involved in

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,280
setting it up fixing it just like they

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,280
would another piece of the tractor so

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,119
um more or less getting up to date with

30
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,640
the new equipment how to operate it run

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,080
it how everything ties together i mean

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,240
the monitors now

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,680
they can control the charger themselves

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,280
so it's a matter of knowing how each

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,040
monitor works with the various pieces of

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,240
equipment how we can tie that together

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,240
and make it work for the farmer

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,560
we've got some customers that grow some

39
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,040
specialty crops some seed corn

40
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,360
and with the price of seed corn for that

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,439
specialty stuff being expensive as it is

42
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,799
they want some

43
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,680
shutoff control so they're not

44
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,960
overlapping wasting seed and inputs

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,399
so we've got

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,200
several customers that do that kind of

47
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,280
stuff that we've helped them out

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,200
that kind of stuff

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,200
yeah i mean that does go along well with

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,880
growing seed corn you need to build that

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,799
row shutoffs where you're maybe you're

52
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,159
not planting a bull row

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,759
with the new technologies it makes it a

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,680
lot simpler go out there fill your

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,119
hoppers and just go plant not have to be

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,319
getting out all the time turn rows on

57
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,319
and off it's not simple
