1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,919
hello this is um

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,519
an additional presentation um to

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,920
understand how to make

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:16,320
and reproduce imo or indigenous

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,880
microorganisms

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,480
so what are indigenous microorganisms

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,359
they are microorganisms that have been

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,320
adapting and evolving in the native soil

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,039
for a very long time before we even came

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,279
here

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,399
so it's all about it's the diversity and

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,480
the life

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,239
that lives in the soil and connects the

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,920
trees under the soil

15
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,680
for them to share nutrients and

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,559
communicate

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,079
so there are mainly while there's many

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,360
and probably many that we don't even

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,600
know about

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,760
but there are fungi bacteria and yeasts

21
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,680
within these ones they kind of some of

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,000
them look like this in the piece of bark

23
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,480
that i'm showing

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,719
and the the important thing here is that

25
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,680
the more beneficial biodiversity we have

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,440
in the soil

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,040
the less chance for non-beneficial

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,799
microbes to reproduce

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,200
they also will add a big um

30
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,520
web like an extension on the roots of

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,799
trees so that they can be more drought

32
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,119
tolerant

33
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,280
and and we can boost their immune

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,159
systems and and resilience to

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,040
this ecosystem that we are if we harvest

36
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,080
them here

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,799
um so that our our crops and plants can

38
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,600
grow

39
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,600
a lot better

40
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,759
so where to harvest indigenous

41
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:36,159
microorganisms

42
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,920
so the best shot would be in nearby

43
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,439
forests that you can go into a

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,720
functional ecosystem

45
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,439
close by hopefully that you have access

46
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,880
to that

47
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,920
the closest the better so that um

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,920
you can go and find them there so

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,640
it's gonna be an expedition for sure

50
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,680
it's gonna be a nice way to connect

51
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,759
in the nature so you want to find

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,240
something that looks like a mycorrhizal

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,759
something like looks

54
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,280
something like the picture i showed you

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,319
in the bark they

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:11,680
they normally appear in leaves

57
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:15,680
like this white webs barks

58
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,040
um pieces of wood of course it has to be

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,920
a healthy soil full of

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,120
mulch that if you remove a little bit of

61
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,080
the leaves there you'll find

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,200
kind of like a white dish presence there

63
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,680
in the soil

64
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,200
that's the fungi that's the that's the

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,200
mycelium that you're looking for

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,360
a quick recommendation is that you

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,840
shouldn't harvest in a rainy season

68
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,280
you should at least wait for two days

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,120
with no rain

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,120
so that you can harvest the imo

71
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,800
so the benefits of

72
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,879
imo indigenous microorganisms is that

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,800
their drought tolerance they have

74
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,000
adapted to this place so they will

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,959
benefit

76
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,200
your plants to be more drought tolerant

77
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,800
this is a picture of how they look like

78
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,959
this is a picture of when we already

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,519
have reproduced them but that you can

80
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:15,120
understand how is it that they look like

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,959
this kind of white web in the soil

82
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,120
they also boost the immune system as we

83
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,440
said so these filaments they add to

84
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,440
plant roots

85
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,720
and they increase the ability to get

86
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,720
more nutrients in water

87
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,360
so the imo there's many steps on how to

88
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,879
make imo

89
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:42,640
so to start with the imo one

90
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:45,120
the first process is that um you cook

91
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,360
some rice i normally make one kilo of

92
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,560
rice but you can make as much as you

93
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,159
want

94
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,239
[Music]

95
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,959
and that will depend on the size of your

96
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,000
natural container

97
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,720
i'll show a picture of that but you want

98
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,840
a natural container like like a wooden

99
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,120
box

100
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,439
um that is not plastic however if you're

101
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,239
reusing plastic i guess it's okay as

102
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,599
long as

103
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,599
it can breathe that you can have um

104
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,959
some holes underneath that on the sides

105
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,560
for the biology to grow

106
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,040
so um it can be a canasta also

107
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,120
something that breeds that is made from

108
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,880
palm leaves or natural material is

109
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,280
most convenient so what you're gonna do

110
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,800
is

111
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,479
the cooked rice you're gonna put it in

112
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,240
your container

113
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,759
and then you're gonna cover it with a

114
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,759
paper cloth on top

115
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:42,080
so um you're gonna take this container

116
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,800
full of rice and you're gonna

117
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,520
full of cooked rice you're gonna go and

118
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,680
bury it

119
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,280
where you have found that fungi and

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,840
those branches

121
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,880
so um if you can you can dig a small

122
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,680
hole

123
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,600
and you place your container there and i

124
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,320
would recommend put some of the branches

125
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,280
full of the

126
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,120
fungi on top of the paper cloth never in

127
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,000
there never in the rice

128
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,360
so what what's going to happen is that

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,520
the biology

130
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,280
that lives in the soil is going to

131
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,680
travel through the paper cloth and

132
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,919
through the holes of the box

133
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,080
and it's going to go and reproduce in

134
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,080
the carbohydrate in this case it's the

135
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,759
rice

136
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,759
so you're going to leave it for five

137
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,800
days without getting wet that's very

138
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,840
important

139
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,600
um make sure that it's in a dry spot and

140
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,400
in case that it rains

141
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,160
or it's a rainy uh area maybe you want

142
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,360
to cover it a little bit

143
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,479
so that there's no rain on it so what's

144
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,479
going to happen is that

145
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,880
the biology is going to it's going to

146
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,720
reproduce in that carbohydrate

147
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,199
and it's going to heat up and then

148
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,880
you're going to have a big big colony

149
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:54,560
in that rice so that would be imo 1

150
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:58,000
to harvest them and after five days it's

151
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,000
gonna look something like this

152
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,560
where this webby stuff is reproducing

153
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,800
it is important not to add organic

154
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,960
matter in the rice

155
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,960
that was my first mistake and then it

156
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,600
was very difficult to get rid of that

157
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,840
you just want the pure rice with the

158
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,120
ecology with the biology

159
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,600
so avoid doing that adding the leaves

160
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,800
and stuff

161
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:26,080
in the rice the biology will spread in

162
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,880
in any ways in the carbohydrate so

163
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,600
it should smell nice and fresh if

164
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,680
there's a

165
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,600
smelly odor i would dispose it i would

166
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,600
throw it in your compost

167
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,400
but it should smell very nice very fresh

168
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,400
like the forest

169
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,440
and then once you have your rice full of

170
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,319
the biology

171
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,720
i would say that you live just one hour

172
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,039
until you start doing imo too so

173
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,720
you want to to harvest it when it's full

174
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,759
of life and you don't want to take too

175
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,440
long

176
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,560
because it can heat up way too much and

177
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,080
you can lose part of the biology

178
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,720
so with ny hour one hour we moved to imo

179
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,000
2.

180
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,720
and basically imo 2 is mix the equal

181
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,759
amount

182
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,800
of that rice full of fungi with brown

183
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,120
sugar

184
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,639
that's the only thing you have to do so

185
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,199
the sugar will absorb

186
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,840
the available water that is still in the

187
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,240
rice

188
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,680
and it's gonna make it not available

189
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,479
anymore so

190
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,479
they that the the biology go into a

191
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,520
dormant state and they release some

192
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,000
spores

193
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,639
and this way you can store imo from the

194
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,960
forest for a very long period of time

195
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,240
as you can see i have many samples that

196
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,560
i have taken in different

197
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,080
forests that i have found and it was not

198
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,280
necessarily a forest but it was a

199
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,360
very abundant natural sight that i found

200
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,560
one of them so to have the most

201
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,560
diversity possible

202
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:57,199
so you just grab that rice that you have

203
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,599
with the same weight the amount of black

204
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,639
of brown sugar and then you mix it in

205
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,680
one boil

206
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,000
in one bowl you don't really want to um

207
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,039
to press that hard on the rice once

208
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,800
you're mixing it

209
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,560
you just kind of want to gently and

210
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,720
evenly mix it

211
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,840
so um you don't want it to be too liquid

212
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,680
in case it's looking very liquid

213
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,319
i would add some of the brown rice on

214
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,599
top

215
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,919
of that imo so that you avoid that

216
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,360
that there's a lot more water because if

217
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,160
there's a lot of water then it's going

218
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,680
to react

219
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,320
and the bacteria is going to start

220
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,000
eating all that sugar

221
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,159
and it's not really going to store very

222
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,800
well so um

223
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,159
i wouldn't use that as a primary imo in

224
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,959
case that happens

225
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,720
just make sure that it's not too liquid

226
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,320
that is consistent and it's

227
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:54,160
uh and it's more solid

228
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:57,839
so always i i use a sugar a brown sugar

229
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,040
cap on once i'm finished uh mixing the

230
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,680
rice with the sugar

231
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,240
just add a little bit of brown sugar on

232
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,680
top

233
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,360
to make sure that there's not going to

234
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,240
be excessive moisture

235
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,880
and this you can store with a breedable

236
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,440
lid

237
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,800
you can store um in a place without

238
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,200
direct sunlight

239
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,959
and it can be good for for a long period

240
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,959
of time

241
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,320
and you should have many of these and

242
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,640
this is the way that you're already

243
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,839
relating with the natural biology

244
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,000
and implementing it in your soil is the

245
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:32,720
best fertilizer

246
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,600
so once you decide you already want to

247
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,560
take your biology out of the dormant

248
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,880
state

249
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,360
it's called imo 3 step number 3

250
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,279
and i'll briefly go through how to

251
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,200
activate and reproduce

252
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:51,519
10 gallons of imo

253
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,680
so of course you're going to use your

254
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,040
imo 2 and you're going to have several

255
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,440
inputs

256
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,399
that are going to help that reproduction

257
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,279
so

258
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,959
fpj is the first one or fermented plant

259
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,000
juice

260
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:10,480
and you use 0.3 ounces for them

261
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,680
you use brown rice vinegar same amount

262
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,200
sea water so

263
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,600
if in case you don't have sea water it

264
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,560
would be great to go on a little trip to

265
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,959
the ocean

266
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,920
and otherwise i guess you could order it

267
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:25,279
online

268
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,120
a little bit of um of seawater or

269
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,320
you know just the best way that you can

270
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,399
get sea water

271
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:36,959
be okay 5.3.3 ounces

272
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:41,040
humic acid in liquid form is best

273
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:44,560
um so the imo 2

274
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:48,160
now i just use one finger and then

275
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:51,200
water 1. 24 gallons

276
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,640
so what you want to do here is that you

277
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,360
want to make a kind of

278
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,200
of a tea so in the water you're going to

279
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,800
add all your inputs and you're going to

280
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,399
mix it gently

281
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,040
so that the sea water and a humic acid

282
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,160
is gonna

283
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,600
is gonna enhance the fungi fungal

284
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,720
activity is gonna give them enough

285
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,720
nutrients to reproduce

286
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,320
so um

287
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,839
i'm gonna briefly say how to make plant

288
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,560
fermented plant juice

289
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,839
so in this case i used moringa because

290
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,200
it's produced

291
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,839
here locally organic so i got a lot of

292
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,160
it

293
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,760
fresh so what you want is to harvest

294
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,360
your plant

295
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,360
and it it can be a local weed

296
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,440
if you want a wheat that you know that

297
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,839
has a lot of potassium and magnesium a

298
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,320
lot of

299
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,959
nutrients one that you see that is

300
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,440
thriving

301
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,320
in the environment that you live in so

302
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,240
what we want is to extract those

303
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,440
nutrients so we can give them back to

304
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,279
our plants

305
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:56,240
to our biology

306
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,120
so i used moringa and i used brown sugar

307
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,560
and so

308
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,880
um i cut them and i mix them i i cut

309
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,959
them

310
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,440
very small so that the juices can come

311
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,760
out and i added the sugar i just mix it

312
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,320
in

313
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,160
in a bucket with my hands and once you

314
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,600
do that already there's some moisture

315
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,959
coming out

316
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,800
and then what you want is to let it sit

317
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,000
for two weeks

318
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,920
maybe a week is is enough but just

319
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:26,000
make sure that that it remains liquid

320
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,120
that is going to stay liquid

321
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,800
so that the fermentation can start

322
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,200
and um when when i did this i had to

323
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,560
extract it didn't look very liquid

324
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,160
although it had some liquid i had to

325
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,079
take out the moringa

326
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,320
and just really really press it with my

327
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,160
hand so i could get all the liquid out

328
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,600
and then that's how i stored it with a

329
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,800
breathable lid

330
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,320
so this is briefly how you make fpj or

331
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,360
fermented plant use

332
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,639
juice you can use um

333
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,639
a plant that you see that is thriving

334
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,160
and with the sugar you're going to be

335
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,720
able to get its nutrients

336
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,440
and ferment it so you can give it back

337
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,560
to

338
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:11,920
our biology

339
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:14,959
so along with the inputs of the imo 3

340
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,639
you need 5 gallons of

341
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:21,360
carbs and 5 gallons of carbon

342
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,880
maybe you can check what is available

343
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,519
locally for you

344
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,360
what i use uh in this case is five

345
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,600
gallons of wheat bran

346
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,600
that is very easy to find here and five

347
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,240
gallons of cacao shells

348
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,680
it's a very good smell i mix them even

349
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,680
mix them evenly

350
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:43,360
because the wheat is going to cause um

351
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,079
it's a carb and it's going to make

352
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,000
the biology heat up a lot so i try to

353
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,839
stabilize it with the cacao shells that

354
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,199
is not only the wheat bran because

355
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,320
if your temperature goes above 120

356
00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:01,040
fahrenheit

357
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:04,560
then most of the beneficial

358
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:07,279
biology will die because of the heat

359
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,360
so when it's dry you mix your your

360
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:12,320
calves and your carbs and your carbon

361
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,320
you mix them well

362
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,040
and then you add your liquids

363
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,560
including the imo 2. so once you add the

364
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,079
liquids you really

365
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,399
try to mix it thoroughly um

366
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,480
and you want to use a natural box for

367
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,320
that because if you use plastic

368
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:36,000
then um the the part

369
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,920
of the imo 3 that is against the plastic

370
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,920
can become an aerobic and this is

371
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,519
something that happened to me as well

372
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:47,040
so you really want a breathable box

373
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:50,240
whether it's wood or cardboard

374
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,120
something like that so this is

375
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,560
when i already mixed my inputs with the

376
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,560
carbs and the carbon

377
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,639
and it's it looks like this this one

378
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:02,480
smells like chocolate cake

379
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:07,040
so it has to always have a good smell

380
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:09,920
and so after five days

381
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,160
you have to turn it every day so that it

382
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,000
doesn't heat up that it never goes past

383
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,800
120 fahrenheit

384
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,120
so mix it every day i do it with my

385
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,680
hands you can use a shovel

386
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,399
you just really want to move it you know

387
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,560
not

388
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,519
for it not to become an aerobic and you

389
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,959
know that that

390
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,199
you can keep that aeration stabilization

391
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,000
this is this happened one and on the

392
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,279
second day

393
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,480
this photo and it looks so beautiful

394
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:43,839
just to see that much ecology uh biology

395
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,839
just thriving right there

396
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,240
but yeah it will look something like

397
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,240
this

398
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,199
if you're in a very dry climate you may

399
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,199
need to regulate

400
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:59,519
the moisture it happened to me that i

401
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,639
use cardboard because cardboard absorbs

402
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,959
a lot of water

403
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,560
it dried up in three days you really

404
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,279
want it

405
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,279
you want it to be at least five days

406
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,399
that it's reproducing so it can really

407
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,680
colonize

408
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,839
all the all the grains so uh

409
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,839
you may add a little bit of water not

410
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,320
too much just to keep that

411
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,279
going for in case it's drying up and you

412
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,199
feel that

413
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,120
the moisture is not correct the moisture

414
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,199
should be um

415
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,199
you can press it with your hands but it

416
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,600
doesn't really stay like a ball it just

417
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,759
has like a little bit of

418
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,240
compression but it falls apart that's

419
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,079
that's what you're looking for

420
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,079
in cold climates it may take a longer

421
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,519
time than five days just stay vigilant

422
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,480
and be open to

423
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,079
to make mistakes and do it again just

424
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,440
always keep an eye on them

425
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,880
they look something like this they're

426
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,360
very very beautiful

427
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,600
so in the end after the five days it

428
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:59,199
should look something like this

429
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,800
so you get this um these chunks

430
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,959
of they will colonize these chunks

431
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,720
and if you open them up you you

432
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,079
shouldn't open all of them but

433
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,720
if you open them up they should look

434
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,679
something like this very webby in there

435
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,360
it looks um it looks very good it smells

436
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,959
great

437
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:22,160
and those are good biology for our soil

438
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,880
the native biology

439
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,280
and you can store that in a natural uh

440
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,720
in a wooden box in a closed wooden box

441
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,320
you can store that

442
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,640
for some weeks and from this you can

443
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,640
make

444
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,400
you can make certain things you can make

445
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,919
liquid imo

446
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:45,120
or you can just mix the imo 3

447
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,799
the finished product with your native

448
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,320
with your native soil and the same

449
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,760
inputs so that you can

450
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,840
build soil that's how we really build um

451
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,000
native soil again you mix your native

452
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,840
soil with the with the biology

453
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,559
and then you have that soil full of that

454
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,799
um

455
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,160
or microorganisms you know that are

456
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,480
going to

457
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,559
stabilize are going to help with the

458
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,799
restoration of our soils

459
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,360
and to make liquid imo which is very

460
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:17,760
easy to add

461
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:21,200
you just need this amounts of um fpj

462
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,000
same brown rice vinegar seawater humic

463
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,440
acid

464
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,640
imo 2 or imo 3 is ok to use

465
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,640
when making liquid imo and your water

466
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,200
important that when you're making liquid

467
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,679
imo since we mainly have fungi

468
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,360
you need a narrator something looking

469
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,679
like this

470
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,480
i got something like this with at least

471
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,360
two

472
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:47,360
tubes giving oxygen you can use um

473
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,559
your stones you can add the end of the

474
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:54,000
tube to a stone you can make that

475
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,520
oxygen rock and it goes in the bottom so

476
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,880
that you can always have this

477
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:01,760
stimulation for 36 hours

478
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,840
and then you have your liquid indigenous

479
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,039
microorganisms that you can add to your

480
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,039
soil and to your plants

481
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,960
so i hope that was helpful on how to

482
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,400
make

483
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,720
in written reproduce indigenous

484
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,200
microorganisms

485
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,640
that is uh has been very helpful for us

486
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,400
it is super fun

487
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,160
to do and that way you make sure that

488
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,559
you're working with the available

489
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:34,720
native biology which is most important

490
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:34,720
thank you
