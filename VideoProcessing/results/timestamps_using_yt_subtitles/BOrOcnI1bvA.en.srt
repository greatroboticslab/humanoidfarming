00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,179
what's going on my dudes welcome to the

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,380
channel I'm Cody Banks and today my news

3
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:07,319
I'm going to be teaching you how to make

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:09,120
a very simple and efficient crop farm so

5
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,460
let's get started on today's video

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,860
to get started on this Farm we're gonna

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,320
require the following materials eight

8
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,660
water buckets three stacks of blocks of

9
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,720
your choice two stacks of dirt one stack

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,640
of glass of your choice two Hoppers a

11
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,820
handful of redstone one redstone

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,220
repeater one button eight dispensers two

13
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,260
chests and then any crop of your choice

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,200
you could do seeds for wheat carrots

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,120
potatoes or beetroot on the side here

16
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,800
are two water buckets you're gonna need

17
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,480
just two pails of water to make an

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,820
infant water pool to lay down some water

19
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,800
to keep your crops hydrated so let's get

20
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,840
started and build this Farm to get

21
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,000
started we're gonna go ahead and build a

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,920
double chest right here and behind it

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,260
we're gonna go ahead and Crouch and

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,579
place our Hopper on the first chest to

25
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,559
verify your Hopper is connected

26
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,660
correctly you will see a tube coming off

27
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,120
of the hopper in whatever Direction the

28
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,340
chest is if your Hopper is placing the

29
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,719
wrong way it will not go into the chest

30
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,339
and your items will not be collected

31
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,860
properly next day we're gonna go eight

32
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,740
blocks backwards from this chest we got

33
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,479
one two three four five six seven eight

34
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,880
just like that then we're gonna put one

35
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,159
block here and one block here we can hop

36
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,080
up on top on top of the chest Crouch

37
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,799
Place piece of glass and let's go seven

38
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:24,479
back two three four five six seven make

39
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,100
that eight so that way there's two

40
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,540
blocks right here next thing we're gonna

41
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,060
go ahead and grab your block of choice

42
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,820
and beside the hopper one two three four

43
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,320
five six seven eight just like that and

44
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:36,000
nine

45
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,400
so it should look like this so far

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,380
alright so we're ready to put our field

47
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,060
in our first field we're gonna start

48
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,500
back here Place one piece of dirt Place

49
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,299
another piece of dirt and we're gonna go

50
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,799
eight across so we're gonna go all the

51
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,420
way to the glass just to make it easy

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,659
and we're gonna go eight back so we got

53
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,460
two three four five six seven and eight

54
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,740
then we're just gonna go ahead and meet

55
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,140
ends and then we'll fill in the center

56
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,600
all right there we have it we have an

57
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,520
eight by eight field our next field we

58
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,439
are gonna do one up here and we're gonna

59
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,180
do an eight by seven so we're gonna go

60
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,619
eight across here just like that then

61
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,800
we're gonna go seven back so we got two

62
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:13,020
three four five six seven just like that

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,459
and then we're gonna meet ends just like

64
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,459
this

65
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:19,440
and fill it in there we have it so first

66
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:21,780
field again is an eight by eight second

67
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,239
field is an eight across by seven back

68
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,160
now we're gonna take our block of choice

69
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,720
and we're gonna make a trough for the

70
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,060
water this is basically a little path

71
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,220
here using our blocks so we're gonna

72
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,220
make these paths around the whole farm

73
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,720
that way the water can sit beside the

74
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,640
actual dirt that way it keeps the field

75
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,440
hydrate now this back one here we're

76
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,660
gonna go up like that and then we're

77
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,340
just gonna fill in the back side here

78
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,940
and then we'll start from the front

79
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:51,000
again make our little water area here

80
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:54,360
going up like that

81
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,160
and then back here just like that so it

82
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,360
should look like this pretty simple so

83
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,739
far

84
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,160
next thing we're going to go ahead and

85
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,780
make a wall that our water is gonna stay

86
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,580
in because we don't want the water

87
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,680
splashing about so we're gonna just

88
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,019
gonna make that wall kitty corner that

89
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,459
block there that way our Hopper is

90
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,140
protected and the water doesn't get all

91
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:15,480
over the place then we're going to do

92
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,760
the same thing for this side go ahead

93
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,360
and make a wall that way again the water

94
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,459
stays inside of the trough here it's got

95
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,500
its own little pathway and then put a

96
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,260
block there again all right pretty

97
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,659
simple so far this is the top view just

98
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:32,400
in case you need help the dirt matches

99
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:34,739
up with the walls here dirt matches up

100
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,940
with the walls here all right so we're

101
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,920
gonna grab our water buckets we're gonna

102
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,019
make a two by two hole in the ground put

103
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,940
a water bug here water bug here and then

104
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,040
we're gonna go and start so we're gonna

105
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:45,720
put a water bucket here it's gonna flow

106
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,519
we're gonna put another water bucket

107
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,040
down there it's gonna flow to the end

108
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,440
another water bucket here and another

109
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,239
water bucket right here that way water

110
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,580
is all in these spots make sure there's

111
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,080
water in these spots all right so we're

112
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,519
good to cover this up now so what we're

113
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,920
gonna do is just go ahead and just cover

114
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,599
this up and do a two high wall that way

115
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,299
our crops don't actually fly out of the

116
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,879
farm again do that to this side cover up

117
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:10,920
the water and then just do a too high

118
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,260
wall and just do that to the other side

119
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:17,160
as well a too high wall all the way down

120
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:19,199
the farm here that way the water is

121
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,019
covered up and our crops don't go over

122
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,570
the over the actual wall and then at the

123
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,800
end here add those walls there

124
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,259
[Music]

125
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,300
just like that so that way your whole

126
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:32,220
Farm is encased next we're gonna go

127
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:34,259
ahead and grab our dispensers and we're

128
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,820
gonna go one two three four five six

129
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,380
seven eight and then I want you to put

130
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,300
water buckets in every single one of

131
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,560
these dispensers all right once your

132
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,240
water buckets are in the dispensers

133
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,400
we're just gonna go ahead and grab our

134
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,320
block of choice and put it over top of

135
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,259
the dispensers and we're actually gonna

136
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,600
put a block behind the dispensers just

137
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,560
like this and then break that one at the

138
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,060
end

139
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,860
and then we're going to meet these

140
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,780
blocks up here like that and then we're

141
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,699
gonna grab our Redstone out and then

142
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,199
we're gonna make a redstone path with a

143
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,419
button okay go ahead and grab your

144
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,979
Redstone and put it on all these blocks

145
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,960
back here that way you're going to be

146
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:09,000
able to power up these dispensers and

147
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,080
the water will flow out and auto crop

148
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,020
for you

149
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,460
all the way till the end here now at the

150
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,840
end you want to decide where you want to

151
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,720
place your buttons so I'm going to drop

152
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,340
this block out put a block down here put

153
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,199
a piece of redstone there and then put

154
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:23,759
the button here now when you click this

155
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,800
button you'll see the Redstone path

156
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,780
travels but it doesn't make it all the

157
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,060
way to the dispenser so we actually have

158
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:33,720
to place a repeater down now I'm gonna

159
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,880
go two blocks right here so basically

160
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,259
two blocks after the jump and we're

161
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,419
gonna try it we're gonna test it make

162
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:42,120
sure the water flows all the way

163
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:44,940
okay all of our buckets are dispensing

164
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,880
so that repeater position is correct

165
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,380
if your buckets aren't dispensing then

166
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,419
you know you'll obviously have to adjust

167
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,639
the repeater accordingly so you either

168
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:55,020
put it this way or that way

169
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,120
um well you'd put it this way you'd put

170
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,979
it to the left one more but it should

171
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,900
work fine long as you've used the same

172
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,520
blueprint as this one all right now we

173
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,020
can go ahead and just put some glass

174
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,020
walls here just to make it look a little

175
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,580
prettier and our last water bucket is

176
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,740
going to be in this corner right there

177
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,840
now I said you can use two Hoppers it's

178
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:14,160
totally up to you guys but if you use

179
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,560
two Hoppers you can break that block

180
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,660
there Crouch and place another Hopper

181
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,400
there that way it's connected to this

182
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,720
