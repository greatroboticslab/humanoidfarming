00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
Imagine a compact harvester gliding

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,040
smoothly across a vast field. Its

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,960
precise movements a testament to modern

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:12,880
engineering. Despite its small size, it

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,280
skillfully navigates between rows of

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,840
crops, efficiently harvesting each plant

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,720
along the way. Built with advanced

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,920
autonomous technology, this tiny machine

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,000
requires no operator. It independently

10
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,480
handles planting, harvesting, and

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,960
sorting. This is a glimpse into the

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,280
future of agriculture where technology

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,760
enables the smallest machines to achieve

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,760
great results.
