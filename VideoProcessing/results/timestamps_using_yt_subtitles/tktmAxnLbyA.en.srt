200
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:17,080
introducing beneficial insects like

201
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,720
ladybugs or using insecticidal soap if

202
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,680
necessary additionally ensure good air

a few inches tall thin the if they are

207
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,959
too crowded this will allow for better

215
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,680
when the pods are full but before they

216
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,920
start to turn yellow regular harvesting

your garden now that your peas are

224
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,600
planted let's talk about how to care for

225
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,000
them to ensure a healthy and productive

226
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,839
crop proper maintenance is key to

thriving one

230
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,920
watering consistent moisture is

231
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,160
essential for pea plants especially

232
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,720
during their flowering and pots setting

233
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,720
stages aim to provide about 1 in of

234
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,519
water per week either through rainfall

235
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,200
or supplemental

236
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:41,000
watering water deeply to encourage

237
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,160
strong root development but avoid

238
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,360
overhead watering to minimize the risk

241
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,079
mulching as mentioned earlier applying a

242
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,920
layer of mulch around your pea plants

243
00:09:51,079 --> 00:09:55,959
can help retain soil moisture and

244
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,560
suppress weeds organic mulches like

245
00:09:55,959 --> 00:10:00,720
straw grass clippings or shredded leaves

246
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,000
not only provide these benefits but also

fixing and generally don't require heavy

256
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,160
fertilization you can apply a light dose

257
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,440
of a balanced fertilizer or compost tea

258
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,560
if you notice slow growth or yellowing

259
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,440
leaves avoid High nitrogen fertilizers

260
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:39,000

276
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,519
as your pea plants grow they may need

277
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:18,079
additional support if you haven't

278
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,120

carefully to avoid disturbing The Roots

280
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,560
peas naturally climb so providing them

281
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,920
with a sturdy support use trellises

282
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,040
netting or even simple staks to help

283
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,200
your plants climb this not only keeps

284
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,480
the plants upright but also improves air

285
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,480
circulation and makes harvesting easier

286
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,240
be sure to check the support regularly

287
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,440

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,440
generally don't require much pruning you

290
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,360
can remove any yellowing or damaged

291
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,760
leaves to promote better air flow and

292
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,200
reduce the risk of

especially during germination and

421
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:10,439
flowering water your peas deeply but

422
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,160
infrequently to encourage deep root
