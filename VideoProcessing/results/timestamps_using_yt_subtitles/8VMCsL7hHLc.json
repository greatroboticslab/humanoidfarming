  "text": "good morning and also good afternoon for those that are joining from europe i'm very pleased to share this panel today at the online dcmi 2020 conference dedicated to challenges finding information in food and agriculture on the web what can we do better and this panel is going to focus on food and agricultural sciences and as you will learn over the next 90 minutes agriculture and disciplines related have special characteristics that make data interoperability particularly challenging and so the work of certain genes to collect scientific data from one side in this particular um sciences gray literature is crucial while journal articles are not necessarily the only scholarly communication channel that counts and secondly and the most important and that is going to be very much highlighted today is that while in other sciences english is the pivotal language in the case of the foot in agriculture and due to the diversity of languages behind used it's necessary to consider multi-language multilingualism and semantic strategies as a way to increase accessibility to all the scientific literature through the use we hope that at the end of this session panelists will share some thoughts about possible ways to address some of the identified challenges as well possible common synergies to build on how how to bring them forward today we have panelists from the footing agriculture organization of united nations cgir land portal foundation usda national agricultural library and the beijing academy of agriculture and forestry sciences that unfortunately is not going to be physically in this panel session due to time constraints the time zone constraints but we have a recording to present the use case that they would like to share with you about the work that they are doing in this field we encourage to all of you to submit your questions through the chat box anytime don't be shy just share if you have any specific request for one panelist please add her name at the beginning of your comment this will make easy to go through the questions and answers part and don't forget that we like to hear from you as well this is an interactive session where we would like also to learn from your thoughts and experiences if you have any in this field or in any other field that you think that could be also of interest for the audience so this panel will start with a short presentation by each of the panelists and this is going to bring us uh to take more or less 60 minutes and after that we will start with the questions and answers but uh before we continue with the session let me introduce myself because of course probably you don't know me at all so i'm in mr village i'm a senior information management um uh at fau and i'm the program manager for agrees in anger work which will be also presented today during our discussion instead that you have here in the zoom all the panelists um we will start um by the order that was displayed in the announcement of this session before i would like to introduce our first panelist which is eddie antonioli erin is coming from the usda national agricultural library niel and she is the lead veterinator librarian and data creation team in the knowledge services division of the usda nil thank you erin and you can share your presentation it's over to you thank you emma can you hear me yeah thank you excellent excellent thank you i'm here today to talk about the ag data commons usda's general ag data catalog and repository which is designed to help usda researchers publish and disseminate data products the national agriculture library is one of five national libraries of the united states it houses one of the world's largest collections devoted to agriculture and its related sciences nal provides a variety of online resources including journal articles digital collections and other materials relating to agriculture i'm going to focus on the ag data commons for today's presentation the ag data commons is a catalog and data repository for usda-funded research data it provides expert services for creating curating and enabling access to complete and machine readable scientific metadata it creates infrastructure for linking information data data publications people and more and it helps the usda funded research community meet public access requirements an ag data commons data set consists of data files and associated metadata we provide tools and services to make each data set richer and more discoverable the ag data commons strives to deliver fair metadata that are machine readable and available via apis and other automated means as a generalist ag repository we focus most heavily on the f and the a of this matrix since interoperability and reusability generally require subject-specific adherence to more regimented data and metadata standards to that end the ag data commons provides discovery and access as its core function search and discovery tools and linked information promote findability we enable access through the catalog and public apis use of open licenses and dois for digital assets the ag data commons synthesizes metadata to achieve a variety of services i like the analogy of lego blocks to represent ag data commons metadata because the pieces come in different colors shapes and sizes and can be assembled in a variety of ways to perform a variety of functions our metadata system is no different we ask for essential information about the data and rearrange that input to satisfy the needs of each service that the ag data commons offers we often work with geospatial metadata which must use the iso 19115 standard and this standard underpins our internal systems because it's robust enough to handle the information from the other standards one use case that illustrates this metadata synthesis includes our work with the ag cross repository ag cross specializes in geospatial data and uses an iso 19115 flavor of metadata in an esri platform we ingest metadata and data by harvesting from agros using microservices architecture according to best practices and create the ag data commons record and store the data files locally we then reformat that metadata to the data site format and reserve a doi using an internal system which then gets added back to the ag data commons record finally the doi is pushed back to agros for display with their record using a restful api records tagged with specific bureau codes are also forwarded to data.gov this way agros researchers can utilize their subject specific platform but also benefit from the discovery and access services the ag data commons offers we offer a wide assortment of fields to data submitters with a great deal of linking potential but we need to strike a balance between information that makes data fair and how much data submitters are willing to fill out when we present too many requirements people simply won't fill out they simply just won't submit their data or they opt for repositories with a lower bar of entry when we allow submissions with too few completed fields the data set findability and potential reusability suffers after reviewing the requirements for the services ag data commons facilitates we arrived at this core set of essential metadata for each record this list doesn't account for some of the subject subject-specific requirements certain research communities may need but we cover our bases as a generalist ag catalog with this set of metadata during the curation process our staff also adds nal thesaurus terms to ag data commons records the nal thesaurus is used to select controlled vocabulary terms for subject indexing in several of the library's databases the thesaurus is produced in part by the national agricultural library is updated annually and contains over 260 000 terms it's available as linked open data for anyone to use the ag data commons provides the infrastructure for linking metadata and objects to enable analytical tools we provide specific fields for these relationships to maximize the linking and machine readability of the metadata this includes different types of relationships between data sets and documentation author identification links like orcid and version guidance we provide features to promote credit for usda researchers as an incentive to deposit data with us and to provide more complete records with linked information u.s federal data should be openly and freely available but the ag data commons makes it easier for researchers to give and receive credit for their work citations are automatically generated for all records in the catalog and researchers can link to their scholarly publications data papers and other related content we also provide dois for locally held data files which has been a big incentive for researchers to share their data publicly now as much as we do well there are still plenty of challenges we face in making data findable and accessible our search features offer a particular opportunity for improvement we've been working with our stakeholders to develop search requirements to use while we evaluate database platforms for our 2021 upgrade our data content represents a diverse set of research topics and metadata needs we can't be all things to all people and instead focus on the services we offer and the metadata required to accomplish those tasks an ale thesaurus application is not currently automated and that's a problem we plan to work more closely with nal's indexing and informatics branch to improve not term application and provide better linkage between various library systems and yet another challenge involves which controlled vocabularies to implement and how to link them to authoritative sources we chose taxonomies related directly to nal's services but seek a better and more effective way to integrate controlled vocabularies used by the different specific areas we support our metadata enriches our data sets but doesn't always make them more discoverable outside of our own platform some of this relates to infrastructure and some to culture for instance orcid accounts can automatically link data sets with dois we issue from their author profile pages but many account holders don't turn on that feature we can capture rich information but strive to increase the linked information we provide to that end we work to convey the value of linked information to the researchers submitting the data more fields often represents more burden for data submitters so we look for ways to make the submission process easier and to communicate the added value as information professionals we understand how complete and linked information enhances data sets however to get the absolute most utility out of data sets we must educate submitters and communicate the value of linked information while lessening the submission burden so data becomes more easily findable and accessible thank you that's my presentation here are a few of the links that i showed throughout my presentation and i will hand it back to emma thank you so much erin also for really doing on time very interesting presentation i would like to bring on board our next panelist um fabrizio celli um fabrizio is part of um the team that is managing aggregates the international system for agricultural science and technology actually he is the technical leader and he is working for the food and agriculture organization of united nations welcome to the panel fabrizio and over to you thank you very much emma okay in this session we will be looking at how aggress is addressing challenges in finding and integrating research in food and agriculture i want to give you some background about phao and aggressive fallow is the food and agriculture organization of the united nations and it's the organization that is maintaining aggressor faust's goal is to lead the international efforts to defeat hunger and to improve nutrition and food security he was founded in 1945 and the headquarter is in rome even if our operates in over 130 countries in 1974 uh foul set up an initiative together with the member countries uh to uh make information on agriculture globally available the outcome of this initiative was aggressive agaris is a database of almost 12 million of multilingual bibliographic metadata agriculture research but it is also a big network of as you can see 434 data providers from 150 countries uh the uh importance of aggress is also given by the fact that it's highly used so according to google analytics aggress receives around 8 million of visits per month and is accessed from all over the world 200 countries and territories before talking about the new challenges that agrius has to address uh i want to show i want to describe a little bit how uh the data providers so the aggregate provider has changed over the time so at the beginning uh in 1974 government centers whose role was to collect all the scientific production in their country and to send the data to aggress then from 2005 aggressors started to accept also data from institutional repositories from publishers and from aggregators usually in this case agrees doesn't go to an institution and ask for data but thanks to the visibility that tagri says institutions come to aggress asking if they can publish data and we can face here problems of integration of the data on the other end with the evolution of the technology and also of the open access institutional repositories agrees uh uh as to cope also with problems related to automatic discovery automatic harvesting and processing of data and metadata available on the web so just to summarize uh there are two big areas in terms of challenges on one side we have the problem of the integration of new data so when there is a new data provider there are several problems to be solved in order to guarantee that the metadata can be correctly published in aggression that can benefit of all the features that give a lot of visibility to aggress data so for example uh considering uh the variety of the data providers and the fact that they come from all over the world they always use different metadata formats and different standards and most important uh there are very different levels of metadata quality so while there are data providers who has made a very rich metadata records on the other end we can find some data providers with very poor records and these of course create a problem of balance inside the aggress database other issues are for example related to the full text links and also the stability of the links agrees uh uh always suggests to add the link to the full text but uh considering that agrees uh the agree started in 1974 most of the links are corrupted so aggress needs to periodically review all the links to guarantee that they are still working then the other important problem is about multilingualism in fact uh considering the tag is just metadata in up to 90 languages the pro some problems can can exist when aggress receives regulars especially with text encoding everybody should use unicode utf-8 in order to guarantee interoperability of the metadata in all the languages the second area is about the automatic discovery and the ingestion of data directly from web apis for example using the iph protocol or using like restful apis uh two big problems here are the relevance of high volume data in fact when you uh search for data on the web and you want to automatically uh harvest and ingest data into the database it is difficult to be sure about the relevance so the fact that the data is relevant to the topics available in the address database the second issue is really the two content classification and to the integration of uh this data automatically are vested from the web now about the integration agrees uh set up an orchestration of uh software components even if at the beginning we have a manual validation of the metadata so there is a physical person who receives the metadata and checks the metadata uh for uh in order to understand this first of all it is relevant to the aggress domain and second if there are semantics error for example or problems with encoding this is something that is possible for regular data providers but not when metadata are automatically harvested from the web because they're the volume of the data it's very high and it's impossible to do this manually after this is done uh aggress has a lot of processes to convert and harmonize all the metadata from a lot of formats to an aggress internal format which is aggressive and then to perform some operations like data cleaning metadata enrichment in order to reach the final version of uh the the record which is the aggressor df so these allows aggress to enable the usage of linked open data technologies so aggressor is not giving any suggestions in terms of input metadata format [Music] agrees tries to accept everything even if there are several challenges here poor metadata so like missing metadata fields uh lack for example of controlled vocabularism wrong usage of metadata properties and as i told you in case of multilingual regulars also problems with encodings this is why aggress recommends to consider the load of bd recommendations which are recommendations in terms of metadata properties to use and also in terms of vocabularies to use and they can help to standardize a little bit uh the situation and to help the integration of the metadata coming from uh such a variety of data providers uh of course it's important to build also some capacity development development this is uh because agaris has learned a lot over the time and the only way to help data providers to produce better metadata is to uh train also data providers so the first step is email exchange so when there are new data providers and aggress understands that there are errors uh or semantic errors or other kind of problems there is a chain of email exchange with the data provider to guide the data provider to produce better richer and meaningful metadata then there are also webinars guides on the websites and recommendations as i told you before with the lord apd recommendations now an important piece of the aggregate's infrastructure is agrovoc this is a controlled vocabulary covering all the areas of interest of file it's translated into 39 languages and it's the backbone of aggress so this is used for example 12 pages with automatic data discovery and classification aggro can factories use them within some machine learning algorithms that allows agris to understand the relevance of the metadata which are automatically harvested and downloaded from the web plus aggro voca is also very important to enables a lot of additional features on the website like the multilingual search like the improvement of the precision and the recall like the possibility to connect different resources so using linked open data technologies and as i told you also in several machine learning algorithms both to determine the relevance of harvested resources but also to classify resources according using these multilingual tests and that's it from my side thank you very much thank you very much fabrizio so we move now to our third speaker uh shio yin ping is from the institute of agriculture information and economics at the beijing academy of agriculture and forestry sciences she is responsible for the construction of agriculture information resources data sharing information analysis and semantic technology technology research as i mentioned before unfortunately she is um she couldn't attend this panel session um i'm not sure whether you can all all of you can share can you see the video yes okay could you confirm as well that you can hear the sound hi okay so i will put the video now it's about nine minutes and then we will move to the next panel list china great honor to have this opportunity to communicate with you now i would like to introduce some of the work our team has done for construction and sharing of agricultural information resources challenges and how to deal with these changes in the future first i grateful introduction to my organization varis was founded in 1958 it's a comprehensive agricultural research institution in beijing there are 14 specialized research institute and the business fields cover all aspects of agriculture there are more than one certain employees ai is a specialized research institute under baffs it manually carries all to research and extension service in the field of agriculture information resource construction agricultural information technology agricultural economic management et cetera our team has been engaged in the construction of agriculture information resources data sharing and economic analysis for nearly two decades we set up the basic agriculture think tank plate form in 2017. the goal of this platform is to build our resources with well organized and functional of agricultural science and technology so service and platform to provide the data sharing service and the in-depth uh information analysis service for decision makers managers and research researchers we have been working towards this goal at present the platform has gathered more than one million pieces of agricultural information resources from china other countries and a few international organizations according to the resource tabs the platform brings together 12 categories of information resources including patents news policies etc according to the agricultural theme the data is divided into cedar industrial planting industry animal husbandry fisheries etc at present resources is mainly in chinese and english resources for mice include text pdf or new numerical values and so on there are four unknown tenures for data acquisition one is the internal data of dafs as baafi's owns a lot of primary data resources such as the expert information technology achievement research report another one is the data from the government and academic association they get it through comprehend concrete and creative construction data exchange and so on suddenly the open data from the internet the last one is the commercial databases i think a good resource sharing platform should have several heretics abundance in resources uh a story authority authoritative and reliable family in update standardized food in um for data specialists spec picture and the data organization with the data and the semantics okay it really can change the and how theoretical data into standardized and available data facilitator data management and the data quality assessment submitted the data into grid and sharing semantic technology can deplete diseased and nearly potential or releasing zipper amount data and that can be applied can be applied to resource retrieval resource recommendation data association data discovery etc we have also held down some preliminary work in the regard metadata standards has been established to standardize the data processing and management a communicative model of agriculture information resource database dataset is established by fully considering the metadata content necessary for data content data display data development etc including include the title subject object keyword type for provider etc on the basis of common metadata different data is extended under either their own unique metadata fields so as to the metadata standard of this business such as the science and the technology projected database implies the projector committed and unit funding amount of projected time etc and we direct 12 types of metadata standards when resources are collected on a platform they are converted into standardized data and stored into the database through format conversation data cleaning with data attribute extend extraction with data extension and other procedures st course is adopted as the basic vocabulary of knowledge organization astikos is a super vocabulary of science technology edited by nstlcs stscc mscs currently st cost has collected more than 240 thousand agricultural terms and more than 90 certain concepts asti course is used in platform data retrieval and the keyword extraction challenges agricultural information resources are limited and the tennis agriculture information resources are many resources data formats are varied and the most are not just submitted according to limited data standards homemade data qualities abstract keywords sims etc are often missing are often missing with data attributes arrow on low level of automatic and artificial intelligence in data cleaning metadata attribute extraction extension and other aspects still need plenty of manual participation multi-legal problems platform including includes chinese english and other languages so it is difficult to achieve the unified resource retrieval and the data association of multiple languages future plan carry out extensive cooperation with more organization of agricultural information resources stronger the research and application of ai technology in abstract extensive extraction automatic tagging of a keyword subject class fixture and so on try to achieve almighty language unified retrieval and the intelligent recommend recommendation and based on our work strengthen the research and application of semantic knowledge of analysis and technology and look forward to completing with our peers this is the end of my speech thank you for your listening thank you so much for our panelist in beijing and i'm really sorry that she couldn't make it in any case if you have any question for her and for baths all right sorry this is yep so if you have any question a specific question for for her please uh don't don't don't hesitate to write it in the chat box i i could um simply send this to them and i would like to welcome our next panelist um this is uh meda de vara she is a senior research fellow at ift this is the international food policy research institute medal led's one of the three models of the cgir platform for big data and agriculture spur heading efforts to operationalize the fair principles towards fundable accessible interoperable and reusable data across the cgir's 13 centers thank you for being here medline over to you thanks emma and thanks to the organizers for having me let me know if you can't hear me clearly or if you're something goes awry with the screen sharing but you should be able to see my screen now hopefully correct yes okay good good um so i'm going to launch right in uh first of all i'm going to acknowledge my co-authors who could not be here uh so thieris and pythagoras from scio and they have helped us uh greatly with this and a lot of what i'm going to be talking about is in fact thanks to them uh let me start in with an introduction like the others have given about cgir because i'm not sure how many people know uh that cgir is a network of 15 research for development centers focused mostly in the global south it is the largest global agricultural innovation network and um we so i mentioned the 15 centers we we have a local presence in over 100 countries most of those countries with gdps of less than a dollar a day we've been around for most of most of the centers have been around for about 50 years and we have large networks of partnerships um we also have uh uh some of the the work that we do is across uh our gene banks which hold or are stewards of um a very large number of crop seed essentially accessions is germ plasma accessions um so in a nutshell uh that's that's really cgir what what we focus on really is uh poverty reduction particularly in rural areas um uh we work on on issues related to food food um security and and nutritional security and we try to do that in in a sort of a an environmentally sustainable way with regard for natural resource management um and ecosystem services um so so that's just to sort of set the stage a little bit on what cgir is uh as we work um in our centers what we find is as as everybody here has i think alluded to is a is an increasingly digitized and digital agriculture so this is sort of a conceptual model of a future farm uh not not in the us or in europe but actually in africa somewhere or could be south asia this is really where um things are going very digital as many of the speakers have mentioned ai artificial intelligence and machine learning uh i come from the big data platform where we have the technologies to be deriving um insights and solutions from data large pools of data in fact but to do that we need to be able to find and access the data something you've heard about in earlier presentations as well we need to be able to interpret that data not just as humans but as machines as well we increasingly need to be able to aggregate large amounts of related data sets and we we generally need to be able to visualize map and of course analyze that data to derive insights from it so that's kind of the the scenario that we work in and for the big data platform one of the things that we're trying to do is assume open uh open access to our data our research data by default but focus on fair data and i don't think i need to go much more into what there is um other people have mentioned this what i'm showing you here is sort of our kind of overall approach to doing this this is a schematic that shows uh the the organized modules uh uh efforts to make data open and fair and and and so the heart of this is the guardian data discovery portal which enables um sort of wider discovery and use by google data sets for instance uh and other search engines uh by external apps for farmers and policy makers uh and and it does that by harvesting metadata from a number of different uh repositories or data platforms and by data here i mean both publications and data platforms so for cgir centers we have 15 centers as i said uh that amounts to 30 odd repositories because each center typically tends to have unfortunately a one data repository and one publications repository typically unlinked so you don't know what publication was built using what data very often so that's 30 repositories we're also making data discoverable from usaid's digital data library from what used to be diffid um and i can never remember what that fcdo stands for but it used to be diffid uh the the the british equivalent of usa roughly speaking we have some data and an increasing amount of data and publications from the world bank uh we also make discoverable uh what aaron talked about earlier usda usda's ag data commons and we have the genesis platform from our uh gene banks which i've already mentioned um earlier we also have data and publications visible from the government of india's open data portal focusing primarily on the ag part of that because there's much more there um and there's a dataverse sitting behind this uh for those who want to upload their data and for that we have built workflows to comply with um based on ontologies and control vocabularies that that form the standards so these workflows we the fair workflows are intended to generate data that's that's um consistently described uh in terms of the the semantics of the data and then uh we're also developing digital tools to collect data that's already standards compliance already built on ontologies and and and such um and of course the the the primary piece of all of this is the so what you can find data as a big deal and here what i'm showing you is the the sort of pipelines that we're building out uh to be able to analyze the data to visualize it and explore it both semantically as well as visually in in maps and being able to query it that way as well so um just a quick view of what this looks like uh this is a search done in guardian on on the terms here on nutrition women uh the idea is i want to find data on nutrition as it affects women so i go to guardian i type in those keywords and here you see a quick grab which you see data coming from three of our cgir centers if brielle re and sip as well as fcdo which used to be diffid uh usaid's ddl data.gov and you may not be able to see the bottom one which is the world bank um there are a number of publications and data sets that are being discovered here there's different ways to filter uh across the top and and to to and to look at that data here and of course i did i did mention usda act data commons gene max if you go further down this you're likely to find data sets from particularly from ag data commons not so much from gene banks here um so to do this to to be able to enable this sort of view um you you need somehow to harmonize a number of different metadata schemas and this is where uh that a lot of the work uh that pythagoras sensor theories do particularly for guardian uh comes into play so guardian enriches the native metadata that comes in from uh the repositories where the data sits uh to enhance their fairness particularly focusing on the findability and accessibility um so here's an example this is this is from one of our centers um uh uh this is a publication from one of our centers simet um and and here what what uh what what was done when you look at this particular uh the same publication as it's viewed in guardian what what's been done is a sort of a standardization of the of the first name last name format of the authors from what you see here which is kind of you know mixed it's it's not a consistent format to a much more consistent format um and then also a deduping so so this this same date this same publication is available both from the from the diffid um repository as well as simmets repository we've deduped it and made it uh you know consistently available just from this one place if you go further down in that same publication you see a set of keywords and these keywords um are both keywords that have been input typically by the the information and data managers uh but as it's been enriched as well uh by pulling from aggrovac as well as ontologies and so that's that's something that's uh very powerful and enhances the definability and accessibility of data this is another example uh which we showed you here uh a data set from um actually not a data set it's a publication from acresat one of our other centers in india um and here you see um an enhancement of of the resource um using geonames so it's it's this was something that was absent in the original uh publication sitting in the repository uh the metadata enrichment uh algorithms that are used by guardian allowed this to to happen using calling on geonames and the last example i want to uh give you is is sort of uh again the keywords that are enriched here um this is a data set now that's that's an ikrisab dataset uh again the center that's based in india and at the bottom of this you see a keyword cloud um as you did before in this case the the the words here are drawn from both aggravated ontologies the earlier example i showed you was agrabox um and and where the ontologies particularly common to play even sometimes they're behind the scenes they're not necessarily part of this cloud but but they very much play a role in making data further discoverable say to google data so it's quite important in in in making the data fair not only within guardian but much beyond that increasing the the the discoverability of uh data more widely data assets more widely so this is my last slide i just want to talk quickly about some of the challenges that the team has faced um the scio team and in enriching in in in using these kinds of approaches and of course one of them is is harmonization in the in in the harvesting and harmonization step so here for cgir particular particularly we we do use a consistent metadata data schema that's um a sort of a an extension of dublin core um but there are differences in interpretation of labels and even if the metadata schema used by our our uh partners who we who we harvest from maps to to to dublin core um it it is a difficult proposition as has been referred to in earlier presentations i talked a little bit about deduping records um so that can be sort of a uh you know we have to be careful about doing that as well uh the quality and the richness of metadata uh uh is both of them are quite highly variable so so that you know for instance um for for uh in some instances you might see words in some in other instances you see something close to sentences or paragraphs in the keywords field which makes it a difficult proposition to know how to deal with um and then of course there's uh in in in some for some records um the the metadata uh is quite rich and in others it's it's very poor there there are you know just the most basic metadata available so there the text mining approaches that are used by our algorithms are become even more important with automated enrichment comes as sort of a pitfall as well so there's the potential for misinterpretation uh for instance i i came across a a data set a spatial a data set about spatial data and they talked in the abstract about grid cells but that was being interpreted by our algorithms as cells and so when you clicked on the on the cells in the in that cloud in the of the keywords what you got what you saw was a bunch of stuff on organismal you know the biological equivalent of cells which is not what this was about at all so so there's a danger there as well and then the the the one you know does one size fit fit all and it doesn't typically because here we're talking largely about um a variety of scales all the way from the genetic to the landscape um and in terms of disciplines all the way from the genomics to or the omics types of disciplines uh to socioeconomics to spatial data and there uh you know it's it's always a sort of a tussle um and and compromises are involved in terms of the the metadata and enriching that of course has its own special challenges and pitfalls as you can imagine so that's um pretty much all i wanted to say i wanted to give you a flavor of how we approach this at cgir and i'm happy to take questions later on thank you thank you mida um excellent so we move to our last um presentation um [Music] and this is uh it's going to be delivered by laura medjularo is the team leader of the land portal foundation and she's responsible for the overall management implementation and expansion of the land portal i will be passing the slides on behalf laura just let me know laura when uh you want me to move thank you emma can you hear me yes thank you so much um thank you for this opportunity first of all i just wanted to say that introduce also my colleague carlo tejo who created these slides with me and we will be presenting uh together uh thank you so much so next slide please let me introduce uh quickly who we are the lamport foundation is a small dutch non-profit organization we've been working over the last 10 years to address the extreme fragmentation of land data providing a free and open information uh for for a rather small community so the land sector uh the land governance sector is a very specialized sector within the agricultural domain um and according to it so they have very special needs so according to land researchers and practitioners so access to land is key for nutrition and food security and increases investment agricultural productivity improves people live food so so access to land is at the heart of this small specialized community i'm not um i mean our numbers are much smaller than those of my previous colleagues but i just wanted to uh let you understand what what what audience and what community we are serving so when it comes to access to data and information it's proved to be very close close sector the vast majority of land governance data remains closed fragmented poorly organized with poor metadata and many times with no metadata at all so they're representing if you search for land information on the web you you can find only few information providers so this means a very narrow range of perspectives and content to keep to be published in a way that is not doesn't facilitate discovery discovery engagement and reuse so because land is a cross-cutting issue and very um politicized so analyzing land governance often means looking at not only different data types but also diff across different domains so it also involves looking at different data stakeholders so not only academia so research data but also the data provided by governments um civil society or private sector um data providers so different with different degrees of data capabilities so our response to this extreme extreme fragmentation and accessibility of information is twofold so on one hand we develop an archer a multilingual platform lanportal.org that hosts a wide range of um organized country issuing data set pages where we aggregate and pull content data of different types such as bibliographic data statistical indicators spatial layers we create a repository of experts and sector organizations media content especially from southern countries and on the other hand we try to build capacity data capacity in the sector and also um a data infrastructure so in a few years the lan port has become a leading online destination for data and information in the sector so we have three main systems we have a geoportal that aggregates spatial layers a drupal website that aggregates bibliographic data a media content and a triple store for statistical data for the purpose of this presentation we will mainly focus on the land library that is a drupal instance where we maintain and create a repository of land governance related resources pulled from multiple sources in which the metadata mapped to semantic standards so next slide please this is our lan library so it includes again for us this is a big number and 61 500 selected resources but i recognize that is a very small number compared to previous repositories but is this content is either published directly by our community of users or ingested through automatic importers most are metadata but sometimes we we upload the the pdf the resource as well so as as you can see is is a very a small and repository that select content for a specialized community of uh experts speaking different languages from different geographies so we pull resources from a number of different sources and improve the quality of native metadata and the same time we also encourage partners to publish metadata and better metadata so in our library we adopt a customized version of the meaningful bibliographic metadata m2b to provide users even more information about the the resources that exist in them in the library so this um custom adjustments to the m2b um include for instance making some fields mandatory such as the the subject field and mainly because we also create um a a semantic set of controlled vocabulary on land which is part of other vocab we'll explain in a few minutes so we also assure the quality of this metadata by including license language geographical focus that is very important for our audience and for the value of the metadata fields we use standard codes such as the the the eso 300 100 3160 c's one alpha three codes for countries or the unm 49 code for areas and regions and as i said before for the subjects we use agrovoc and in particular um a sub schema of agrowork called lanvok is a small 300 set of keywords or concept highly relevant to the small sector that we serve and so we contributed developing landmark and maintaining landform within agroc up to my colleague now that explains the data flow thank you very much so in the next slide so here uh in this slide i want to show you how data flow when we import information from some parties into the lan port so at the beginning we have the sources sources that could be very different from mono generated excel file that follows a structure that is shared in the in the lamp portal website to adjacent respond from cms as wordpress uh or xml respond from a dspace for instance the dsps api so we have this as the source in the b in the middle we we have what we call the importers that are piece of software that mapping the map to things we need to map the fields itself so a field in the source will be filled in the in the lampportal metadata it could be some of them and also we need also to to map the values because we are using several closed lists in the ram portal and we need to do some kind of mapping between the two the two values and finally in order to ingest this information into the lamp. that is a drupal website we use the fit important feature and during this whole process during the whole process there are tasks of data correlation so if we we see that there is an issue with with the metadata or with a value we contact directly our partners our the data providers in order to raise this potential issue something that is important to highlight that it's in in the land portal we are trying to not uh host pdfs we are not trying to host the publications we are always trying to point back to the source and we only try to collect the metadata not the pdfs so in the next slide we can see some of the challenge that we are we are facing as uh my previous colleagues mentioned i think that is more or less the same that we have very different sources so as as we need to deal with different uh sources um some common challenges arise so the first thing is to find relevant relevant information because our sector is really small so trying to find information is is not easy after that it was okay this source is is interesting i have relevant information so what can we do how many documents this source have so if there are too many maybe we can go to a machine approach working with some kind of software uh python importers or maybe we need just to to fill uh the metadata and spreadsheet and ingest it and uh well the cms is that [Music] the content management systems that are behind the organizations the data providers are very different in terms of of the cms itself or maybe it could be an html page and also the version and working with different cms and different versions make us to change the approach each time and also the type of format the data format of the source could be like rtf csv xml json files ris very different also the metadata mapping we need to do one by one okay this field imagine that in the sort we have um a dc contributor maybe in our website could be or should be a an author we need to do this kind of mapping and also the data values um another challenge that we have is the multilingualism mainly for the data creation because we can start more or less some languages but other languages are out of the scope and sometimes you don't know if there is a problem or not in the in the quality of the data last to mention is that we use a lambok as for tagging the content and not only for tagging the content we are also using uh lamvok that is a subset of a concept of aggro block also for harvesting in order to find relevant sources so trying to map sometimes uh the source to this lamborgh is a challenge and now i give back the floor to my colleague laura next slide please so to conclude uh we learned that what we learned over the past 10 years is this is a very challenging sector because it's absolutely fragmented fragmented data information is is highly fragmented and enclosed in silas so what we usually recommend to our data partners is to to have an an openness default mindset and follow fur principle so the capacity development is as important as maintaining and creating common open repositories we recommend to use standards in data any metadata to show the data metadata model um establish channel 4 for continued feedback and collaboration with our partners is more a partnership rather than serving uh uh kind of an audience but one of the most important lessons that we learned over the past years is that collaboration is key so collaborating with like-minded organizations like those that are sitting in this panel today in the sector is is very important joining forces to improve accessibility of scientific literature promoting the use of standards spread best practices promote and build capacity development and and also another key lesson is building on what already exists without reinventing things like reusing existing semantic vocabularies for instance and build communities of practice around uh those standards to the help improving constantly improving and promoting them this this is very important is one of the most important lessons i wanted to share thank you very much thank you laura and thank you so much carlos so i think that we are and thank you to all the panelists i think that you did a great job it's uh six to six here in in the european eastern time i presume it's 1206 in washington dc so uh thank you so much to all of you so we kind of start now what we call the questings and answers um i haven't seen too many questions from the audience um but i will encourage you once again that if you have any um any kind of yeah question to to for any of the panelists please use the chat box and we will answer as soon as possible in the meantime i have some questions for you for all our panelists and i was i would like to put them on the table and perhaps to have a kind of a round and to know a little bit what all of you think about um i mean these these topics i think that in some cases you already mentioned uh how crucial to recommend and and to promote good practices is um are let's say in in our domain as much as it happens as well in other domains but what recommendations specifically you think that we could provide to organizations and to enhance this visibility of their resources through the improvement of the quality of metadata what kind of steps would you suggest more specifically that we could do to help them or what you would recommend to them in laura you were very specific in your presentation right now talking about a specific community that you are targeting so maybe do you want to expand a little bit more what you mentioned before about this kind of recommendations that you are preparing for for instance workshops or um publications videos yes of course as i mentioned the building capacities um goes hand in hand with building the the sector infrastructure so on one hand we work with the the agribook team to develop landvoc as part of the general infrastructure and then on the other hand will build capacity through moocs workshops or tutorials for people to improve their knowledge management capacity with their data management capacity so we encourage them to you to to create metadata to enrich their metadata to expose their metadata in the right way to use standards in their metadata fields um that's and again building a community that supports those best practices is is very important um from from different uh sectors so in in the landmark community of experts for instance we welcome um leaders from civil society organizations or a representative of government organizations or researchers from universities so all with different needs and slightly different perspectives but we won core idea in mind that the sharing data is very important to improve land governance thank you thank you laura amita would you like to add something about lessons learned on these sites uh from her experience a lot of experience with researchers and cgir yeah yes i can tell you a few things um i'll keep my remarks clean though um so so i i like what laura said i mean i think it's really important to work um within the community uh a community and across communities so one of the things that we're doing is is to work uh within communities of practice uh and that helps to train and build capacity within our own communities of practice in this case uh it could be data managers and information specialists across cgir but more broadly even beyond cgir so so anything that we do uh will be open to to others as well um part of this focuses around capacity building as laura mentioned a lot of it is also about culture change so with when you're working with researchers um you know the the i was going to mention the third thing which is tools and services but really the biggest rub is the culture um and that's what you have to change um and and to do that there there are multiple ways in which we we're trying to do that one is to to to build the capacity to to build the the tools um to to answer the question of what's in this for me that the researchers need to sort of effectively understand and and respond to um and basically to incentivize the the proper annotation and the proper handling the proper management of our data assets why you know more broadly speaking um that takes many forms it could be through uh you know how researchers are rewarded let's get away from the model where people are rewarded only for you know high impact factor publications this is a message we're consistently trying to push out um how are you managing your data how fair is the data we've got metrics now to kind of you know put a quantitative stamp on how fair data is so that you can start to now incentivize it more broadly through um annual evaluations for instance off researchers of scientists um be you know putting in place rewards having data sprints that that our data managers and information specialists organize on our pretty routine level uh hackathon you know pureathons they call them data curatons and and data sprints where researchers are able to come in spend two hours or half a day with very much hands-on uh you know help to make to annotate their data assets better so these are all pieces that we need to put in place combined with the tools and the services such as the fair workflows that i mentioned earlier which will help um researchers in the agricultural space particularly annotate their data consistently and very easily uh the idea is to make it easy and and you know let let researchers uh you know be able to to do that that way so many different approaches i would say i see aaron agreeing with all the things that you're saying erin would you like to say something else about that yes um that's the incentivization just trying to convince people to produce better metadata is is huge because when you're uploading data files if you don't have good metadata you don't know what that is and no one can reuse it and a lot of times researchers they're so strapped for time that they don't it's an afterthought metadata's an afterthought and then at that point once they get their publication they they're just scrambling to go on to the next thing and so we're trying to build it into the process so that it's maybe more from the beginning like with the usda first of all we are now um required to have data management plans so they have to start thinking about where they're going to put their data and how they're going to share their data and all of that what what they're going to produce what standards they're going to use at the beginning before they even get the grant and so that is we're hoping that that helps to increase just they're thinking about it that they're they're thinking about it they're coming up with that plan and that it's built into their culture it is a culture change and you know unless it's in unfortunately in those cases unless it's mandated a lot of people won't do it because they don't have the time and they look at that metadata form and then the other the other step is for us to make it more accessible for them so they see a huge metadata form and they get intimidated and we are also offering webinars and and tutorials and one-on-one sessions and group sessions to help educate people and take the take the shock out of it when they see that right you can may add just one word i what airing is saying about culture is absolutely important so the the the idea of sharing data is absolutely an attitude and we notice that people for instance they don't think about the license of their data and if they don't put any license that's that's close by default so but they don't put the license just because they don't think about it not just not because sometimes they don't want to share the data so it's really changing the attitude of how people deal with data and they don't think about sharing a data management plan before they start working on a publication when they finish a publication they think their job is done and and they don't realize that if they don't share it they don't make it open then it's not really useful right 37 whether you would like you had a specific dislike about all these but i don't know whether you would like to add something more yes i would like to add something i really agree about uh the reach the asking for rich metadata and especially to make that available but i want to add something about the technology so i think that in this sector we are very late we are still talking about uh sharing the data and making data available while that should be given for granted tim berners-lee 20 years ago was talking about publishing your data make raw data available and so over now we live in the area of uh the technology so what we should really think is not only sharing the data but it's sharing the data in a way that machines can do a better job with the data so for example using standard metadata properties of course allows the machine to better understand what's going on without using very sophisticated algorithms that need training datasets and specialized id knowledge then for example also relying on vocabularies existing vocabularies or aligning your vocabulary with existing vocabularies can help of course connecting resources can help data discover you can update a representation so the usage of vocabulary is uri so once there are alignments then we solve a lot of issues with understanding the meaning of the data with the possibility to link things together uh and then when you publish the data for example on a website the possibility to annotate pages with schema.org and using metadata so that search engines can understand what's going on in your website or if you have an api like document your api in a machine readable way or using tools like swagger so overall i understand that we have 20 years of delay because we still have to face with problems related to making that available while we should address the next step the next series of problems like making data available for machines so to solve a lot of other issues that we have now right right carlos i don't know whether you would i like to to say something about what febreze was mentioning i saw that you were listening very carefully or yes um yeah just i was thinking about uh we were talking about a lot about reinventing the wheel all the time that we don't reinvent the wheel but we're thinking more about not tripping on the same stone and we are facing the same challenge the same different people in several places so maybe something that to think about is to have a kind of session about what are the lesson learned and what are the the the actually the the the the issues that arises in in every kind of integration because i think that fabricio and i we we get the same errors from different places um sometimes you have this lesson learned somewhere you you will overcome this these issues faster right so this brings me to another question that is more about a suggestion so because i see that we all have the same problems in a very similar way so i'm just thinking what um what kind of next steps we could take as leaders of of of important information systems in agricultural sciences to join forces to to really uh um work on um together to to to to um to let's say overcome with this this these challenges or there is any activity do you think that we there is any kind of uh um context where you think that we could simply make sure that there is this duplication that even carlos is mentioning in another area but in general that we are finding ourselves in different areas could be shared lessons learned sharing standardization of data i'm so i would have walked all over the place so what makes me very happy since uh eventually i'm the aggravate manager and i'm working as well with nalt to map both vocabularies so this is very very uh important at the moment but there is any anything that you think that we could um work together i know that for instance uh if i was working with laura in doing capacity development activities we are supporting uh the alarm portal as much as we can also with inl we are working on this mapping i was mentioning with nida we are also working in some some areas related to mapping ontologies in cir and et cetera et cetera this one of some of the areas but do you have anything else in mind that you could you think that we could do together to improve this situation that we put on the table today i have a thought about that and it actually relates in part to something someone just typed in the chat about dealing with rigorous standards and metadata standards for different subject areas and that's one challenge that we have we're dealing with genomics data and life cycle assessment data and geospatial data and it's all ag related but in the ag cross example that i showed in my in my slide may be finding ways to find where the subject specific um people are keeping their data and finding ways to standardize it in order to make it more findable but then to point back so that they don't have to necessarily conform to one standard and i think medha mentioned this in her presentation that we can't it you can't make one one size fits all it doesn't and so what we should be doing is trying to figure out who's searching what are they trying to accomplish and then getting together and figuring out how we can facilitate that so whether it's using a standard vocabulary to integrate into one platform that people can search and then go off into their subject specific maybe something to something like that i mean we do that to a lesser degree i mean we're focusing on u.s united states data usda data specifically but um some of you are aggregating what we collect and so if we can feed into that i would love to know what would make it easier as you're taking in our data to make it more discoverable you know on a larger platform right okay do you have [Music] any other comments mida falizio laura carlos i mean one of the things that occurs to me is here we have you know some of the pr you know fairly some fairly important platforms in in agriculture um and repositories and we could rope in a few others perhaps world bank for instance in a and a couple of other entities uh but it would it would perhaps be helpful to together develop um a framework or a set of principles that that we stamp with with our presence essentially with our organizational uh presence and and float out there as as sort of guidelines um along with attached tools that that people can choose from it doesn't have to be your tool or my tool we don't have to choose among them but we we make make it possible for people to not only see what what best practice really might be or is really but but also how do i actually make it simple for me you want me to do this tell me how to do it and i'll do it you know that that sort of approach needs to be uh could could perhaps be helpful um the other thing i would say is you know in terms of incentivization one of the things that we're doing um that that i'm trying to figure out how this group could work um together on is one of the things we're trying to do is show researchers what the value is of well-described data what can data science do for you and so one of the you know one of the sort of the small projects that the big data platform funded through the organized module is uh you know answering the broad question of you know is fertilizer used really really um profitable in africa we all go with the assumption that it actually increases yields but does it actually uh translate to profit and if so where and so this was done using guardian uh they you know the researchers a team of three primary researchers found uh 200 data sets in guardian 760 locations and they were able to put you know uh use machine learning over this kind of data pool this these data points um to derive some insight and and actually found that it's not always um you know even where yields are very high profits can be very low because it depends of course as you might expect on on uh market value of the of the crop on on the price of fertilizer etc so being able to pool all of these data and spatially you know identify where where fertilizer is useful it's one of the key things that we you know that's that's a key question for for um african agriculture and and we can do that uh and and once researchers see this kind of thing being done they get really excited about it so can we then uh you know with these growing data pools come up with these kinds of use cases that would be very interesting i think in terms of changing hearts and minds right yeah yeah well yep right sorry all right oh no this uh this example is uh it's very it's very nice and i think that this is the last uh step of the chain because as far as i see now there are two two two different groups so there are the producers of the data and as we are saying we cannot oblige them to use a common standard a common format they produce the data they can produce it what we can do as aggregators and agress is doing already that but we can always do it better is to do capacity development with them when we receive the data with wrong metadata and in the wrong places so for example there is the alternative title and you find there the journal title you have to tell them that this is this is not working so this is the the first thing that we can do work with the producer of the data and help them to produce something better all the rest is up to us so uh the harmonization of the data the media enrichment and we have to to do an effort sometimes we're going to do a joint effort because everybody has their own way to to to be funded so we are also guided by what we find outside but what we could do is to [Music] to work together to like recommendations that we can use uh that we can use all together when it's time to urbanize the data when it's time to give some not truths but recommendations to publish the data and to make that available because then at that point there is the third step that meta was saying and all this will help the usage of the data to discover to create new knowledge and to this to discover new things but as aggregators we have a responsibility to guide the data providers and between us even if uh there can be like uh political and institutional problems to to at least write down some guidelines that we can all follow well we belong to a very small um community so we always we always had major uh benefits from collaboration collaborating with other aggregators and within a wider sector like the agriculture sector i certainly welcome the idea of developing common tools or guidelines facilitates to facilitate interoperability and raise awareness and and to me is is also a matter of making um i mean one of the incentives for instance in my opinion is really demonstrate what the consequences of a closed data environment are what a close date environment will look like and why a more um interoperable uh this environment is is than the more democratic so this is a kind of the um the argument that we bring to the table all the times is making data visible interoperable means making the data landscape more democratic and diverse we are almost finishing the panel session but i just realized that there is a question for meta that says can you say more about your metrics for how fair the data is yeah so um i i saw that and i pulled up uh i'm sharing my screen again just to show you how we do this um so so this is the the guardian landing page guardian.bigdata.cgr.org if you go to about guardian or if you do a search in guardian um every every resource you'll see a fair metrics uh linked to and and you can go to sorry to analytics here and when you go to analytics you see something about um you know fairness across particularly across cgir but you can go to view metrics here and it tells you a little bit about how we're actually scoring for fare and and basically what that amounts to is that we're using um if i click on that download the the the guide we've got a guide here a step-by-step sort of blow-by-blow guide on how you get to zero from zero to level five for bo for all of these things for f a i and r um so this is what we've tried to use in in terms of how we score uh it's built on the on the netherlands uh archive for its dance i can never remember what it stands for it's somewhere here permanent access to digital research resources dance roughly translated so we've used their metrics to to develop these algorithms and so each data asset in guardian is scored that way we're changing our our interface so you'll see something like this now with a very large data management toolkit and if you go to that to that toolkit um at the very bottom for instance you you'll see you can browse them and so if you go to data curation you'll see the fair data guidelines here and the fair data workflow uh will be available soon as well there in another couple of weeks thank you so much meda this brings us to the end of this session i would really like to thank to all the panelists for such a nice one hour and a half i have really enjoyed to list listening to all of you and i hope that attendees also enjoyed this um this session as well as you have seen this is just the beginning of something else and we hope that perhaps in another time we will uh talk more about what we we are going to do together as we were putting on the table today so thank you to everybody thank you as well for the organizes of dc and i and for giving to us this opportunity is very",
