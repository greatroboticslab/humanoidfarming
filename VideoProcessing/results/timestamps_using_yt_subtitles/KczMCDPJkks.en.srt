hi I'm Melissa Sakura and BSU Extension

2
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:16,750
agent agriculture and natural resources

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:19,180
for sergeant cabbage today I'm going to

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:23,140
be preparing my garden for the growing

5
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:25,180
season with a few simple steps if you

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,300
haven't taken a soil sample in a few

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:30,190
years it's recommended that you do so so

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,670
you know you're available nutrient

9
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:36,460
levels in your soils and yes you

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,589
Extension has a video available that

11
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:43,690
walks you through the process of taking

12
00:00:38,589 --> 00:00:46,089
a sample if you have questions once you

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,949
have your soil test results you'll be

14
00:00:46,089 --> 00:00:50,440
able to determine if a fertilizer

15
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:53,350
application is needed or not

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:56,460
when preparing my garden I want to make

17
00:00:53,350 --> 00:01:07,690
sure to remove any old plant materials

18
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:10,180
from the sterile surface removing these

19
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:13,120
plant materials will help reduce my

20
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:18,250
chances of spreading diseases that may

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:20,410
have overwintered when determining if my

22
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,410
garden soil is ready to be worked or not

23
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:26,050
I'm going to look at the soil moisture

24
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:29,470
about two to three inches deep so now

25
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:31,890
I'm going to take a sample look at the

26
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,890
moisture

27
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:50,090
the soil here is easily crumbling apart

28
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:53,890
then it's ready to be worked if it stays

29
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:56,810
in a ball and doesn't fall apart easily

30
00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:00,459
you'll want to wait a few days for the

31
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:05,649
soil to dry out if you work your soil

32
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:10,310
when it's too wet it's going to form

33
00:02:05,649 --> 00:02:15,040
clumps and it's gonna be really hard for

34
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:21,170
those seeds to germinate and establish

35
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:25,910
in that soil before working your soil

36
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:30,560
you may choose to add compost which will

37
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:34,760
help with nutrient and water holding if

38
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,610
your soil is ready to be worked you can

39
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,060
kill your garden to provide for a nice

40
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:44,599
seed bed perhaps you have a smaller gun

41
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:49,250
area or a raised bed and you can also

42
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:53,359
use your shovel and rig to provide a

43
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:57,829
nice seed bed to go many gardeners are

44
00:02:53,359 --> 00:03:00,799
also choosing no-till as an option when

45
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:04,609
planning for my gardening season I want

46
00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:08,720
to make sure I have enough space between

47
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:10,609
rows so I get until throughout the girl

48
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,000
named season to kill the weeds if needed

49
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:17,060
I also want to make sure I plant enough

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,319
space between my plants for them to have

51
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:23,959
adequate room to grow and I want to plan

52
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:26,750
for my crop rotations so I'm not

53
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:29,900
planting my tomatoes in the same spot

54
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:33,670
every year I like to use a garden

55
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:37,209
journal when planning for the season

56
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:39,670
that way I can plan my rotation my

57
00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:42,010
available space and I can also make

58
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:44,319
notes in my journal throughout the

59
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:47,380
growing season and which varieties I

60
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,650
liked and didn't like and reference it

61
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:52,810
from here to here if you have any

62
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,989
questions about preparing and planning

63
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,970
your garden contact your local NDSU

64
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:00,360
Extension agent and they'd be happy to

65
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,360
help
