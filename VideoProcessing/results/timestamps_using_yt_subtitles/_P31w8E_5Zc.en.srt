1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,840
in my youth we learned in school that it

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,279
takes 500 years to build an inch of

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,230
topsoil but there are people who are

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,780
doing it 500 times faster than that and

5
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,700
if these practices were adopted on a

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,150
global scale according to some estimates

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,789
it could offset all emissions we can

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,260
begin drawdown like right now but we'd

9
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:22,710
sacrifice agricultural productivity

10
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:25,050
right no actually these methods can be

11
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,269
as productive or more productive than

12
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,640
chemical based agriculture there's two

13
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,570
things though that they do require that

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,649
represent a profound shift in our

15
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,450
agricultural system and our entire

16
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,250
society the first is that they are more

17
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,950
labor-intensive in the United States

18
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,629
approximately 1% of the population is

19
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,120
directly engaged in farming that might

20
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,969
have to go up to 10% as it was in 1950

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,309
and maybe if you include gardens maybe

22
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:55,230
go up to 50% and the other is that in

23
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:57,090
regenerative agriculture what works in

24
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,739
one place may not work on another

25
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:00,960
continent or even in the next Valley

26
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,049
over the only way to make them work is

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,689
to be a patient attentive observer of

28
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:08,610
that particular land so it requires an

29
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:12,119
ongoing intimate relationship that is

30
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:14,369
unique between the human interacting

31
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,229
with that land and the land itself that

32
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:18,540
does not fit into an industrial model

33
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,430
the essence of industrialization is

34
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,409
standardization that's what makes it

35
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,259
efficient that's what allows a machine

36
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,820
to do it in order to have a truly

37
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:28,799
regenerative agricultural system we have

38
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,450
to undo that way of thinking and that's

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,670
another reason why we need more people

40
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:34,670
in close relationship to the land

41
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,570
you
