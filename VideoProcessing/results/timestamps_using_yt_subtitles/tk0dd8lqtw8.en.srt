00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,400
hello my name is dana jokola and i'm a

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,920
graduate student working with dr aj nair

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,320
in the sustainable vegetable production

4
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,720
lab

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,560
at iowa state university today is august

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,439
13th and we are here at the horticulture

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,359
research station

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,039
in ames iowa and i wanted to give you a

9
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,160
brief update on the research that i'm

10
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,160
doing on

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,439
reduced tillage systems for organic

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,199
vegetable production

13
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,800
i'd like to acknowledge the series trust

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,480
and north central ser who have both

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,200
provided funding for this project

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,719
so thanks to those organizations so

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,600
while no-till has become relatively

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,120
common in

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,879
field crop production in some parts of

20
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,600
this country it has remained relatively

21
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,680
absent from

22
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,360
organic production mostly because

23
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,280
organic farmers rely on

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,280
tillage and mechanical cultivation for

25
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,280
weed control however tillage has a

26
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,640
number of adverse effects on soil health

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,920
and so we're working on systems that

28
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,760
will allow us to minimize

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,280
the tillage in this study we're going to

30
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,680
look at two such systems

31
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,039
no-till and strip till in the production

32
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,840
of organic broccoli

33
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,439
and peppers so these systems are based

34
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,840
on the use of cover crops

35
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,680
for weed control the idea is to grow an

36
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,960
in-situ mulch

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,960
through which you can eventually

38
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,439
transplant your crop or plant your seeds

39
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,320
so in this study we seeded rye and vetch

40
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,880
last fall

41
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,200
on september 12th at a rate of 90 pounds

42
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,799
per acre for the rye and 25 pounds per

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,560
acre for the vetch

44
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,759
you'll notice that the planting date is

45
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,560
a little on the earlier end of the

46
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,400
spectrum

47
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,840
and the seeding rate was a little on the

48
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,960
higher end of the spectrum and those are

49
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,320
both intentional

50
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,079
they're both required in order to

51
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,799
generate sufficient biomass with the

52
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,640
cover crop

53
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,040
in order to suppress weeds for the

54
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,479
subsequent growing season

55
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,479
so the cover crops grew throughout the

56
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,360
fall and the spring and then

57
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,000
in late may they start to flower so now

58
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,159
when

59
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
rye reaches anthesis which is pollen

60
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,880
shed and the vetch reaches

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,520
early pod stage they can both be fairly

62
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,560
well

63
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,880
terminated by mechanically rolling them

64
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,560
with a tool called a roller crimper

65
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,320
in this study we have three whole plot

66
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,640
treatments no-till

67
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,239
strip till and then conventional till

68
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,560
the conventional till is the system

69
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,800
used most commonly by organic vegetable

70
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,440
growers in the midwest

71
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,280
each of those plots were subdividing

72
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,720
into two subplots to test out two

73
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,520
different nitrogen fertilization

74
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,120
strategies

75
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,920
in the first we apply the full rate of

76
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,920
nitrogen 150 pounds for broccoli 80

77
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,760
pounds for pepper

78
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,440
using a granular dehydrated chicken

79
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,640
manure product which we banned just

80
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,879
before planting

81
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,000
in the second subplot we're applying

82
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,319
just two-thirds rate

83
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,680
of that granular fertilizer pre-plant

84
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,319
and then we apply the remainder

85
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,680
using fertigation of a liquid fish

86
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,400
product

87
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,280
in four events starting three weeks

88
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
after planting

89
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,040
and then repeating every 10 days for

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,720
four events

91
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,959
so we've only just begun harvest in the

92
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,239
last few days so it's too early to tell

93
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,159
how the yields are going to compare

94
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,440
between treatments but our

95
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,680
hypothesis is that we're going to be

96
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,879
able to achieve equal yields between the

97
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,319
no-till and strip till

98
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,400
and the conventional till we have

99
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,959
however been collecting data on nitrate

100
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,959
leaching

101
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,319
in all the plots using lysometers which

102
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,480
are installed in the plots

103
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,159
and pretty consistently across the first

104
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,319
four collections we've seen that

105
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,200
the conventional till plots are leaching

106
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,280
at a rate

107
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,720
four times greater than the no-till and

108
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,959
the strip till

109
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,720
which is important because we're seeing

110
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,080
widespread nitrate contamination of

111
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,200
groundwater issues and

112
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,319
iowa has introduced a reduction strategy

113
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,959
to try to reduce

114
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,599
the amount of nitrates going into the

115
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,200
groundwater

116
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,440
so it turns out that no-till and strip

117
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,080
till using these surface mulches

118
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,159
might be a good way to achieve that i'm

119
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,080
here in a conventional till plot

120
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,599
as you can see there is no cover crop on

121
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,120
the soil surface

122
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,799
the cover crop was incorporated with a

123
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,920
rototiller prior to planting and has

124
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,720
mostly broken down

125
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,560
at this point and we have had to come

126
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,879
through with a rototiller twice to till

127
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,040
in between the rows to control weeds

128
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,959
okay here we are in a strip till plot

129
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,680
and as you can see we have about a 12

130
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,239
inch wide tilled band where the crop is

131
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,080
planted

132
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,599
and this provides some of the benefits

133
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,000
of conventional tillage

134
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,439
in the row where the crop is planted

135
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,799
while we have done a little bit of

136
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,239
weeding between the plants

137
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,639
we've done no weeding in between the

138
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,880
rows where as you can see we still have

139
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,759
a nice mulch suppressing weeds

140
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,759
so we're here in a no-till plot and as

141
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,520
you can see there is a mulch covering

142
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,720
the majority of the soil surface

143
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,000
in these plots and the peppers are

144
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,560
looking healthy

145
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,240
and you can see that we have a nice

146
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,800
still pretty thick mulch here that's

147
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,280
suppressing weeds in between the rows

148
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
okay this is the roller crimper this is

149
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,600
an eight

150
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,360
foot inj model it was designed by the

151
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,360
rodale institute who did some of the

152
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,560
earliest research on organic no-till

153
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,680
systems

154
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,639
and so it's a barrel that has blades

155
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,880
welded on it in a chevron pattern

156
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,199
and the blades crimp the stems of rye

157
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,240
along the length of it and allow the

158
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,479
cover crop to

159
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,479
dry down and kill more reliably

160
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,360
you can also fill the barrel with water

161
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,960
which adds additional weight

162
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,400
resulting in a more effective kill as

163
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,479
well

164
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,080
this is a hindker 6000 strip tiller

165
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,360
which we used in this project to create

166
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,919
the strips

167
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,039
it has several components up front it

168
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,800
has row cleaners

169
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,800
which move the rye mulch out of the way

170
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,800
next there is a coulter which cuts

171
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,240
through any remaining rye stems

172
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,400
which would get in the way of the rest

173
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,039
of the strip tiller

174
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,759
following that is a subsoil shank with a

175
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,080
rolling disc

176
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,280
on either side these discs are designed

177
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,880
to float

178
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,280
however we found that in order to

179
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,160
successfully till in the rye

180
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,720
we had to put a u-bolt and fix it to the

181
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,639
frame of the strip tiller

182
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,400
the shank also allows us to deliver

183
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,160
fertilizer in the row

184
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,840
with this side dressing unit that's

185
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,160
mounted above

186
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,639
then lastly there's a rolling basket

187
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,199
which breaks up any remaining clods

188
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,880
that would be in the planting area we

189
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,639
used the strip tiller at two points

190
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,960
during the growing season

191
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,639
once in the fall about six weeks after
