  "text": "[Music] and my life. [Music] Namaste and welcome to the video course on watershed management. Today in module two on sustainable watershed approach and watershed management practices. In lecture number five, we will discuss about the agriculture practices and watershed management. So the topics covered in today's lecture includes watershed ecology and agroecosystems, soil and water conservation management practices, sustainable land management practices, crop management, nutrients and pest management, integrated farming, and finally a case study. Some of the important keywords in today's lecture include agroecosystems, agriculture management, nutrient and pest management and integrated farming. So as we discussed in earlier lectures like sustainable water management or sustainable land management or uh the sustainability issues are all very important in in watershed management. So uh in in any of the waterershed which we consider one of the important land use is the agriculture. So we have to see what are the important issues as far as the uh agricultural management is concerned. What are the important issues in sustainable agriculture management. So uh as far as watershed uh in many parts of the world are concerned uh watersheds are experiencing pressure from high population growth, climate, land use change and overexploitations of natural resources. So you can see the effect of population growth and then the land use change all these are directly influencing the agricultural practices uh within the watershed. So as we discussed earlier to stop the degradation of natural resources and to understand the sustainable agriculture management practices we need to deal with upstream and downstream resources management challenges. So what are the major challenges within the waterershed as far as various resources are concerned how we deal with the uh the management of those resources. Then uh the sustainable agriculture management is concerned. Uh we have to deal with the uh to identify sustainable land use practices to increase sustainable agriculture production uh and to increase opportunity of rural livelihood. So we can see that in most of the the uh areas the rural people are living mainly based upon the agricultural or the farm outputs. So we have to improve this farm output in a sustainable way. So uh for that on a watershed basis we have to see that the agriculture is sustaining and then the the the land use is sustainable and water use is sustainable. So uh within that we have to see that how we can have better uh agricultural or agriculture water management or agricultural practices. So let us see some of the issues as far as water management in agriculture is concerned. So this uh deals with the interactions and interplay between food, people and nature sectors. So we have already seen earlier when we discussed about the sustainability issues. So the important sectors are food, people and nature. So out of this the food sector produces biomass and influence ecosystem most of the time positively and sometimes negatively. So you can see that as far as agriculture is concerned the water is concerned major use is consumptive. So this is uh can be directly through irrigation or otherwise. So as far as irrigation is concerned there can be major or micro irrigation and many times farmers use excessive irrigation and say this irriated water are largely uh recycled. Then some of the other issues like use of fertilizers and pesticides and then corresponding uh problems like non-point source of pollution in the water either surface or groundwater. So like this we can see that agricultural water use is concerned a large number of issues are there which we have to deal um as far as the particular watershed is concerned or waterershed management is concerned. So uh you can see that when we consider the the three sectors like food people and nature. So the requirement of water for the people is relatively small. uh so uh you can see that say for example if you can see 1 cm per hectare per day for as far as irrigation water is concerned that much water is sufficient for uh thousand people domestic or other usages. So if you consider say the world average as far as agricultural municipal and industrial water usage is concerned the ratio is 70 to 15 to 15%. But say for example in developing country like India this usage is 85% for agricultural uh only 8% for municipal use and 7% for uh industrial sector. So that way you can see that say for example in a country like India major portion of the water is used for agriculture purposes. So if we can save uh the water available water say by doing appropriate agriculture management practices effective water use in agriculture then we can save lot of water. So uh but you can see that in most of the time whenever uh we consider the farming sector for a sustainable agriculture we need irrigation since as we discussed earlier the rainfall is say distributed only for say four or five months. So time wise variation is there then special wise variation is there. So that way we need um regression for sustainable agriculture. uh so that way if you consider say for example the global withdrawal of water for agriculture industry and municipal use and then its total use uh in liter say for example the data from 1900 to 1995 for about 95 years you can see that uh this uh curve shows the total withdrawal and then you can see that this just below this this curve shows the agricultural withdrawal and the municipal usage usage age is much smaller. This white line shows the municipal usage and then this gray line shows the industrial usage. But especially in agriculture lot of water is lost in different ways. So that way with respect to the total withdrawal you can see that the effective water the total water usage is much much less compared to the total withdrawal. So that way if we can save the water which we are using for agriculture by appropriate management practices approp optimal irrigation management practices we can save lot of water and that can be utilized for many other purposes and then also we can use say for for example for further irrigation and other purposes. So if you consider a world average the world average for irrigation is concerned irrigated area covers about 40% of arable lands in the world and rainfford is the rest that means about 60% of the uh arable land in the world is say the water is obtained through rain and only 40% is obtained through uh irrigation. Say for example now if you consider India's agriculture scenario and irrigation is concerned uh so India has about 2% of world's land 4% of fresh water 16% of population and 10% of its cattle so this is the the major issue as far as a developing country like India is concerned we have only 2% of ranch uh but we have 16% of population and then 10% of cattle and only hardly 4% % of fresh water and the geographic areas concerned say India's 329 million hectare of area of which only 47% is cultivated 23 23% is is forested and 7% under non-aggriculture usage and about 23% of the land is wasteland and uh if you consider with respect the population the land availability is concerned per capita availability of land 50 years ago that means In about 1950s it was about 0.9 hectare but now due to the population explosion uh this will be reduced to about.14 hectare by 2050. So that way the land availability compared to any other country it is much much smaller. So that way India is a major problem as far as the the the sustainable practices as far as land um water and agriculture is concerned. So whatever available we have to do it in a better way and out of the cultivated area in India uh about 47 40% is irrigated which produces about 55% of the food requirement of the country and 60% is rainfford producing uh about 47 45% of about 250 metric ton of food required presently. So you can see that 40% of the reated area produces 55% of the food and 60% of rainfed area only produces 45% of the the 250 metric t of food produced. So in 40 years say for example by 2050 uh say government of India wants to increase the reation level such such that we can have more food production. So the irrigation we we want to increase up to at least up to 50% so that 50% is um irrigated area and 50% is of the arable land is um the rainfford area so that that ratio of food production 75% can be produced from reed land and 25% from the rainfford land for out of the 500 metric t of food required by uh 2050. So this is the Indian scenario as far as the the agriculture and uh irrigation requirement uh is concerned. So now uh let us see what are some of the uh the agriculture related issues as far as um especially India is concerned. So uh in India after the independence in 1947 uh there is large increase in agricultural growth rate. Say for example in the 1950s if it was about.3% 60s and 70s or 80s it has increased to 3.5%. So this has mainly happened due to a large number of irriation or reservoir projects implemented in the earlier five-year plans. So that way the irriation capacity has increased and that way the agricultural growth has increased. So then another important issue is say say in the la the first first few five year plans say in 70s and 80s government of India put a lot of efforts to uh improve the agriculture sector through introduction of new high yielding varieties that is say we can call it as first green revolution in ' 70s and then in second green revolution say in ' 80s uh government of India through its agriculture and other ministries concent center on the genetic engineering uh through organized input management and u say farmer services and extension and then also um better seed varieties were implemented in the agriculture sector. So that way we can call this um say 1980s as second green revolution. So that way lot of improvement were taken place in the agriculture sector but of course lot of issues are still there uh in the agriculture sector. So some of the negative trends in spite of the positive trends as we discussed here the negative trends are say per hector yield is low. So compared to other countries like uh USA and China the per hector yield is much lower. Then infrastructure facilities in the farming sector sector are concerned are poor. Then uh say the uh total management aspect is neglected in most of the farming sector. And then also uh you can see that still in rural area the farming is not mechanized. So people are using different types of traditional equipments for farming and then say most of the time the rural farmers are not adopting scientific farming. uh so that way uh say lot of issues are there as far as the agriculture in India is concerned. So uh some of the important constraint as far as agriculture sustainable agriculture India are concerned are listed here. So these are decline in per capita land availability. So as we already discussed that per capita land availability is decreasing due to population explosion. Then stress in water resources. So available water uh is not sufficient for irrigation um due to lack of um say better agriculture management practices, water management practices or lack of availability of sufficient water. Then degradation of soils, the lack of efficient water management, uh monocropping in many areas farmers are with the same crop. So that way uh there are lot of problems as far as nutrient management and then other soil related issues are concerned. Then lack of crop management um negligence of sustainable agriculture. So um say as far as especially most of the farmers are concerned they are not bothered about the sustainability issues as far as agriculture is concerned. And then of course people's a that means the farmers are indifferent to various the scientific farming or mechanization and other issues due to of course various other constraints um the due to lack of availabable resources or due to lack of education and other issues. So that way these are some of the important issues especially in a country like India as far as sustainable agricultural management practices are concerned. So now let us see the water the agriculture management practices within the perspective of watershed. So the we have already seen that uh agriculture practices are very important in in any of the watershed management plans. So uh the agricultural practices following within a watershed uh the the the whatever waterershed plans or management issues we are making. So that will definitely uh affect. So that way let us discuss about the watershed ecohydrology and agroecosystems. So this agroecosystems uh we can define as a subset of ecosystems that defines functional uh representation of coherent agricultural activity uh including interaction of living and non-living components involved uh within the uh watershed. So we are considering a subset of the ecosystems as agroecosystems. uh then we can do various sonation according to the the ecology according to agriculture practices and the climate system. So that way we can call these zones as agroecological zones which are defined as uh land units carved out of agroclimatic zones based on major climate superimposed on length of growing period. So so particular crop is concerned a particular uh say climate season is concerned. So accordingly we can say define this agroecological zones. So this mainly depends up on the moisture availability. Say for example India is concerned we can classify uh India into 20 agroecological regions and 60 agroeco sub regions. So as we defined here agroecological zones indicate uh the various uh issues as far as the agriculture is concerned with respect to land with respect to climate and other issues. So each agro eco sub region has further been classified into eco unit at district level for developing long-term land use strategies. So when we discussed about the sustainable agriculture practices these agroecosystem or agroecological zones are very important since we can implement or we can sort out many issues uh by considering these agroecological zones or agroecological uh sub regions as we discussed. So here in this slide you can see the agroecological regions of India. So these various colors indicate various zones. So these zones are delineated based on physioraphy, soil, u length of growing season and bioclimate of the region. Say for example we can say uh the agriculture ministry has put various nominal culture also. So for example a zone means say a son is called aer zone. So there the it is numbered as A13 EH1 A stands for physioraphy 13 stands for soil scale. EH stands for bioclimatic zone and one st stands for length of growing period. So that way we can put various agroecological zones. Uh so AE zone A13 EH1 is referred as western Himalayas here. So the some of the important characteristics of the zones shallow skelectal soils hyper climates with the length of growing period less than uh 60 days. So that way by by considering this agroecological zones uh we can uh look into various um sustainable agricultural practices or issues and then we can go for planning and management. It can be watershed based planning and management but by considering these type of zones we can implement or we can have various plans. So as we discussed so what are the necessities or what are the need of agricological classification. So the needs are listed here. Uh to assess yield potentialities of different crops, crop combination in agroecological regions or zones. Then to formulate future plan of action involving crop diversification to disseminate uh agricultural uh research and agro technology to other homogeneous areas. And then to determine the crop suitability for optimization of land use in different agroecological regions or zones. So as we discussed so this agroecological region or zones um uh say indicates say what kind of crops say what kind of climate climatic region or what kind of soil pattern is there then we can put plants say like what kind of crops can be grown there what should be the crop period length so like that various issue can be put according to the agricological ical classification or agricological zones or regions and then we can come up with the plans as far as sustainable agriculture practices are concerned. So now uh as far as sustainable agriculture practices are concerned soil conservation and water conservations are two important issues. So let us look into some of the important principles and issues as far as soil and water conservation are concerned. So soil conservation important principles are based upon rainfall of high intensity then erosion of top fertile soil takes place. So we have to stop this soil erosion. So that is uh uh the so by various practices we can reduce the soil erosion. So that is the so-called soil conservation. So we can have uh various measures like condor farming and then say we can plant trees or grass to reduce the soil conservation. So various measures are measures are possible like biological measures like a conservation tillage deep conservation farming and we can go for mechanical measures like terasing uh water disposal uh other low cost measures. So like shown here we can say reduce the soil erosion and we can go for soil conservation using uh various uh techniques. So then as far as water conservation is concerned the principle of the water conservation is say where precipitation is less than crop requirements what what we have to do. So uh then where precipitation is equal to crop requirement or where precipitation is in excess of crop requirements. So accordingly uh these three classes we can uh have a particular um say intervention or particular uh strategy uh say according to the the climatic or rainfall conditions. So in the first case where precipitation is less than crop requirement the strategy includes land treatment to increase runoff onto cropped areas uh following water conservation use of drought tolerant crops uh suitable managing practices. So this is when the precipitation is less than crop requirement. Then second case where precipitation is equal to crop requirement. So the strategy is local conservation of precipitation maximizing storage within the soil profile and storage of excess runoff for subsequent use. So this is when precipitation is almost equal to what is required as far as crop requirements are concerned. And then the third case uh where precipitation is in excess of crop requirements the strategy is to reduce uh rainfall erosion to drain surplus runoff and store the surplus water for subsequent uh use in summer season. So this way as far as uh water conservation is concerned we can uh make particular strategy depending upon the region depending upon the case. Uh we can have either whenever precipitation is less than crop requirement or whenever precipitation uh is almost equal to crop requirement or when precipitation is in excess of crop requirement. So accordingly uh we can go for particular strategy as far as water conservation is concerned. So now uh based upon uh these issues now let us uh discuss the sustainable land management practices. So we have seen the for to achieve sustainable agriculture practices um we need to go for sustainable land management practices. So uh sustainable land management practices that gives um knowledge based it is a knowledge based system which helps to integrate land water biodiversity and environmental management to meet rising food and fiber demands while sustaining ecosystem services and livelihood to meet requirements for the growing population. So we can uh define the sustainable land management like this. So it is a holistic way of sustainable approach as far as land water uh biodiversity environmental management and then uh say the requirement as far as the growing population is concerned. So this sustainable land management or SLM enhances the productive capabilities of land in crop and grazed area. So if you consider the various issues appropriately and we can increase uh the productivity uh the crop yield and then forest forestry can be improved or the the grass land or grazed area can be imbroved. So through sustainable land management uh we can have actions to stop reversed degradation or at least to mitigate adverse effects of uh earlier misuses. So whenever we discussed about the waterershed deterioration issues and related problems uh we have seen that uh say here say the waterershed will be degraded say by various problems various issues as we discussed earlier. So uh through sustainable land management practices we can at least uh reduce what is happening and then also we can reverse the trends so that uh we can have same overall uh sustainable uh development. So now let us look into what are the objectives as far as sustainable land management practice are concerned. Some of the important objectives are listed here to increase land productivity. So that means replenish soil nutrients uh by lying or other means uh and then maintain soil cover. So like cover we can use cover crops and residue recycling. And the second objective is to provide adequate quantity of water. So there is no scarcity of water. So we can use crop forage or tree species with higher water use efficiency. So that depending upon the uh available water uh we can uh go for uh say water resource management using particular crop then to maintain water quality. So water quality is also an issue. So uh here we can protect vegetative filter areas in the repairarian zones to remove excess sediment and nutrients and then also the non-boyant source of pollutions all those we can reduce and then uh third objective is to reduce flooding and flood damage. So as we discussed earlier flooding is always a problem. So we can through sustainable agriculture management practices or sustainable land management practices we can plant deep rooted weightation to enhance infiltration and water consumption by the plants and this also may decrease the soil erosion problems. So these are some of the important objectives as far as sustainable uh land management practice are concerned. So now uh let us look into the sustainable agriculture issues. So first one is the the crop husbandry. So crop husbandry means the practices of uh growing and harvesting crops uh based upon scientific principles and careful management and conservations of uh resources. So whenever the the the cropping pattern so we have to consider the cropping pattern what type of crop is to be used then the various issues uh say as far as soil is concerned water is concerned and then uh the the health of the crop is concerned. So here the crop husbandry includes soil enri en enrichments usage of hybrid and improved seeds and better cropping pattern. So some of the techniques used for improved crop productions include uh soil enrichments by bofertilization. Uh then introduction of micronutrient management uh then usage of hybrid seeds uh achieving optimum plant population so that better production will be there. Then timely and effective we control. So we say in agricultural practices we be control is very important. So we have to timely do the we control then pest management. So these are some of the uh important techniques which we can utilize in crop husbandry so that we can achieve sustainable uh agricultural practices as far as various uh crop management or crop husbandry is uh concerned. Then uh the next issue in sustainable agriculture is nutrient management. Uh so as far as nutrient management is concerned uh it is important to tackle problems like use of inorganic fertilizers. So last few decades farmers are using lot of inorganic fertilizers like ura then phosphates like that. So whenever we use without say optimal use or without scientific say knowledge then what happens is that it decrease the soil fertility and then also it become a pollution source as far as soil and water is concerned. So then other issues as far as nutrient management is concerned to stop uh we growth uh to avoid crop diseases uh improve crop yield. So these are the uh the main uh issues as far as nutrient management is concerned. Then as far as nutrient management is concerned, it includes uh disseminate knowledge of nutrient and its function to plant growth. uh so most of the time say in a country like India the farmers are not well educated so we can disseminate the knowledge say why we had to study a nutrient analysis as far as particular area particular waterershed is concerned and then how to improve the nutrient say in the soil so we can disseminate the knowledge and then its function say in plant growth as far as nutrient management is concerned. Then assessment of nutrient availability as far as the waterershed is concerned and then nutrient management like supply deficient nutrients to the soil also avoid excess use to protect the environment. So as I discussed for example the nitrate phosphate and then sapotage nk is concerned. So you can see that the last few decades um many areas farmers are using this um uh this the important nutrients like NPK. Uh so what happens when it is overuse is there it becomes uh an environmental problems and when whenever underutilize underuse is there so then it becomes a deficient nutrient as far as the particular area is concerned. So that way we should look into an effective nutrient management as far as a particular area or particular waterershed is uh concerned. Then let us further look into the nutrient and its functions. So uh there are two basic types of nutrients. One is so called macronutrients. So these macronutrients are available in soil in large larger percentage. So for example nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, uh sulfur, calcium, magnesium etc. Uh so then other one is so-alled micronutrients. So this is available in soil in minute percent uh percentage. So like um iron, copper, zinc, manganesees etc. So that way uh this depending upon the requirement for the particular crop say depending upon the availability of that particular nutrient for the particular area we have to uh provide that particular nutrients um to the soil so that the crops can grow in a healthy way and it can give better yields. So appropriate nutrient management is uh very important. Then let us look into what are the important functions of nutrient. So some of the important functions are listed here. Uh these are it include an involvement in photosynthesis and produ produces uh carbohydrates. Then early root formation and growth. uh then nutrient helps plants to survive in uh bitter environmental conditions like um the environmental conditions like um drought area or the increased saline area. So like that so the nutrients can helps plants to survive in this particular areas. Then increasing uh water use efficiency. So if you give appropriate nutrients appropriate levels to the plants or to the soil then we can even increase the water use efficiency and then important role in reproduction of plants. So these are some of the important functions as far as nutrient is concerned. So we should have better nutrient management plans as far as the particular area or particular waterershed is uh concerned. uh so then uh say particular area is concerned we should assess the nutrient availability and then uh we have to provide nutrients to the soil for the particular crop is concerned. So the various tests are possible as far as the assessment of nutrients are concerned. So some of the important tests are listed here like traditional soil tests uh including test like P for pH uh nitrogen phosphorus potassium uh electric conductivity etc. So this type of test traditional soil test we can uh perform uh in every 3 to 5 years so that uh depending upon the the the non-avity of this particular uh nutrients we can provide these nutrients according to the requirements. Then another important test is called nitrous nitrate test. So this uh involute the pre-planned nitrous test for additional nitrogen uh deep nitrate test how much nitrogen has already less below the crop rooting zone. So this test we can do and then accordingly we can provide appropriate um say nitrate treatment as far as the soil is concerned. Then next one is traditional plant test like a chlorophyll meter to quickly determine the nitrogen status without destroying any uh plant tissues and then also uh we can go for irriation water test and then electric conductivity and pH test. So these are some of the tests used to assess the nutrients available for the particular area particular soil for particular c crop growth. So then accordingly we can go for nutrient management by supplying uh appropriate nutrients and appropriate levels or appropriate measures to particular area for the uh given uh crop. So now another important issue in sustainable agriculture management is uh pest management. So the pest management the main object objective is to uh say how pest management interlates with climate uh water crop and soil management uh say for farmers to understand. So the farmers should understand how the the pest management will help them then to incorporate uh this pest management techniques um and it's so its decision making process as far as the farming is concerned. So this is another important issue. So some of the important necessities as far as pest management is concerned uh that include a critical component of conservation practices. So it is very important the pest management the negative impacts of pesticides. So if overuse is there then lot of issues can be there. Uh then ground and surface water deterioration due to non-point source of um u source of pollution like pesticide contamination. So this is a very important issue as far as water and soil is concerned. Then environmental risk uh like um say for example uh burning crop residue for disease and then insect control. So these are the necessities as far as the pest management is concerned. So then for the considered area considered crop we have to go for appropriate uh pest management as far as the the sustainable agriculture management is concerned. Uh then generally we use a term called integrated uh pest management. Uh so IPM so IPM approach is to uh to pest control that combines biological uh cultural and other alternatives to chemical control with the judicious use of pesticides. So instead of overuse or underuse of pesticides we have to judiciously use the pesticides by considering the various biological cultural and uh other chemical issues are concerned. So the important goals of integrated pest management uh includes uh maximum use of naturally occurring control forces uh in the pest environment. So particular area particular crop is concerned we have to consider whether uh we can control the pest naturally. So if if it is not possible only we have to go for chemicals. Then first focus on non-chemical measures. So whether biologically or with say natural control whether we can reduce the pest. So first focus is on non-chemical measures. Then use of chemical pesticides only for preventing severe damage. So as far as particular uh farm is concerned or particular agriculture is concerned. So we go for indicated pest management so that um to reduce of course the damages due to the pest but um we have to see that um whether without non-chemical measures whether we can reduce the pest problem and then if chemical measures to be adopted then it should be in a controlled way so that uh there are very less environmental problems so that we can achieve sustainable agricultural management for the particular area is concerned. So now finally let us look into what are the important issues uh as far as sustainable agricultural management practices are concerned. So some of the important issues are listed here. First one is uh biomass management. So for the particular area uh what kind of crop is to be considered for the particular region and particular area depending upon the soil depending upon the water availability and also uh like crop rotation. Then second issue is concerned better conservation practices as far as land and water is concerned land and water concerned we have to go for better conservation practices. Then uh conservation buffers. So for sustainable to achieve sustainable agricultural management we can uh consider uh conservation buffers like forest buffers at particular area and then grass waterway uh then we can go for filter strip then vegetative barriers then conservation barrier for wind etc. So various conservation buffers we can consider for the particular watershed or particular area is concerned to achieve sustainable agriculture management. Then as we discussed earlier we can go for crop husbandry by considering the various crop management practice or concerns. Then uh we can go for nutrient management. So as we discussed in the previous slides nutrient is very important. So we should not overuse and we should provide sufficient nutrients as far as the particular area or particular crop is concerned. So nutrient management is very important in uh sustainable agricultural practices. Then integrated pest management. So first we have to see whether we can go for pest control without chemical use and if chemical use is required then we should go for on a scientific way controlled way. Then of course as far as sustainable agriculture practice are concerned we can go for modern technology like molecular biology uh then and genetic engineering. So now these two branches of science like molecular biology and genetic engineering uh have been grown um consider considerably in the last few decades. So uh the expert expert the the scientific uh it's a availability of this uh molecular biology and genetic engineering or its practices. Uh through its practices we can have better sustainable agricultural management. We can go for uh say for example seeds are concerned we can go for hybrid and imbrove seeds and then we can go for tissue culture. you can go for uh say uh hybrid varieties. So like that uh various uh things various due to the development uh in molecular biology and genetic engineering we can uh use the the various available technique uh techniques uh for sustainable agricultural or agriculture management uh is concerned. So now uh another important issue in sustainable agriculture management is um whether we can go for integrated farming system. So uh say integrated farming system or IFS some of the issues are listed here in this slide. So uh say for example mixed farming system we can go for mixed farming system. So mixes farming system combines crop and livestocks enterprises in a supplementary and or or a complimentary manner. So uh for a particular watershed or particular areas concerns uh it is not only crop we can have a integrated uh way of saying mixer farming as far as crop is concerned as far as um livestocks are concerned. So we can combine together so that we can have better say economical achievements as far as the watershed is concerned. So integrated farming system means integration of uh various agricultural enterprises uh like cropping uh animal husbandry fisheries forestry etc. uh so so that we can have uh better economical achievements as far as the particular area is concerned uh and this gives great potentialities uh in the agricultural economy. So some of the important components of integrated farming system includes uh crops, livestock, birds and trees. Uh so uh depending upon the area say for example crop is concerned uh we can have a monocrop that means only one type of crop or a mixed uh or ind crop and then multi-ter crops of cereals legumes or pulses and oil seeds forage etc. So crop is concerned we can have not only monocropping we can have different crops together. Say for example say wherever coconut farming is there with the coconut we can go for say we can grow pepper. So like that various crops can be combined with within the given area so that the farmers um can have more products and better benefits from their particular farms. So the main motto of integrated uh farming system is maximize food production and then overall development of a waterershed. So uh say by integrated farming we can achieve uh say uh overall development of the area since the farmers will have um say better profits since v through various crops in the same area so that we can maximize the uh food production and maximize the benefits. Then integrated farming system is concerned. Some other uh same issues like uh indropping, mixer cropping, strict crop cropping. So as far as crops are concerned, we can have uh three ways of integrated farming. First one is indropping. So here crops are grown in space available in between the plants. Say for example, turmeric can be grown in mango gardens. Uh so like that say uh some crops will be already growing like this. You can see that here the in the mango garden here mangoes are growing and then here other types of crops. So this is so called inter cropping. Then second one is mixer cropping. So here alternative rows of different crops we can use so that say we can improve the crop yields then preserve soil fertility. Then the third one is strip cropping where long strips are used for growing crops on leveled birds. So like this as far as integrated farming is concerned cropping is concerned we can have intercropping mixer cropping and strip cropping. So like this uh say by using integrated farming system we can achieve sustainable agriculture practices or sustainable agriculture management for the uh given uh watershed. So within the perspective of what we discussed today sustainable agriculture management practice are concerned let us look into a case study. So the case study is Adasha water studies in Kotaprai village in Andhra Pradesh. uh it is spread to over 465 hectares and uh the uh say an indicated water management plan based upon sustainable agriculture has been done by in this area. So the details are taken from these website details are available in this website. So the main objective of uh this um uh watershed intervention uh was to link strategic research in natural resource management with the development research to increase productivity uh of rainfood agriculture through enhanced efficiency of natural resources while maintaining the uh resource base. So this was the main objective as far as the waterershed intervention in Adasha waterershed. So uh finally uh through this uh the aim was to increase um the productivity through adoption of improved soil water nutrients and pest management as far as the area is concerned. So the area is shown here it is taken from this website. So the important strategy in this watershed uh was to link uh the research with waterershed development schemes to enhance effectiveness of uh community participation and in this watershed a multi-disiplinary multi-institutional um consortium approach has been utilized uh and various developmental projects were implemented by research in this area. So they used an islanding approach uh through micro waterershed as upfront demonstrations managed by farmers with technical backups. So uh technical advice given by in this area and then uh say the farmers implemented these projects then the uh the watershed is concerned onfarmm strategic research was conducted by Chris in partnership with the farmers. So some of the important watershed details are uh said 270 farmers out of which uh in this area 136 are small land holding uh up to one hectare and 60 are medium land holding and 74 large land holding about two hectares. Uh so this as far as the distribution of land holding as far as farmers are concerned in the Adasha waterershed. Then u some of the other watershed details like annual uh rainfall is about um 800 mm uh say 85% of it occurs during June October. So soils are predominantly black soils in this area. Soil depth varies from 30 to 90 cm. Uh the general slope of the land is about 3%. And some of the important crops grown include sorghum, mice, cotton, sunflower, PG&P, soya bean in rainy season and sorghum uh sunflower vegetables in post- rainy season under rainfford condition. And then in some areas um say the the farmers grow turmeric, onion and rice cultivation depending upon the uh water availability and then uh irrigation. So all these uh details were taken from the cryat website. So let us look look into what are the important interventions done by the therat authorities. So here they they conducted a complete resource mapping as a first step and then they identified the various problems as far as the waterershed is concerned. They discussed the various issues with the farmers. So uh some of the interventions done by chroat include continuous weather monitoring. Uh they implemented a number of automatic weather stations in the regions and then uh say conducted scientific soil analysis. So that soil according to the soil analysis the soil has been classified uh and then they identified which type of soil is suitable for particular crops. Then uh also a cropping system analysis has been carried out. So that how much crop yield is possible then what is the cost for farming and then what will be the uh benefits from the particular uh crop in the particular area. Then cropping has been uh done according to soil. uh then uh the cost effectiveness of particular cropping has been also analyzed so that um uh whether say better crop yield can be achieved through various measures. Then another aspect which has been implemented in this watershed is intercropping. So we have already seen what is intercropping. It is not only one crop various crops were uh same done in the same area. Then use of nitrogen fixing plants. So that uh so instead of providing uh say nitrogen through artificial fertilizers. So if the nitrogen fixing plants um give nitrogen to the soil. So this has been implemented. Then ver composting then organic farming. So all those things were done in this particular waterershed. So also integrated pest control uh through natural control measures were implemented in this watershed. So that was one another important aspect of uh the success in this um uh watershed. So then finally the cryat or the nos's uh carried out capacity building and then they gave a training to farmers so that farmers know what kind of cropping to be done and what particular area and then uh say scientific way of farming then by using soil testing and then then nutrient management then integrated pest management. So these are some of the important watershed interventions done in this watershed. So then now let us look what are the important impacts of this measures interventions done by the theat in this adasha waterershed. So uh the analysis showed that crop yield considerably improved in many of the areas then considerable improvement in water vability including groundwater. So they implemented rainwater harvesting also in this area. So that improved the water availability for the area. Then in integrated nutrient and pest management were carried out. So that way farmers are using um very less artificial uh fert fertilizers uh but they go for organic fertilizers and then better nutrient management and then they go for u better say uh scientific pest control and natural pest control instead of going for uh say chemical say using chemicals for pest. management then continuous monitoring. So as far as the watershed is concerned it was monitored using remote sensing and then GIS platform has been also used for uh overall better management. Then holistic watershed management uh the holistic approach as far as land water agriculture and people are concerned. So that way a holistic development approach has been uh um say done in this particular watershed. Then this watershed has been declared as a role model of integrated sustainable watershed management through sustainable agriculture management by various agencies. And then so this has been replicated in many villages in India and abroad. So another important aspect in this watershed is capac city building and training has been given by the NOS's to the people. uh so people participation was another important aspect and then overall socioeconomic upliftment has been taken place uh in this watershed through uh various interventions. Uh so as far as this today's lecture is concerned some of the important uh reference are listed here including uh various uh websites. Then based upon today's lecture uh here I have listed uh one tutorial question. So the question is illustrate necessity of sustainable agriculture management uh practices as far as overall waterershed management plans are concerned. So uh you can do through a systematic approach some of the steps are mentioned here. So identify the components then uh uh the possible scientific interventions as far as the agriculture management practice concerns then identify the problems then identify the role of uh uh modern techniques like molecular biology and genetic engineering. Uh then uh importance of nutrient management then role of indicator pest management. So uh most of these issues we have discussed in the lecture. Then uh some of the self evaluation questions from today's lectures lecture are listed here. Uh first one is discuss agriculture water use and compare world and Indian scenarios. Uh second question is what are the major constraints in achieving watershed based sustainable agriculture management. Then discuss the agroecological classifications in India and its importance. then illustrate sustainable land management practices. So uh for most of these questions the details are available uh in today's lecture. Then a few assignment questions discuss Indian agriculture and irrigation scenarios. Then explain waterershed ecology and agro systems. Then explain important uh issues in soil and water conservation. then discuss uh importance of nutrient and integrated pest management and related issues. So most of these questions can be answered uh based on today's lecture. So finally one unsolved problem is uh listed here for your waterershed area. Study the scope for integrated farming systems in your area. So this uh we can do in a step-by-step procedure. So first you can identify the suitable integrated farming system practices for the area for integrated uh sustainable agriculture management. Uh then carry out stakeholder analysis uh consider traditional practices of the farmers. You can go to the field and discuss with the farmers and identify then suggest scientific methods uh various methodologies how we can go for uh integrated farming systems. Then identify soil and water conservation measures for the area. Then identify proper monitoring and evaluation strategies for the area and uh involve how we can involve the local people uh to achieve indicated farming systems for the uh given watershed. So this is you can do it as an unsolved problem. So this is uh today's lecture we discussed about the uh sustainable agricultural management practices and then its important uh importance in water management. U so we'll discuss further the variable various issues as far as uh sustainable water management or sustainable waterershed management issues are concerned in the uh next lecture. Thank you.
