  "text": "well hello there everyone coming to you from home today this is April 16th 2020 web presentation for the Eastern Ohio grazing council we're gonna talk to you today a little bit about grazing terminology and definitions and I gotta admit when I started thinking about doing this topic it was because I just come back from the western Pennsylvania grazing conference and they had talked about some things there that I wasn't quite sure what the definition was and so I figured how better than to look up definitions or try to figure out what those things were and to also put them in presentation form for all of you and then as I did the presentation I thought boy you know maybe we're going a little too basic but I'll tell you as I did the research and kind of look through some other terminology I really found out that I learned a lot myself had some some grazing epiphanies along the way and really enjoyed putting this one together I will say that that I put a really big breeze and take two together and I ran through it once and it was gonna be almost an hour long so I've cut it way down and we'll probably have to pick up some other grazing terminology somewhere on down the road but we'll go ahead and get started ok first I wanted to talk about the management definitions or the management descriptions of grazing but first let me say that there's no real written down definition of a lot of the terms we're going to discuss here and so you're getting the Clint vini version of each of these terms or words that we use and I may not be exactly right but it's the best that I can find and the best that I can put together certainly we can do some more research and some more thinking and talking about what each one of these terms mean to us as we go through this presentation but first one on the list their management intensive grazing will always be shown as capital M small I capital G and and that's because when Jim garish coined the phrase management intensive grazing he wanted all the focus for intensity to be on management and not on grazing we want our management to be intensive and not the grazing it's really easy to have intensive grazing you put too many animals into small space and leave them for too long a time and that's intensive grazing or what we would call over grazing but we want our management to be intensive it's the the management that we make intensive grazing so management tents and grazing is all about the forage and letting it get to the correct height before we graze it removing the animals when they get to the residue we're shooting for so bluegrass 2 which is 3 inches which your grass fescue 4 inches residue and removing the animals moving them on to another paddock they're being rotation involved they're rotating to a new panic typically the stays in a paddock would be less than three days because we don't want the animals to to regrade plants that are starting to regrow after your grazing event we don't return to a paddock until the height is where we our target is for entering a paddock and we'll skip a paddock if we need to if the Ford isn't grown enough to be able to put the livestock in then management intensive grazing takes in stockpiling and winter feeding and and really as it scores focus was on reduction of cost for grazing and for farming in general and also increased production per acre as management ends in grazing we do see sometimes that our individual production or per cow or purse tier has gone down a little bit but our overall production per acre has has actually gone up so mr. garrison wrote a great book that same name management intensive grazing if you're interested it's out there and it goes through all those things while we're on that same thought I hope that these terms here we'll be putting into a future presentation I'm probably gonna call it stepping up our grazing game and we're gonna go a little more in depth into some of these so I'm trying to hold myself back and not put everything into each one of these the next one they're mob grazing this is something that I've said that I've been doing for years and as I did the research for this presentation I kind of realized it maybe maybe I'm doing it wrong or maybe maybe it's not what I exactly want to be do it every time but mob grazing typically uses high stocking densities per acre so a stocking density of a hundred thousand pounds per acre plus for those of you that don't know how we calculate that stocking density is is how many pounds of animal is on that acre so if we want to get a hundred thousand pounds per acre of stocking density and we've got 10,000 pounds of cattle and our herd we need to split that acre up ten times to be able to get a hundred thousand pounds per acre of stock density so we won we've got to have enough forage out there to graze and keep those animals on for for a day and at least split up ten times but also we've got to split that acre up ten times to get that stocking density mob grazing incorporates longer rest periods and things really the at the core of mob grazing it's it's thinking about putting all of our livestock in one big group or mob so our growing steers are finished steers our calves our cows are stalkers if we've got other grazing livestock putting them all out there in one big group tall grass grazing kind of follows along with that we would be grazing stuff that's kind of over mature maybe has gone to seed at Brown in the hope of tall grass grazing is when we go those ultra high stocking densities that livestock are trampling the Fords that's over mature returning it back to the soil and they're grazing the vegetative parts of the sward that we have out there the real issue with tall grass grazing is we're allowing the forage to get over mature and as we think about grazing we think about it being a solar panel out there and collecting sunlight and if we've let that Ford to get over mature then it's snow we're collecting the sunlight that it could be hearing Easter Ohio we only get seven eight months of growing season we don't want to let that solar panel get dirty or shaded I guess is the way to think about it we want it to stay green and growing and vegetative that may have been the biggest Epiphany I had while I was doing the research for this presentation is that at times I'm letting things get too tall that was the way I knew how to do mob grazing was let it get too tall with a lot of forage out there per acre and in doing so I'm hurting myself in the production in because I'm not keeping it vegetative and keep it growing adaptive grazing what else started in did because I wanted to really know what adaptive grazing was over the western Pennsylvania grazing conference Alan Williams talked a lot about adaptive grazing and it really didn't know the definition so to me as I did some research and there are some really awesome YouTube videos there's a whole series out there on adaptive grazing that Alan Lance did so it's core it's kind of rolling management and some grazing mob grazing ultra high stocking density grazing kind of rolling those all in together and and it's just what it says it's adaptive so at times were at low stocking densities depending on our goals at times we're at high stocking densities depending on you know we may have a problem we'd we're trying to mob up and graze hard or or trample we may have tall grass that we need to be able to put them at a high stocking density to get them to actually eat consume and trample that forage but adaptive grazing is adapting our grazing management to our current situations the seasons how the grass is growing and what our herd needs and and it may have role in a little bit of the holistic management we'll talk about in just minute rotational grazing this is one that I think is kind of a slang term for management intensive grazing but to me rotational grazing is somewhere that we've got a set number of paddocks and we rotate through them and a set number at Daiso really we're rotating by the calendar I've set up a lot of these systems designed a lot of these systems the farmer usually goes something like well I can only move them once a week so we set up a system with five to seven pastures they move them once a week there's really not any thought put into the forage it's all put into the calendar that to me is a rotational grazing system where we're just rotating based on the calendar and in continuous if sets not grazing we talk about continuous we're talking about an area where the animals are just out there loose there's no real rotation to it they may be their season-long they may be their month-long really any time we leave animals in a paddock more than let's say 10 days we're at that sort of continuous grazing level because our utilization rates have fallen to a point that they're the same as if we would have left them there all season al-bait if there's a rotation of any kind it's better than continuous and being there all season but anytime we've been in a paddock probably more than ten days we're getting to that continuous grazing kind of situation then regenerative agriculture that's kind of the new term out there if I had to pick a kind of a face of regenerative agriculture it's a guy by the name of Gabriel in North Dakota but the regenerative agriculture folks really take soil health into account a lot of them are cropland producers that are integrating livestock into their cropping rotations as as Gabe Brown talks about it he's got regenerative agriculture right there on his ranch side as you go into his place in North Dakota and one of the things he said in one of the presentations I listened to was you know we wanted to talk about being sustainable and I didn't want to be sustainable I wanted to be regenerative I want our ranch to get better than what it was so that's sort of the thought for regenerative agriculture is they want to regenerate and it's also partially realizing that our soils are degraded they're degraded from the time we arrived here and we wanted to put them back to as good or better a state than they were when we arrived and then holistic management created by a man named Allen savory in Africa but also has some some interest in southwest desert areas of this country but holistic management is a whole management system and it can be for wildlife it can be for grazing animals incorporate some of the high stocking density stuff that's where some of the mob grazing stuff comes from adaptive grazing certainly includes some of the holistic management stuff but it was really created for some of the brittle climates and in managing those brittle climates and getting them to produce forage again so they're there again there's a really good book Allen wrote Allan savory wrote about holistic management it's a very very hard read but it's a very good read on what holistic management is and it's kind of managing all the parts of your grazing operation or of your field or farm next we're going to talk a minute about pastures and the different terminology we use for pastures so a paddock for those under many different definitions I think as we talk about grazing but to me a paddock is the interior really fenced areas in our large or a pasture area so at home we have 14 paddocks then we can infinitely break those paddocks up into smaller areas that we should probably call sales I usually call them breaks but a paddock to me is a internally fenced area inside our larger pasture area so from that you can take a cell cell being for me it's one day's grazing or twelve hours worth of grazing I guess it's it's your grazing durations a time or length so if some of us is selling a paddock would be the same thing for some of its it's different like I said I used the term brake especially in a paddock where I've split it up maybe three different times and I've allowed them to walk back to water for those that 24 hour or however many hours that time is usually it's less than three days I may give them breaks within a paddock and allow them to walk back to water as long as it's less than three days from their strip grazing strip grazing something we use in the fall when we do stockpile grass stockpile grazing strip grazing typically is given animals a small strip and then allowing them to walk back to water and this may be for a month in the winter time that we keep giving them more strips and allowing to walk back to water because we're really not concerned with how much forage they're gonna be picking at what they've already walked over because we're not in the growing season bale grazing sort of like strip grazing with bales we have the bail set stocked out there at 25 foot centers typically we build temporary electric fence around those bales and then we move the temporary fence to allow the livestock access to the bales so use a lot in the western states we talked about that a couple of presentations ago for here in Ohio but is a good system especially if we get frozen weather creep grazing something we might do with cows and calves we may build an area in the fence so that the cows can her calves can get to the next day's grazing or next week's grazing to allow them to kind of pick a better forage or or have a better meal than what their mothers are eating in the product that they're in creep grazing can use a creep gate it can use a raised area in the fan sir simply the calves can go under the one strand of wire to get to the next field to creep graze leader follower grazing sort of along that same line what we do there is we're putting the animals that are on a higher nutritional claim ahead of the animals that don't need to be let's think grass finishing steers in the front paddock and cows in the second pasture so the cows follow this the grass finishing spear so the grass finishing steers are only eating the best and the cows are eating what's left over or eating the rest before we move them on so the steers move ahead the cows fill in the field that the steers were in and then flash grazing is something we talk about if we're Grace and say like riparian areas that we fenced out so streams creeks ponds places we might only turn the cows in there for an hour or two hours are very short duration so they go in they graze and we get them out of there before they lounge around and before they have a chance degrade that area like tamping down stream banks or waiting in the ponds those are areas that we would do flash grazing we'll talk about forages here I just kind of threw in some terms that maybe everybody's not really up on and also maybe some things that need a little bit better definition to them so a s'more the sward would be all of the forages contained in our pasture or in a paddock so our grasses legumes forbs weeds everything that's out there that is graze able is what we consider our sward out there in the pasture dry matter we talked about a little bit last week and I don't don't feel like I left with a very good so dry matter is the dry matter equivalent of our pastures dry matter typically is around 14% moisture that's self stable for grains and for Hayes so we figured dry matter based on that so if a cow eats three percent of their body weight in dry matter a thousand-pound cow that's 30 pounds of dry matter per day the thing we have to remember is this time of year our grasses are really wet our forges are really wet they're ninety percent points so that means that they have to eat a whole lot more pounds of forage to cover that dry matter need so we convert everything to dry matter because we don't know what the moisture content of the forage is we know dry haze dry matter but we don't know our forages so when we're talking about how much it cow eats we always convert it to dry matter residue or residue there again my challenge to everyone to leave a more of a residue residues what we leave behind us so that four inches that we left when we when we move the cows or on our livestock on in a cornfield the residue is the leftover corn flour that's coming through the combine I maintain we should come up with a better term in that residue still sounds like waste to me that sound like what we what we want to leave behind and it takes grass to grow grass and if we leave that residue we'll have grass next time if we take it all we won't have gas when we're ready to come back to it the spring flush something we're going to talk about in a web presentation here coming up if you're looking at that percentage total gross by month chart down below it's the Green Line it's that first real big bump in our forage production we're gonna be hitting that here in a couple weeks when everything seems to be putting on a seed head we can't get ahead and we can't graze enough grass the cows physically aren't eating enough grass that's the spring flush conversely the summer slump follows that up it's the time of year when the forage is just kind of stopped growing typically brought on by lack of water it's thought that it it's heat related but it really is more a lack of moisture even though those are are some of our wet or months it's that we have so much heat that our water around here turns to humidity and is in the air and not in the soil and not feeding the plants stockpile we talked a little bit last slide about stockpile forage would be forages that we've grown for the purpose of grazing later in a time when forges aren't actively growing so that could be it's typically the fall and winter but also could be the summer slump we could be doing all grass grazing in that summer slump area and in plugging something we talked about this time of year bugging basically is when we've grazed a pasture that was too wet we had livestock in a pasture when it was too wet their hoof action has caused the soil to lose all of its pore space soils always have pore space for both air and water and if the cows especially get to chomping around in a wet pasture they do what we call hogging them up and that is that they leave hoof tracks and they they push out all the air and water and pore space and so the plants have nothing left to grow on the microbes are even going to be severely affected because there's no air for them to get in the soil I wanted to talk just a minute about animal units and how they pertain to our grazing system so an animal unit typically is a thousand pound beef calf we talk about an animal unit we're talking about a thousand pound beef cow and so we convert our actual cow weight down to thousand pound beef cow range and we can talk animal units with dairy cows that typically we're factoring it down to a thousand pound cow for the CAFO units and for permited livestock operations there's whole charts on what is an animal unit and it's all converting those animals to what a thousand pound cow would do that way we're converting two things one what that animal eats and two the manure that that animal produces all to one standard unit of measure so and we unit follows along with what we talked about with dry matter you know it's kind of a conversion ratio for us so the animal unit day is how much forage and animal if we're talking about animal unit day we're talking about how much forge that they will consume in that day's time same with a animal unit month are our soil surveys are typically put in there for production under animal unit months so that's anim it's time thirty days to make it months of production so I know in the western states that use a lot at AUM Xan au DS to talk about how much forage is out there if they're renting pasture or if they're figuring out how much they have under a center-pivot irrigation system they talk about animal units and animal unit days then the carrying capacity could be the carrying capacity for our entire operation could be carrying capacity for a particular set of paddocks or product or one paddock for that matter but a carrying capacity is the standard set unit for for an area so a lot of the grazing leases in the western states are under carrying capacity they've got a set number of livestock and typically they go back to animal units for for what that carrying capacity is on that particular piece of pasture and a grazer I threw grazer in there as a an animal in the animal unit category but it really isn't grazer is us it's it's the farmer or the producer that is managing their animals in a grazing situation as I said I had to cut some slides so grazer within another one but I put this in here because every time I spell it out I get the big red line in spellcheck and I just want to put that out there that I'm not misspell in it that is actually considered us that's us the grazers and anyone that manages their livestock in in a grazing way can be considered a grazer so just a minute here on some what I consider marketing terms now I know if you're eating down through there is saying well those are management terms and they are some for some of us it's lifestyle choices our farm style choices but to me I tend to put these in a marketing type category because this is how folks choose to market their products I guess I put this in here because I end up seeing a lot of things on social media and out there in the community where folks are poking fun at one Marketing Avenue or another and I is calling it back it's all marketing we're all in this together 2% of the population or less our farmers and so we don't have any room to kind of worry about how someone else chooses to market their product these are marketing avenues they're ways for us to market a product so organic organic is is a done by a certifying agency you have to be certified organic to sell organic products now there is a loophole there where you can sell less than so many thousand dollars and call yourself organic but for the most part those folks are certified they've got a certifying agency that looks into what they do and an organic typically are not allowed to use certain products if they're not naturally derived so one of the things we run into is is we can't use treated fence posts sometimes with organic things because that's a not a naturally derived product Organic to gets into the discussion of pesticides you know they're not allowed to use a lot of the pesticides that you do use some the ones that they use are typically naturally derived pesticides they don't use a lot of synthetic fertilizers but they do use a compost or or other things natural kind of follows along with that organic type thing then the natural and I'm not sure whether they're natural even had whether they have their own label or not I'm not really up on that but the natural folks typically tend to to say that their stuff is pasture raised so pasture raised poultry or hogs on pasture they're considering that they're natural because there there are some folks that raise organic products that raise them in a more conventional setting but they they use an organic feed and follow some of the organic practices so the the natural folks are kind of differentiating themselves away a little bit by saying that it was naturally raised and then grass fed and grass finished kind of is a sticky situation sometimes as they started marketing products as grass fed we found that that some producers can say well it was grass fed it had grass or had forage but it was also fed a Green product one way or another and so the grass-finished has then kind of come up from from there to denote that the product or the the livestock was produced using only forage typically is what the grass-finished would would say conventional then is is the conventional way of doing things with they're following a conventional kind of way of agriculture and doing things in the conventional way and that's not to be derogatory of the conventional folks I firmly keep myself on the fence on all of these marketing what I consider marketing terms because I see merits in all of them I think all of them have some good points and all of them work for themselves and and and that's why I consider it marketing because it's it's all in what works for that operation and how they manage their operation how its used to market their product well that's a wrap for this web presentation I hope I helped you guys have a little more understanding about some grazing terms and some definitions for them win this presentation by thanking our sponsors I hope you guys enjoy what we've put together here also while I'm here I'll say don't be afraid to go look up some of these grazing terms if you enjoy our web presentations there are really good YouTube videos out there about a lot of these topics that you can pick up and watching and some there's even whole series of them and I've kind of done that here in this time that we seem to be faced with quite a bit because it's nice to just sometimes turn off the news and pull out a good YouTube presentation and boy have I really learned a lot over the last few weeks just doing that whenever I got a chance and really excited about the spring grazing season and what we've got coming up here especially with all the newfound things that I've kind of been watching reading through be looking for our virtual pasture walk next week I believe we're going to start shooting some Oh's for it tomorrow and try to get it put together and turned out next Thursday so thank you all for watching we'll see you next time",
