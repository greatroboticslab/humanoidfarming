00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,200
a significant Milestone is being marked

00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,759
this week with the official commencement

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,160
of infrastructural works for the

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,759
national agriculture Innovation and

5
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,000
Technology Center this state-of-the-art

6
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:15,360
facilties is poised to revolutionize

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,520
local agricultural practices by

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,920
integrating cuton Edge technology and

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,480
sustainable farming methods through

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,840
Hydroponics a five member technical team

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,119
from Guyana is currently on island to

12
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:30,000
spare head the installation of a highly

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,840
Advanced agronic system an initiative

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,920
that symbolizes the beginning of a

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,520
transformative collaboration between St

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,440
Lucia and Guyana for agricultural

17
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,680
technology adoption and Innovation what

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,160
we are seeing here today is the

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,600
beginning or the foundation of the

20
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,280
Agricultural Innovation and Technology

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,160
initiative that our ministry is hoping

22
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:54,600
to stretch out to youth or to expose

23
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:57,440
more young people as it relates to new

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,640
in new production methods or

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,719
techniques and this has all been made

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,160
possible

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,760
and we are so grateful to the guyes

28
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:09,880
mission for coming in and starting us

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,840
off so when more more of these new

30
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:15,720
technologies come in we are able to take

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,479
it on on our own and show our young

32
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,720
people from start to finish what they

33
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:22,280
could accomplish and how far agriculture

34
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,159
could take them on this lot we hope to

35
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,479
establish I believe one to Hydroponics

36
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,560
green houses the Hydroponics Center is

37
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,960
also expected to serve as a model for

38
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,280
local Farmers demonstrating modern

39
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:36,960
techniques that maximize crop yield

40
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,399
while minimizing environmental impact

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,280
officials from both countries emphasize

42
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,880
that knowledge sharing and capacity

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,600
building will be key outcomes of this

44
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,880
initiative fostering a stronger original

45
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,840
partnership in Agricultural Development

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,680
so five of us came to assist you guys um

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,240
St lucians uh to set up two Shar houses

48
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,159

49
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,600
we're we're uh going on well uh we're

50
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,520

Innovation and Technology Center is

56
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,720
expected to set the foundation for

57
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,280
future advancements in smart farming

58
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,879
data- driven agricultural Solutions and

59
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,400
climate adaptive practices with

60
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,560
construction now underway stakeholders

61
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,400
remain optimistic about the center's

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,480
impact on food production

63
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,800
and economic growth from the Ministry of
