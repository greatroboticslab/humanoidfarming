1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,879
so it's generally when you involve in

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:06,319
eating

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,120
intermediary and that's because the end

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,519
buyer wants some transference of trust

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,080
and they trust the USDA more than they

6
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:14,679
trust a buyer that a grower that they're

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,359
never going to meet and when you start

8
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:18,000
looking at Gap there are slightly

9
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:19,760
different types of Gap there's Gap

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
specifically for mushrooms for tomatoes

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,480
for aquaponics um and for a few other

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,599
things

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,800
um and there are certain like categories

14
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:32,640
within Gap so there's the Harvest step

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,879
or the production step uh like field

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,120
production there's the harvesting or

17
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:39,960
pack house and then there's post Harvest

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,440
handling unless I don't know about you

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,160
because I think at some point you uh

20
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,399
would wash your sunflower shoots which

21
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,239
would probably be considered post

22
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,800
Harvest handling since we don't wash our

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,320
Greens in any way we did not have to

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,440
comply with or fulfill or go through the

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,359
Hoops of the post Harvest like category

26
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,359
of requirements
