  "text": "[Music] okay we're here with dr. Mike Lehmann at the Air s in Brookings South Dakota and like you have a talk that you like to give about an underwear demo an underwear experiment you did the summer we'd love to hear about it well sure I guess I'm gonna backtrack just a little bit before I introduce the Younger wear which everybody's waiting for and talk to you a little bit about this field experiment behind us is a field experiment with plots containing different rotations of corn and soybean either corn and soybean by itself or corn and soybean with other crops in terms of a four year rotation and this experiment has been going on for 16 years so 16 years these rotational treatments have been in place and in this case by adding diversity and taking a two-year corn and soybean rotation which is this plot right here and over here this plot of corn here is a four year corn pea winter wheat soy rotation we've added diversity into the system and this diversity is diversity of crops but it's also diversity of crop residues diversity of root exudates from these crops diversity of root architecture in the soil and so diversity is really the focus crop rotational diversity is the focus of this experiment and why do we care about rotation crop rotation we've done a number of long-term Studies on these particular plots and what we've shown is the four year rotation actually produces about 25% less nitrous oxide so you lose 25 percent less nitrogen as nitrous oxide from the plots so that nitrogen stays in the ground where the plants can use it later they also with the forward rotation we were able to increase the soil organic matter about 25% over a two-year corn and soybean rotation and I forgot to mention all these plots are no-till so they're all no-till and then they've had they have a treatment crop cropping system treatment of rotation and so then the third finding we have the nitrous oxide and the soil organic carbon are all better situated with the four-year rotation but also the soybean in the four-year rotation has 25% higher yields than it does in the corn soybean meal or tation so all across the board whether it be nutrients soil organic carbon or yields we're seeing better performance by the four-year system you know I can tell you about this stuff and I can show you the data but there's not very many visual displays or I can show you the difference between a porn and two-year rotation and so it'll give you an idea of how fast decomposition occurs in the soil you",
