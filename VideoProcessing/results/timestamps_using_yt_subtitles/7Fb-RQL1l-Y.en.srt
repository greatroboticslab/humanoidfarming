ReDiscover our connection to the land

19
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,840
and the food it provides these are more

50
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:57,600
Rice cultivation is a meticulous process

51
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,000
it requires a deep understanding of the

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,840
land and the plant's needs the first

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,240
step involves plowing or tilling the

54
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,039
soil this breaks up compacted Earth

55
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,640
creating space for air and water to

56
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:10,800
penetrate organic matter such as compost

57
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,640
or manure is often Incorporated to

58
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,680
enrich the soil and provide essential

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,400
nutrients for the rice plants this

60
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,720
organic matter acts as food for

traditional rice farming proper leveling

68
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,160
prevents water from pooling in certain

69
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,959
areas which could suffocate the rice

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,959

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,239
a significant threat to rice production

110
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,079
droughts can lead to water shortages

111
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,759
stressing the rice plants and reducing

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,880
flood the patties drowning the plants or

114
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,600
making them susceptible to fungal

121
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,120
farming is not just a technique it's a

122
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,880
philosophy it recognizes the

the farmer and the consumer this

125
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,560
approach prioritizes practices that

126
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,240
minimize environmental impact while

127
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,440
maximizing yields and ensuring the

128
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,639
long-term health of the land one key

129
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,680
principle is reducing water usage

130
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,520
traditional rice farming often involves

131
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,639
continuous flooding which can lead to

132
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,479
Water waste and methane emissions

133
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,440
sustainable methods such as the system

134
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,440
of rice intensification or SRI promote

135
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,199
intermittent flooding allowing the soil

136
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,320
to aate and reducing water consumption

137
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,759
organic farming practices which is shoe

138
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,680
synthetic pesticides and fertilizers are

139
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,680
also Central to sustainable rice

140
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,840
production instead of relying on

141
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,880
chemicals organic farmers utilize

142
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,039
natural methods such as crop rotation

143
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,240
and compost application to build soil

144
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,240
fertility and control pests

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,639
harvest each type of vegetable is

154
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,160
crucial for ensuring optimal flavor and

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,080
nutritional value root vegetables such

156
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,919
as carrots and potatoes are ready for

157
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,560
Harvest when their foliage begins to

158
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,720
yellow and die back leafy greens on the

other hand are best picked when they are

160
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,120
young and tender timing is key

161
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,440
harvesting too early can result in

162
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,080
underdeveloped flavors while waiting too

163
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:14,560
long can lead to tough bitter vegetables

164
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,639
the methods used for harvesting

165
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,280
vegetables vary depending on the type of

166
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,240
plant and the scale of production small

167
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,360
scale Farmers often rely on hand

168
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,240
harvesting a labor intensive but

169
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,520
rewarding process that allows for

170
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:29,840
careful selection of the best produce

171
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,880
larger operations May employ mechanized

172
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,880
Harvesters to efficiently gather crops

173
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,880
like potatoes or

175
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,360
harvesting with care and efficiency just

176
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,680
as a carpenter relies on a well stock

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,199
toolbox so too does a vegetable farmer

178
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,840
depend on a range of tools to

179
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,440
efficiently and effectively Harvest

180
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,440
their crops these tools often simple in

181
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,360
design but essential in function are

182
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,919
extensions of the farmers's hands

183
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,240
allowing them to gather the fruits of

sharp pair of scissors or a harvesting

187
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:08,400
knife is indispensable these tools allow
