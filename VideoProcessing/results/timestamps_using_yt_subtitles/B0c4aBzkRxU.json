extension veterinarian based in Fargo Jana Block livestock systems specialist base at the heading or re C John do better livestock systems specialist based at the north central yeah Minot Carl hoppy livestock systems specialist based at the Carrington RAC and Miranda Meehan environmental stewardship specialist based in Fargo also with us tonight offering technical support is Scott Swanson or electronic media specialist based here in Fargo again thank you for thank you all for joining us and I'm going to turn this webinar over to Lisa well good evening thank you all for joining us our speakers tonight all this as specialists are dealing with many of the same winner management issues and challenges that you are and so please feel free to ask questions I was asked to talk about assessing cow and ball condition in managing bolts in a tough winter situation and so the first thing I'm going to talk about is body condition scoring this is a really nice three-step system for body condition scoring first I'd encourage you to look at the ribs of the cow or the bull that's denoted by number one on your screen if you can see those last two ribs and that animal is in a body condition score less than five if those last two ribs are not visible that animal is in a body condition score five or greater next we would encourage you to look at the spine that's denoted by number two here on the cap Wow if that spine is visible the animal is in a body condition score of three or less next look at the shape between the hooks and the pins in the dairy industry we call that area of the Theroux if that animal has a strong v-shape in that area that animals in a body condition score - if it's a strong V but a little more flat that would be a body condition score 3 a V shape would be a body condition score 4 and then as we move into a u-shape in that area it would be a body condition score 5 and as we move into a flatter shape those move into body condition scores six seven and eight in the United States our beef body condition scores range from a 1 to a 9 a body condition score one is considered a callable that is starved very emaciated and a body condition score 9 is considered an animal that is obese so let's look at body condition scoring we would like to see our animals in a body condition score 5 to 7 a calving time those are the two body condition scores on the right side of the screen here so we'd like our material cows to be in a body condition score of 5 again we are not able to see those last two ribs the spine is not available it's not visible excuse me and the shape between the hooks and the pins is in a strong u-shape and so you can see that this cow at the top on the right hand side is in a body condition score 5 the cow below her we cannot see those last two ribs the spine is not visible in the shape between her hooks and pins is very flat and so she's in about a condition score of 6 or greater now why did we talk about this well for every body condition score you lose you lose between 80 and 100 pounds of weight it takes a great deal of energy and cost to get cows up in that to increase body condition score at calving or right before breeding and so we really are concerned about body condition score there's a lot of impact on calf help calf health and calf productivity along with cow productivity we tend to forget about bowls when we manage in the wintertime and we certainly forget about looking at our body condition scores of bulls so these are two bowls the bowl on the left is a body condition score five again just like our cows we cannot see his last two ribs we cannot see his spine and that shape between his hooks and his pins is the strong new shape so he's a body condition score five the ball new light is a yearling bull this bowl at a sale time had a back fat of about a quarter of an inch 2,600 and again as we look at him you cannot see his last two ribs his spines not available in this area between his hooks and misses pins is very flat and so he's going to be a body condition score six or greater so as we move into talking about balls we have rows around to improve the our herd but also to breed our cows right and that's how we get back herd improvement so let's talk about spermatogenesis that's the fancy term for semen development in those that take 61 days or about two months and so anything that has happened in that period of time will impact semen quality and the ability to pass a breeding soundness exam I always encourage people to think of semen development as a factory so anything that has happened along that production in that line over the past two months will reserve result in the lemon in the semen production system we certainly don't want any women's when it comes time to breed cows so what's the effect of body condition score on semen quality and physically normal Bulls Waldner embark they are out of the vet school in Saskatoon at the University of Saskatchewan looked at body condition scores of bulls it breeding sound this time exam time in a time period from January to March which is the green bars in April to June which is the yellow bars we would ideally like to see balls in the body condition score of four or five or six at breeding time and at turnout time and here's the reason why you can see that the body condition when we have those boys in those body condition scores the percentage of those Bulls the satisfactory semen goes up significantly higher so we range from anywhere being 60% satisfactory to 78% and a January to March timeframe for semen checking to 80 percent almost 85% in that April's June time frame so what happens when we buy yelling bowls or even two-year-old balls at the local production sale typically those bowls are a little heavier and conditioned because we are trying to optimize production we're trying to optimize weight gain and marbling in those bowls and so you can see here on this screen that this shows a comparison of bulls that were weighed at say a time and then weighed again when they were tested and they looked at the percentage of balls that would pass braiding soundness exam so in a short period of time after that sale 74% to those bulls has to semen semen test or breeding soundness exam at that point in time is those were losing about seven pounds a day when you get out to about 43 to 85 days after that sale those bills are losing still about two and a half to three pounds a day but only half of them pass the breeding soundness exam so the take-home messages is that when we buy these Bulls young bulls a yearling more two-year-old bowl and take them home we want to make sure that we are still maintaining their quality of diet so that we don't lose a lot of weight body condition in fact so this year we are going to see a lot of bowls what you're likely going to see a lot of bulls with scrotal frostbite and so what's that impact on semen quality so in this slide satisfactory semen quality is in the green bar questionable semen quality is in the yellow bar and unsatisfactory semen quality is in the gray bar I want you to look at the the boxes with the red squares around them so they looked at frostbite and they graded frostbite by the number of scabs that were a penny or larger or a penny and smaller severe frostbite were those scat were those Bulls that had one or more scabs on their scrotum that were larger than a penny slight was one or more that were smaller so when we look at severe frostbite in bowls that had breeding soundness exams for example conducted it from January to March zero men those bowls had what we would consider to be a satisfactory breeding soundness exam somewhere around 30% had what we would consider to be a questionable one as we move down here to may in June you can see that the percentage of bulls that have satisfactory breeding soundness exams or semen quality increases significantly so the take-home message is to protect the scrotum and testicles from the cold the easiest way most logical way to do that is with some good wind break and good bedding and so on the picture on the left you can see that these bulls are bedded with some nice straw and there's some really nice natural wind break through these trees this can also be a man-made one break how weather that happens to be stacks of bales or some of these portable wind breaks as you can see in Canada maybe they protect the scrotum and testicles of boughs a little bit different they utilized a Crown Royal sac we know that that is maybe not appropriate here and the easiest thing to do so in summary both should be in the body condition score of 4 to 7 a pre breeding to command it turn out we want those boys to maintain condition through the breeding season but we don't want them to be too fast maintain young recently purchased Bulls on a similar plane of nutrition and diet as they were when they were purchased and then slowly stepped them down if you have not done so check out the body condition scores of your herd sires now ask someone who's knowledgeable about cattle to check out the body condition score of your herd after bulls and cows to don't confuse hair muscle and/or hey belly with a condition and get help developing a ration if you need to add some condition this is really important in bills because we don't want to get them too fat and we don't want to step them up on too hot of a diet most of our County Extension offices have software and rash and development ability if you need some help next we talked about this betting bills and in fact betting cattle is really important provide some windbreak breeding soundness exams really important we need to have our bills tested within a month of breeding season that gives us enough time to find those if our bows happen to not test well but it also is an appropriate amount of time for them to have that breeding soundness exam be accurate when you turn them out don't save pennies to waste dollars by skipping a breeding soundness again exam most veterinarians charge 50 to $100 for breeding soundness exam and while that seems like a lot of money think about this if your cows breed just 21 days later because you're both failed a breeding soundness exam that ends up being some around 50 pounds of weaning weight if calves sell for a dollar and a half a pound that is $75 per head that you have lost you could have paid for that breeding soundness exam with just one calf remember that that semen test is only good for the day it was taken and that semen development takes 60 days and so with that thank you I wish you the best of luck and as we move into spring and next dr. Jerry stuck is going to talk about managing calves that have been chilled and pulled stress and calves idea Lisa good to be with you this evening I know that this is really not a topic that it's all I'm enjoyable to talk about we're gonna talk about it anyway we've still got winter left and a storm coming and I hope none of you have to deal with cold stress calves but we're gonna focus in for the next few minutes on talking about how we handle and how we deal with it and how we recognize well these are the three things we're gonna discuss we're gonna talk about how to recognize a calf and maybe in trouble and I'm sure that's nothing new for those of you in the audience you know how to tell when calves aren't doing well or doing right we're going to talk about them in for intervention and then maybe some things about what the outcomes might be you know I noticed some things that all of us are gonna talk about betting and wind protection come into play here and and yet the snow months are talking about it does cause us some issues it's supposed to be wet snow and whenever we have those kind of conditions the problem with moisture is that it decreases the level of insulation on an animal it's not just the cows but it's those calves and those those calves with not a lot of body weight not a and a lot of surface area they tend to suffer the most when it gets to be these tough conditions so you need to be doing what you can be out there as often as you can during this tough weather I know you're gonna probably lose some sleep over the next few days but being out there probably saves you some calves and so think about what your schedule is and if you can get somebody to check calves for you during the night time or even even the day times you can get some sleep sure helps barns through help and just a reminder to keep them as clean as possible and fresh bedding at this time of the year um I just want to talk a little bit about behavior of animals that are under some stress and and cold stress and and remember that cold stress can happen in a lot of different outside temperatures I mean the critical temperature for calves is probably somewhere around 55 degrees so and all that means that is when the temperature goes below that they have to take in more energy to maintain that body heat we'd like 55 degrees now but calves can handle it if they if they're able to get up and nurse and the mother takes care of them but the behavior that you need to be aware of that they'll exhibit when they're in cold stress is maybe standing off by themselves and hunched up and and of course you'll see that when there can't get out of the wind but they also can be just laying down even next to the mother and you won't notice it and you need to determine whether that calf is nursed or not and sometimes I'll admit it's hard to it's hard to determine that but look at the otter do the teats look dry and when it's moisture outside they probably won't look dry they'll look wet but is the hair on the utter dry or the other quarters full a lot of things to look for but if you're still wondering you need to put your fingers and clean fingers preferably in the mouth and see if that mouth is cold if that mouth is cold they have not nursed and you're gonna have to intervene and and even beyond that when you get a calf that's cold and vocalising that is a really bad clinical sign I sometimes use the term five percent chance of survival so the prognosis in a calf that's vocalizing is really really poor we define hypothermia and calves as anything below 98 degree Fahrenheit rectal temperature you know newborn calves should be somewhere in that 90 902 we can actually have severe hypothermia down to 86 degrees those calves will definitely need to be intervened I don't I don't I'm not telling you need to run around with a rectal thermometer I'm telling you that you can probably identify those calves that need help just by their behavior if you have one that's fine but it's not something you need to need to have to identify calf that needs help this is just a reminder that better days are ahead we will get through this March and we will have green grass and some of you will have calves on green grass just remember this doesn't these next two days don't last forever just want to make a couple of comments about this in order for a calf to maintain its maintain its core temperature and maintain its life when it's cold out he has to increase metabolic activity and of course that happens when that calf leaves the uterine environment that's nice and warm and and safe and all the shop know all the sudden he shoved out into the the cold environment and so his metabolic activity has to really jump ahead and get on board there so mentioned that the metabolic activity will increase 5x over the resting phase and I mean what calves end up doing is they end up shivering and that helps them to to generate heat and I've got a comment in here below sharing its talks about calving difficulty when a calf is having trouble being born or the mothers having trouble delivering that calf that actually is a detriment to that calves ability to withstand cold temperatures because it messes with the metabolic activity even a calf that's born unassisted is going to have increased cortisol and just a little bit of cortisol allows that calf to better utilize fat we're going to talk about brown fat in just a little bit but also the sugar stores the glycogen and protein to create heat and what happens in cold temperatures in addition to increased metabolic activity when it's cold out there's vasoconstriction in other words the vessels will constrict and you don't have that that blood flow to the ears and feet and tail and that's why when it gets really cold and you see problems a result that's that's the pieces of the anatomy that that get affected the most just a little comment on calving is just to back up what I just mentioned about calving knees and calves ability to withstand cold and get up and nurse I'm answering something about brown fat and we don't often think about that you think in terms of white fat while calves are born with brown fat and and they have the unique ability and it's gone after just a short period of time but they have an unique ability to use that fat to keep warm and and calves that are born to cows an adequate body condition score back to what Lisa was talking about those calves will have a little better supply of brown fat that gets them through the tough times and gets them to get up and start nursing so it's a big deal having cows and in adequate body condition score especially cold temperatures it's really important just a couple comments about colostrum we'll come back to this again in just a bit if you think about a calf in thermo neutral zone thermo neutral zone and I mentioned this earlier but the mono thermo neutral zone for calf's probably somewhere in that 50 to 55 degree fahrenheit range they need in order to maintain their their heat source they need almost two thirds of a gallon of colostrum milk colostrum will different for cod a cow and from from breed to breed and dairy breeds and beef breeze but just there kind of an idea of what those calves at calves actually need and when that temperature falls below that thermo neutral zone then they actually need a little bit more just to maintain their their energy that they need for internal body heat and remember that our beef cattle do an amazing job of acclimating to the cold when I talk about thermal neutral zone I mean our cattle grow longer hair they do lots of things to acclimate to the cold if they didn't we wouldn't be able to raise cattle out pop doors I mean even in temperatures way below zero if the sun is shining and there's no win and they're laying embedding those calves actually do extremely well frostbite is one of the one of the side effects of this cold stress that you can have it can have frostbite rot on the skin but a lot of times what we see happen first is that the tips of the years will freeze and then they old necrosis and then they'll fall off and that's okay those calves will be okay if it's just the tips of the years the one that becomes really dangerous is when their feet freeze and you'll notice you can notice this early on perhaps when when you feel the feet and they're just frozen solid and if you don't notice that then those calves will actually get up and move around and be fine but after a day or so maybe about 48 hours those feet become swollen they actually get a little what I call squishy because there's edema fluid in the tissues and and they're painful and you can wait a while to see if somehow there's a miracle that occurs and they improve but they're most of the time they're not going to be treatable at those at that stage and those calves will likely have to be put down so how do we heat those calves up lots of different ways lots of different methods you know heaters floor heats and blankets and hot boxes and I just want you to think about this though because when a calf is really hypothermic you know I mentioned that 86 degree rectal temperatures is extreme hypothermia it's going to be hard to conduct enough heat through the hide to raise that internal body temperature so and in order to do that really the calf has to also have the ability to produce heat and that's why in both of these instances those calves need colostrum I know you're in a hurry to get that calf formed up but some time during that period when you're warm and you you got to provide colostrum because that allows calf that calf to get some energy that it really needs warm water is tends to be very efficient at warming calves and some of you may have bathtubs available sometimes you need to carry them right in the house and put them in the bathtub 100 degrees fahrenheit water and I'd be like I'll just caution you a little bit sometimes it's okay to warm those calves up a little bit with dry heat first so that it's not so much of a shock so robbing and putting external heat on is okay so you can start to raise some of that temperature but the bathtub still may be needed in those calves that are extremely help affirming and also they need colostrum yes this is my famous picture of a calf in the bathtub and that one actually did survive believe it or not um just a couple comments again on colostrum itself fresh is the best some is better than none and sometimes you need to put that beef cow that doesn't know that you're trying to help her in the calf got to put up in ahead catch and this is where you need some help you need somebody to grab the tail any of the bass and move it to a vertical position so she won't kick so much and put your head in that flank and milk the nearest heat and then once they kind of calm down you can kind of release some pressure but that fresh colostrum is the best energy source immune source that those calves need frozen classrooms fine I prefer if you harvest it from your own herd I'm a little leery of taking frozen claws from from other herds and from dairy herds there are colostrum substitutes on the market today and look at the label make sure they got a minimum of hundred grams of immunoglobulins that those calves need I know always get questions about brandy and whisky and 5-hour energy drinks brandy and whisky I'm pretty sure are designed for human consumption I'm not sure about five hours I don't know of any studies done on them so stick with the things you know colostrum is the best I'm going to pass this over at this time to Janna block our extension livestock specialist out in heading her Janna you take it away all right thanks Jerry okay so I'm gonna be visiting with you a little bit about how to evaluate your nutrition program and I know it's been a long haul for many of us and still looking like we're facing a little bit of winter so it's important to be really critical and evaluate what's going on with your nutrition programs as we try to finish out the rest of this winter and head into spring so things that we need to consider our obviously quality and quantity of our base diet most the time that's going to consist of forage so don't be like the guy on this cartoon here and let the whitetail show you which are the best bales get your hay inventory conducted and I'll talk about an example of that shortly and also make sure you get nutrient analysis conducted so that you know exactly what you're dealing with obviously you have to know what different types of production groups that you have to take care of if you've got some first-half heifers some old thin cows mature cows or bulls those are all going to have different requirements and you're going to need to feed them strategically based on your feed resources most of you are calving now or you have been for some time and so that's going to impact requirements in terms of when your cows gets peak lactation which is approximately 60 days after calving that's also going to really kind of match up with our pasture turnout dates in terms of when we have to feed that high quality forage win requirements out there at highest what's the condition of our cow herd evaluate body condition score and I'll talk about a couple of other strategies to kind of monitor nutrient status and then of course your considerations are going to always come back to the bottom line what kind of costs are you looking at what facilities and labor do you have available and you might need to consider some alternatives rather than just a full feed hay diet okay so this chart gives you just some rule of thumb for estimating can take based on energy content or a TD n total digestible nutrients so as you can see here the low quality Raja's will have the least amount of intake that's just due to bulk or physical fill due to fiber content and so our dry cows are going to be able to eat around one at 1.8 percent of their body weight of that low quality forage lactating cows will increase the intake of that and again intake will just continue to increase as forage quality increases and I have just an example of down here on the bottom of comparing an intake of a low quality forage @ 30.8 pounds to a high quality forage at 37.8 pounds so again that's where understanding the quality of your forage is helpful and this can be used when you're looking at your hay inventory and trying to figure out what the intake should be on various forages based on quality so Jimmy kind of mentioned the lower critical temperature so in beef cattle that's just the temperature below which they have to utilize energy to maintain body heat and so in mature cattle we're talking about 32 degrees with a dry winter coat or 18 degrees with a heavy dry winter coat and so as the temperature starts to decline you can see that feed intake will increase energy for production is lost and the maintenance requirement increases so we can utilize the ambient temperature and wind speed to calculate an effective temperature and we use this effective temperature to determine how much additional energy those cattle are going to require just to maintain body heat so again a basic rule of thumb is to increase T DT DN or energy by one percent for every degree below the lower critical temperature so if we have the dry heavy winter coat that I talked about in the previous slide our lower critical temperature is 18 degrees so if we have air temperature of zero in a wind speed of 20 we're looking at an effective temperature of minus 39 so we take our lower critical temperature minus our -39 and with those cows are going to require 57% more energy so just going through some nutrition calculations here and I know I'm throwing a lot of numbers at you I can definitely get you copies of this slide or you can print it from the webinar later just showing you the relative difference in how much energy is going to be required by that cow just based on that wind speed and temperature and so if we were able to feed that cow then not afford to that she's going to need to meet her energy requirements she'd be eating 3.6 percent of body weight that might be possible in some feed black diets that's still on the high side and probably not possible with our forage based diets so we have to find some other ways to reduce maintenance requirements and the amount of feed that those cows are going to require so just a couple ways that you can do that many of you are probably already doing some of these things need to think about providing some higher quality forages or grain or by-product feeds just more energy-dense feeds again forage will generate the most amount of heat per unit but we can't get in the forage into them based on that really high energy requirement and it's also difficult for cattle to utilize our quality feeds when it's cold because intake increases passage rate increases and nutrient utilization will actually decrease and so just providing the higher quality feeds is a good idea at that time separating off thin and young cows seperate and feeding them separately is a good idea if you have facilities just to give them a little more attention and again be strategic about the cattle that you need to maybe provide a little more nutrient-dense feeds also Lisa mentioned that Gerry mentioned it wind breaks and shelter are really critical that's going to really help reduce the effect of the windchill and reduce that effective temperature if natural shelter isn't available need to get out there and provide some portable wind brakes tires hay bales whatever you've got a lot of you already probably feed in late afternoon or early evening if you can stand it I know a lot of times it's hard for producers to kind of wait to feed but basically what that does is just kind of generates more heat of fermentation later in the middle of the night when those cattle me with most and typically the temperatures at the lowest wanted to just mention hay waste most producers are utilizing round bales and that's good for minimizing labor but we do know that studies have shown that waste is could be pretty high when you're rolling out bales twenty to forty five percent so you are in the situation where you're having to unroll bales out on feed ground it's a good idea to try to limit access a one versus a four day supply they've shown that is a waste is reduced by twenty percent so obviously if we're coming into a blizzard situation and you feel like you need to put a few days of feed out go ahead and do that this is just thinking long term over the entire feeding period providing it one day at a time is probably your best bet feeding on fresh ground if possible is going to be important to increase utilization and intake and then obvious defeating low-quality hey first and trying to encourage them to consume all that before they go to the high quality feeds it's really difficult to put out high quality feed and then kind of force them to go back and consume that low quality forage so we're thinking about reducing waste a couple things come to mind obviously using a bail processor so basically that just functions to reduce particle size increase passage rate and then increase intake so it's a good way to increase utilization of low to medium quality forages disadvantages possibly some increased costs due to labor fuel investment in equipment you can also get some leaf loss particularly on windy days which we have a lot here in Norfolk North Dakota so that's just a consideration you can look at your increased feed availability and utilization versus the amount of cost that it's going to take to get you there hay feeders are certainly another option they've been shown to really reduce feeding losses it doesn't work in every situation obviously but the cone feeder with a waste panel at the bottom it's definitely a consistent feeder that results in the least amount of hay waste so this just goes back to calculating you know conducting a hay inventory and calculating how much you're going to need to get you through the rest of the winter again just a couple of examples here so we need to know body weight of our cows need to know the percent of body weight as forage that they're consuming and that's based on forage quality which you get from your forage analysis and then we're going to need to calculate in a waist factor here to get pounds of forage consumed per cow per day just example 1400 pounds eating 2 and 1/2 percent of body weight I put in the waist factor of 25 percent and so they're gonna be eating red needy right around 44 pounds per cow per day if we have a 60 day feeding period to get through hopefully we're gonna have green forage available after that and so that's the total amount of forage needed per cow you also need to know your Bale weights and your dry matter again that's your nutrient analysis and so based on our vale weight and a 90% dry matter that's how much dry matter we have will prevail so we end up right around 2.2 bales per cow and you could do a quick estimation of this just based on one bale per cow per month adding in a little bit of extra like I said for waste and this doesn't necessarily mean that this is exactly how much each cow needs I'm just gonna have to adjust based on temperature condition forage quality and all those other factors that we've kind of talked about when you do look at supplementing some low quality forages it's important to know what your goal is and how to most effectively meet that goal and so if we're talking about low quality forages that have less than 7% protein that's the point at which ruminal fermentation could be limited and so we need to look at providing a high quality protein supplement containing greater than 20% so we've got alfalfa hay soybean meal distillers grains the nice thing about cows is they can be fed these every two to three days because of their ability to recycle nitrogen if you've got a forage with greater than 7 percent protein might need to look at supplying an energy supplement and again that's going to be based on the different requirements of your various production groups and you need to kind of look at whether you choose a fibre versus a starch based supplement so some of our fiber supplements are soy hulls wheat myths and distillers grains and our starches are our feed grains corn barley and other things like that so we know if we feed too much starch on a forage based diet it's gonna reduce digestibility and intake of the forage and that's just based on changes to microbial population so there's some things you can do to strategic and make sure that you're meeting those needs effectively without too much impact on the microbes just when I quickly show you a feed cost calculator this was developed jointly by the North Dakota farm management education program and NDSU Extension this is just a simple Excel spreadsheet and you can go in and customize all of your feed stuffs and you can put in weight we thought it was really important to include your trucking cost how many miles that you have to incorporate when you're evaluating that so you get a total tracking cost you can go down here and nutrient content and use your values from your feet analysis and plug those in it'll calculate your dry matter per ton your new trip your energy and protein per ton and what you end up with is dollar amount per pound of nutrient and so that's what we want you to use to compare supplements when you're trying to make those supplementation decisions and just a couple additional considerations before I turn it over to John really important to not forget about water we know that cold use is going to increase metabolic water use and so this time of year we don't think about cow's water requirements as much as we do in the heat of summer but they still require adequate water for making sure that we get good feed I jest in the utilization and maintain performance and health especially with lactating cows so probably minimum a gallon 400 pounds of body weight I know people have had a huge amount of challenges this year I'm just dealing with ice and the tanks so a couple different options here for tanks that maybe aren't next to an electric source a propane stock tank heater there's water circulators some of those may result in some excess water flow and so that can be a challenge but check into different products that are available out there and then another thing is you just need to once we get your forage analysis done your hay inventory done want to take a look at how that's performing in your cow herd again evaluate that body condition score and take a look at manure consistency this pile here or there's not really a lot of solid rating shows that that cows getting a little bit of excess protein here we have adequate protein but you see some rings and again there's usually a crater type appearance at the top of the pile and then down here we get into deficient protein there's definitely very obvious rings and usually this manure pile would be very firm so that's just one other option for evaluating the nutrient status of your herd again I've known I've thrown a lot at you tonight be sure to contact me if you have questions or put them in the chat box and I'm going to go ahead and turn things over to John do better and he's going to talk to you about in limited hey Thank You Jana welcome to anybody who might have joined us on the webinar up here in mine it we've had a couple days a reprieve from the weeks and weeks of bitter cold wind chills which stressed a lot of things equipment people a livestock and calves and unfortunately I think we're all aware that there's some more stuff coming to North Dakota and some new challenges with some blizzard conditions it's truly amazing to me just how Hardy our cattle are is these pictures kind of illustrate they can cope with a lot when we do our part to get them out of the wind have a little back pad on them and keep their rumen full so they generate some heat of fermentation and have some energy to deal with the wind chills and the cold in the cases when we can't do that for one reason or another we got some cattle suffering from some lameness or age it's pretty conceivable to have cows lose three or four pounds a day in a condition score within less than a month of time we've talked about how their energy needs go up with the cold and the wind chill and along with that their appetites go up the rate of passage goes up they can eat more feed and we a stock them and give them more feed because it's absolutely necessary what that does though is it puts us in a position now that some things have happened what we thought was an adequate feed supply all sudden is starting to look a little short and we've got some instances of people running a little low and concerned that their hay might not get them to where they need to go how that happens is just looking at what we've had to do if we've been feeding 35 pounds of hay normally under more normal weather and we've had weeks upon weeks of extreme weather with minus 40 and 30 wind chills daily and we've had 50 pounds we've all sudden fed 40 percent more hay over those two months that's led us to a situation where we might have to adapt some management to stretch the aid that we still have we're not there any worse close to grass for most of us turnout might be in mid-may even late May so we need to have a plan on how we're going to get there one of the things that we can do is we could probably go out and try to find some additional hay the reality of being able to find it and the cost we might be able to locate it or is probably time to look at some other alternatives most cases beating some grain or concentrate feed and limiting the hay somewhat might be an option that we really have to consider Lee sit consider I've got two rations in this slide one for the last month of gestation the one for the and one for the first month of lactation as calving is undergoing right now we know what a cow needs for her energy needs and we know we can supply that with medium to better quality hay if we've had 40 pounds in late gestation or fed 45 pounds in early lactation if we don't have that much hey we could restrict the hay to probably 30 pounds feed 5 or 6 pounds of corn and with the bedding and a little extra straw out there to help her get content and fill up the room and we could still meet her tdn or energy needs if we happen to have a limited supply hay but we're long on silage we can adjust the ration as well to feed a lower percent hey maybe a third hay two-thirds or more silage and we can mean her needs that way now I recognize some people are a little careful about how much silage a high-energy feed they could feed a calving time bill concerned about hi milk production to a young calf who can't handle it the potential will cause some digestive or scouring calves but we can manage that by limiting that to an appropriate level feeding grain is a little different than feeding hay so we got to take things a little slower and understand that we got a potential to cause some digestive problems if we don't do it right for the most part it's a new feed to cow it's a fast digesting feed and it should be introduced into the rash and fairly slowly we don't want any cows to overeat too fast create and acidotic rumen and might have some consequences of bloat and Founder and so forth typically we also want to try to feed these start to your grains at a low percent of the ration just so we don't interfere with the digestion of the fiber that might be in the ration we still get the value out of our forages general that's feed less than four 10% of body weight or in the cows in this state that might be four to six pounds for wheat and barley we know cracking them breaking the seed coats gonna create intensive digestibility of those feeds and we also like Janice said some of our rations may be short of protein and maybe a grain by-product which is typically higher in protein may be more appropriate than feeding just a straight grain as well as when we feed these byproducts or a higher grain ration they're high in phosphorous low in calcium you might want to consider that or check our mineral to make sure we're not over feeding phosphorus and under feeding calcium and pick a mineral with the right blender proportions of those two but most importantly if we're gonna feed a limit amount of grain to a herd of cows we have to have a way of getting it out there get distributed so we don't have some cows eating excessive amounts that some cows not getting enough so we got to give each cow her fair share and distribute the grain over a pretty wide area for that to happen one of the biggest challenges is how you do that how you get four or five pounds of grain to your cows you know timely matter and everybody gets a share and it's hard to handle grain if all you've got is a loader tractor for most people who are for people who are feeding a mixed ration it's a feed bragging certainly just weighing in the grain adding it to the mix of forages and feeding it out works very well some people are not equipped with silage you're gonna feed silage and so we've got some other options with that and we could probably get a cake feeder or kick box go out there and put it all on the ground or we can add an attachment to a you know a bale process or some of them have hoppers you can put 2030 bushels of corn or grain in and top dress the Shred hay feeding grain has also got some challenges and that sometimes it's pretty difficult with a large herd of cattle to feed them in such a way that we can actually minimize the waste you know if we've got hard frozen ground dry sod or compacted snow and ice you know cows will do a pretty good job of licking up grain off of those surfaces however if we get some slush and mud and deep snow it won't work very well in those cases we almost have to go to feeding these things in some kind of a bunk system or if we're feeding it on the sod or the ground certainly it's even better to feed small piles that's with a trip hopper on your feeding attachment so we put little files over a roll rather than a continuous very small shallow line of grain certainly grain feeding is a weight and stretch artery for a little bit it's also something that we might be kind of required to as hay by the hay piles this diminishes and we just have to stretch everything so we're gonna do what it takes and I commend you for being the Stockman you are and you know taking care of these cattle under these difficult conditions and now I'm gonna turn it over to dr. Karl toppy and he's gonna talk to us a little about where maybe we can source some of these additional treats thank you John I know in our part of the world here when has really been extended cold and I hear you've been used up pretty quickly this year and we're now looking for other options to supplement our cow herds so I'll turn the feeds are certainly one of those things can be used co-product feeds are moderate to high in protein they're moderate to high in energy content as well a couple of things that poor quality forages straws definitely need to have added to it so Coke products work well as a supplement or a partial replacement for a forage space ration we're excitingly well for low quality forages like straws or Slough Hays or we've already used our good quality feeds and we need to add something to the poor quality feeds co-products certainly are something that Brooke held quite well surprisingly North Dakota has many co-products Mills crushes refineries and processing plants across the state when you get the other states they don't have the number of opportunities that we have in North Dakota now I recognize that most of these crushes and mills and processing plants are located in the eastern part of the state which means that we have ready access on our side and western side of the state they have the same access but they have freight costs and EPA just how much coke products do we produce in North Dakota there's two examples that I'll share of just how much volume we produce our state mill and elevator that's owned by the state of North Dakota it's the largest single durum wheat mill located in the world at one location there's other companies that are bigger but we actually have the largest in one location at mills 90,000 bushels of wheat a day our durum into flour semolina that means it produces a co-product they mail out the starch the co product the fiber and the proteins are left over and that's called wheat meds or wheat middlings and they produce a hundred ton a day which is around 33 semi-loads just to give a feeling at 10 pounds per head per day they produce enough feed to feed 20,000 head of cattle uh daily North Dakota has 900 thousand head of cattle almost a million head of cattle so you can see that 20% of our of our cowards in North Dakota could be fed just what would produce out of this one particular mill it's a high-quality feed of 18 percent crude protein and 83 percent even more production in co-product feeders found in our ethanol distilleries across North Dakota we have five plants in North Dakota they produce 3,000 3,500 to 4,000 tons daily of distillers grains that's on a dry matter basis give them the cow inventory that we have we could feed seven pounds of distillers grace utilizes feed to every cow every day or if we just looked at a seventh month period we could feed twelve pounds of distillers grains per day there's that much product produced in North Dakota 12 pounds of distillers grains would really take the edge off of how much hay is needed for our cow ration not only that if you look at 30 percent good protein you're giving almost three and a half pounds of crude protein per cow per day which just is a heck of a lot of protein to provide to a cow but on a poor quality ration that might be something at Cal certainly needs this time of the year again it's 38 percent crude protein and eighty-six EDM again high-quality feeds go products there's two big issues that occur with them and that's going to be the pricing of it as well as the freight freight costs can get to be pretty high it's very competitive with other local feeds when you look at the price of these Co products but you have to include the price of the freight Western North Dakota certainly will have a higher costs on our eastern part of North Dakota it has to compete with our other feats like grains Hays and other available Co products but there are some limitations on our products there are some long-term stability issues with some wheat meds tend to take moisture out of the air and consequently mold unless they've been put on the air floor during the summertime the cellar screens used to have abridging problems with it you can still have things like distillers excuse me wheat mids is very light and fluffy unless it's pelleted which increases density to foal and makes it a lot easier to transport some feeds like the wet corn gluten feed or the wet distillers grains or beet tailings or beet pulp all are high in moisture and of course mold can become an issue to calculate and cost per pound a nutrient and easily be done it's just a matter of taking the feed that you're going to be using and taking the cost per ton and dividing it by the energy content of the feed so in this example I used $90 ton wheat meds that has an 80 60 DM you do the math and all of a sudden your cost per pound of protein counted tdn or energy content is five cents a pound if you need these tdn values go to our NDSU a s 1182 alternative by-product feeds publication that has a directory of of prices of tdn values in the end the price of TD n values we have a bunch of co-products across North Dakota in most parts they're all low in starch and high in fiber and high in protein feeds that are perfect for a coward that's being fed a low for a low quality forage in the milling process or fermentation process most of the starch is removed in these products and/or the oil if it's a oil seed results going to be something that's very high in fiber and usually high in protein - and this fiber I need to point out is very digestible in the rumen diet distillers grains are produced in five different plants in North Dakota third senescent all at Casselton Hank is in renewable energy at Hank and Sutton Dakota spirit AG ethanol spirit wood bluefin ethanol at underwood as well as red trail energy at Richardson it's a very popular feed you can see some of the values over here it's very palatable that that's an understatement cows really go after the sweet quite well it mixes well with other feeds conditions the feed maybe there's a limit to 30% of the diet this is some of the sulfur issues that you want to use there are ethanol plants and other parts of the in South Dakota and other states that can be trucked into North Dakota too right now they've raised the price of distillers grain so it's still cost competitive but at $160 a ton it's no longer the cheapest feeds out there that we can provide to our cow herd wheat middlings is another option there's five plants in North Dakota that produces wheat meds Dakota growers in Carrington Minot milling in Minot iron in milling down at Fairmont of course North Dakota Mellon Alva that we talked about in Grand Forks and to a lesser extent the plant up in can do some of these have already been their source to supply has been booked out for the year although at the mill and elevator and Dakota growers availability is still available an 80 or 90 dollars a ton turns into a fairly competitive feed corn gluten feed is created through the process of a wet corn milling which is the plant located on a Wahpeton North Dakota at Cargill of course when corn milling makes high fructose corn syrup and the leftover product is 83% tdn 20% protein very palatable it can be sold as either dried or wet you need to contact these people because usually availability is was rather reduced because they're sold out it's that popular it's very palatable soy hauls is a product that we haven't had in North Dakota unless we Freight it in for Minnesota or South Dakota until the recent several years now the ADM planted Enderlin is producing soy hauls since they're now crushing North Dakota soybeans so high energy content feed it's pelleted it's protein can range from 8 to 13 percent so be sure to know what your product is if you may not be considered a protein source for your feed but it certainly is a replacement for for our feed I do have to point out that it's usually high in calcium and low in phosphorus most of our other co products are always high in phosphorus maybe triple x amount of phosphorus it would be in green and of course calcium is quite low a coin like John identified adding extra calcium to co-product feeds is always indicated if you're located close enough to a beet pulp plant or a sugar refinery like American crystalline Hillsboro drayton East Grand Forks or Crookston or even min dak down at Wahpeton they have a supply of beet pulp and tailings that they usually at least American crystal provides a no cost other than trucking bar says you need to be on the list to be able to get it and if you have a trucker that hauls that this is a product that works quite well I think of it as a nice replacement for silage if it's if you're feeding the wet pulp or the wet retailing be sure to know if the moisture content is quite high so that's what limits trucking to usually around a hundred miles away from the plant before other sources of feed get to be priced more competitive we do have protein sources or crushes in North Dakota canola meal is very popular if that's all you need it's usually priced competitive it's produced in Belva as well as in Belem or West Fargo even up a holic Minnesota these plants are available linseed Mills crushed him in Cargill and West Fargo on a sporadic basis but it is available soybean meal is priced very high and it works quite well if you want to use soybean in your ration that's produced down ADM and envelope 46% crude protein the real bargain on these particular protein sources right now a sunflower meal so if you're needing protein sunflower meal could be a hundred and twenty dollars a ton even less than that and it's available out of Cargill and West Fargo and it can be available out of northern Sun and Android if you need to have a list of co-products boasts the phone numbers as well as a recent price please go to our account and research extensions on their homepage on the internet and look for livestock and then look for livestock extension and then click on sources and prices for selected Co products in North Dakota and with that good luck in trying to source extra feed for your cow herd if you're running yourself short on hay and can't find a there is a vast amount of co products available in North Dakota if you can find out what's available our next speaker is going to be Miranda Meehan she's our environmental livestock environmental steward specialist and dr. Meehan is here to talk to us about pasture and range turnout issues good evening so I'm gonna just change paces a little bit here and talk about as what we expect as we look forward to a greener grass especially into some strategies to help you plan for the 2019 grazing season one thing I want to keep you all to keep in mind is that yes we do have a lot of snow and there's a lot of moisture in that snow but due to of the timing of melt and in how things melt a lot of that snow is going to be run off and yes it's going to be great for refilling some of our stock dams and surface waters however that is not going to be available there's not going to be the principal source of responsible for our forage production this year 80 percent of forage production in North Dakota B comes from precipitation in May and June so don't be making your grazing management decisions based off of the available precipitation snow that we have right now so when we when I talk we talk about preparing for a grazing season and when should we be putting those cattle out there I know a lot of people use a calendar date the ideal way to do this is to look at grazing readiness based off a plant development or you can estimate it using growing degree days we do have a publication that goes through that so I'm not going to go in detail the simplest way is to go out there look at plant development or introduce pasture species such as crested wheatgrass smooth round grass meadow chrome that would be the three leaf stage and so you just simply are gonna count the leaves starting from the bottom one two three and then for our native species it would be the three and a half leaf stage and why do we use this as a rule of thumb it's important to be looking at this and not crazy in our class too early because grazing too early can stress those plants out and actually result in up to a sixty percent decrease in your forage production for the grazing season as a typical rule of thumb we expect our crested wheatgrass is already early May our ohms smooth brown grass metal grown grass being the most common typically ready to graze in mid-may if you have post contracts here peel and that's typically stuff that's coming on contract is typically somewhere called intermediate wheat grasses and you can expect that to be available in late May and our native pastures typically aren't ready until earliest is early June depending if you're cool or warm season dominated and that would be our full season dominated pastures which are most common across the state however I want to keep him remind you and is that that there's a lot of variability so we don't want you want to be careful but just looking at those states it varies across the state some research that we've been doing with with the extension agents across the state shows a two week variability between counties when different species are available to graze and also we have year to year variability so just because that's the gate you were able to start crazy last year does not mean that that's when our species are going to be available to graze this year so the last two years I have been recommending agents across the state to monitor grazing readiness for some of our common passion of these species Chris wheatgrass smooth brown grass and then our most common native species would be Western week for us we also have some what that green needle grass but there's some challenges there because it's a little bit more difficult to identify early in the grazing season in 2017 if we found that crested wheat grass was a was ready to graze at that three leaf stage around May fourth where a broom was actually earlier at late April April 24th where our Western wheat grass wasn't avail wasn't at the three and a half leaf stage until the end of May almost Morial day one of the reasons you'd be probably wondering why is crested wheat grass behind smooth grown grass when I said that should be available to graze earlier I don't know if you guys if you remember that we warmed up pretty early in 2017 but then we had a cold snap later as things were starting to grow and that said some of our grasses back including the crusted me curse which was further in development at that time I did have to get a lot of pictures from County agents where they were out there monitoring and grazing readiness and they had pictures of the grass was snow looking at 2018 a crested wheat grass was similar we were at May 11th and then our smooth brown grass was actually two weeks later at May 7th so typically around where we would normally expect it to be our Western grass was about the same at that end of May May it May 20th it was this year so one of the things that we've seen here though we actually seen a delay in some of the species because of the drought to 2017 depending on if those areas if pastures were grazed hard they seen a decrease in in productivity and a delay and grazing readiness in some areas so I expected something similar this year with we will have a delay in our Gracie and readiness because it's gonna there's a delay with all the snow when our plants are going to start growing and photosynthesizing and her grounds going to take longer to warm up how long that delay is going to be I can't say right now we do plan on working with the agents across the state and monitoring again this year so hopefully we can keep you up to date on that as we move forward I know a lot of you are probably it changed to get out and get your cows out of lots and especially the snow when it starts to melt you're going to have a mess and really like you want to get them out of there you're also running hit short on hay supplies so here there's some strategies you can look at you get them out there a little earlier but while reducing that the stress to those those pastures and I'm talking about these and what I would say the order preference so ideally if you can looking at supplementing on hair pastureland kasher again need it or we those can graft species not native specifically things like the domes and your and your crested and then providing them some additional forward if you Forge if you still have it available are supplementing with some of the other products that Carl talked about the next one thing to look at would be grazing some of those domesticated grass pastures then moving and if you don't have that as option utilizing some of your winter annuals for spring grazing and Phil should be available early May so things like triticale rye or winter wheat if if you planted those last fall then the next thing if those aren't options for you would be evaluating what you have for native native pastures native rangelands we have a pretty big issue across the state with kentucky bluegrass invading our native rangelands and and becoming dominant on a melon long pasture especially eastern portion of the state so if look at this picture here this would be a patch or pasture that's been taken over by a Kentucky bluegrass so that would be a good option if you're gonna graze native range if you have a pasture looks like that starting there actually could help decrease your Kentucky bluegrass you're using it early in the season and give some your Nadeau's a competitive advantage one thing is that this would be very bowl of protein so you definitely would need to supplement protein in this situation and then finally if if you have to graze native pastures choosing one that's dominated by cool season grasses and if you're not sure about composition need some help with the identification contact your extension agent or your NRCS I'm sure they'll be happy and help you with that few other considerations which we haven't talked about yet is this is what especially with this coming storm we're talking in record level historic storms that we need to be thinking about flooding if we have a riparian passion that we usually turn out in the spring maybe avoiding that because it's going to be a mess for one and you're gonna have the decline in health but also that that is gonna tear that pasture up and may reduce its productivity in the long run other thing is you know a lot of you aren't thinking about drill right now except for maybe those of you that were impacted in 2018 but we do we did see that keep that delay in grazing readiness from those areas impacted by the 2017 drought if they're a grazed hard to be also seen decrease in productivity this is a good example of that delay in all over county last year our Western B grass on in mid-may was at the one and a half leaf stage compared to the three and a half leaf stage early May the year before and there's a pretty significant it's probably hard to see in these photos but there's a pretty significant difference in the productivity and the height of the forage and those in those two pictures and they actually seen that as it stayed pretty stunted as it got to the three and a half leaf stage there was an isolated part of the state that did experience drought in 2018 so if you were in that area you also some of you also had the experience don't in in 17 and so being cautious and maybe not starting on pastures that you put extra pressure on and those in those years so they have a little extra time to recover as always try not you know not over grazing if you do put a little extra pressure on a pasture make sure they're you're allowing enough time for it to recover from that extra prep pressure so if you started in a year starting in one of your native pastures early in the grazing season this year making sure that you don't come back into that pasture again until next fall if you need any help with some thoughts or ideas on how increasing management strategies contact me contact your Extension agent or your NRCS and they'll be glad to help you set up some strategies there so with that I am gonna turn it over back over to dr. Charlie was he's gonna have some closing remarks and then we can open it up for Question and Answer all right Thank You Miranda and thanks to all our presenters out there we really appreciate that time you've taken and our attendees out there might notice that many of our specialists are doing this from home and so we want to thank you for the opportunity to come into your homes tonight and from ours to yours so this is the question and answer time we have a few questions as we go through these if you have other questions please type them in and so the first question X I'm going to call on dr. stuck and the question is can you feed a hyperthermic calf colostrum I've heard that a cap won't utilize the classroom until its internal body temp is increased and it will just sit in a cat's stomach can cause blood is this true yeah good question and I think when we talk we were talking about the need for colostrum no matter what method you're warming the calf I think I did say some time during that warming process you need to get colostrum into that calf because you won't have as much success with warming the calf unless that calf has been granted this is warm colostrum so that actually helps a little bit as well so it's just it's every bit as important as you're warming method whether it's a hotbox or or a warm water bath I'm not telling you to put in the colostrum before you start warming the persuit process but at least some time during that warming process put claustrum into that calf and it'll help it'll help that calf build his own energy in addition to what you're already providing to warm that calf all right thanks Jerry next one I think Miranda I'm going to call on you what growth stage should cows be turned out and I think the growth stage is with what growth stage should Cosby turned out on winter annual pastures such as winter rye so we want to turn it out at the vegetative stage I would use the same rule of thumb as we do for our introduced grasses like the three latest age with these if you manage it correctly and don't don't graze it too low you can actually take them off and you'll get regrowth that you'll be able to create again so managing the grazing and one of the keys with these is a lot of people are watching these pastures they have a lot of other things going on so getting them early enough so you can get that wreath grilled because once you head so you don't have that potential for me girl and there's a serious decline in quality too alright thanks Miranda the next question I have is well this is a toss-up I think I'll call on dr. hoppy first but then other panels can come in on that feeding in late afternoon and early evening a her this better for having I was told is this true oh I'm not sure if it's better for actually calving but if you're looking for calving changing the time frame which cattle calf throughout the day feeding in the evening will tend the delay calving until earlier in the morning you'll end up having less night time calvings if you're feeding late in the afternoon or early evening actually the opposite is true in sheep by feeding them within four or five hours you'll end up having more lambs to happen so you don't you want to get away from nighttime watches and sheep be sure to feed them in the morning if you want to get away from nighttime calving be sure to feed the cattle at night or late evening all right thanks Carl we're at Wow hour and 15 minutes we've been at this and thank you very much and all those attending one last call for questions I'm going to call on the presenters if there's any final comments that anything has come up while you watch you present things that you want to make a point duck otherwise if there's no questions cause you're a little bit antsy we shared the link where you can find the feed cost comes later sure Carl if you what we're going to do is at the end of this session and you type in an email so we should be able to email you we have some other supporting documents that we're going to send to all the attendees that were tuned in tonight so we'll be sending down so if there are anything else put in a question box if there's something else you want us to send out but we will be sending out that information let's see I'm trying going down my checklist here I think we've covered most everything any other specialists have any final comments or thoughts dr. Charlie I just I guess I just tell the audience still at this point that we are available our phones are almost always on and so you can get ahold of us and if you have any more questions why we were willing and able to help in any any way we can and thanks Jerry anybody else so I just want to close with thanks dr. Charlie I was just gonna say 20 su leads the University of Nebraska Omaha 48 to 39 with 1220 left in the second half and that's to go to the big NC double-a tournament thanks Lisa and that's that's great okay so thanks good for zooming with us tonight on behalf of India extension we wish to wish you the best over the next few days it doesn't look like it's going to be very nice weather out there if you have more questions at a later date please contact your local County based Extension agent they can field your questions or they can also get in touch with us they have all our contact information when this webinar concludes you should be linked to a brief survey to leave feedback for us we are very interested in your experience this evening with us in the use of this webinar technology and we want to learn from you so if at all possible please take a few minutes and give us your feedback and so with that I'm going to say thank you for your time tonight and good night",
