00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,240
hi I'm Larry lunder field agronomist

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,400
with Pioneer seeds in Western North

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,160
Dakota and today I want to talk to you

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,160
about a very important part of your weed

5
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,840
control program and that is

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:22,160
incorporating a pre-emergent herbicide

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:25,320
into that weed control program now

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,080
oftentimes we hear I don't like to use a

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,060
pre because it might not rain which is

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,640
the case it's not the case this year but

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,820
some years that is the case but what

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,280
adding a pre-emergent does do for you is

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,800
it brings additional modes of action for

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,200
weed control into your field it helps

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,660
you with Troublesome weeds that have

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,059
been shown to been resistant to many of

17
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,780
our post-emergent herbicides such as

18
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:54,600
kosha also what it will do is it will

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,420
help you to maintain your post-emergent

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,760
herbicides longer as we don't continue

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,980
to develop resistance with other weed

22
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,619
species that could become Troublesome

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,619
within our fields

24
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,740
now currently we have resistant to

25
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:13,200
things such as glyphosate

26
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:16,680
many group two herbicides such as a

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,140
sulfonated ureas and many group one

28
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,840
herbicides such as the acc's which are

29
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,600
common commonly used for grass control

30
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,659
and things such as small grain in order

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,540
to maintain the chemistries we currently

32
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,000
have on the market we will need to be

33
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:38,280
very judicious in our management of

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,600
these herbicides so incorporating a pre

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,540
into those

36
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,060
systems will be critical in order to do

37
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:47,220
that long term

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,920
we are demonstrating

39
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,680
many of these pre-technologies and what

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,020
they can do in our enlist executive

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,700
plots across North Dakota and

42
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:02,159
Northwestern Minnesota this year and we

43
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,960
invite you out to visit those on our

44
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,180
tour dates in July

45
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,740
and I will leave you with one more

46
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,039
thought and that is

47
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,420
cleaner Fields will give you bigger

48
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,239
yields

49
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,819
that concludes this Pioneer Agronomy
