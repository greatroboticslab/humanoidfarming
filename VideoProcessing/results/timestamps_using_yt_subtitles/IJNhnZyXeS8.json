watermelon plants need to be nurtured with care to ensure strong growth [Music] but good seeds are just the beginning the soil must be meticulously prepared across 130,000 acres of land equivalent to over 100,000 football fields Farmers till the soil making it loose and fertile the soil needs to be just right providing the roots with the perfect environment to grow strong [Music] and then the newly sprouted seedlings are planted into the soil each carefully spaced to give them room to grow with the help of modern machinery each seedling is precisely placed into the pre-prepared furrows saving the farmers both time and effort afterward a thin layer of soil is gently applied retaining moisture and protecting the young plants from envir enironmental elements even though the planting process has become more efficient with technology the farmer's meticulous care and dedication remain evident in every step they don't just see seedlings they see the promise of the upcoming Harvest

picture this once the watermelon is deemed ready a farmer expertly slices it from the vine and with a quick practiced motion heaves it up into the air waiting on the back of a truck another farmer with the skill of a seasoned Outfield catches it midair and places it gently in the truck bed this back and forth continues as the truck slowly moves through the field with each watermelon tossed and caught with the same precision and care it's a lively and efficient process filled with shouts of encouragement and laughter as the team works together to gather the fruits of their labor every harvested watermelon represents not just hard work but also the camaraderie and deep love for farming that these Farmers share hey he he he hey [Music] after being harvested The Ripe watermelons are
