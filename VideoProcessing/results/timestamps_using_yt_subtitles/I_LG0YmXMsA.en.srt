well- drained and nutrient-rich soil

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,640
before sewing the field must be plowed

22
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,000
to a depth of 20 to 30 cm to break up

23
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,760
compacted layers allowing roots to

00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:09,200
drainage which is particularly important

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,439
as cotton plants do not tolerate water

29
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,479

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,200
treated before sewing by soaking them in

56
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,720
warm water for 8 to 10 hours to

57
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:26,160

after sewing and the soil's moisture

66
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,599

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,039
the cotton processing begins with

197
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,879
cleaning the raw cotton to remove

198
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,639
impurities such as seeds and dust next

199
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:23,599
the cotton is separated and thoroughly

200
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,199
combed to straighten the fibers

201
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,479
facilitating the subsequent stages the

202
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,199
combed cotton is then drawn into thin

203
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,839
strips which are spun into yarn or

204
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,599
fabric fibers the spinning process

205
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,279
utilizes Modern Machinery to ensure the

206
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,640
fibers are uniform and durable if the

207
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,039
final product is large cotton rolls the

208
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,040
cotton is tightly pressed and rolled for

209
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:47,920
fabric fibers the cotton threads are

210
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,040
woven into fabric using automated
