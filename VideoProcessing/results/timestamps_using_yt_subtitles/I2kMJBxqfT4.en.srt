2
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:11,610
it's harvest time for little grower Ron

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,130
Longbottom at his grass patch property

4
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:17,310
near esperance we've been harvesting

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,680
fees for quite a long time say lentils

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,020
for us is quite similar grower interest

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,060
in lentils is on the increase their

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,400
popularity is well-established in

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,859
eastern Australia in w.a

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,470
the industry small but developing

11
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,960
especially in the esperan sport zone the

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,800
interest is prompting research with GRDC

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,510
support into lentil agronomy growth

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,610
harvesting practices and good returns

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,520
being another incentive we've got the

16
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:47,100
soils and the farmers with experience

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,050
with peas and then lentils are usually

18
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:55,710
slightly higher priced so that's sort of

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:57,930
driving the change to lentils GRDC

20
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,030
projects include investment in measuring

21
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,219
and monitoring ways to improve the

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,290
agronomy of lentils and highlighting

23
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,619
some of the new and promising varieties

24
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,360
that don't shatter shed or lodge high

25
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,700
lands just come out I reckon it's gonna

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,030
be a winner and hallmark I think is

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,840
proved very good round locally most of

28
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:20,130
our lentils are bolt but the hallmark in

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,799
highland seemed to have some of their

30
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,689
characteristics plus more herbicide

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,950
options the new variety certainly have a

32
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:28,590
bit more vigor about them and the other

33
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,090
thing we do is were sowing them early so

34
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,950
one of the things that actually ron was

35
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,290
a sort of an innovator was saying the

36
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,490
lentils in the middle of April and I

37
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,759
just jump out of the ground and grow

38
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,759
better

39
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:43,130
one of the critical things with growing

40
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,590
lentils and peas is setting your paddock

41
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:47,719
up properly to start with in years gone

42
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:50,329
by we've tracked changed paddocks to

43
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:52,069
clean up a lot of the stumps and then

44
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:55,189
rolling it straight behind the cedar

45
00:01:52,069 --> 00:02:00,079
which most people that grow please do

46
00:01:55,189 --> 00:02:01,849
and you do the same with lentils modern

47
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,189
harvester fronts are removing barriers

48
00:02:01,849 --> 00:02:06,560
to make harvesting lentils easier

49
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:08,780
including Otto on ground pressure

50
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,040
monitoring yes you see here on the

51
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:15,200
screen this head is in float mode so the

52
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,390
header is picking up off a sensor down

53
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,430
here you'll see the one with the numbers

54
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,590
on it I've sort of told it around about

55
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,660
the one and a half to maintain that

56
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,700
amount of pressure on the ground so as

57
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,590
we're going along the computer in the

58
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,810
header is automatically monitoring him

59
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:31,579
as precious through that potentiometer I

60
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,470
don't really need to hang on to the

61
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:36,290
hydrostatic part from the fact that if I

62
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,090
see a stump that is made probably one of

63
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,690
the biggest differences to harvesting

64
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:41,310
legumes I think

65
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,860
[Music]

66
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,110
Harvester setup does require added

67
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,450
contingencies to avoid cracking the

68
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,790
lentils in hotter weather sort of got

69
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,700
you concave quite open you've slowed

70
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,709
your rotor down similar fan speed to if

71
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,610
you are harvesting wheat because lentils

72
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,380
are quite heavy

73
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,920
you can have your sips at a similar

74
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:04,110
setting to wheat taking steps to

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,810
minimise fire risk is important because

76
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,540
lentil residue has a low ignition point

77
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,090
ron has installed thermal blankets to

78
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,550
reduce risk this is the muffler and the

79
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:18,660
exhaust so they wrap around and then

80
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:21,239
they continue down here at the turbo the

81
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:24,180
manifold and the turbo themselves are

82
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:26,640
the hottest parts that's one of the sort

83
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,019
of the engine modifications we've done

84
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,130
you know to sort of help with reducing

85
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:34,319
fires apart from some on-farm storage

86
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,420
mark Seymour says upfront investment to

87
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,090
launch inter lentils doesn't need to be

88
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:41,310
overly significant well lentils easy to

89
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,440
store you don't have to have a sealed sy

90
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,019
like bond and carrier put this big shed

91
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,180
up it can hold 2,000 tonnes of lentils

92
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,090
they tarp them up and they're good for

93
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,940
six or seven months Mark's advice is to

94
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,910
give lentils ago they offer an option of

95
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,860
another break crop in the rotation and

96
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,260
grdc's project priorities are all aimed

97
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:05,790
at achieving increased yields and grower

98
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:08,310
returns I think it's not as hard as it

99
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,930
can sound certainly the harvesting puts

100
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,970
people off but as you've heard from Ron

101
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,829
and other people that the harvesting

102
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,150
with new headers is quite different to

103
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:16,600
ten or fifteen years ago

104
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:19,739
so if don't be scared

105
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,739
