1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
in the Alabama Cooperative Extension

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:07,140
system we are in the business of helping

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,440
people the animal waste and nutrient

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,820
management team can help producers

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,880
effectively use the mineral and

6
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,310
nutrients within it Alabama Cooperative

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,070
Extension is my number one go-to and

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,289
resource from our farming operation our

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,260
team consists of extension specialists

10
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,260
regional agents and agency partners who

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,289
want to help producers use animal waste

12
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,809
in a way which is beneficial both to

13
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,640
their farms and the environment our

14
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:37,559
mission is truly to talk about

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,090
environmental stewardship and what

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:40,680
nutrient management should be how

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:42,899
nutrient management is a part of

18
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,000
environmental stewardship we have a lot

19
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,370
of soils in this state that are degraded

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,140
Souls we've got to figure out those ways

21
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,730
that we can be more productive and one

22
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,800
of the best ways to do that is to

23
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,829
increase soil health and we can do that

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,350
through wise use of animal manures soil

25
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,690
and Mineo testing has great benefits it

26
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,989
is important to know not only what you

27
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,939
have eaten your soles but also what you

28
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:08,670
are applying to them really common

29
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,189
testing on a regular basis by sending

30
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,010
samples to a small testing lab like the

31
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,950
one here at Auburn University soil

32
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,420
testing grip sample is one of the best

33
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,130
things you can do you need to know

34
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,740
what's going on in your soul and what

35
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,290
your needs are we can give you

36
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,189
information on efficient use of manure

37
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:33,570
such as when and how much to apply I

38
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:36,540
definitely would say here and on any

39
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:39,840
cropland acres we certainly don't over

40
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:42,960
ply we try to apply enough to get what

41
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,090
we need to get as far as yields and and

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,610
get to the pasture where we need to get

43
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,630
it and by using soil tests to try to see

44
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:54,149
if we should or shouldn't apply

45
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:55,590
overflying fertilizer it's not throwing

46
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:57,360
money away but it's not helping the

47
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:59,460
environment you really have to pay

48
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,900
attention to your nutrient management

49
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,670
there's much to be lost from

50
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,160
over-application as there is under

51
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,380
application you have to do it wisely

52
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,360
we can't start not what we know is being

53
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,480
sound environmental stewardship

54
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,190
practices and so we can do that we're

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,530
not here selling anything we have

56
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,880
nothing but pre advice to give and so

57
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,100
that's what we're all about is helping

58
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,650
growers to help themselves and to help

59
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,630
the land also there's time certainly

60
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,480
that I've called our Regional Extension

61
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,970
agent up those are great resources to to

62
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,400
help us it helps clear the mind up and

63
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:35,459
answer the question so we've got to

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,140
produce much more with less we're all

65
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:40,410
working together towards the same goal

66
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,030
and we'll get the job done but it's a

67
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,130
partnership in between the farmer and

68
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,220
extension it's going to help us to get

69
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:49,530
there call or email us and we will help

70
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,870
