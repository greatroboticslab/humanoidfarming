00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,440

2
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:12,719
hoggingservices.com out here on another

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,960
job this weekend

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,199
opening up some trails and you can see

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,080
behind me what we have done

6
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,359
uh when we got started it was basically

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,600
fingertip to fingertip

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,119
along this trail and the owner wanted it

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,800
open up and it's a lot of this florida

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,240
scrub that you see behind me

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,359
and uh getting it done so it's been

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,760
about

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,480
about four hours so far getting through

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,239
it pretty quick

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,840
uh we got the bottom of light today it's

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,760
the only thing heavy enough to

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,120
get through some of this and here's what

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,320
uh

19
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,760
the bomb of light can do to some of

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,760
these trees you can see it's basically

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,360
shaved that in half it's not a mulcher

22
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,840
but it'll certainly cut that down and

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,120
allow you to pick it up and move it and

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,039
i'm not sure why he ran over that one

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,399
but he did

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,520
so i'm going to spin you around and

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,160
we're going to go back and take a look

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,440
at

29
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,520
the tractor in action with the

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,119
heavy duty bomb of light on there here

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,720
we go

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,400
this job ended up being more work than

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,840
anticipated had to put a lot of branches

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,479
on the ground

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,080
like over here back there came along

36
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,680
with the chainsaw

37
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,000
each of us took a turn and basically

38
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,320
whooped us

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,680
soaked to the bone uh from sweat out

40
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,840
here in the florida

41
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,920
humidity so kind of overcast today it

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,360
rained a little bit ago so it hasn't

43
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,920
been too bad

44
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,600
but with that humidity it's just hot so

45
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,079
about an hour on that chainsaw is about

46
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,640
any but

47
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,520
as much as anybody can take you can see

48
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,960
a peek at the bottom of light up there

49
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,960
let's take a break we'll be right back

50
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,520
all right mosquitoes and horse flies are

51
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,439
out today welcome to florida

52
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,439
the rainy season just kicked off

53
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,840
watch out he's probably backing up

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,159
this is the last bit we've done here

55
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,320
[Music]

56
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,840
we got lucky the owner added some work

57
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,360
to it

58
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,959
we made a couple extra hundred bucks for

59
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,160
clearing around the pond

60
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,599
you gotta be careful not to get near

61
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,160
that thing that thing will throw a rock

62
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,160
off yards

63
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,000
it's kind of like working with a

64
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,640
sledgehammer compared to a regular

65
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,560
brush cutter we had a tail wheel put on

66
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,840
it that was a fail

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,599
somewhere along the way it looked like a

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,200
pin got pulled out the tail wheel fell

69
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,040
out and he ran over it

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,120
dented it kind of jacked it up so we'll

71
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,920
have to try to repair it later

72
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,519
we have to get a new wheel just

73
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,840
disappointing i hadn't even really used

74
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,840
it yet

75
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,959
back right into those palmettos it won't

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,879
multiple meadow but it'll

77
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,560
it'll cut a palmetto stalk and uh unless

78
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,480
if it's the real fibrous piece it won't

79
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,159
it won't uh mulch it like

80
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,480
otherwise it will uh do a real number on

81
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,480
the palmettos

82
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,080
all this strobe that you see around here

83
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,599
like this stuff

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,519
the only time it gets difficult is when

85
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,959
the branches hang over

86
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,640
the field and then they get in the way

87
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,640
of the track to the cab

88
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,319
which is why we got to go out with a

89
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,280
chainsaw

90
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,519
ahead of the cutter and cut those

91
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:33,840
particular branches down so we can

92
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:33,840
move efficiently in the tractor

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,680
but we're gonna keep this video short

94
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,080
