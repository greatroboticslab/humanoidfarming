  "text": "[Music] capsum slamming in Kenya is a profitable Venture but many farmers struggle especially during the germination stage with the right guidance however you can grow cups scums from seed to harvest and make the most of these high demand vegetable in this tutorial we will walk you through every step from selecting the best cap scum seeds to planting from test control to harves in now we shall cover the following topics the caps in Kenya the best time to plant cap scums in Kenya the best soil for caps scums farming the best cap scum variety to grow in Kenya how to raise cap scum seed drinks caps scum's planting and spacing cap scam fertilizer application schedule caps scum's past and control methods and finary CS scams diseases and how to control them the ccam market in Kenya ccams enjoy a stud demand in Kenya particularly in the Mass market and grocery stores Brokers absorb around 70% of the total production making it easier for Farmers to sell in bulk and secure fast revenues C scums prices typically range from 30 shillings to 80 Shillings per kilo fluctuating based on supply and demand prices are highest during the times of extreme shortage the best time to plant cups scams in Kenya for the highest profits ideal time to plant CS scamps in Kenya is February and September this allows you to harvest during Easter and Christmas festive season when the demand is highest planting this month ensures your crop are ready for Harvest when the prices are pick to maintain a steady income ensure a continuous Supply by stuggling your planting and harvesting times buyers prefers farmers who can provide consistent deliveries regardless of the season the best soil for cups comes farming before investing in caps scum farming ensure your soil is suitable caps scums thrive in deep fertile well drained room soils avoid planting in Fertile in fields previously used for potato or tomato farming as these crops share paste and diseases that could damage your caps scum crop the best cap scum variety is to grow in Kenya for better yields choose high yield hybrid caps scum varieties these are more resistant to diseases and paste here are two of the best varieties for Kenyan Farmers number one Maxell Maxell is a popular open pollinated sweet paper variety known for its heavy fruiting the fruits weigh around 200 g and each plant can yield 4 to 5 kg Maxell matures in about 90 days and has a high tolerance to Tomato mosaic virus Maxell variety planting density or the planting population is around 900 plants per 200 200 140 square m or 20,000 lb per acre the second good variety for for Farmers is super Bell F1 super Bell is a hybrid variety with broky ropes and V fleshy fruits it has a mild flavor and high resistance to Tomato mic virus and potato virus harvesting starts 65 to 75 days after transplanting it can yield up to 25 tons per acre how trat C scum seedings seedings establishment is where most Farmers fail C scums seeds take four to 5 weeks to establish however this can be accelerated by soaking seats in an Optimizer or city shooter solution before planting SE seeds shallowly and cover them with black paper to shorten the germination period by up to 2 weeks how to plant capsicum and the spacing for best result space capsicum plant 45 cm by 45 cm this allows for 20,000 plants per acre use well decomposed fard manure andate a valer before transplanting after transplanting drench the plants with insect sides like thunder and a f feed like City shooter to protect against catoms and other paste capsicums are fertilizer application schedule this is how you should now apply fertilizers from planting to harvesting on 14 days after transplanting apply dap to promote Loot and fer growth 40 days after transplanting apply NPK 17 to stimulate flowering 60 days after transplanting apply C fertilizer to enhance fruit enlargement additionally use nitrogen potassium and calcium FIA fertilizers like easy grow vegetative Advanced K and Cal marks to boost plant health and fruit produ prodution further caps scum paste and how to control them these are the most destructive paste in capam familyi number one lead spidermites these are tiny paste that feed on the underside of the Rees causing yellowing and upward cing to control them apply profile at the rate of 10 ml per 20 L of water or escort at the rate of 8 ml per 20 L of water the second past is white fries white fries stack nutrients from the Caps plant Heering photosynthesis infested leaves show white waxy material and to control apply thander all profine seites at the late of 10 ml per 20 L of water and the third one is catws these are these are P that cut seedings near the soil level drench the soil with profile at the rate of 3 ml per lit or Pentagon at the rate of 1 ml per liter to control them the other one is loot not nematodes neat called cause loot soiling leading to reduced Vigor and plant depth drench the soil with Alon at the late of 0.5 m per lit or Mas at the late of 10 m per 20 l cap scum diseases and how to control them the most destructive disease is bright it is caused by Fungus phool capsa that leads to Rapid Folia flute and lutro to control apply R gold at the rate of 50 g per 20 l or mistress at the rate of 30 G per 20 lit the best way here is to prevent the infection the next disease is dowy M this disease causes yellow spot on the Leaf surfaces and Browning leading to Leaf Drop and sunb to prevent down M apply at least little gold at the rate of 50 g per 20 L of water the other disease is fium whe fium whe is caused by fium oxum this soil bone fungus leads to vein clearing yellowing and wieling to control fium whe drain the soil with absolute aate of 10 m per 20 L of water absolute is fungicide the other disease which is very very critical is bacteria weight this bacterial disease causes wieling of young leaves and discoloration of vascular tissues contr it apply green cup at the rate of 2.5 g per liter which is a copper based product this will tend to suppress the spread of the fungus capsum farming in Kenya can be highly profitable if you allow the light if you follow the light steps from seed selection P control and harvesting with proper so preparation disease management and continuous harvesting you can maximize your yeld and profit throughout the year we really really hope that you learned something from this tutorial and we hope to see you on the next one in case of any question complaint let us know",
