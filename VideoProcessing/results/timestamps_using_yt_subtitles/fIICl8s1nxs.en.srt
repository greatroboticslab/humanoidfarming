00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,080
hello my name is hans kandel i'm an

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,160
extension agronomist at ndsu

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,519
today's talk is about early planting of

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,200
soybeans

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,559
when we have a

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,800
nice season

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,320
when the temperatures are good and the

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,800
forecast is decent we can't try to start

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,080
planting soybeans in the early part of

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,199
may

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,640
in a large study that we have done with

12
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,760
investigating what farmers actually are

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,000
doing we found that about a third of a

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,800
bushel can be gained if you plant one

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,800
day earlier within that planting window

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,680
and the planting window is somewhere the

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,440
first week of may till the end of may

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,160
so in the experiment that i'm discussing

19
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,399
today we planted as soon as we could get

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,200
get into the field which was the first

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,079
week

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,199
of may and then we came in two weeks

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,520
later

24
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,039
so the objective of this study is to see

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,760
what is the difference when you plant

26
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,600
early versus planting late

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,120
one of the dangers that we can have when

28
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,439
you plant a little early is that there

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,080
can be a frost at the end of the

30
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,479
the beginning of the season like in may

31
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,960
this year we had a frost on the 28th of

32
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,240
may and that caused some of the plants

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,280
to be somewhat injured but in most of

34
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,200
the years if we plant in the second half

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,200
of may like starting what the 15th of

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,400
may the plants will take about a week

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,080
before they germinate and once they come

38
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,520
out of the ground the chance for frost

39
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,280
is limited so there's also a danger if

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,520
we plant too late

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,880
that we might have a frost

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,759
at the beginning of the september month

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,600
like we had last year in 2020 where

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,720
there was a frost at eight of ninth of

45
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,720
september

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,640
versus what is traditionally the frost

47
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,399
date around the 21st

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,439
so we can have the frost early in the

49
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,799
season

50
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,720
and late in the season but what we want

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,680
to do is maximize

52
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,880
the amount of sunlight during the time

53
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,040
that we plant till we harvest so in the

54
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,840
trials that we have done we have found

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,560
over about 18 different environments

56
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,959
that planting early gives about a seven

57
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,440
percent yield increase

58
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,599
however under certain conditions for

59
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,000
instance if you have tile and you can

60
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,040
get in about a week earlier than on the

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,080
non-tile there we saw between early

62
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,599
planting and late planting even at 28

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,000
difference in yield

64
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,239
now the benefit of early planting is

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,519
that we also have the opportunity to

66
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,239
select a variety that matures a little

67
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,080
bit later so we can capture the sunlight

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,640
from the beginning of the season all the

69
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,599
way to the end so we have maturity

70
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,720
groups the zero group if we just go one

71
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,360
or ten

72
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,599
one or two tenths of a point more

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,120
then we can capture more of the sunlight

74
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,920
at the end of the season

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,360
we found that when we look at three

76
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,159
tenths of a difference

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,000
difference in maturity that we can pick

78
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,080
up maybe six

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,440
percent in yield

80
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,720
so in the trial that we are looking at

81
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,720
we can see here behind me is the late

82
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,519
planted where there is still leaves

83
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,519
green and yellow leaves whereas if we

84
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,519
step a little bit to my right where we

85
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,080
planted a little bit earlier all the

86
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,680
leaves are already gone

87
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,040
so the difference between the plots that

88
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,120
we are looking at

89
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,799
is we have here uh

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,239
early maturing

91
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,879
variety

92
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,680
and we have a late maturing variety that

93
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,959
was planted a little bit

94
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,200
earlier

95
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,239
so the benefit here is looking at the

96
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,920
combination of early planting

97
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,000
and maturity

98
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,319
and if we combine those two

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,879
we know that if you have the opportunity

100
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,280
to plant early with that later maturing

101
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,000
we pick up some yield

102
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,799
so the other factor that is important of

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,280
maximizing yield is looking at the

104
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,599
interception of sunlight so we need to

105
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,799
have the right amount of plants within

106
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,040
the fields

107
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,560
our recommendation at ndsu is to have

108
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,159
about 150 000 established plants per

109
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,920
acre

110
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,360
the second factor that is important is

111
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,599
the row spacing

112
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,759
if we have white rows

113
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,919
we are losing some of the yield

114
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,079
potential because the sunlight is

115
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,479
penetrating into the canopy and reaches

116
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,080
the soil surface instead of leaves to

117
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,639
maximize yield

118
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,160
so in the combination of looking at

119
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,960
planting date

120
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,600
maturity and seeding rate

121
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,680
our trial shows that the highest yield

122
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,759
is obtained in the combination early

123
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,400
planting and late maturing

124
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,759
those plants will have the most

125
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,720
capacity to maximize yield however as i

126
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,680
mentioned

127
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,440
we need to get the crop mature before

128
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,320
the fall frost so selecting a maturity

129
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,680
still need to be within what is normally

130
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,800
for your region

131
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:04,080
maybe go one tenth or two tenths of a

132
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,639
maturity later but don't go too late

133
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,600
because then in the end we run into the

134
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,800
frost

135
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,280
here we see the 08 maturing where we

136
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,720
still see yellow and

137
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,680
green leaves on the plant laid planted

138
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,759
the same 08 maturity

139
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,400
if it was planted in that first week of

140
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,479
may we can see that the plant already

141
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,199
has dropped most of the leaves and will

142
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:33,440
be ready for harvest pretty soon

143
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,680
here is an example of a o5 maturity bean

144
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,680
that was planted about two weeks later

145
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,240
than the earliest we could get in this

146
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,840
one was planted roughly in the third

147
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,320
week of may in 2021

148
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,080
i'm comparing this one with a late

149
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,080
maturing variety

150
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,440
this is an 08 maturing variety that was

151
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,840
planted early

152
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,360
and as you can see the o8 has already

153
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,160
dropped its leave

154
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,240
and based on our previous research

155
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,440
we are anticipating that the early

156
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,160
planting

157
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,840
and the late maturing the 08

158
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:15,600
maturing variety will actually outfield

159
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,880
some of the early maturing material but

160
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,479
key is early planting to maximize the

161
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,600
sunlight that we

162
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,600
are receiving during the season
