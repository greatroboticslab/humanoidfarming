1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,859
here's a big old thistle anybody would

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:08,130
recognize it

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:12,690
I've been mob grazing if you will the

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:14,490
horses in this area so they've grazed

5
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,699
this right back the sheep were in here

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,619
before then the horses some people do

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,130
the horses first and then the sheep but

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:28,400
my sheep are my prophet not the horses

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:32,969
so in here you can see there and there

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:36,630
the horses have eaten the flowers of the

11
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:39,540
thistles so it cuts down on the seed

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:44,460
population I'll come in and I'll chop

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,890
this down as well so some of them

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,780
they've left the seed heads is there it

15
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:52,079
didn't quite get to the stage where they

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:56,120
were tasty for the horses but a lot of

17
00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:01,190
the other ones you can see they chomped

18
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:07,799
through all the thistle heads right here

19
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:10,500
there's an old saying a chop in May you

20
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,710
double the display chop and June you've

21
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,830
cut too soon cut in July and you watch

22
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:22,020
them die basically the horses you can

23
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:24,180
see trimmed this thistle bloom and this

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,220
one here but you can see a second one

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,390
coming on so that's basically what

26
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,810
they're talking about is doubling the

27
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,890
display and there's more flower heads

28
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,310
coming up in there

29
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:39,020
despite the horse chop eating that one

30
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:45,030
so these are some more here thistles

31
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:47,009
that the horses ate blooms off of it was

32
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,009
hey I was getting from a particular

33
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,049
farmer was always full of thistle so

34
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:53,640
I've spent years fighting thistles and

35
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,600
when I came home these fields were

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:01,469
nothing but thistles and rye grass so

37
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,380
here you can see the horses haven't been

38
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:08,280
in this section you can see the grass is

39
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:12,020
higher and you can see the flower heads

40
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:14,780
of the thistles forming

41
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:17,300
and when the horses come in they will

42
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,000
eat those so you can see the height of

43
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,430
the grass there versus the height of the

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,800
grass where the horses haven't been so

45
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,680
the horses have been here and they're

46
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,920
going in there now it is eaten back by

47
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,870
the sheep but I'm getting instead of

48
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,760
mowing it or topping it I'm getting the

49
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:38,390
horses and you see they're fertilizing

50
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:42,170
it as well and so I do the field and

51
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:44,810
sections so that their manure is

52
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:50,840
relatively evenly spread I'll now come

53
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:56,180
in and Harrow these products that are

54
00:02:50,840 --> 00:03:00,040
now free of fencing so here you can see

55
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:03,020
for manure piles but they're dispersed

56
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:07,670
around the place they're not all in one

57
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:10,490
location because I've done I think in

58
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:14,750
this small section here you can see the

59
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:18,830
horses up there so in this small section

60
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:23,240
here where you can see the electric

61
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:25,670
fence down that fence line here this

62
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,110
side of the row of trees the other side

63
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:36,940
of this dead oak tree and to there I

64
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:41,090
think I've done three six nine ten

65
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:47,570
twelve paddocks so they're now starting

66
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:50,750
on their thirteenth paddock which is up

67
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:53,510
here at the top and they have a line

68
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,940
that electric fence up there there's a

69
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:59,840
lane for them to go down to the water

70
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:02,780
trough which is right there so you can

71
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:07,820
see here is the product they're grazing

72
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:09,410
and here is the new product sorry this

73
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,700
is the paddock they're grazing now this

74
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,709
is the next paddock they're gonna go

75
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,750
into you can see there's electric fence

76
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:19,040
and that's a third paddock so I'm

77
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:20,720
dividing a strip into three and it

78
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,610
spreads the manure because horses always

79
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,040
have their favorite patch to go and

80
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,590
in a big field and their favorite patch

81
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,190
to eat

82
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:32,130
and this way they have to

83
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:35,040
everywhere and this is is what's really

84
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,470
good for the soil health and I'll come

85
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,810
in with the Harrow you can see they

86
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:42,630
there's no particular location now where

87
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:45,750
they it's everywhere which is great

88
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:48,060
and I'll also come in and chop down

89
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:51,330
those huge thistles now that I've

90
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:54,419
changed where I get my hey I'm no longer

91
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:58,530
I'm working on people who have diverse

92
00:04:54,419 --> 00:05:02,310
wards of hay and feeding my sheep that

93
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:07,110
to resew more into my fields this field

94
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:08,669
here the Rams you can see are right

95
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,889
under that tree over there so they're

96
00:05:08,669 --> 00:05:16,190
sharing their free-ranging in the field

97
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:16,190
but the horses are paddock grazing
