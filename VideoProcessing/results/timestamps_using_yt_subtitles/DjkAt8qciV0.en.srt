1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,279
there are a few facilities around that

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,720
have utilized it

3
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:11,120
but it's fairly new for beef bracken

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,400
county extension agent for agriculture

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,800
and natural resources david appleman

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,240
used to be a full-time dairy farmer but

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,279
he left the dairy business

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,000
25 years ago and applies his farming

9
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,359
knowledge

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,599
as an extension agent today kind of

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,880
kind of my favorite here but when his

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,279
adult children

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,640
wanted to get into a beef cow calf

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,440
operation

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,880
breeding for genetics and quality that

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,440
presented a problem

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,440
we did not have any facilities at all we

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,879
were just open pasture

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,800
and so we knew being employed off the

20
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,840
farm we had limited time

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,000
and so we wanted a facility

22
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,239
that allowed for easy management

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,120
and then we wanted to optimize animal

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,640
performance

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,559
and animal comfort as well

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,320
appleman visited the university of

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,560
kentucky's dairy farm

28
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,720
where there was a compost bedded pack

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,840
barn for cow comfort

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,159
which the dairy cows seemed to enjoy

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,159
appleman got the idea the concept could

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,920
work for beef cows

33
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,840
when it comes to animal rest that's

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,040
something we've forgotten about we don't

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,720
focus on

36
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,560
and we really have to keep in mind that

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,000
if animals are in muddy conditions

38
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,360
they're going to be standing for

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,439
many more hours than normal and you take

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,119
six eight hours of additional standing

41
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,880
just because it's muddy

42
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,799
i think that's where the real stress is

43
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,079
coming on all these beef animals

44
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,720
30 to 35 cows in their fall calves

45
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,320
spend the winter months in this compost

46
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,040
bedded pack bark

47
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,960
they stay out of the mud are fed hay and

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,520
grain in this feeding area

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,360
where appleman said they can control the

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,680
amount of hay loss

51
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,280
the resting or loafing area is this

52
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,399
bedding of sawdust

53
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,560
where cows can lay free of mud and gets

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,119
raked twice a day to keep the area fresh

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,160
appleman said it is a safe way to manage

56
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,520
his herd

57
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,599
while making visual contact every day

58
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,640
we think about our farm population and

59
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,360
we do

60
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,879
see our producers getting older and

61
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,800
still working off the farm so they're

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,360
coming home at night

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
it's dark it's muddy they're taking the

64
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,920
tractor out in the field going through

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,040
gates

66
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,519
and you know among animals that are

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,360
pushing and shoving to get to the feed

68
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,840
and while the cows spend the winter

69
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,120
months

70
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,599
indoors it gives appleman's pastures

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,519
a chance to recover and be ready for

72
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,080
another grazing season

73
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,040
when the cows and calves return to the

74
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,599
pasture

75
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,160
in the spring from the university of

76
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,760
kentucky

77
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:58,800
college of agriculture food and

78
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,800
environment i'm jeff franklin
