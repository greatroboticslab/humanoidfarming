1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,180
thanks Marty I want to thank Ruth for

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,340
putting this together she does all the

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,340
work and I want to thank you for coming

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:18,150
it's always good to talk to real farmers

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,750
last winter if you were here we spent a

6
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:24,689
lot of time talking about water and

7
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:26,460
that's what it's all about is water and

8
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,090
if you look at what impact that we've

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,040
had with with no-till in South Dakota

10
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:34,590
and whatever it's all about water and

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,450
better utilizing the water and we

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,600
calculated a couple of years ago for the

13
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,239
Board of Regents who wanted to know what

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,430
the hell we did the board board of

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,170
directors of Dakota lakes got together

16
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,710
and we met with the Board of Regents and

17
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:56,670
we calculated the difference in crop

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:01:01,260
production in 1987 versus 2014 this was

19
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:03,719
in 2015 if we took the center of the

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,090
South Center and the and in the north

21
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,460
central crop reporting districts in

22
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,500
South Dakota basically that middle third

23
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,650
of the state of South Dakota in the

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,020
middle there we changed the farmers

25
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,880
change there we use the the Woolsey

26
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,110
price the night before Woolsey South

27
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,840
Dakota price we we changed the amount of

28
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,890
grain that they sold by one point six

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,900
billion dollars those are big numbers

30
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:32,909
unless you're in Washington but that's

31
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,310
big that's big numbers in South Dakota

32
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:39,450
that's a big increase in you and it's

33
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:44,220
it's the thing that I noticed from when

34
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:47,729
we first started doing this in 1990 till

35
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,880
now cities like Gettysburg that at one

36
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,909
time years ago in the 60s or whatever

37
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,130
when there's lots of babies had to two

38
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,590
classes in every grade in in the

39
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,719
elementary school and then they went to

40
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,920
one class in every grade and then all of

41
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,600
a sudden they're almost talking about

42
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,649
closing the school they're going back to

43
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,479
two classes and every grade again and I

44
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:11,250
think that's a good news and I think

45
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,200
part of that is how we produce things

46
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,640
and I'm going to kind of follow up a

47
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,740
little bit

48
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,730
with what Cody is doing and then I want

49
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:21,830
to talk about just some real basics a

50
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,959
lot of talk about soil health and muffin

51
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,569
fluff and whatever but they're just some

52
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,090
real basics to how you do how you do

53
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:31,100
no-till and it's and it's just real

54
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,209
simple stuff so we're going to talk

55
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,350
about a little bit of that and then you

56
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:35,740
can go home and get ready for the

57
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,740
blizzard

58
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,239
that's a Dakota Lakes right you know

59
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,550
that's our main station then we have

60
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:46,010
some soils to the north and if you're

61
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,860
not familiar actually that main station

62
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:51,260
the north those North two quarters right

63
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,410
in here those are what we call mill

64
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:56,300
Broyles which would be very similar to

65
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,090
what you see around Kennebec in that

66
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,790
area for you guys further east they're a

67
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,040
bit just a little bit better than the

68
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,680
peer soils and stuff you see out here in

69
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:10,070
some places and then the south side are

70
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:13,989
some pretty good less soils our North

71
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:18,260
unit has the old triple threat with

72
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:20,630
promise opal and sans arcs so those are

73
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,430
ones that you're familiar with some of

74
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,620
you guys here have none soils which are

75
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,720
really quite good soils actually and

76
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,430
then quite if you've formed some farms

77
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,209
and Pierce Pierce oils or something like

78
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,890
that a little trivia question for you

79
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:35,739
there's the soil call all our soils are

80
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:38,810
named after cities and whatever

81
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:41,030
localities right so the sand Sark is a

82
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:44,209
really shallow soil it's about a foot

83
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:47,060
and a half deep over fractured shale and

84
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:49,100
it's a put in half of that real clay

85
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,180
stuff the true virtus all just really

86
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,530
shallow

87
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:58,430
what's that named after well the sand

88
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:00,500
Sark soup right San Sark - tribe there's

89
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:02,269
a little city of San Sark there Craig

90
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,709
across the river from guess Gettysburg

91
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:08,110
but where does that name come from

92
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:15,140
it's French anybody here speak French

93
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:19,459
well in French saans means without Arc

94
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:21,350
means archery or bow and arrow so when

95
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:22,729
the first fur traders first came to that

96
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,340
area across the river from Gettysburg

97
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:27,120
the tribe they ran into there was it's

98
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:30,360
not using bows and arrows

99
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,430
still using Lance's so that's where that

100
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,620
name comes from it's kind of interesting

101
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:36,150
I always like to joke with my Native

102
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,210
American friends from that I said that

103
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,820
those guys were the conventional tillers

104
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:43,620
of the Indian society the last the last

105
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,410
Native Americans to adopt a new

106
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:48,150
technology right we still have people

107
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,960
doing conventional tillage here you

108
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:54,720
shouldn't be doing tillage here water is

109
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,210
too precious to you did a meeting

110
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:01,440
yesterday in Columbus Nebraska get 28

111
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:04,139
inches of rain a year well maybe they

112
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,850
can grow crops without saving water

113
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,699
there and then they got irrigated they

114
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:10,650
got irrigator sitting on fields there

115
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:15,560
where they get 28 inches of water a year

116
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:20,729
and rainfall what a bunch of pessimist

117
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:22,470
right okay this one are native

118
00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:23,789
vegetation looks like we're going to go

119
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,080
to Australia Ruth's not gonna go to

120
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:30,449
Australia in about a month

121
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:33,060
and they have trees everywhere and they

122
00:05:30,449 --> 00:05:35,450
have less rainfall than we have because

123
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:39,090
the rainfall comes in the wintertime

124
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:40,950
when it's cool and it goes deep past

125
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:42,479
because you're not using any water and

126
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:45,780
it all just moves deep and then you've

127
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,280
got trees okay so that the only place we

128
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:50,970
see trees is where there's a major

129
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,690
drainage way so the first time I went to

130
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:57,900
Australia I showed this slide somebody

131
00:05:54,690 --> 00:06:00,240
in the audience went I said yes ma'am

132
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:05,070
she's worried the trees go I said Paul

133
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,229
Bunyan cut him down there's no idea of

134
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:11,550
Paul Bunyan why so you don't do that

135
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:15,630
that was a dumb thing to do so Ruth and

136
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:17,849
I went to France four years ago and we

137
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:19,889
did a kind of it we were in England

138
00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:22,490
first that was fun and then we went to

139
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:26,699
France and they they got us a car that

140
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:29,130
had GPS that would speak English and we

141
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:31,110
would do a meeting I do a meeting from

142
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:34,229
8:00 till noon and then we'd hop in the

143
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,140
car and turn on GPS and go to the next

144
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:38,550
town and somebody meet us for supper and

145
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,900
show us around that town and we do

146
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,920
another meeting the next day and

147
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,410
whatever it's kind of

148
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:46,680
interesting trip but every town we went

149
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,000
to they had to show us their castle so

150
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,440
we went looked at the castle when you

151
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,840
got the grain bins and got and they all

152
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,880
kind of looked pretty impressive and

153
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,010
took a lot of energy to build them and

154
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,350
and a lot of work and a lot of wealth

155
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,970
and whatever and you you know you go in

156
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,530
and now you got the grain bins there

157
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,930
where did where did you produce the

158
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,250
grain that went in the grain bins they

159
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:08,010
said well on the land right around the

160
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,360
castle so you look over the wall and it

161
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:13,020
was so degraded it wouldn't even grow

162
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,440
bushes very well and you'd point that

163
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,390
out that maybe that was one of the

164
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,130
reasons it's no longer castle and when

165
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:24,660
we looked at their soils this is what

166
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:25,290
they look like and this is what they

167
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,060
look like

168
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:28,230
and they're still plowing them and

169
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,640
they're plowing them deeper and they're

170
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,530
plowing up and down the hills and

171
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,780
there's places are plowing down the

172
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,490
hills because they can't plow across the

173
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,020
hills and they can't plow up the oats

174
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:41,610
that can't pull it so they drive up and

175
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:44,180
plow down and so I I started the

176
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,560
discussion by saying my ancestors left

177
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,780
Europe to come to the United States

178
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,300
because they degraded the soil so badly

179
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,190
that they had in Europe that they had to

180
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,340
go someplace else and find soils that

181
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:58,290
weren't degraded and then I said they've

182
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:04,920
done a good job of degrading the soils

183
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:07,260
that they find in the US ok this area is

184
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:11,910
part of the Louisiana Purchase Louisiana

185
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:14,670
Purchase happened because they're the

186
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:17,640
Lavi Andre brothers came from Winnipeg

187
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:20,910
Manitoba they were fur traders and they

188
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,580
came across the Continental Divide in

189
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:25,080
eastern North Dakota if you didn't know

190
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:26,610
there is one there is one there between

191
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,680
the Red River drainage and the Missouri

192
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:31,740
River drainage right there between

193
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,250
Valley City Inn and Jamestown there's a

194
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:38,790
Continental Divide it's about this high

195
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:40,740
okay and and they came across that

196
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:42,330
Continental Divide that came down the

197
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:46,740
Missouri River and they buried lead

198
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:48,630
plates in different areas of around here

199
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,700
we don't know how many they built they

200
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:53,510
buried but one was buried just above

201
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:57,480
Fort Pierre and you can see that one in

202
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:59,610
in the the Heritage Museum and it

203
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,610
claimed this area for France that was 17

204
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:06,360
43 so the white man had been here quite

205
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:08,100
a while you know pretty pretty actually

206
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,380
before the Revolutionary War we had

207
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,850
white guys running around out here

208
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,530
claiming they're here for France you

209
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:18,420
know pretty optimistic guys there too

210
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:21,480
and in the our founding fathers George

211
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:24,780
Washington Thomas Jefferson and those

212
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:28,500
guys were way back in the early part of

213
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:30,690
our nation the late 70s 1700s a few

214
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,550
years more increased surreality will

215
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:34,500
drive the inhabitants of the Atlantic

216
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,330
states westward for support

217
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,620
they were degrading the soils and they

218
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:40,440
knew that and they were trying to figure

219
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:42,750
out what to do about it whereas if they

220
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,090
were taught how to improve the old

221
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:48,390
instead of going on to in pursuit of the

222
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:51,570
new and productive soils they would make

223
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:54,120
these acres which now scarcely yield him

224
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:57,570
anything turned out beneficial to

225
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,040
themselves George Washington he and

226
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:01,080
Thomas Jefferson had lots of

227
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,100
conversation about how stupid it was

228
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:10,950
that they continued to degrade the soils

229
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:15,090
that's 300 200 whatever years ago David

230
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:16,830
Montgomery wrote a book dirt if you

231
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:20,580
haven't read it it's kind of interesting

232
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:25,650
reading this photo here was taken in

233
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:26,940
South Dakota in the 1930s because we

234
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,900
were doing that when I went to

235
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:36,780
Gettysburg in the 1970s to teach high

236
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:39,590
school chemistry not not AG dejan

237
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:42,360
chemistry people don't understand that

238
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:44,160
you couldn't be assured that you would

239
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,570
make it to Pierre and back if you left

240
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:49,230
Gettysburg go to Pierre in the

241
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:51,240
wintertime you wouldn't be assured

242
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,760
you're going to get home if the wind

243
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,350
started to blow because everybody was

244
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:03,540
doing wheat and summer fell in that

245
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:06,270
country okay talking about his dirt book

246
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,830
at a meeting and they said you know in

247
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:09,330
the teachers line I mean

248
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:12,810
speakers loans that you have at these

249
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:14,250
bigger conferences I sat down with him I

250
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,990
said you know you really should come and

251
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:20,400
revisit that area north appear again and

252
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:25,500
see what's happened there because it's

253
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:27,600
changed and he comes subsequently wrote

254
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,990
this book growing a revolution which has

255
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,450
a chapter about some of the guys in that

256
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,210
area in fact my carnal teas in that in

257
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:40,380
that book they talked about his his

258
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:42,420
operation okay but anyway Thomas

259
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,570
Jefferson realized that they had to do

260
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:47,430
something so in 1803 he bought the

261
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:49,590
Louisiana Purchase and then he sent

262
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:51,360
Lewis and Clark up the river right

263
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:53,520
here's where two cold Lakes is by the

264
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,200
way right in there but they came through

265
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:59,280
here so we know what this land looked

266
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,740
like before before we got here and start

267
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:04,890
screwing it up but what they were

268
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,240
looking for were beavers was the first

269
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,870
thing that's what the lobby hunters

270
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,430
weren't looking for beavers and they

271
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:15,750
took all the beavers out well what were

272
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:17,190
the beavers doing here all these dams

273
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,070
and all these little tributaries all the

274
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:22,680
way from Black Hills down down River

275
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:24,390
through Missouri whatever so you take

276
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,160
all the beavers out then you send the

277
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:28,170
settlers in and the settlers start to do

278
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,890
tillage they cut down with few trees

279
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:35,220
there are and they start over grazing

280
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:38,430
and we have flooding now what should the

281
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,880
response be put the Beavers back and

282
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:44,490
quit doing that stuff you're doing right

283
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,740
no no we're we're not that smart so

284
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:49,080
we're gonna put in large main stem

285
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,420
reservoirs we're European males right

286
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,160
that's what we do we go put in large

287
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,960
main stem reservoirs we've got four in

288
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,990
South Dakota they're gonna they're gonna

289
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:01,710
give us 500,000 acres of irrigation over

290
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:03,960
around Redfield because that was flat in

291
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:07,650
the 1930s and 40s you can't irrigate

292
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:09,090
land that's rolling you have to have

293
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:11,190
this stuff that you can run the water

294
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,690
down between the rows and we all know

295
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:16,050
that you couldn't produce corn and

296
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:18,210
soybeans at Redfield without irrigation

297
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,470
for God's sake and it's kind of like

298
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,450
Nebraska they don't think they can

299
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:27,300
produce anything without irrigation

300
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:30,480
ray did you notice that so they built a

301
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,790
big dam and they build a big power plan

302
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,490
and they built an irrigation pump

303
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:37,710
station that's never been used and they

304
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,840
built a whole bunch of canals so I I

305
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,800
show people the canals when they come to

306
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,930
visit if they're going the right

307
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,790
direction we show them this huge huge

308
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:47,760
canals that were built to take the water

309
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:51,570
from the Missouri River over to the Jim

310
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,240
River but when I went to red field in

311
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:57,030
1983 and by there a Ray managed the same

312
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,340
farm I managed it the one at red field

313
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:01,680
one time in its existence we both had

314
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:05,070
the same major professor in our PhDs

315
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:09,060
we have a lot of parallels but when I

316
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:11,400
went to red field in 1983 there was

317
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:15,600
nineteen hundreds of soybeans and

318
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:18,030
and Brown County combined and I made the

319
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,770
mistake on my PhD orals to say that I

320
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,390
thought if we no tilled we could

321
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,750
probably grow corn and soybeans in the

322
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:27,840
Jim River Valley without irrigation and

323
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,820
Larry fine whoo-hoo ray remembers nobody

324
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,060
else does but he thought I didn't

325
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:35,880
understand water very well so he he

326
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:39,930
really made my life miserable for an

327
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:44,490
hour or so in my orals but he lived long

328
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:46,170
enough to see no-till and different crop

329
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,150
production move into the Jim River

330
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,830
Valley which now those two counties are

331
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:53,250
the number one number two corn producing

332
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:54,810
counties in the state and I was told

333
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,780
before we came to Pierre that we would

334
00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:01,080
never produce hundred bushel dryland

335
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:04,860
corn it in used County I was told that

336
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:06,240
George and I made a bet on it so we won

337
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,950
that bet several years in a row before

338
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,640
the guy to say he didn't want to do that

339
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:14,130
anymore but it just it talks to the idea

340
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:17,820
of we haven't in the old days we didn't

341
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:21,030
use water well the thing that we have

342
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:23,670
done no-till is just a tool the thing

343
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:29,370
we're doing is using water better that's

344
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:30,750
really what we're about so in 1973 we

345
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,420
had a whole bunch of guys got all

346
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:35,870
excited about the Russian wheat deal

347
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:39,649
energy prices were low 1970

348
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:41,269
and interest rates were low in 1973

349
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:43,430
everybody started putting in irrigation

350
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:46,370
along the Missouri River it's because

351
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:50,380
somebody had invented a center pivot we

352
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:53,510
didn't need to we didn't need to have a

353
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,829
level ground to irrigate anymore so

354
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,680
these guys start pumping water out of

355
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:59,810
the Missouri River and irrigating and it

356
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,620
ran promptly back down the hill into the

357
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:05,510
river because our soils were these wind

358
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,910
blowing less soils and they when they

359
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,620
got tilled which everybody said to grow

360
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:11,750
irrigated corn you got to have it black

361
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:15,260
and then we put water on it just look

362
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:16,970
like this floor and that's kind of when

363
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,100
I entered the scene have tried to figure

364
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:23,180
out how to stop runoff under irrigate

365
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:26,269
errs and that's where those efforts led

366
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:29,029
to a meeting after a field day one night

367
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:31,040
at Bob Steakhouse where people said we

368
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:33,380
really need to have more research effort

369
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:38,570
long the center in the western part of

370
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:39,920
the state and another guy said well I'll

371
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,930
get my brother-in-law who's in the

372
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,199
legislature to get you some land and I

373
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,850
said why don't you leave your

374
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,699
brother-in-law alone let's see if we

375
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:51,649
can't get our own land instead of having

376
00:16:49,699 --> 00:16:53,720
the state own it so we can control it so

377
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:55,370
that's the way that started its own and

378
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,140
directed by farmers all fixed facilities

379
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,940
of land and much of the irrigation

380
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,149
equipment owned by the corporation and

381
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,949
things like that right again the

382
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:05,510
comparison of corn soybeans spring late

383
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:07,699
winter wheat and sunflower production

384
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:13,089
those three areas increased by one point

385
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:17,419
six billion in 2014 as compared to 1986

386
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:22,069
we didn't do that because we set out to

387
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:24,199
improve yields the goal was to better

388
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:25,520
manage our water because that's what

389
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,410
we're having trouble with we weren't

390
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,049
getting the water in the ground better

391
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,820
manage your nutrients and this is what

392
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,500
this whole movements about whether you

393
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,780
call it soil health that you call it

394
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,880
no-till or you whatever you call it it's

395
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,950
about better managing the ecosystem we

396
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,660
have to do a better job or we're going

397
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:43,340
to end up looking like the Europeans

398
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:48,140
where they're totally degraded soils

399
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:49,310
we've only been at this for 200 years so

400
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,500
what we did is

401
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:53,210
look at how the native systems work

402
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,180
because they water goes in the ground

403
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:58,040
and native systems and you don't have

404
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,770
the salty spots and native systems

405
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:04,010
normally and we call this a

406
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:08,810
transformational change or a holistic

407
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:10,130
report approach I stole this from Jay

408
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:12,290
Fuhrer who said he stole it from

409
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:14,210
somebody else but it's one of my

410
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:16,220
favorite statements the light bulb did

411
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:21,410
not result by incrementally making

412
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:23,540
candles better you know you think about

413
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,900
that it's just go okay yeah that makes

414
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,780
sense

415
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,340
you know back and often and so what

416
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:30,020
we've been doing a lot of times in

417
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,090
agriculture were just incrementally

418
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,990
changing what is really a system that's

419
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:37,460
been broken since it was in Europe

420
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:40,120
instead of just saying now this is

421
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,830
stupid let's do something else

422
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:44,570
farmer manages ecosystem take sunlight

423
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:47,240
water and carbon dioxide and makes them

424
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:49,370
into products to be sold and we look at

425
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,200
this water cycle energy flow mineral

426
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:54,530
cycle community dynamics and there's

427
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,110
lots of places where we have talked

428
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,850
about how we do that does the brain feed

429
00:18:57,110 --> 00:19:00,770
plants and recharge groundwater or

430
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,960
runoff or deep percolate if you're

431
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:06,110
running your water off and you live at

432
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:10,340
wall you that's a problem you don't want

433
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:13,760
to do that okay yeah that's what's wrong

434
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:17,320
here we can now put on 2 inches of water

435
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:20,630
in 9 minutes with our irrigate errs and

436
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,100
we have nothing runoff and if you come

437
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,740
into summertime and many of you've been

438
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:26,450
there we walk in behind those irrigate

439
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,580
errs and it totally changes your way of

440
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:31,070
looking at things and it's because we

441
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,410
have this armor we don't have the armor

442
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:35,600
there because we think that's cute it's

443
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:38,050
there because it protects the soil keeps

444
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,830
the weeds from going keeps the soil cool

445
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:45,620
does all these things people so I really

446
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,450
like to use that big hole opener makes

447
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:51,560
that wheat grow better well now you have

448
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:53,830
no more armor ok you gotta have that

449
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:55,220
armor and that that that whole process

450
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,950
starts it

451
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:00,980
there's where earthworms live they're

452
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:03,530
protected for anybody has been around

453
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,960
irrigation this is 20 years we

454
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:08,860
tract if you've been around irrigation

455
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,480
those things always had big ruts in them

456
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,340
and when we first started doing this we

457
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,990
had our Board of Directors from the coal

458
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:17,300
lakes the guys that were irrigating

459
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:19,220
we're irrigating with tillage come to

460
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,720
Redfield one day and we had a lateral

461
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,450
move they're running on some no-till

462
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,920
drop and we went out to look at crops

463
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,460
and I'm walking along I'm talking

464
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,170
together

465
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,300
yeah then turn around I have no farmers

466
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:33,170
behind me they're all lightened up on

467
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:36,020
one of my wheel tracks going why isn't

468
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:38,120
that deeper and I hadn't really ever

469
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:40,010
thought about that you know they didn't

470
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:42,710
set out to make shallow wheel tracks and

471
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:45,740
they noticed it because there's weren't

472
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:50,060
that way take the e out of it

473
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:53,780
evapotranspiration ET the evaporation

474
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:56,060
makes you know money when you make the

475
00:20:53,780 --> 00:21:00,230
water go through a plant it makes you

476
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:01,850
money when you make it let it just float

477
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,980
off the surface it doesn't make you any

478
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:06,890
money so one of the ideas behind this

479
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:09,050
forage cover cropping thing is to try to

480
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:11,270
take something that would have to

481
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:13,940
evaporate to make it dry enough for you

482
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:17,540
to plant or whatever and make it go

483
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:21,710
through go through a plant and yesterday

484
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:24,860
at in Nebraska we had two young farmers

485
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:26,390
that were on a panel and they're both

486
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,040
talking about well you know one of the

487
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:30,500
things I really like now than a no-till

488
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,150
would that cover crops and whatever I

489
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,360
can drive in that field anytime we want

490
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:36,920
to and I don't think in that don't make

491
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,560
rice and all that kind of stuff doesn't

492
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:42,050
happen year one but they've noticed now

493
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:44,930
that that is starting to happen make

494
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:46,580
water in or the soil and then maximize

495
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,860
the water holding capacity by building

496
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,420
the organic matter we've talked about

497
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,610
those things today this is a good idea

498
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,590
for irrigation is a great idea for those

499
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:57,980
without irrigation like you guys so most

500
00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:01,090
of our impact has actually been on the

501
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:03,740
non irrigation part of of the country

502
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,720
most of the guys that were irrigating in

503
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:08,210
in nineteen seventy six have quit

504
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:12,710
because their lifts are too high and

505
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:14,900
they grow they make more money per

506
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:15,490
dollar invested by far on their dry land

507
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,460
they would

508
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:21,250
irrigation irrigation is expensive and

509
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:24,250
it costs you a lot of money everyday and

510
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:27,040
it and it's it it's high management and

511
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:29,380
it gets obsolete and it has issues

512
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:32,170
there's places where a Geisha makes

513
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:34,450
sense but you shouldn't be competing as

514
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:36,400
you know and tell you tell you've used

515
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:39,670
every drop of water that Mother Nature

516
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,790
gives you as efficiently as you can you

517
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:44,140
shouldn't even think about irrigation

518
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:46,660
ecosystems harvest sunlight right and

519
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:50,170
that drive all other processes sunlight

520
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:52,540
energy that's stored in the residue

521
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:54,640
removing these products from the

522
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,910
ecosystem reduces the energy available

523
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,220
so if you're taking off all your residue

524
00:22:56,910 --> 00:23:01,540
which they are in a lot of places

525
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,010
there's nothing to drive that soil

526
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,780
biology everybody keeps talking about

527
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:07,179
the soil biology well the soil biology

528
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:10,570
you've got to feed them and they eat

529
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:12,550
residue got a guy from Iowa called me

530
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,440
that day and they gonna harvest his corn

531
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,850
they're gonna take all he's a dairy you

532
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,740
got agreement with the dairy he's gonna

533
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:20,800
harvest these corn and then they're

534
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:25,179
gonna take cut off and rake up and Bale

535
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:27,280
all these corn stalks and he says I want

536
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:30,670
to continue the no-till my soybeans how

537
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,110
do I do that we've got a lot more things

538
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:36,220
to discuss and just how you're gonna

539
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:37,600
know tell your soybean that's one of the

540
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,809
reasons we're doing the thing with

541
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,240
livestock it has to do with the residue

542
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:45,070
and cycling the residue so there's one

543
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:48,190
of our cover crops that mixture of

544
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:51,040
barley oats and peas and whatever and we

545
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:52,720
slice that you've seen these photos

546
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,460
there's winter wheat growing back in

547
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,040
there so we got the living root it was

548
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,740
in winter wheat during the summer but we

549
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,240
also have winter wheat going back there

550
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:03,460
and it'll be there next spring and then

551
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,160
we'll kill it before we plant the corn

552
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:08,320
in this case and this that thing stays

553
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,910
nice and green in there one of the

554
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,210
things that I don't know if Cody

555
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:15,190
mentioned it but the stuff we bailed

556
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:17,200
this year those wasps we be able to make

557
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:20,200
the comparison so we have the residue

558
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,150
remove stuff so that's waswas pretty wet

559
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,540
when we bailed it but it was a wet fall

560
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:28,120
and and so we've had to feed those bales

561
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,350
because they were going bad whereas a

562
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:31,210
swath is fine

563
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:34,840
finding the really bad stuff and that's

564
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:37,600
velocity of the day no day went in

565
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:40,840
really wet because of the wet fall sauce

566
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:43,480
it when it's pretty wet it's fine so

567
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:46,210
there's there's our our mamas and their

568
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,220
babies eating their swass but the

569
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:50,470
question always comes up there's a swath

570
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,990
get spread out if you move that thing a

571
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:55,000
little bit every day they clean it right

572
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:57,490
up but you can see the are more steel in

573
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,240
there that swath reat stubble still and

574
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:01,420
they leave that alone

575
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:05,620
it lays down and everybody's happy okay

576
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:11,500
more cows more goats more sheep number

577
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:13,360
one meat eaten in the world is goat okay

578
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,410
so and they're good at getting rid of

579
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,710
Candida thistle

580
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:21,730
so you might want to get excited about

581
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:23,320
this but there's no way to feed the

582
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:25,360
people in the world in the future if

583
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,570
we're going to take me to way the only

584
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:30,610
way to take marginal land and turn it

585
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:33,520
into human edible protein produce human

586
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:37,210
edible protein on upgrade the protein is

587
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,740
to use ruminant animals and anybody that

588
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,330
tries to tell you that we're going to

589
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,690
have fake meat and all this stops they

590
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:45,850
can't make feet fake meat on marginal

591
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:48,310
land okay so if you're going to feed

592
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:50,590
people we're going to have to use the

593
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:53,350
animals which is fine that's what we

594
00:25:50,590 --> 00:26:01,330
should be doing anyway 100% grass-fed

595
00:25:53,350 --> 00:26:05,770
ground beef certified USDA where was

596
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:07,690
this produced well we get some cows from

597
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:09,250
Montana than never seen grain doesn't

598
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,920
know what grain looks like some coal

599
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:14,110
cows you haul them to them place in

600
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:17,740
central or eastern South Dakota and you

601
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:19,030
put them on cover crops and you fatten

602
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:22,020
them on cover crops you take them in

603
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:26,280
Omaha and you make them in hamburger

604
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,280
okay so this is actually being done

605
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:36,619
okay I don't know why me having trouble

606
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:40,909
with that I'm probably doing something

607
00:26:36,619 --> 00:26:42,679
goofy all tillage tools Detroit destroys

608
00:26:40,909 --> 00:26:44,869
soil structure all tillage tools

609
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:47,119
decreased water infiltration all tillage

610
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:51,919
tools reduce organic matter and all

611
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:53,330
tillage tools increase weeds 27,000

612
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,070
gallons of water with one percent

613
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,919
organic matter in six inches of soil

614
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:59,509
that's 1/4 of an inch of water we can

615
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,579
increase the organic matter by four

616
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:03,709
percent we've put in an extra inch in

617
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:07,129
the top six inches and extra 2 inches on

618
00:27:03,709 --> 00:27:08,379
top foot grandpa had more organic matter

619
00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:10,879
than you do

620
00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:13,729
he came here because it had a high

621
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:16,389
organic matter he mined it that's fine

622
00:27:13,729 --> 00:27:19,729
now you have to quit doing that

623
00:27:16,389 --> 00:27:21,169
what about pests well let's talk about

624
00:27:19,729 --> 00:27:23,089
aphids given the high rate of

625
00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:25,359
reproduction by aphid certain levels

626
00:27:23,089 --> 00:27:28,489
continue increase all summer a

627
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:32,509
photography males that give birth to

628
00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:34,669
pregnant females see you know all the

629
00:27:32,509 --> 00:27:38,959
guys in the in the audience should be

630
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:40,999
afraid because you could be out of

631
00:27:38,959 --> 00:27:42,950
business if you're in the aphid world if

632
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:46,429
your next reincarnation you're born is

633
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:48,049
an aphid you're really trouble so

634
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:51,649
pregnant females that give birth to

635
00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:55,129
pregnant females you should grow high

636
00:27:51,649 --> 00:27:57,349
populations but we don't because a fat

637
00:27:55,129 --> 00:28:00,229
population dynamics depend on levels of

638
00:27:57,349 --> 00:28:02,829
natural enemies temperature and that

639
00:28:00,229 --> 00:28:02,829
kind of thing

640
00:28:02,979 --> 00:28:08,389
7 spotted lady beetle females 8 on

641
00:28:05,869 --> 00:28:11,419
average 100 15 soybean aphids in 24

642
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:14,329
hours a male eat 78 the end starts of

643
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:20,690
little things that look like dragons 8

644
00:28:14,329 --> 00:28:23,899
105 the other kind eats 95 males 54 not

645
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:25,399
quite as hungry great so when you go to

646
00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:26,779
check on me a fridge you got in your

647
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:33,200
weed or how many aphids you got in your

648
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:34,940
soybeans you also count 2 ladybugs wait

649
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,889
a week walk at the farm a few years ago

650
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,950
and the entomologist was saying oh well

651
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:41,509
he's way above thresholds and I smiled

652
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,290
and whatever and we went home that night

653
00:28:41,509 --> 00:28:44,330
rooster

654
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:47,450
not gonna spray are you I said well I'm

655
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:49,910
gonna look at a Monday because I have

656
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:53,210
lots of lady birds in there and the

657
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:58,760
temperature was going to get hot Monday

658
00:28:53,210 --> 00:29:00,320
or Tuesday they're all gone okay so no

659
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:08,780
one knows the number one thing that

660
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:12,770
kills a foot is fungi 84% soybean aphids

661
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:14,240
got whacked by this one fungi so if we

662
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:16,100
know the number one thing that kills

663
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,310
aphids is fungi number two are these

664
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,980
predators and somebody tells you if

665
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:23,660
we're going to come out and spray some

666
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:26,180
herbicide now why don't we just throw a

667
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,830
little fungicide a little insecticide in

668
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:32,120
that and it just doesn't cost very much

669
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:33,880
and it can't do any harm see you're

670
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:39,980
gonna kill all your predator

671
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:42,020
seven species of aphid found seven

672
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:45,800
species of Asian pathogenic fungi were

673
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:51,740
found in them in 2003 and for overuse of

674
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:53,690
fungicide can cause insect outbreaks if

675
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:57,140
we use too many fungicides you kill you

676
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:58,820
kill the the predatory fungi so we had

677
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:00,440
this cover crop few years ago my

678
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,180
neighbor come over and we were you know

679
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,890
it was what a pollinator type thing it

680
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,880
was a mustard and it's all flowering

681
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:07,160
just full of bugs

682
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,650
he's aren't you gonna spray this I said

683
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:13,760
why would I spray this see what his bugs

684
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:15,410
in here most bugs are good bugs some of

685
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,270
these weren't good bugs but I didn't

686
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:22,430
want to harvest his crop anyway I said

687
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:24,140
I'm feeding my predators so I'm gonna

688
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:26,300
have predators around next year when the

689
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,740
when the bad bugs show up I got to feed

690
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:29,360
him something to keep him around and let

691
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:32,690
them have babies and stuff so they're

692
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,430
ready right over-reliance and herbicides

693
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:36,170
leads to resistant weeds and maybe

694
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:40,460
disease problems everybody talks about

695
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:42,110
these resistant weeds one of the

696
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:44,450
problems we have is we have too many

697
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:48,020
bacterial diseases now because we use

698
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:49,550
surfactants too frequently the things

699
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:52,010
like bacterial leaf spot and whatever

700
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:54,050
what what bacteria do is they penetrate

701
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:55,510
into leave if you put a surfactant on a

702
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:58,480
week in the wax you're going

703
00:30:55,510 --> 00:31:01,450
get more disease fungicides herbicides

704
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,840
and insecticides have collateral damage

705
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:07,090
their disturbance to the system ray

706
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:09,520
mentioned chloride when we get a

707
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:11,760
chloride we always put a little chloride

708
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:15,910
on with our wheat because chloride helps

709
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,920
the wheat protect itself from disease so

710
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:19,870
we don't have to put the fungicide on so

711
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,470
we just put a little bit on there so it

712
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:25,420
has high high chloride concentration

713
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:27,850
high disturbance techniques HOH drills

714
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,280
and such and in vertical tillage

715
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:32,650
increase weed pressure and cause soil

716
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,630
erosion and this this is tillage erosion

717
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:37,600
we pull the top of the hills down as I

718
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:41,260
came north from Columbus yesterday up

719
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:42,880
through Norfolk and in the Yankton came

720
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,950
home that way have all these big rolling

721
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,840
less hills down there blew up by the

722
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,580
Missouri River bottom and they're still

723
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,820
doing tillage on them and the tops of

724
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:53,320
the hills are going down to the bottom I

725
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:57,850
couldn't believe they were still doing

726
00:31:53,320 --> 00:32:00,750
that okay the way we control pests is we

727
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:03,280
use sanitation rotation and competition

728
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:04,960
pesticides are only part of Sanitation

729
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:07,500
to keep weeds from going to seed for

730
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,640
instance they're only part of rotation

731
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,470
what I want to do in terms of

732
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:15,360
competition is to keep a weed small

733
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:17,830
enough that my crop can compete with it

734
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,940
fertilizer placement ray doesn't care

735
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:24,880
about fertilizer placement I do because

736
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:27,640
I don't want my weeds to have it so I'm

737
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,590
going to place my fertilizer either in a

738
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,750
place or a time when it's not going to

739
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:34,750
benefit to weed something like Palmer

740
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:37,330
amaranth is a huge and feeder and if you

741
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:39,550
if you broadcast nitrogen on you're just

742
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:41,590
feeding the wheat so we're gonna place

743
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:44,110
our fertilizer three inches from the

744
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,890
corn row at the same depth or the

745
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,930
sorghum roll

746
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:49,750
I don't care where its roots are II just

747
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:52,090
don't want the weeds to get to it so I'm

748
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:54,070
going to put it where the plant my plant

749
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:57,430
my beneficial plant can compete with the

750
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:59,170
weeds ecosystem the lake nutrients for

751
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:02,380
extended periods of time become deserts

752
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:05,560
saline seats and you have some of them

753
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:09,150
out here is because we aren't using and

754
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:09,150
cycling the water in the nutrient

755
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:13,450
like it should be a nutrient placement

756
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:16,090
is part of cycling

757
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:18,429
I'm a farmer takes sunlight water and

758
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:20,890
carbon dioxide and make products that I

759
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:22,960
can sell and Ray said to me earlier

760
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,730
today in a private conversation what we

761
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,790
need to do is be getting to the point

762
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:31,780
where we're selling stuff instead of

763
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:33,730
selling commodities selling stuff that

764
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:34,770
we can sell in the internet you guys all

765
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:37,030
know how to do that

766
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:39,040
that's old guys don't know how to do

767
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:40,870
that but young guys not do that so we're

768
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:42,809
going to produce something and sell it

769
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:47,080
and there's people that want to buy

770
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:48,730
stuff that's produced sustainably or

771
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,250
regenerative Lee or whatever at a half

772
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:53,620
an hour conversation the other day on a

773
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:55,210
telephone on the way down to Nebraska I

774
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,190
stopped on top of Hill had a half an

775
00:33:55,210 --> 00:34:03,360
hour conversation to the person in

776
00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:06,340
charge of sustainability for Cargill ok

777
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,770
and we've got to be able to give them a

778
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:10,060
product state that we can defend and say

779
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:12,790
this is done the right way

780
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:15,879
the best environmental way the best food

781
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:19,270
safety way and and this is the way we do

782
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:21,700
it focus on having the soil wet during

783
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:23,950
the dry part of the year instead of just

784
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:25,389
focusing on having it dry during wet

785
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:28,570
part of the year so you can be the first

786
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:29,139
guy to get done planting right and you

787
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,149
know it

788
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:32,770
every year people come and I got a

789
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:35,800
neighbor that works a heck out of his

790
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:36,580
ground and sometimes his corns bigger

791
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,850
than mine

792
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:42,639
the last week in the June last Thursday

793
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:44,379
in June most time it isn't but sometimes

794
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,570
it is and guys a look at things away his

795
00:34:44,379 --> 00:34:48,159
corns bigger than yours and I used to go

796
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,800
through a long explanation now I just

797
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,570
say oh I didn't know you harvested corn

798
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,840
in June and I turn around and walk away

799
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:58,119
and then kind of Bend the end of that

800
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,560
conversation focus on having the soil

801
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:02,320
cool during the hot part of the year

802
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:04,030
roots don't like it hot and they don't

803
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,460
do a good job of taking up nutrients if

804
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:09,970
they're hot that cover that armor

805
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:12,930
it keeps the soil cool so we can have it

806
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:15,550
cool during that hot part of the year

807
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:17,320
that's important to irrigation people

808
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:19,810
it's imperative to rain-fed farming

809
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,190
mother nature's an opportunist if you

810
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:23,800
have a problem weed

811
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:26,369
these insect I don't care you provide

812
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,810
the opportunity somewhere in your system

813
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:31,420
here's resistant kosher that we

814
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:35,050
developed on purpose in the early 1990s

815
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:38,260
to prove we could it's resistant to

816
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:39,700
pursuit because I said I predicted that

817
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:43,089
was going to happen the company

818
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:45,460
threatened to lawsuit if I didn't

819
00:35:43,089 --> 00:35:46,869
retract so I just developed my own and

820
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:51,790
then that negated that whole lawsuit

821
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:54,730
thing that's that's kosher right there

822
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:59,260
that's chickpeas hiding in there just

823
00:35:54,730 --> 00:36:01,690
for my carnally that's sick t-mike but

824
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:05,770
we didn't have much at that period of

825
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:07,630
time to control anything in chickpeas he

826
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:09,970
surely couldn't use it now the cross

827
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:11,710
compliant the cross resistance came

828
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,390
because those kosha I went and got from

829
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:16,599
somebody that had been overusing glean

830
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:18,550
so it's not just a pursuit thing it's

831
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:19,180
all oversight said if we don't use them

832
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,640
properly

833
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,950
now what happens there oh here let's

834
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,810
look at the how this happens if in the

835
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:28,630
old days and you guys used to have a

836
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:31,030
little bit of downy Brome here you don't

837
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:32,140
have it anymore right it's gone Scott

838
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:36,609
you don't have any cheatgrass scene

839
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:38,200
where do you he's just grinning but that

840
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:40,119
used to be a huge problem because it did

841
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,660
a rotation that provided huge

842
00:36:40,119 --> 00:36:45,010
opportunities and randiandersen

843
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:47,980
made this statement two years of warm

844
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:50,890
season crops or a fallow unusual warm

845
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:54,010
season crop and a fallow reduced number

846
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:56,170
seeds by 95% so we did wheat corn fallow

847
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:58,510
the old eco fallow thing we could take

848
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:00,220
care of cheatgrass same thing happens

849
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:03,010
with warm season weeds like the Palmer

850
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:05,800
amaranth or waterhemp or something like

851
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:09,609
that and the reason that works is let's

852
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:11,710
take foxtail it emerges Palmer arm

853
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:13,359
amaranth same time after the corns plan

854
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:14,980
that goes to flower before the corn is

855
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,530
harvested so it has its whole lifecycle

856
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:20,890
here and it can compete in the early

857
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:23,170
phases if I put winter wheat in that

858
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:25,900
thing hasn't emerged winter we weed has

859
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:27,640
full canopy and it it's harvested before

860
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:31,119
that thing goes to flower and you can

861
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:33,880
control it just very simple thing we had

862
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,760
long term rotation study maybe some of

863
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,100
you remember that

864
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,110
warm and cool season crops everything

865
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,990
was done no-till is in linemen counting

866
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:45,020
on some promise tiles we did that for 12

867
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:48,350
years and in the 13th year Randy

868
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:51,800
Anderson came out we had a what we had

869
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:53,960
to do was was planted all uniformly to a

870
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,430
wheat crop which we did and he came out

871
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,280
and counted the number of weeds in the

872
00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:01,220
different rotations where we did week

873
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,990
chickpea for 12 years he found 94 weeds

874
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:05,180
where we did wheat corn chickpea found

875
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:08,540
40 where we did a more diverse rotation

876
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:09,950
that he found seven Clara Seamus who

877
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,340
allow do you still remember had a

878
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:15,020
similar type study where he used in

879
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:17,480
anhydrous tonight for once every four

880
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:22,760
years other than that he was no tilling

881
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:25,790
and he had a loader he had a high

882
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:28,250
diversity sunflower wheat corn spring

883
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:31,430
wheat and he had a low diversity wheat

884
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:33,830
millet rotation and and Randy did the

885
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:37,700
same thing with his and what we found

886
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:40,460
was the same trend highest with a low

887
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:42,620
diversity Louis with high diversity

888
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:44,990
rotation but since I didn't do any

889
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:46,820
disturbance I did better the real

890
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:50,600
comparison there is tillage and poor

891
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:53,450
rotation 225 weeds per square yard or

892
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,980
square meter no-till and good rotation 7

893
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:56,750
weeks

894
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:59,750
97% weed control just with cultural

895
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:01,670
practices that has to do with

896
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,350
disturbance so if you're thinking well

897
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:06,950
dad just gonna go out and disc a little

898
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:08,420
bit right I mean one of the one of the

899
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,640
things I used to tell guys cuz they'd

900
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,110
want to start no tilling but dad didn't

901
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,390
want or the uncle didn't want to get rid

902
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:17,750
of the machinery

903
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:20,380
just in case we might need it I said

904
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:23,090
fine ok just tell them you'll do that

905
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:25,820
but you know to protect some tires and

906
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:27,830
hydraulic cylinders take the height

907
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,720
tires off and hydraulic cylinders off

908
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:31,580
before you park it over in the edges and

909
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,560
then they really won't be tempted to

910
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:36,560
start up and go out and screw with it

911
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:38,840
when you go on vacation right so because

912
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,730
that used to happen at times kid goes on

913
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,010
vacation dad goes disc bunch around just

914
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:45,470
just to make it better

915
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:47,480
he took Green Fox Hill place at 3 deaths

916
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,990
in the soil zero two and four inches and

917
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,240
he looked at

918
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:54,770
number of live seeds yearly okay

919
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,790
after two years if he left it on the

920
00:39:54,770 --> 00:40:01,430
surface only 11 percent were still alive

921
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:04,700
buried 2 inches 28 percent buried four

922
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:06,530
inches 55% if you're doing disturbance

923
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,210
are constantly digging up and burying

924
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:11,150
and makin seeds go dormant you can't

925
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:13,820
control the weed seed bank so to prove

926
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:16,880
that even further we took four places at

927
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:20,030
Dakota Lakes I let little areas go to

928
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:24,260
all the weeds grow and go to seed once

929
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:26,240
and then he tilled a small area and left

930
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:27,650
a small area you're not not tilled and

931
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,930
then when we put herbicide on these

932
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:32,270
areas we put a tarp over top of them so

933
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:33,980
they never got herbicides on them and he

934
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:36,950
counted the seedlings yearly for three

935
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:38,780
years okay first you're not much

936
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:40,820
different from tilled in no-till second

937
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:43,670
year not much difference it's when you

938
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:47,930
have that two year break that you get

939
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:52,250
the big difference corn pea winter wheat

940
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:53,510
corn if you got a weed that goes to seed

941
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:55,910
in the corn that you really can't

942
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:58,760
control in corn you can get rid of

943
00:40:55,910 --> 00:41:02,420
ninety-six percent of it if you're just

944
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:04,160
doing every other year you can't so

945
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,750
there's a typical thing if we drive a

946
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,580
little wide with our winter wheat or

947
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:11,780
don't really get a runaway in terms of

948
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:14,630
weeds so real quickly rotation types

949
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:16,400
simple rotations this is the one most

950
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:18,320
people think about wheat corn canola

951
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,840
spring wheat winter wheat corn sunflower

952
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,680
corn soybean wheat fallow whatever

953
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,940
they're simple they're predictable

954
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,470
limited number of crops the managing

955
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,240
market this is what a lot of people are

956
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:33,080
doing but they're very predictable to

957
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:34,940
the insects and such rotations with

958
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,970
perennial sequences which I think we're

959
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:40,040
going to have to use we're going to have

960
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:43,100
to put those deep roots in that Cody was

961
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:45,109
talking about and we can if we we can do

962
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:48,950
a stupid rotation for about six years

963
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:51,680
and then put it in a perennial for three

964
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:54,020
or four or the only thing I don't like

965
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,420
about this is I'd rather see grasses in

966
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:58,430
there but there's lots of examples of

967
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:00,080
those limited number annual crops

968
00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:01,370
demands your market excellent place to

969
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,560
spread manure if you

970
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:05,690
spread manure you can probably produce

971
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:08,150
more soil structure with annual than

972
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:11,750
annual crops because the grass specially

973
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:14,570
the grass mixtures disadvantage you've

974
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:19,550
got a Cody pointed out today that we got

975
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:22,430
that new rotation we started we're only

976
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:28,390
putting in a perennial five years out of

977
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:31,060
20 now I'm not sure that's enough okay

978
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:33,710
compound rotations where we take two

979
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:36,350
rotations and make them into simple

980
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:37,520
rotations make them more complex we were

981
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:39,500
talking about one of these at noon

982
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:41,240
spring late winter wheat corn soybean

983
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,190
corn soybean half the corn is behind

984
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:45,170
soybeans and half the corns behind wheat

985
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:48,080
if you're over in the Jim River Valley

986
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:50,240
that's probably a good good rotation for

987
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:52,370
you because you can grow pretty good

988
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:55,100
corn behind soybeans as you get further

989
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:56,810
west you can't do that you got to have

990
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,790
more moisture I call this a

991
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:00,410
mother-in-law a blanket rotation because

992
00:42:58,790 --> 00:43:03,110
the mother-in-law banker comes to visit

993
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:06,920
you in June you show them this corn

994
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:09,020
planted in the soybean looks great if

995
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,430
they come in August or September most

996
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:12,200
likely you'll take him out and show them

997
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:19,400
the stuff that was in the in the wheat

998
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:22,760
stubble okay still have a limited number

999
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:27,140
of crops to manage creates more than one

1000
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:29,090
sequence for some crop types if you grow

1001
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:30,890
corn behind beans every year you're

1002
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:32,570
going to get corn rootworm beetles at

1003
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:34,700
five from the corn field the soybean

1004
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:38,420
fields to lay their eggs that's happened

1005
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:40,340
in Eastern Corn Belt if we grow if

1006
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,080
everybody here grew corn behind wheat we

1007
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:44,270
would get corn rootworm apply to the

1008
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,440
wheat stubble to lay their eggs so we

1009
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:50,030
got to try to be not predictable

1010
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,800
complex rotations we're crop to the same

1011
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:54,800
crop type varies so we started putting

1012
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:58,490
in bill barley instead of to wheats we

1013
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:01,190
got barley or oats we got most sunflower

1014
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:06,230
and pea that kind of thing has some

1015
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:07,790
advantages very capable creating a wide

1016
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:11,140
array of crop type by sequence

1017
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:13,520
combinations sorghum and corn have

1018
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,690
advantages and disadvantages but they

1019
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,580
complement each other

1020
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:20,580
it takes a lot more crop management

1021
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:24,390
skills but this is why we pay you guys

1022
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:25,650
the big bucks right it's not you got to

1023
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:26,940
have the management skills it's not

1024
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:30,420
because you can drive a tractor straight

1025
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:31,980
anymore because I got auto steer so now

1026
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,560
how the tractors going across the field

1027
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,810
you can work on your management stacked

1028
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:39,590
rotations is the one that surprised us

1029
00:44:36,810 --> 00:44:42,450
and that we developed and we didn't

1030
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:44,550
really realize the power until laters

1031
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:47,400
where we put the same crop or crop type

1032
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:51,120
twice in a row and the idea is to do

1033
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,980
that to get the long break the secret

1034
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:56,670
here is the long break to let that weed

1035
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:59,760
population go down right and so and once

1036
00:44:56,670 --> 00:45:02,760
it's down it takes a couple of years for

1037
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,380
it to come back up again so we do two

1038
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,700
and then get out of there and we got a

1039
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,700
four year break before we come back to

1040
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:12,060
that crop again okay we keep the pest

1041
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:13,950
population diverse or confused diversity

1042
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:17,040
in sequence and intervals its mix along

1043
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:18,690
and sort residual herbicide programs for

1044
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,530
you guys out here if you're afraid of

1045
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:25,080
atrazine because the low rainfall if you

1046
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:27,750
stack to warm season grasses corn or

1047
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:30,120
sorghum or millet one after the other

1048
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:31,530
you can use a higher rate of atrazine in

1049
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,920
the first one that's one of the most

1050
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:36,960
powerful things you can do it's cheap

1051
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,790
atrazine is cheap and you can do that

1052
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,090
kind of stuff and especially if you're

1053
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:43,830
doing grazing things ok 2 year break

1054
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:47,130
between corn and wheat so you don't have

1055
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:49,440
to worry about the head scab thing but

1056
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:51,330
the goal is to allow sufficient time for

1057
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,790
press pressures declined to very low

1058
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:57,210
levels before sequencing the crop or

1059
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:59,100
crop type 2 times and we can reduce the

1060
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:01,640
rest of developing bio type resistance

1061
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:04,800
we grew the cost of herbicide programs

1062
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:06,810
some crop sequences may not be ideal we

1063
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,860
really don't stack broad leaves very

1064
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:12,090
often but the goal is to be in

1065
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:14,040
inconsistent in both sequence and

1066
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:17,880
interval so look at your rotation same

1067
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:20,010
there how predictable am i right to you

1068
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,450
it might look predictable to insects I

1069
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:26,280
mean if you're just doing something that

1070
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:28,350
allows them to develop some habit in the

1071
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:30,830
in the court in the Western Corn Belt

1072
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:33,120
for instance corn-soybean guys now have

1073
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:34,470
corn rootworm beetles where the eggs

1074
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,810
don't hatch for two years instead of

1075
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:39,510
hatching first year because it's always

1076
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:41,400
one year so they figured that one out

1077
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:44,310
that's why they've got to use BT and all

1078
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:46,920
that stuff where we don't have to here's

1079
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:51,480
some rotations utilizing most actin and

1080
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:54,090
in normal sequences canola winter wheat

1081
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:56,730
corn the two corns and then the rest of

1082
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:59,790
it's not stacked we got one we use on

1083
00:46:56,730 --> 00:47:02,520
the farm on the north unit where we do

1084
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:05,790
two eats a pea and then we do a sorghum

1085
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:07,410
corn actually up there and then and then

1086
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:08,820
pea I guess that's one here right here

1087
00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:11,820
when our wheat winter wheat sunflower

1088
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:15,390
sorghum corn pea and this one really is

1089
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:21,150
a some kind of an oil seeped might be

1090
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:23,010
flax whatever dryland rotations again

1091
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:25,050
those that's where those at you'll be

1092
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:27,630
able to get these slides too but there's

1093
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:30,090
no set recipe or best rotation the

1094
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:32,340
everybody needs to pick their own it's

1095
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:34,710
going to vary with fields it's going to

1096
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:36,710
vary with if your neighbor has resistant

1097
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:39,180
kosher and he lets it blow across yeah

1098
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:41,910
it's going to vary with a lot of things

1099
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:43,560
and including you know your personal

1100
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:45,210
lifestyle wouldn't when do you want to

1101
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:49,880
have a little vacation time in the

1102
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:55,470
summer or whatever show you a few slides

1103
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:57,720
there's a rotation in 2006 that wheat

1104
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:59,880
let didn't look very good 2006 very dry

1105
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:02,460
year and right across the road that's

1106
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:04,110
what the winter wheat looked like what

1107
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:07,080
was the difference there and you can see

1108
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:09,330
it from an aerial photo the good-looking

1109
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:11,640
wheat was in this corn pea winter wheat

1110
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:15,300
had been in that rotation since 1990

1111
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:18,330
this was 2006 and this one was soybean

1112
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:21,900
corn pea winter wheat half broadleafs

1113
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:26,400
half low residue we didn't have the

1114
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:29,430
armor and look at that week okay what's

1115
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,980
it mean in yields 2006 60 versus 29

1116
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:34,970
bushel 7.9 inches of rain from the time

1117
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:40,410
we harvested two peas until we harvested

1118
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:41,950
the wheat in 2005 when we got 23 inches

1119
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:45,220
92 versus 50

1120
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:47,950
seven in 2002 which is the first time

1121
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:55,000
this happened 6.4 inches in a year

1122
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:56,970
56 versus 28 I can't afford to do I hear

1123
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,980
this all the time I can't afford to grow

1124
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:02,020
yes I can't afford to do this I've got

1125
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,490
to do the high a value of things I've

1126
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:04,990
got to do the low residue things could

1127
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:08,020
it make me more money they don't make

1128
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:11,140
you more money if you look at this type

1129
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:15,760
of response this rotation just doesn't

1130
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:19,690
have enough high residue so we've taken

1131
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:21,640
the soybeans out Cody mentioned this and

1132
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:23,320
now we put we have these this three way

1133
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:25,890
just looks like this three way same

1134
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:31,900
thing other than we have a five-year

1135
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:34,420
perennial sequence in there and in 17 or

1136
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:36,250
18 years we're going to have good

1137
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,170
information and when I explained that to

1138
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:40,060
Cody one day said you better keep riding

1139
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:47,560
your bicycle if you're going to be

1140
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:50,200
around here to watch that what happens

1141
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:54,060
where there is lots of water surely they

1142
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:58,619
don't need to worry about this right so

1143
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:58,619
corn corn soybean wheat soybean

1144
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:05,650
first-year soybeans 76 bushels second

1145
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:09,609
year soybeans 81 this is under

1146
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:12,910
irrigation if I just do corn soybeans I

1147
00:50:09,609 --> 00:50:14,530
get sixty two point nine bushel so if I

1148
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:16,300
average those two from the other one

1149
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:18,940
seventy eight point eight versus sixty

1150
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:21,910
two point nine so the guy doing corn

1151
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:23,589
soybeans is getting less soybean yields

1152
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:25,390
how about corn yields well continuous

1153
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:28,300
corn we've had corn in one field since

1154
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:31,300
1990 it's about two hundred three bushel

1155
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:33,790
the acre average type thing corn

1156
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:36,670
soybeans to seventeen corn corn soybean

1157
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:39,460
wheat soybean the two corns average the

1158
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:45,490
first ones like 250 or so the second

1159
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:49,390
ones 217 or 220 235 okay so what if I

1160
00:50:45,490 --> 00:50:51,880
grew 5,000 acres of that I get a million

1161
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:54,010
bushels if I got 5,000 acres of corn I

1162
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,480
got a million bushels of corn and a

1163
00:50:54,010 --> 00:51:00,430
big-ass dryer lot

1164
00:50:55,480 --> 00:51:01,960
the trucks I mean wow but there's guys

1165
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:08,950
that do that and think they make money

1166
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:13,420
okay corn-soybean I got 2500 acres of

1167
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:15,670
corn I got 2500 acres of soybeans corn

1168
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:17,710
corn soybean wheat soybean I got 2,000

1169
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:20,080
acres of corn 2,000 acres of soybeans on

1170
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:24,400
thousand acres of wheat and there's the

1171
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:27,010
bushels okay would you trade 7,200

1172
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:33,880
bushels of corn for 120,000 bushels of

1173
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:37,270
wheat today see that's what the numbers

1174
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:40,780
show yeah and that can't afford to do

1175
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:45,880
anything but corn soybean I produce more

1176
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:47,770
bushels of soybeans on 2,000 acres of

1177
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:51,900
soybeans in this rotation than you do on

1178
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:55,359
2,500 acres of soybeans on that rotation

1179
00:51:51,900 --> 00:52:00,030
interesting can't afford to do that with

1180
00:51:55,359 --> 00:52:04,000
all grain over here can't afford not to

1181
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:06,040
first time I went to Argentina they were

1182
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,320
doing seven years of pastures and seven

1183
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:10,330
years of cropping and then there

1184
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:18,790
cropping was no-till with cover crops

1185
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:20,320
and diversity corn wheat beans and I had

1186
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:21,850
a friend of mine we dug out a little bit

1187
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,140
of soil and he held it up and if you

1188
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:26,980
want to talk about what is a healthy

1189
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:29,260
soil that's a healthy soil and then they

1190
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:33,010
outlawed the export of beef get rid of

1191
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:35,260
the beef thing can export beef keep all

1192
00:52:33,010 --> 00:52:37,350
the beef for the poor people well guys

1193
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:39,880
the poor people can't eat enough beasts

1194
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:42,310
they can't pay enough for it so the guy

1195
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:44,230
started got rid of the beef and started

1196
00:52:42,310 --> 00:52:48,760
growing soybeans on soybeans I went back

1197
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:53,530
in 2006 and it looked like this exactly

1198
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:57,160
the same fuel and went back a year ago

1199
00:52:53,530 --> 00:53:00,790
that's last fall they haven't change

1200
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:02,530
that yet and now they have lake showing

1201
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:04,300
up where they never had lakes they have

1202
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:05,740
rivers showing up where there were never

1203
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:09,119
rivers because they've got the water

1204
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:13,839
cycle broken so bad knee

1205
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:16,690
we can't expect our governments and our

1206
00:53:13,839 --> 00:53:19,660
companies and whatever to understand the

1207
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:23,349
importance of maintaining our soil

1208
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:25,269
resource we have to do this ourselves

1209
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:26,769
organic matter makes a difference

1210
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:27,640
there's our daughters who are much older

1211
00:53:26,769 --> 00:53:29,979
than that now

1212
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:32,769
and one of them might come by often in

1213
00:53:29,979 --> 00:53:35,259
here pretty soon but this is a prairie

1214
00:53:32,769 --> 00:53:38,650
plant and and and Cody's showed you one

1215
00:53:35,259 --> 00:53:40,769
of those right compare that to what you

1216
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:42,910
get with wheat and whatever and that

1217
00:53:40,769 --> 00:53:45,190
cycles these nutrients back to the

1218
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:48,039
surface of your ph's are dropping your

1219
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:49,930
light you got lying down here but you

1220
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:51,789
keep pushing it down goes sideways

1221
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:53,559
becomes a Saline seat bring it back up

1222
00:53:51,789 --> 00:53:55,420
get it on the surface but if you haul

1223
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:58,029
that off and take it to a feedlot Cody

1224
00:53:55,420 --> 00:54:00,099
showed you that too today that nutrient

1225
00:53:58,029 --> 00:54:02,709
doesn't get back to the fields all

1226
00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:03,999
tillage tools are soy so structural

1227
00:54:02,709 --> 00:54:08,229
tillage tools decreased water

1228
00:54:03,999 --> 00:54:09,579
infiltration right people I got to

1229
00:54:08,229 --> 00:54:11,019
vertical tillage thing I got this

1230
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,700
tillage thing got that thing though it

1231
00:54:11,019 --> 00:54:15,579
works great no it does it

1232
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:17,619
Mother Nature doesn't do tillage till

1233
00:54:15,579 --> 00:54:19,359
they just agriculture what fracturing is

1234
00:54:17,619 --> 00:54:20,680
to petroleum they both increase the

1235
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:22,539
speed and extent of nutrient removal

1236
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:26,769
from the resource leaving the resource

1237
00:54:22,539 --> 00:54:30,489
degraded that's not what we're about

1238
00:54:26,769 --> 00:54:32,499
we're not miners I did ask the North

1239
00:54:30,489 --> 00:54:35,309
Dakota and the Alberta people and I was

1240
00:54:32,499 --> 00:54:38,170
there earlier this year what's the hurry

1241
00:54:35,309 --> 00:54:40,059
why don't you leave some of that some of

1242
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:43,089
that oil there for your grandkids I mean

1243
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:44,440
do you not like your descendants why are

1244
00:54:43,089 --> 00:54:47,259
you mad at them why do you got to get

1245
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,459
rid of it all right away I mean you

1246
00:54:47,259 --> 00:54:51,039
don't think we're going to use some of

1247
00:54:48,459 --> 00:54:53,709
that down the road 100 200 years okay

1248
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:57,009
some expert proposed using tillage as a

1249
00:54:53,709 --> 00:54:58,630
means to address weeds resistance if

1250
00:54:57,009 --> 00:55:02,979
tillage was so good at getting rid of

1251
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:04,239
weeds they should all be gone by now and

1252
00:55:02,979 --> 00:55:08,079
that goes through the science of that

1253
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:11,699
but I'm not going to okay thank you very

1254
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:11,699
much you've been a pleasure

1255
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:19,860
[Applause]

1256
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,460
you
