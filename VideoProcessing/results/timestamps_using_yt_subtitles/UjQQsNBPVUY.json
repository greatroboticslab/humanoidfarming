  "text": "hi guys this is Megan from the blog Wilson Thompson calm and today I want to share with you guys some ideas of things you can do before you have your homestead do you have the home stink bug but you are maybe still an apartment or a city and you really can't do anything but there is some thank you too I'm going to share with you some ways you can start and plan out your homestead while you're still in any situation that you're in there's so many things that you can do before you're on a ton of land to start homesteading when we first got married we lived in an apartment for the first year and I had grown up right for the last like five or more years of my life I had lived on hope so did my parents and we raised made me chickens and Barbados sheep and we had milk goats laying hens and like all these different things and so then when I was in the apartment when we first got married I had this really strong urge to start homesteading but I didn't think I could and then I started learning about all these things that really are home state but that you can do in an apartment or anywhere so the first thing you can do is to educate yourself start reading everything that you can get your hands on about homesteading feet about gardening orchards making a ultra types of farm animals animals that complement each other rotational grazing you can start deciding what animals you would like to have on your farm which ones will you start out with make sure you are knowledgeable about what kind of speed that they'll need and minerals and supplements and all the things that for animals might also be a good idea to read up on purchasing leave dealing with wells lipstick pink and housing options for books as you get yourself on this enough so that when you go to buy your dream homestead you know what you're looking for and what you're doing the next thing is use the space you have to start I'm sitting now if you have a really small backyard space to garden or compost and probably even raise some sort of small livestock like chickens or rabbits or quail or even some miniature goats I know that if you're in a city it might be a little frowned upon to have like goats bleating in your backyard but rabbits are something that's really really quiet I think ylr - so depending on where you are and how thick your ears are you can find them nested extra quiet to have fun we're an apartment then you can do some container or vertical gardening you can even do some countertop composting with the focaccia box learn some home study skills canning cheese-making sewing cooking from scratch fermenting they send your countertop things like kefir and Kucha and we can start a bread there is just a ton of things you can ferment and I'm totally impossible you can learn how to make buttermilk make your own toothpaste there is pretty much just no end to these amazing and practical skills that you could be learning and these skills are definitely going to help you out when you are when you are under homestead the next thing is to create a budget are you saving for your down payment on your dream homestead now so that when something comes available or you're in a position where you could move that you're able to actually buy something what about money for fencing or animals or tools start living now by creating a budget that allows for this even if your homestead is years down the road find a home setting mentor or several mentors find someone that is living the life that you want and ask them if you can help out on our homestead I learn about all the things that they're doing they can teach you all about planting gardens and maintaining them in animal husbandry and they could probably even help you with a lot of the indoor skills like canning this mentorship and having practice on someone else's from said will give you a really big head start create your own there are so many people who possess a wealth of knowledge about all of this stuff and why not try to glean some from them and then my last tip is to decide where you want your dream do you know where you want to settle down what areas do you like the best what areas have the best homesteading land I know around here that there's a lot of areas I have the key areas of land but they're really Rockets they would be the best for gardening unless you're doing raised beds there's other areas that have like the best pasture land and rocky areas don't really make the greatest pasture land as well as treat areas good establish the community as much as you can you can grow a farmers market to meet all the different local farmers and learn where their homesteading and growing things and just make sure that it's the right place for you because once you start your homestead you're going to want to say that for a long time especially when Xena guards planted animals are a little easier to move by gardens thank you you built all these reasons is that soil and so I'm gonna just make sure that you are ready for more permanently whatever dream you have your mom said you can totally start now there's so many ways you could do it so I hope that this was helpful to you guys for maybe some ideas of things you can do now if you're interested in learning about any more of these skills that I've talked about just follow along because if I share of all kinds of practical homesteading tips and tons of recipes so I hope you'll join along [Music]",
