  "text": "well folks there's some things I'm just not very good at and I still show you anyways because uh I can stand to learn a thing or two and I don't know probably some of you guys can too and then the folks that know how to do it out there can give us some pointers and hopefully improve but today I'm doing something I've never done before and that is actually plowing a field now I've tilled many a field I have discs Fields never plowed never turned soil like this before and uh when you see the farmers doing it they're doing big old tractors but we've got a single bottom plow here doing it on a little tractor just to see how it does and it is a learning curve and I think we did four rows and I think by the fourth row I was getting better at it not great but um you got to listen to your tractor first of all I mean there's a lot of strain going on when you're using a ground engaging tool like this one here I was going too deep I wanted to take a full depth pass with it but it's just it's just not going to happen with a small tractor like this just doesn't quite have enough oomph and so I was trying to find a sweet spot there with it raised up a little bit and you know trying to make sure the it was level front to back and I tweaked that with the hydraulic top link a little bit here and there and I could tell that when I was going faster it was really letting that the side and the soil kind of spill out and roll over like I think you wanted to do but there were times when it bogged out and it was it was challenging to keep it going that constant pace which I think is pretty visible in the video now this patch of grass here is what we're going to turn into a food plot or a part of a food plot here later this summer for the deer we had Jeff Sturgis out with Whitetail habitat Solutions and we've been talking about him a bit and that's a lot of what we're doing is putting his plan into place out here with the intent of making it better deer hunting and that it's not for everybody but that's one of the reasons I bought the property and it's um it's a lot of fun to kind of do this stuff and so while my results today are probably not ideal keep in mind it's my first time doing it only four passes and each pass is getting better and I think it's going to make good results in the end here turn the soil over I don't know if it's ever been turned before this was a pasture for cattle previously with the prior owner that lived here and um it's a good chance to try out a new tool with the summit tx25 tractor iron craft we've been talking about them lately they're a new partner and manufacturer that we're working with where you see something on their website you can buy it through us we're going to have it shipped right out to you and this single bottom plow here really caught my eye get a decent amount of requests for a tool like this for smaller tractors they make a double bottom or a two bottom pile as well and so I was really curious to see how it worked a few things about this iron craft plow one of the the first things that I was looking for a feature when I looked for anything is going to be if it's quick it's compatible and this was not quick hitch compatible but the reason for that was legitimate and so the reason it's not quick hitch compatible is that well that first row you're on level ground you know both the left and the right side you're on level ground that's just fine but after that you're putting your right tires down in that Furrow that you had just plowed out and so the tractor is leaning and just the geometry of everything you need to be able to offset and use your side lengths to rotate everything and get the plow level even though the tractor's out of level it's kind of an awkward thing but it makes sense once you visually see it happening and so that's the reason it's not quick hitch compatible there it is sheer bolt protected so if you whack something you know a big root or a big rock or something on the ground it does have that shear bolt protection on there so that will break right off and protect the rest of the three-point hits the rest of the tractor from something catastrophic happening to it we didn't have that happen here yet I would be surprised if it does happen we have pretty good soil that we're working with in our area in Southwest Michigan and so it is rated for tractors in this horsepower range you know the 25 horsepower range that we're using on the summit but it is near the low end of that and I think it's suitable for it as long as you're not taking a full depth pass with it that's going to be where you're struggling down is becoming really unusable at that point they do make deeper plows as well in both the single bottom and the two bottom uh plow on there too so you can get different setups for different size machines out there to suit your needs but you can see similar to a long time ago when we used a dirt dog subsoiler these these tools that go down to the ground they require a lot of horsepower not just that but then the weight to get the traction to the ground as well and even for that big 70 some horsepower tractor that we had pulling the two bottom sub soiler it was just about everything I had to pull that thing along and so it's it's not really a knock on the tractors whether it's a bigger a small one it's just that it's just what you're asking it to do that's a big job for it and a more extreme scenario now we're going to be shooting this area here into uh into some greens some some brassicas and some buckwheat and some radishes and all that kind of stuff and making a big old food plot to draw the deer into the center of our property and then kind of hunt the oh the travel corridors that kind of come in from all the the bordering properties around there and you know I could have just sprayed this off and disc and tilt it but I wanted to try something new and see how it went and I'm learning something different and then someday the hope is to be able to master this tool which is some tools are easier to use than others and this one is it's tough it was tough to keep in a straight line when I on the first pass when there wasn't anything to follow along uh the whole tractor kind of one almost turned sideways or angle a little bit the subsequent passes were easier to follow that line because you're you're right down in that row following along but man it's not uh it wasn't for the faint of heart but it was a satisfying thing to do nonetheless so I read somewhere online because I don't know what I'm doing that you should start in the middle of the area you want to plow up and then kind of work your way out from there just around around the circle and so I was like all right I'll go down in the middle of this and then do that I'll just go around in a circle and work my way out from the center but as soon as I got done with the first pass I was like this doesn't make any sense because I'd have to go over that huge mound in that whole row there that has plowed and so in hindsight I think I should have started on on the outside and then just worked my way over from I guess what the right to the left but I I think in my mind you have to always come back and start at the other end unless you just started well you can work your way outside in I suppose couldn't you you work your way outside here and just keep going outside and inside and to the inside of the inside yeah I don't know some things my brain's not working right now but maybe that's a possibility too anyways I'm sure you guys will fill me in you won't let me off the hook there and that's okay because uh I'm sitting in my tractor having fun in the summer playing with a new tool I'm not complaining anyway so I got more work to do more learning to do so I'm going to get back to work and try to knock the rest of this out but if you know what you're doing or you want to figure this tool out for yourself go to our website you'll get more information pricing you can place your order and if you're looking for anything else for your tractor for the front end loader or the three-point hitch we're happy to help you out we ship all over the country every day of the week and for just about every tool we sell we have videos of it too so you can get a close-up of it see what it's all about see it in action see if it's the right tool for you for your situation and your projects so I want to thank you for taking time out of your day to stop by and until next time stay safe we'll see you soon thank you [Music]
