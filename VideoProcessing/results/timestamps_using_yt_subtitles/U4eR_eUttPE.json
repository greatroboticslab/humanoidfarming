  "text": "[Music] I'm M dresser I own old turtle farm it's located in East Hampton Massachusetts and this is my assistant Farm manager David Shane old turtle farm is an 18 Acre Farm we have 12 acres of crop Land We Market mainly through a CSA with a little extra going to some local grocery stores we have 146 shares this season feeding 227 families cover crops are a real important part of our farm we keep half of our land in cover crop we use it mainly for our fertility program since we don't use a lot of other types of f ility here on the farm we also use it for weed suppression we graze our layers on it we have a flock of layers that we pasture on our cover crop throughout the season they are um Freer ranged within an electric net that's moved every two weeks and housed in Mobile coups that we move every day they do um a lot of bug control for us as well as create some fertility we have a system whereby we have um cover crop next to crop so we use it for beneficial habitats as well our field space is divided into sections of 30 beds there's a section of cash crop bordered by two sections of cover crop the next season those are are rotated such that the cash crops are now in sections where there was a cover crop each of our sections U contains 30 permanent beds they're mostly 300 ft long by 45 in Center to Center we also keep these permanent beds exactly where they are we use a a spater um and drive only on the pathways work walk only on the pathways so the beds always remain the same whether they're in cover crop or in cash crop after our cash crop we would seed with Ryan or just dry as the season gets colder um then the middle of next season around July that Ryan vet would be put down and put into uh a cover crop that would winter kill such as oats and peas or sudex this section was in uh cash crop earlier in the season and it's now been spaded down and put into Ryan VCH we are on a permanent bed system so the pathways always stay stay in the same place and the bed is planted with cover crop we keep the pathways clean so that we're able to find the bed the next year uh we use a permanent bed system mainly to reduce compaction and to help with maintain good soil structure we sewed this the middle of August and we go by beds so Ryan vetch usually gets put down um 5 lb of rye and 2 lbs of VCH per bed and since we go bed by bed we just mix the seed according to the number of beds we're going to put down at that time this Ryan vetch will be allowed to grow until it starts to head out and then it will be mowed we usually have to mow twice for the Rye and then allow the vet to come back through and flour and we mow again for the vet and then it will be spaded down and put into a winter kill cover crop such as oats and peas this is is the equipment we use for planting our cover crop simple drop Cedar that we purchased from Market farm implement it's made by shaper Brothers it's adjustable according to the size seed that um you're putting down we incorporate it with a basket weeder we use a pipe on the back of the tractor that drags along the bed and that helps to create the compaction necessary for U faster seed germination this is a field of oats and peas was seated in the mid mid August after space in down Ryan VCH the beds are seated to about 5 lb of premixed oats and peas per bed any of the legumes that we put down we do inoculate them prior to seaing the other um part of our fertility system is compost so um we have to buy our compost in it's rather expensive so we have been um using a lot of lagoons in our cover crop and hopes and hoping to uh reduce the amount of compost we have to use we've been experimenting with a combination of sudex and red clover planted after a cash crop the sudex will winter kill and then the red clover will come back through uh in the spring and remain through the next season the sudex was put in after cash crop the middle of August the seaing rate is um 3 lb of suex to 2 lbs of red clover per bed sudex gives us a lot of biomass and then the red clover gives us the nitrogen and red clover is something that we can leave in throughout the next year we do not have to till it down and put it into a crop that will winterkill because couple times of Mowing and by the following spring there's not so much left it goes down very easy after the sudex is winterkilled this is what the field will look like the sudex was left in place the red clover has been mowed four times through the season will be left here until spring when it will be spaded down and put into a cash crop the timing of the planting of sudex is very important this sudex was planted in the middle of August when it was still quite warm this bed of sudex was planted two weeks later when it had started to cool off so it's obvious there's going to be a substantial difference and the biomass created by the sudex this section is an example of needing to respond to uh something that didn't work correctly it was seeded into sudex and red clover last year but this spring the red clover didn't come through very well so in order to um reduce our weed problem we spaded the Clover in and planted it into straight sudex the end of May we got a great stand of sudex and this has been mowed three times um has created a very good weed suppressive situation",
