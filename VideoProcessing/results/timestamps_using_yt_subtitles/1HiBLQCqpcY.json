  "text": "hello welcome to little Garden on the Prairies and welcome to my beautiful Green Yard this is one of those Springs where we've been getting lots of rain which is great cuz we haven't had one of those for a few years as you can see the grass is super green Dand lines are coming along nicely and with this rainy weather comes a lot of cool temperatures so we're having a really cool spring and the nighttime temperatures are still pretty cold so because of that I've been really careful as to what I'm going to be planting out and when and in this video I'll just go through how you should just be careful in a cold climate like mine here when you plant out your stuff you really got to watch those temperatures so let me show you what I got going on in the Garden today so all of my winter sewing jugs are still intact here I'll let you see if I can see we got some angula coming in here really good the sweet peas are almost growing through the top got some green onion and chamomile uh basil and parsley so everything's coming good except for mint I'm not sure it's not going to come or if it's just super slow but these will be safe from the cold they're in the best place ever they got their little mini green houses keeping them warm and then here are all my bedding plants it still need to go into pots and into the garden and I'm just going to wait you can see I got tons of col Aces that are so beautiful and they're getting so big but they are one of those plants that are very sensitive to cold I've already had some of them freeze that I set out in some pots about a week ago a little bit too early we had a cold night and they froze and died so but my tomatoes are looking super healthy the green peppers are doing great so everything's going to be fine I'm just leaving them in here they'll be fine for another week until our nighttime temperatures get better I've left this door open for the last few nights but because we're going to hit that 1\u00b0 pretty sure it's going to freeze here in our yard so I'm just going to shut this door for the night and then reopen it in the morning so when the weather was warm a week ago I started potting up my flowers into my pots here and now I'm having to bring them in at night so I'm going to be just putting them in the garage until those nighttime temperatures stabilize and stay warm this is what I'm going to have to do for now so when I got up this morning the temperature on my phone said it was only 0\u00b0 so I knew that we must have got frost and you can see here in the shade on the grass there is a hint of frost still on there so I'm happy that I had put away all my pots and covered everything and saved it from frost so here is where I got my peas planted and my onions planted and they're pretty cool tolerant plants I can see that I have a couple peas starting to pop through but I think they will be fine they can handle a little bit of light frost this was something that I had to cover it's a ground cherry that I started from seed and it already got burnt once by a frost here last week and a couple of these plants are still hanging in there they're looking a little weak but I think they should be okay kept them covered last night so they are fine and these are all my onions that I had planted up they were ones I started from seed so they were not too established into the soil here but I didn't cover them and they seem to be fine like I said they are pretty cool tolerant and can handle a little bit of frost so these should be okay the potatoes of course under straw are just fine they will be okay they just got planted a week ago so cool nights are not going to affect them they should be fine I got some luses started here in my containers that are also haven't sprouted yet so they should be okay and my area designated for cucumbers tomatoes peppers is still um unplanted and looking pretty uh rough right now I need to do a major cleanup and get these ready but as I said it's going to be a good week or so before they need to get planted so I got some time to work in my garden this week so I always like to check my weather and look ahead you know 14 days just to see what the trend is looking like as you can see here coming up on this week we still have two evenings where the nighttime low is only going to be 2\u00b0 Celsius and then again coming up like 5 days from now the 24 of May 2\u00b0 at night so those are pretty cold temperatures and in my yard you know when it hits that 2 1\u00b0 there's a good chance I'm going to get Frost so just looking at this I'm going to be holding off on doing any planting of tomatoes peppers probably right till the end of May here when we start to see those nighttime temperatures are moving up to some warmer evenings and probably um our daytime highes are going to get into the 20s which is great so so even though it's really tempting to get plants out in the garden when you have those beautiful warm sunny days it's really the nighttime temperatures you got to keep an eye on and um make sure that you're not going to be planting your plants out in cold weather and end up losing them and having to start over are good for yeah they're good for okay put some more we need lots more yeah oh my walk so there's always lots of things to do while we wait for those temperatures to warm up and today my grandson and I are doing some picking of Dand lines we want to do an oil infusion so we can make some svvs so you really need to be patient when you live in a cold climate like I do the weather is so unpredictable in the spring and you just have to wait until Mother Nature has set everything right and then it's time to get all your garden planted so please hit that like button leave a comment and we will see you on the next video thanks for watching",
