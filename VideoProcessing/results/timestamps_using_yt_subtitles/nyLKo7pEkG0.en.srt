1
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:22,600
I would like to share one idea about

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:26,439
managing water scarcity for food

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,450
security focusing on sub-saharan Africa

4
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,420
the world's population has been

5
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:34,300
increasing continuously and this has

6
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:38,080
been translated into more mouse for food

7
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:41,350
and agriculture and food production

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:44,430
needs a lot of water actually right now

9
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:47,589
just for irrigation itself use about

10
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:51,010
seventy percent of further withdrawn

11
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:54,909
water resources and as a consequence

12
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:59,050
many rivers and lakes are drying up so

13
00:00:54,909 --> 00:01:02,920
we are facing great challenge to produce

14
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:06,040
more food with the limited water

15
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,560
resources then the question is where we

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:12,610
should focus on to produce more food

17
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:16,510
with per drop of water food production

18
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:19,150
is not just for local consumption it is

19
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,850
also for international trade at the

20
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:24,070
moment the international traded food

21
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:26,680
accounts for about fifteen percent of

22
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,930
the total production an international

23
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,630
trade that carries virtual water which

24
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:35,170
is the water used there for production

25
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:38,440
during the production America North

26
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:42,670
America and South America and Oceania

27
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:45,460
are the major food exporters and also

28
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:48,550
the virtual water exporters and Asia and

29
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:52,420
Africa are the major importers of food

30
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:55,870
also the importance of were taught in

31
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:58,840
this map of water scarcity as you can

32
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:01,870
see a tree though major water scarce

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,720
regions are in the middle latitude of

34
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:09,009
northern hemisphere and the in

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:12,519
sub-sahara Africa there isn't physical

36
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:16,110
water scarcity however in sub-saharan

37
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:18,940
Africa yield crop yield is very low

38
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:22,810
typically one-third of the global

39
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:25,900
average and why it is that we did a lot

40
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,700
of studies on the factors influencing

41
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,840
the

42
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:33,959
yield growth in sub-saharan Africa and

43
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,800
craft models are widely used for this

44
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:41,930
kind of an investigation and coupling it

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,790
with GIS we can do large-scale

46
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:49,590
assimilation and find out what factors

47
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:52,500
are important for crop growth this slide

48
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:56,160
actually shows one of our research

49
00:02:52,500 --> 00:03:00,030
result which is simulated a result of

50
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,819
amazed yield in sub-saharan Africa the

51
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:06,750
total height shows the range of the year

52
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:09,540
the red line shows the average yield of

53
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:12,540
maize at this moment for the whole

54
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,769
continent and then the second bar

55
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:21,329
actually shows if we increase the water

56
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:24,269
supply to meet the demand for by the

57
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:27,239
crops what will happen it shows actually

58
00:03:24,269 --> 00:03:31,079
it doesn't have much impact on you

59
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:33,569
because you doesn't increase much the

60
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:35,910
third part actually shows when we

61
00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:40,139
increase the fertilizer fertilizer

62
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:44,670
supply to meet the demand of crops and

63
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:48,269
then you can see the huge jumps by a big

64
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:51,720
margin but the ranch is still very large

65
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:55,019
because this means that the the ranch or

66
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:58,920
the yield is unstable and the last one

67
00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:01,829
last bite ratio said that the yield is

68
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,500
stable with water supply and sufficient

69
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:09,540
fertilization and here we want to show

70
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,730
the technology and and know-how actually

71
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,480
there we know how to improve the yield

72
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:19,530
for sub-saharan Africa if we can double

73
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:22,349
the yield then the sub-saharan Africa

74
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:25,050
would not need to import cereal anymore

75
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:29,789
if we contribute then there will be

76
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:32,430
surplus for export so with many regions

77
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:35,450
in the world having water scarcity and

78
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:39,639
the increasing production becomes a more

79
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:43,240
costly and sub-saharan Africa is

80
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:46,629
new sauce for the future food supply and

81
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,020
virtual water supply to elevate water

82
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:53,469
scarcity other regions so a Chinese

83
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:56,439
entrepreneur once has said give me a

84
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:59,110
Africa and I can feed the world he's

85
00:04:56,439 --> 00:05:02,139
wrong he cannot have Africa but he's

86
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,749
right in a way that Africa does have two

87
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:07,810
big potential to provide food to the

88
00:05:04,749 --> 00:05:13,000
world and the challenge is how to

89
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:17,279
unleash this potential in our

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,610
sustainable and equitable and

91
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,610
economically way

92
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,580
you
