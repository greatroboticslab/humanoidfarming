1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,460
all right let's see what we find we have

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,960
no idea because we have not checked our

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,760
bees yet

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,160
don't tell the B police

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,380
so we have a brand new

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,220
set of deep frames

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:20,400
that we might have to replace

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:23,160
oh I need some medium frames in case we

9
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,699
have to take some honey out

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:29,340
let me go grab some medium frames and

11
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:30,980
then we'll be good to go

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,940
you want to go grab this

13
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,559
they're right inside the door of the

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,420
barn I had them ready

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:42,840
if all eight frames are full of honey we

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,120
will just take the entire box off and

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,700
replace it with these deep

18
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,219
but if there's not a lot of honey then

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,620
we will only take a little bit of it and

20
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,899
replace it with empty frames we've

21
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,539
actually never done a honey Harvest from

22
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:01,860
a live Colony so this is

23
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:04,260
new to us and we're hoping to get some

24
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,720
honey this is their second year so there

25
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,119
should be it should be full of honey and

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,979
and I'm hoping that's what I see

27
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,720
but

28
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:15,600
we don't know yet because we haven't

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,520
been in the hives and done an inspection

30
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,740
yet so this is our inspection slash

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,020
hunting Harvest if it's available

32
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:25,680
well I guess it's safe to say that this

33
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:29,640
is a healthy swarm we caught

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,400
they are busy busy bees

35
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,080
all right so we added

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,220
another

37
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,460
box

38
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:39,720
to our swarm hive

39
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,340
and got

40
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,740
a couple of frames of honey from the

41
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,119
other two hives each we didn't want to

42
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,900
take it all so we just took a little

43
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:52,030
just a sample so we're gonna have some

44
00:01:48,900 --> 00:02:11,060
honey crushing and tasting

45
00:01:52,030 --> 00:02:11,060
[Music]

46
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,620
thank you

47
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:23,620
[Music]

48
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,959
are you guys picking strawberries

49
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:34,040
beautiful ripe organic strawberries how

50
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,040
many have you eaten Daddy

51
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,720
and we just got here

52
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,180
it's probably gonna have more than three

53
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,420
oh more Mama make sure it's red not

54
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,239
white nope nope nope not the white one

55
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,739
gotta pick solid red

56
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,300
daddy you teach them A Little Bit

57
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,160
Stronger

00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,420
I already told them but

59
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,420
I think he needs reinforcement

60
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,720
not the white one

61
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,680
there's plenty of red ones

62
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,480
are you just eating them instead of

63
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,480

all right come on

79
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,319
when you're so obsessed with

80
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,799
strawberries that you buy

81
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,799
all of them

82
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,490
[Applause]

83
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,499
[Music]

84
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,540
I absolutely

85
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:48,259
I absolutely love the diversity of our

86
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,259
Homestead

87
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,540
foreign

88
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:10,440
all right I decided to pull

89
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,759
some garlic heads to see

90
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,860
because

91
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,020
everybody is having to pull their garlic

92
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,280
early here in Georgia

93
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:19,199
and

94
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,479
sure enough

95
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,660
so are we

96
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:27,660
so I'm gonna go ahead and probably pull

97
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:31,259
all of it I might leave some

98
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,460
but I'm gonna evaluate as I go if I see

99
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,220
one that looks like it's going to be

100
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,759
tiny I might not pull it out

101
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,860
yeah go put them with the garlic

102
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,259
we decided to get a couple of these

103
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,699
extra large onions

104
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:48,180
to cure

105
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:49,740
as well so we're gonna put our garlic in

106
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,440
our onions

107
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,960
to dry in the Sun

108
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,880
and then we'll hang them up

109
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,699
to stay dry

110
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,080
watch your step oh you're coming close

111
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:05,100
to the corner of that

112
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:08,160
all right put them up here

113
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:10,580
you want you need some help you do one

114
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,580
at a time

115
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:15,259
oh okay

116
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:23,580
yeah you're gonna do that one yeah

117
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:27,360
oh big boy big helper thank you

118
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:29,520
so we had a very strange winter

119
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:33,960
which is the growing season for garlic

120
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:36,900
so the garlic has had a very abnormal

121
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,479
year for growing and it looks abnormal

122
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,120
we've got some that are huge and already

123
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,860
trying to sprout and grow new heads and

124
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,080
we got some that didn't even divide into

125
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,539
heads that are still really small

126
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,620
well that one's divided yeah that one's

127
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:51,479
dividing

128
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,580
but garlic goes through like an onion

129
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:56,400
stage where it's just layers

130
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,380
before it starts to Clove off

131
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,620
like you can tell this bump right here

132
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:04,319
is in Clove forming on the outside

133
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,180
obviously this one is doing the same

134
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,460
but you just never know what to expect

135
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,160
with your growing season how it's going

136
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,440
to affect the crops you just have to go

137
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,900
with it and for me I decided it was

138
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,880
worth pulling it all the garlic and

139
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,419
having that bed for something else to be

140
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,419
planted into

141
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:27,120
the guinea have taken quite an interest

142
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:31,080
in the bunny

143
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:34,800
champ has a new outdoor

144
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:37,139
cage so that he can have more space

145
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,419
and more Breeze

146
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:41,400
we might still put them in our more

147
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:46,340
protected location

148
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,340
at night but he likes it out here

149
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:54,720
the American breasts are doing very well

150
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,419
they are upgraded to the chicken tractor

151
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,759
and it looks like we have a good and

152
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:03,180
taru ratio

153
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,280
so we'll be confirming that as things

154
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,500
get further along but right now it looks

155
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,060
like we have a couple of rooms and a

156
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:13,759
couple of hens so that's

157
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,759
enough to start breeding them

158
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,560
you got it open uh-huh all right put

159
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,560
that one in there okay

160
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,889
perfect now zip it close

161
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,889
[Music]

162
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:36,479
so easy a three-year-old can do it

163
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,500
we're gonna use this to dry some of our

164
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,880
herbs

165
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,880
for teas and medicines
