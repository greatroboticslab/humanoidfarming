1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:10,740
welcome all and good morning my name is

2
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,710
Chris Roy I'm the consultant basically

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,520
from Victoria and I manage that Gerry

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,810
says grain storage extension project

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,180
this morning's topic as you can see on

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,390
your screen is best results for bags and

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:27,599
blankets some quick housekeeping before

8
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,310
we get going there's a Q&A window the

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,769
choker you can define which allows you

10
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:34,320
to ask your question click the Q&A

11
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,600
window to open up pop your question and

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,719
then if you'd like to send a question

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:44,940
anonymously just tick where it says

14
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:48,000
senators please feel free to ask

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,610
questions as we go out I can kick this

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,680
presentation interactive and answer your

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,480
questions I've also like to thank the

18
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,180
virtual copy work for facilitating

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,660
session for today if you are having any

20
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:11,670
trouble hearing me or or connecting

21
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:19,439
those contacting they pay me oh this

22
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:24,030
results for bunker storage bags where do

23
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,770
they fit into this system often here

24
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,360
they will just come to me and they say

25
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:31,350
old creme bags they're cheap right but

26
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,840
they any good for me yes they do have a

27
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,210
place in the system yes they have a

28
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,920
lower capital cost they tend to have a

29
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,840
bit higher maintenance and a bit higher

30
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,590
labor requirement they expect the

31
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,090
obvious and and they to make them really

32
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,369
they're really well suited to the

33
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,189
shorter term storage so if you think

34
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:52,799
about the higher volume lower very sort

35
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:55,530
of commodities ideal for those things

36
00:01:52,799 --> 00:02:00,630
like how is the distance and ideally you

37
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:03,570
really limit them to dry grain moisture

38
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:09,780
driving bags because we don't have a way

39
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:12,660
there efficiently with bags it's really

40
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,740
about from the experience I see around

41
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,400
the place in

42
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,650
tell me about it's really about the

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,440
effort your team if you don't put much

44
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,930
effort in don't expect a great result if

45
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,880
you put the effort in then you can make

46
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,970
them work very well and you can expect

47
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:33,050
to stall them for a bit longer obviously

48
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:36,000
if you imagine a graph of time and risk

49
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,710
longer the bag is down the higher the

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,920
risk becomes of something going wrong

51
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:42,600
that bag the gravy Burma getting in

52
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,120
there pests getting in there grain

53
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,160
quality loss so ideally in short term

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,350
however statistics if there's a really

55
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,290
good spot for them nineteen years we've

56
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:55,110
got a bit high volume of grain that

57
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,610
you've got to hold but not the

58
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,610
anticipating to hold it for too long

59
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:12,740
site selection preparation

60
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:16,580
moving is key you see occasionally the

61
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:18,960
the bag one bag in the corner of a cap a

62
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,490
and unfortunately there we have a

63
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,660
typical scenarios where I see if they

64
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:26,760
will have how the issues one because

65
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:30,060
it's not the best site and it's not

66
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,800
managed that well though site selection

67
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,380
really is important so ideally we have a

68
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,170
central site written a few central sites

69
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,870
around the farm that allow us to have

70
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:41,100
all-weather access to that site and some

71
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,960
way that we're going to be driving past

72
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:44,550
regularly so at least weekly we need to

73
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,090
be checking the bags and packing in

74
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:50,160
holes dealing with any grammar issues

75
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,710
things like that so a central site with

76
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,170
several central sites around the farm

77
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:57,360
where all your bags are stored in the

78
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,950
same way you can set up your silo you

79
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,990
put them all at a central spot so that

80
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,060
they're much easier to monitor manage

81
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:08,940
and therefore you're more likely to do

82
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:12,540
it oh this one's higher ground I dealing

83
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:14,970
with a slight slope and you can see the

84
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,130
picture here we'll go bag which is on a

85
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,680
bit of a rise which is great

86
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:22,410
anything I do if I was doing the bagging

87
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,729
would be to start at the top of the

88
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:28,710
slide and run the bag again just with

89
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:30,270
water drain

90
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,400
make sure it runs down the hill away

91
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,500
from the bag and the pinion walks it

92
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,900
seal mechanism e-news at the end of the

93
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,900
bag probably better than the other way

94
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,390
obviously if you put it across a slope

95
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:52,290
the war is going to run down the

96
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:54,000
intended compacted service I've got

97
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:58,020
written there put a nice cratered

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,880
surface in this picture well I have seen

99
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,500
plenty of times is when the rain comes

100
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,230
and falls on the bag runs around the

101
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,200
side beside the bag a little bit we

102
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,120
don't cover slow and that'll soften the

103
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,430
ground underneath the bag and then they

104
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,010
later the bet black-saw make it sink

105
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:17,880
into the soil and so what you end up

106
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:19,800
with a bag it might be a little way

107
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,440
under the compaction suits into the

108
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,940
ground and so if there is a hole under

109
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:29,660
there if my sleeve even underneath them

110
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:32,610
into a hole with the grain bag sitting

111
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:37,169
active surface so the bags it's nice and

112
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:44,700
firm on top of the green and really also

113
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:50,250
I stopped more poorly beside obvious pre

114
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:52,560
of sticks and sharp rocks they told me

115
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,410
to take them all away from Queens where

116
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,910
birds nests

117
00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:00,600
obviously birds are they have an issue

118
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:02,880
with banks so having a site that's away

119
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,070
from the bird's nest another obvious one

120
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:12,330
but something that I hadn't thought

121
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:14,070
about if someone told me another one the

122
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,570
creditor to the paper would do a bag

123
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,820
they've passed on a lot of their tips

124
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:19,950
and tricks of working what hasn't

125
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:23,030
but away from sand hills on the long

126
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:25,490
grass where rabbits and foxes tenderly

127
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:28,110
obviously rabbits not a huge issue

128
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:31,080
prepared but what chases the rabbit

129
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:37,110
these problems and Fox is running over

130
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:40,640
top of the bag taking them away from

131
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,640
those samples and long grass

132
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:54,060
first if I suppose is to select the

133
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,590
quality bag and that can be one of the

134
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,420
first helpful tip someone Gavin was

135
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,690
absolutely super Thums it in the photo

136
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:02,970
here I've got a demonstration what I

137
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,890
mean by thumb just giving it a sampler

138
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:09,360
bag or corner bag and just kind of stick

139
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:11,100
that thumb through it to to see how hard

140
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,860
or how easy it is to actually punch it

141
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,690
about the head improved since they first

142
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,760
come to Australia the quality of bag

143
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,970
casino is much better than it started

144
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:25,350
out to be something to just be aware of

145
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:28,860
I don't set much and more people selling

146
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:34,770
silage bag of grain bags and they just

147
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:38,850
not this not that a bag with a stretch

148
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:40,350
mark on it also makes life easier come

149
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:44,130
with a rule or so you just measure up

150
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:45,990
here speech that the manufacturer

151
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:49,440
recommends things like that to make it

152
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:51,210
easier when you try to give it back I

153
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,220
don't have been research on this but in

154
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:55,290
have said they sprinkle a little bit of

155
00:07:53,220 --> 00:08:00,330
your ear on the ground before laying bag

156
00:07:55,290 --> 00:08:02,460
good to the mice and Kenny research

157
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:11,160
around how that works or what it works

158
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:14,610
but anecdotally ceiling the starting end

159
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:17,340
of a bag is quite important you might

160
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,560
have seen or in my review real easy

161
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:21,240
method of punching the bag up putting

162
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,360
tabble trial in and stop being

163
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:29,580
underneath itself it really is not the

164
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:31,140
best option for a few reasons one of the

165
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,479
main ones is when you come to into the

166
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:35,840
bag the square of the starting wing

167
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:39,180
there where shopping you have to do

168
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,970
really shuffling so whatever we can do

169
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,940
to make that Joe lead you the better so

170
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:47,310
starting with a nice square in where

171
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,290
they use this here together at seal or a

172
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,110
couple of bits of timber clamp together

173
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,910
and then roll it under each other roll

174
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,200
it under it so

175
00:08:53,910 --> 00:09:00,090
[Music]

176
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,290
seal and a square obviously when you're

177
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:05,940
feeling they want to get the correct

178
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:07,920
stretch don't overfill the bag there

179
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,090
where if you haven't used bags before

180
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,590
that they will stretch out a lot more

181
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:19,560
when it's warmer itself stretcher bar

182
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:21,210
easier doing a bag on cool day versus

183
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:30,810
filling the bag on a hot day will be

184
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:32,430
will be a little bit different so I've

185
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,680
got straight this some people might

186
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:35,850
think that's a little bit picky little

187
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,800
bit finicky that we need the bag

188
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:42,570
straight couple reasons for that though

189
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,890
one is that it's a lot easier when it

190
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:48,300
comes to out loading if you've got a

191
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:50,520
straight bag to follow this one the

192
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,110
other one is in the front you have got a

193
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,240
couple of creases forming in the bag

194
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,030
every time the bag changes direction

195
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,520
until called a crease and those creases

196
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:03,060
we find a wear mask and most likely to

197
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:04,800
attack because I can chew the bag so the

198
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,260
straighter we get it for those creases

199
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:12,500
their spots we've got to the mass to

200
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:12,500
access and down here like I said before

201
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:18,480
well look at this photo you can see the

202
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:20,880
site here it's always suggesting the

203
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,360
core of paddock again not more not not

204
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,770
my preference I understand that's very

205
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,150
convenient for harvest logistics to run

206
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:31,080
out straight from the chase then into a

207
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:34,200
bag in the toilet paddy it's not ideal

208
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:37,290
and and really limits the time that I

209
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,240
would be comfortable waiting bag leave

210
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:42,060
the grain stored in the bag so if it's

211
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,530
just half of logistics for a month and

212
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,330
we want to take the risk on be another

213
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:58,130
half loaded when it's dry and not too

214
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:58,130
wet do start in crazy

215
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,230
after filling obviously we've got to

216
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:07,949
seal up the the end of the bag well if

217
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:10,139
we're finished if you know go to a bit

218
00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:12,570
of effort here you can get proper heat

219
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:14,160
seals just to seal that up properly to

220
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,230
keep the moisture out it seems like a

221
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,720
pretty simple thing but what people tell

222
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,010
me that the moisture moisture will find

223
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,079
its way in there if it's not done

224
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,540
properly so if you really have got worth

225
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,370
going effort again clamp the tube it's a

226
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,190
timber together our father saw the bag

227
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:30,949
roll it under itself and then put some

228
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:34,260
dirt on top of it

229
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:35,970
hold that end in that opening listen to

230
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,820
it obviously you've got to leave some

231
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:41,579
bag access there if the unloader started

232
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:46,470
so some dirt on the top will stop that

233
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:49,079
back in the end and seal that then fence

234
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:51,300
off the side of course even if we don't

235
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,339
have sheep on our farm there's always a

236
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,589
story of the neighbors sheep got out and

237
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:58,470
run over the top of my bag or some well

238
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:00,660
go to something or wild pigs building it

239
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:03,060
and made a mess so I would recommend

240
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,500
defense inside the gals of whether

241
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,459
you've got livestock or not there's

242
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,560
always something that we do Petare

243
00:12:07,459 --> 00:12:14,579
fighting a mice you can do a pretty

244
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:17,790
simple bait station to bait the mice and

245
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:19,139
clean up any spills happened around the

246
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,639
site you can send the left hand side

247
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:22,769
here we've got a beautiful hard

248
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,350
compacted site here that makes it really

249
00:12:22,769 --> 00:12:28,110
easy to clean up grains pills

250
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:30,750
and the reason for that is to to remove

251
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:33,260
a reason for both grain pests and vermin

252
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,699
lice birds

253
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,589
anything like that to be actually

254
00:12:35,699 --> 00:12:40,350
attracted to the bag to be attracted to

255
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:43,010
the site so if we clean those fills up

256
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:45,300
and remove me from the site completely

257
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:48,389
we remove the temptation in the

258
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,980
attraction same as when we're patching

259
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:52,949
the bag we're going there monitoring

260
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,620
patching them that's about stopping

261
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:59,940
their attraction stopping them spilling

262
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:02,040
growing out and stopping the photo on

263
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:05,209
the right here we've got a nice simple

264
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:07,889
fence around it to stop of them and

265
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:09,810
don't like though is that left the grass

266
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:13,860
grower in the bag which again is a

267
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:16,079
shelter there for the mice or insects

268
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:18,810
not ideal and you can set it up right

269
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:20,100
beside a built in fresh tree line which

270
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:24,420
might be convenient in the court of a

271
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:26,579
paddock but that's it's just providing

272
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:31,890
food for those birds needs to control

273
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:37,620
witches regular monitoring I've already

274
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:40,649
touched on we here weekly is the ideal

275
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,810
for patching bags again depending on

276
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:46,529
where they are and how much pressure

277
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:48,029
they are under wrong vermin I've had a

278
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:50,010
couple people tell me they have got to

279
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:53,010
go around them every couple of days to

280
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:55,260
patch them again as soon as you've got a

281
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:57,000
hole you've got a spot for grinding it

282
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,339
out that becomes an attraction for more

283
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,370
of them and that also is a spot where

284
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:05,160
moisture can get in so soon you've got a

285
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:06,839
moisture coming into a bag you're much

286
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,360
more likely to have brain damage of

287
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:12,060
course but also provides a really nice

288
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:23,730
spot for insects to start bringing moist

289
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:28,470
grain got a sample the bag check for

290
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:31,290
moisture temperature insect pests have

291
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,880
antennae soon it and a great system for

292
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:36,540
the sampling but I'm sure you guys have

293
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,250
got them whether you use a speed and

294
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:48,120
take around the speed so that it doesn't

295
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:52,040
tear the bag Mars the grain but same way

296
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:55,519
we market lining up any other silos

297
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,570
leaving the market cleaning bags as well

298
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,980
obviously if we have big Brian full

299
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:00,980
events you want to dry in the board away

300
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,500
you know put this picture in to

301
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,470
demonstrate they've got a bag nice and

302
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,839
straight which is making unloading easy

303
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:22,949
and see it's not too many holes it's

304
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:25,620
likely not put the bag down for too long

305
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:27,340
so well it's in a paddock and right

306
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:29,380
beside some trees

307
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,060
they're doing the right thing not baby

308
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:39,820
bear too long expected me to be either

309
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:42,760
stored or brain here quick frozen frozen

310
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:45,930
cons of bags certain low capital cost

311
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:49,480
upfront they do allow that segregation

312
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:52,420
flexible capacity flexible in location

313
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,220
meet leasing ground or you've got a farm

314
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,960
that's the distance from the home place

315
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:59,500
and it's not convenient to cart going

316
00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:02,940
home you could set up a bag use like

317
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,529
they're so flexible location the conned

318
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:09,100
things to be aware of they will require

319
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:12,970
a bit more labor so it takes two people

320
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,800
to load the bag and ideally color people

321
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,480
to fill them successfully you could

322
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,900
probably take shortcut but again every

323
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,070
shortcut you take really reduces how

324
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,839
good a job you're going to do and

325
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:26,529
therefore how long you can store the

326
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:29,560
plane successfully in the bag the pilot

327
00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:32,370
we we don't novel successful way to be

328
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:35,620
irate the grinding bags Lee in there so

329
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:39,490
cooling I wish to there's some risk with

330
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:41,080
with damage and loss with a bag all

331
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:44,680
things I'm telling you here is to try a

332
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:46,690
minimum or inspectors and the limited

333
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,000
storage look people tell me about stored

334
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,130
in bags really comfortably for up to 12

335
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,280
months but the other people that have

336
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:57,220
done everything absolutely ideal is like

337
00:16:54,280 --> 00:17:00,490
me if you're going to take shortcuts or

338
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:06,240
perhaps it's it's not an ideal situation

339
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:06,240
then really talking about storage really

340
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:14,560
quick summary on bags there let's have a

341
00:17:12,610 --> 00:17:17,709
quick look of bankers while we're going

342
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:19,569
on temporary storage very similar to

343
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:22,569
bags in the site selection we want

344
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:25,660
somewhere high we want good drainage to

345
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:27,579
keep the moisture away they compacted

346
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:30,130
pad again for the same reasons as we

347
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:33,100
could do with bags we don't want the

348
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,380
weight of the grain forcing a little

349
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,650
depression in the soil and then creating

350
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,650
spot

351
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:46,809
a graded slope so if you imagine a

352
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:50,019
roadway black should want a graded canva

353
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:52,570
across the pub area and then we want to

354
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:55,330
actually slow down so the water runs out

355
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:59,470
of that bunker area as well so the

356
00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:01,690
camber and it's like it really is worth

357
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:06,279
building and building website for a

358
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:07,990
bunker if they will say part of their

359
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:10,299
site selection for a bunker if they've

360
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:25,960
got really flat ground is actually where

361
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:29,559
they've got access to some filth and

362
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,090
bunker walls look doesn't always be you

363
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,450
don't have to have a wall around the

364
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,629
bunker

365
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:36,610
so the increases your capacity and it

366
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:38,080
can help with sealing the top down a bit

367
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:40,330
better and holding top having something

368
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,429
to command it to you concrete ballz

369
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:47,740
obviously ideal is it the clamping

370
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:51,009
system but what I wouldn't recommend is

371
00:18:47,740 --> 00:19:04,059
using hay or straw as a wall purely

372
00:18:51,009 --> 00:19:06,090
because insects blowing pests in Bangka

373
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:09,249
capacity to a few ways to go about it I

374
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:12,220
put this table in here the people

375
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:14,409
interested they can jump on on the

376
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:17,409
website afterwards and look it up from

377
00:19:14,409 --> 00:19:22,809
the store crank ombré your website or or

378
00:19:17,409 --> 00:19:25,779
of course this just wouldn't have a you

379
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:27,309
know idea start with how high your all

380
00:19:25,779 --> 00:19:30,070
there is Gannett going to stack the

381
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:33,730
grain so if you've got an order that can

382
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:36,429
reach up four meters expect your hub of

383
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:39,190
that this is in wheat and it's expected

384
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:42,490
the battle to get 700 meters wide given

385
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:45,149
the angle of repose for weight if you

386
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:49,210
adjusted a cone if you're looking about

387
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:50,529
225 ton capacity as the example if you

388
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:54,320
went 30 meters long

389
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:58,670
if you fitting weight

390
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:02,420
it said number 60 cubic meters but

391
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:05,240
really any loot I will break to figure

392
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,830
out the capacity of a bunker the other

393
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:12,440
way to do it of course is to calculate

394
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:15,230
it for yourself the angle of repose for

395
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:18,080
the various grains here a growing coffee

396
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:25,180
it was a calculation here which you can

397
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:28,000
do and then obviously your volume

398
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:29,810
manners and then you convert that to the

399
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,710
conversion factors where they're storing

400
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:36,500
weight or value give you an idea of

401
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:40,120
having a pad you need to grade half a

402
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,120
part you need to put your bunker walls

403
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:52,910
bunker operation I would always

404
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,770
recommend the bottom top I have heard

405
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:57,290
people say that they use the top top for

406
00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:04,010
a few years and then that becomes a

407
00:20:57,290 --> 00:21:06,290
bottom top you can do that with no

408
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:10,850
separate but a lot of quality top for

409
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:12,110
the bottom the top top there are quite

410
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,120
significant differences in the quality

411
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,220
of top that you can get so again if you

412
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:19,810
let me at the bunker for more than

413
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:22,670
short-term storage the quality

414
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:25,040
difference and having a way to seal it

415
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:27,560
down this is an ideal method to be able

416
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:33,470
to clamp the top down to that concrete

417
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:35,120
bunker wall obviously if we're going to

418
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,790
do a bank on either a method for

419
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,530
removing the top depending on the

420
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:42,110
conditions if there's a bit of breeze it

421
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:45,260
can be quite dangerous and seriously

422
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:48,950
injured trying to remove taps will put

423
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:53,720
taps on on bunkers one at 20 so having a

424
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:55,880
safe way to move the tasks without

425
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,890
having man handling really is a good

426
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:04,330
idea and of course on the out loading

427
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:04,330
method telehandler or a lighter or

428
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:14,760
well bunker operation needs a couple of

429
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,060
other methods if you put on the earth

430
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:20,190
wall might be a tempest for the bunker

431
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:21,990
you can put an earth wall there the

432
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,850
ground sheet obviously wants to come up

433
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:26,910
and right over the top of that that wall

434
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:30,930
and then the top table will come down

435
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:34,170
and join it now I do see in the next

436
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:35,700
slide yes I have ever put any bit of

437
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,930
dirt around the bottom of the top here

438
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,750
to hold the top down

439
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,880
good in theory but it can cause water to

440
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:44,790
pool on top of that little that little

441
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,710
line there so another method is to

442
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:49,830
actually dig a trench around just

443
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:51,810
outside of the bunker or top to go down

444
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:54,390
and through and then put the soil in

445
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:57,390
into that depth of the trench so that

446
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:58,860
water running down the bunka tar will

447
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:02,340
run straight across there talking away

448
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:06,270
from the bunker site again a bit more

449
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:08,670
work the more effort but you extend it

450
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:11,850
the life of time that you can store

451
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:14,160
grain there without having an issue and

452
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:17,430
again these things operational things

453
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:20,130
are very similar to two bags we can

454
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:21,000
clean up many skills remove the grain

455
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,670
from the site

456
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,470
remove the attraction thanks aside our

457
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:32,810
faithful mice and sure it's happy still

458
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:36,870
being sort of pros and cons of bunkers

459
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:40,320
low cost to capital up front takes off

460
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:41,940
the passive flexible location obviously

461
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,520
requires a bit more labour

462
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:46,320
so if labor is something you can get at

463
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,660
our store then that's fine if labor is a

464
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,850
real pressure for your Tallis Tom then

465
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:52,580
then then bag can bank it may not fit

466
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:57,780
with your system

467
00:23:52,580 --> 00:24:00,960
Brian quality question was aeration it

468
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,940
is possible in a butter he's a bit of

469
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,590
work and in a bit to set up so I have

470
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,410
don't you sit down there common but it

471
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:09,600
is possible risk of damage on Wall

472
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:12,390
Street begins rated for the ephemeral

473
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,930
storage and the work required for

474
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:18,620
successful fumigation not impossible but

475
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,620
Dow Sephora

476
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:26,740
so we have a look at the big picture of

477
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:28,480
managing grain storage overall and

478
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:30,220
thinking back to that first slide of

479
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,360
where the bags and bunkers fit into a

480
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:37,120
grain storage system we've really got

481
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:39,640
three three categories that I think

482
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,770
about in pest prevention and what do we

483
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,660
do this try and stop pestering in s

484
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:46,720
control what we do it with do get pests

485
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:48,730
and having many grow in quality so if we

486
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,880
look at those in the relationship bags

487
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:53,290
and bunkers hygiene structural

488
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,090
treatments and in terms of cleaning up

489
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:57,250
around the site cleaning up and loading

490
00:24:55,090 --> 00:25:02,260
or unloading here if you do that if you

491
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:03,910
use our diatomaceous earth aeration

492
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:07,450
cooling I'll put a cross against that

493
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:09,490
one while you can do in Bunker's I don't

494
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:13,770
see it done very colony because it is so

495
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:17,950
much work just to set up and manage

496
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:19,360
across means that one protectants look

497
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,190
this is where they do have a place in

498
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,680
that temporary top storage and ensure

499
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:26,500
the term I'll put a question mark there

500
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:28,780
because I don't know if any one that is

501
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,130
actually set up a chaser bin or

502
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:34,080
something took me out or plyo

503
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:36,640
protectants at the core acquired right

504
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,220
it does seem to be they were challenged

505
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,120
to be able to get an even consistent

506
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:46,840
flow of rain calibrate that particular

507
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:50,050
station so certainly possible I just

508
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,650
don't see it that often so put a

509
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,180
question mark

510
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:55,720
yes that one but the thickness would

511
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:57,160
help of course and monitoring absolutely

512
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,620
you can do it I've got a question right

513
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:15,730
there because so many people I say don't

514
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:17,680
do it but I know you can even if we do

515
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:21,850
all that we do get pests or our options

516
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:32,530
to control them phosphine you say only

517
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:33,970
control with the on-farm now in bags and

518
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:37,540
bankers it is possible

519
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:40,600
research being done in both and it is

520
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,610
possible to fumigate it needs a bit

521
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,130
extra work there's quite a process to it

522
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:47,800
one of the real challenges to fumigating

523
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:52,990
in bags is actually painting getting the

524
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:55,240
phosphine back out of the bag being in

525
00:26:52,990 --> 00:27:03,790
sacrifice mania and it will take a

526
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:05,590
longer really long bag there is more

527
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:09,970
information I'll show you for that just

528
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:11,500
really great quality in growing

529
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:13,390
qualities are really about moisture and

530
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,370
temperature management which we don't

531
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:18,370
have a lot of options in bags and

532
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:20,290
bunkers so it really relies on ask

533
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:22,570
putting the grain into both temporal

534
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:25,330
storages at the right conditions so it

535
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:34,750
is a very maintained because we don't

536
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:36,640
have much control over to sum up before

537
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:38,320
I get into the circular questions coming

538
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,250
in which is fantastic so keep them

539
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,370
coming me let's say they prepared to put

540
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:47,920
in the work and give it a good result

541
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:49,750
but it'd be unfair here talk to someone

542
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,190
about using bags and bankers and they

543
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:53,680
tell you that they can store it for a

544
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:57,100
long period of time successfully and

545
00:27:53,680 --> 00:28:01,390
then you go home and do a do a short cap

546
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:03,700
job or noted for the quality is your set

547
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:09,820
up and then complain that you didn't

548
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:11,710
have the same result they really stick

549
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:14,920
about your expectations for storage and

550
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:16,330
bags and bunkers obviously they do have

551
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,570
their limitations

552
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:22,240
I do have their spot so bring out and

553
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:23,920
utilize them they doesn't work really

554
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,290
nice in conjunction with some permanent

555
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:29,080
storage so you can have a combination

556
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:31,240
both if you want to out load a bag get

557
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:33,760
an issue in a put out load one to have

558
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,640
some permanent storage out load of you

559
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,410
to so you might have a bag in a paddock

560
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,540
and then after month you've got to silo

561
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,500
space freed up you can transfer the

562
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:43,840
grain from the paddock

563
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,970
interventive storage any feedback there

564
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,090
if you need to but having some

565
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:51,290
flexibility

566
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:54,410
really bad well as with my things on the

567
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:56,420
farm plantain head to do your

568
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:59,360
preparation figure out your pest control

569
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:01,010
method and figure out your outgoing

570
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:07,700
method and then make sure you clean out

571
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:10,850
both the more information here the

572
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,380
stored grain cumberland website or you

573
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:15,890
can you can contact the nearest grain

574
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:20,690
storage specialist on 103 them shoot me

575
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:22,190
an email with some links here you can

576
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:24,140
click on the links they're successful

577
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:26,780
storage and grain bags as a fact sheet

578
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:29,840
there's a few other information

579
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,700
resources there for bags and bunkers if

580
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,980
you feel that the website and just

581
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,770
search bunker you come up with a few

582
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:39,950
days over there tea video which are

583
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:49,550
really quite quite handy for growers

584
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:51,950
perspective he'll the questions here i

585
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:53,630
encourage you to keep talking these

586
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:56,660
questions in and i'll try and tackle

587
00:29:53,630 --> 00:30:01,070
them one of us on question here would

588
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:04,070
you feel about a bag look as i said it

589
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:06,950
is possible it is a bit more work to

590
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:09,410
fuming out in the bag you need to set up

591
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:12,650
a system you can actually put the

592
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:16,630
tablets into the bay about every 7

593
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:19,190
meters so they can liberate and then

594
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:23,630
remove the tablet after the fumigation

595
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:25,940
period obviously it relies in the bag

596
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:28,250
being sealed completely so the quality

597
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:31,010
of a bag the head with a job you've done

598
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:35,720
in actually mixing up any hole is

599
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:39,620
silastic tape because we can do a

600
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:42,260
pressure test on bags or bunkers in

601
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:44,510
ideal world would have gas monitoring

602
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:46,520
equipment that actually tell us whether

603
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:49,130
we're reaching the required two to three

604
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:55,910
hundred parts per million for a seven to

605
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:58,730
ten days then as I said the fainting is

606
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:01,010
actually one of the tricky parts of you

607
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:04,669
getting the bag so that can now

608
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:07,100
having a little fan getting some

609
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:09,140
perforated tube with a red on it or like

610
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:13,700
an order flight you can actually screw

611
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:15,770
into the staffing end of the bag open up

612
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,900
the bag other end of the bag where

613
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:26,240
you're finished billing and actually

614
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:27,290
suck the air to the bag so yes it's

615
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,559
possible

616
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:32,120
in fact this the second link I've got

617
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:37,130
here store grind up another user slash

618
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:39,080
rain bag negation foundation fill a

619
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:44,240
barrel in that video goes through the

620
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:51,169
process the I do ideal as the course of

621
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:53,900
gas starts doable storage the question

622
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:58,100
here more comment in bags if you don't

623
00:31:53,900 --> 00:32:02,240
leave adequate labor upside bags in no

624
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:04,790
etching this with a a really good

625
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,580
comment Roy they do take a bit more

626
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:10,880
louver and you might think you can do it

627
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:13,250
on your own or they build with West

628
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,780
people but certainly agree with the

629
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:17,840
comments there they are given a chance

630
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:22,910
which if you try and do too much

631
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:25,790
yourself so labor something you're short

632
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:28,429
of a Paris they may not be your best bet

633
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:36,080
got plenty of people around and they're

634
00:32:28,429 --> 00:32:38,000
obviously in a bit low capital cost are

635
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,150
there any other questions that you guys

636
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,520
have cooked down for few more here that

637
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:46,809
off and get a spit but please refer to

638
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,809
add the question there if you can

639
00:32:53,960 --> 00:33:03,499
well often here is the bag he medically

640
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:06,769
sealed therefore low oxygen inside tell

641
00:33:03,499 --> 00:33:10,789
you sex currently I haven't seen any

642
00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:14,960
independent research to back that up so

643
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:17,929
I'm going on here say my my personal

644
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,149
feeling is that it's the bag was in

645
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:23,450
perfect condition it's quite possible

646
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:25,399
but reality used most bags and have some

647
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:27,919
holes in them at some point and I don't

648
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:29,869
about the option to do so the short

649
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,129
answer is I'm not sure that they are you

650
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:32,840
medically still I certainly wouldn't

651
00:33:31,129 --> 00:33:41,169
want to rely on that of my own and

652
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:43,789
insect control then the damage and

653
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:56,720
hopefully they are sealed that they the

654
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:59,720
oxygen low inside but certainly the

655
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,320
question here have been problems in the

656
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:17,169
past

657
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:22,059
when used yeah good point

658
00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:22,059
not Valley can can be a little more

659
00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:27,559
sensitive to it to its storage certainly

660
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,809
in terms of moisture and temperature we

661
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:32,179
know that lower the moisture below the

662
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:35,450
temperature the better the quality of

663
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:38,569
North Valley will be maintained so again

664
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:41,790
keep your bags for the lower value

665
00:34:38,569 --> 00:34:43,809
higher volumes sort of product

666
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:47,960
[Music]

667
00:34:43,809 --> 00:34:49,790
Malvolio Dewey you put it into a solid

668
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:53,089
that you can have a duration to cool it

669
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:56,710
cool it rained down quickly so you think

670
00:34:53,089 --> 00:34:56,710
thanks right that question or comment

671
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,440
are there any other questions or

672
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,550
comments people look up before we finish

673
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,960
