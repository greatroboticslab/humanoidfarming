1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,200
what is Hydroponics hydroponic gardening

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,320
is a method of growing plants without

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:11,320
soil in hydroponic gardening the water

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,080
does the work in this case the work of

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,000
delivering nutrients to the plant roots

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,600
in order to grow plants Hydroponics is

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,119
the cultivation of plants using water

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,840
nutrients and a growing medium it's

9
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:26,920
growing without using soil there are

10
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,039
different types of hydroponic systems

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,679
there's the wicking system as its name

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,079
States a WI and a phenomenon called

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,719
capillary action the nutrient solution

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,960
will slowly but regularly and constantly

15
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,000
spread from where there is more to where

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,440
there is less water as the plants need

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,760
it you may also see an ebb and flow or

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,840
what is called flood and drain system

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,280
the basic concept of an Evan flow

20
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,000
hydroponic system is fairly simple

21
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,920
plants are placed in a tray which is

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,320
periodically filled with nutrient-rich

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,320
water pumped out of a reservoir below

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,960
the system uses gravity to return the

25
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,960
water to the reservoir to be reused nft

26
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,960
nutrient film technique nutrient film

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,320
technique is a hydroponic technique

28
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,400
where a shallow stream of water

29
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,880
containing all the dissolved nutrients

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,880
required for the plant growth is

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,360
recirculated past the bare roots of the

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,880
plant in a watertight Gully also known

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,799
as channels aeroponics are specialized

34
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,119
versions of Hydroponics where the roots

35
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,159
of the plant extend only in air and the

36
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,560
roots are directly sprayed with a

37
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,720
nutrient water in a drip system of

38
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,560
Hydroponics the water-based nutrient

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,000
solution is delivered to the root system

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,840
of plants using drip irrigation drip

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,040
systems are ideal for vertical

42
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,680
hydroponic farming since the nutrient

43
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,520
can be placed at the top and gravity

44
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,000
sends it down to the rest of the plants

45
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,040
dwc or deep water culture is one based

46
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,960
on a tank called a grow tank where you

47
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,399
have the nutrient solution and an air

48
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,880
pump to provide air to the roots there

49
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,520
are a few disadvantages to hydroponic

50
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,560
systems the initial costs are sometimes

51
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,119
higher a deeper knowledge is needed and

52
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,000
sometimes they need a little bit more

53
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:11,920
attention having thought about the

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,480
disadvantages I knew the proven

55
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,959
advantages were worth an initial

56
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,120
investment in a small hydroponic system

57
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,000
what are the benefits of hydroponic

58
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,239
systems plants grow

59
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,400
significantly faster when existing soil

60
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:32,400
is poor Hydroponics is the best option

61
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:36,000
Hydroponics crops yield from 20 to 25%

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,200
greater than soil it requires less space

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,360
and uses a lot less water than soil

64
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,239
farming Hydroponics also has a lot of

65
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,640
health benefits eating more vegetables

66
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:51,159
can improve your overall health no

67
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:54,480
pesticides are ever used in Hydroponics

68
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:56,840
growing without soil reduces and

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,360
minimizes the risk of contamination from

70
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,319
growing vegetables in dirt that uses

71
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,360
manure

72
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,040
and the vegetables harvested from our

73
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:09,280
hydroponic system last 2 to three times

74
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:13,000
longer and can be harvested even after

75
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,000
being cut two to three times dwc or deep

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,920
water culture fit our family's needs and

77
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,239
it was a great place to start

78
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:25,319
Hydroponics is too simple and too good

79
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,400
for me not to share it with you after

80
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,720
you set up your Hydroponics for food

81
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:32,920
system you'll have a continuous supp

82
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,620
supply of delicious and nutritious salad

83
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:40,200
greens herbs and vegetable
