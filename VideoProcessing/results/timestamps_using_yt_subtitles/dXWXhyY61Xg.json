  "text": "good afternoon everyone my name is Julie Garden Robinson and I'm your host for today's field to Fork webinar this is brought to you by North Dakota State University extension this is actually the ninth year we've done the series and we're really glad you've been joining us maybe this is your first time or maybe you've been to all of the webinars so far we have archived all of the webinars from previous years and the link is on our field of fork webinar page and I want to give a special Welcome to our watch parties welcome everyone we also are providing a certificate of attendance on our website and it is posted with the recording which will come out in a couple days the next slide shows the upcoming webinars so you can take a look we hope you join us for these as well the next slide shows the webinar controls and because of our large number of participants we invite you to post your questions and comments in the chat let's practice finding and using the chat box some of you already did you can ignore the Q&A box we're not going to use that we're going to have you put your questions for harleen in the chat box so type your city and state where you are right now the next slide provides an acknowledgement so as you work on putting your city and state in I have a special request this program is sponsored in part with grant funding from the usda's Agricultural Marketing service through the North Dakota Department of Agriculture actually and I will ask all of you to complete the short online survey that will be emailed right after today's webinar and as a thank you we are continuing to provide prizes to the lucky winners of the random drawings so be sure to include your complete address and by the way you will need to scroll down to today's date and speaker's name because we're combining our data from 2023 and 2024 so the 2023 dates are listed first so scroll down a little bit and click on that button that corresponds to the 2024 date and with that our next slide is a welcome to today's webinar and our speaker I'd like to tell you a little bit about Dr harleen hatterman Valente she was born in northeast Nebraska and raised on a crop and Animal Farm she came to NDSU in 2000 as an assistant professor in the high value crops project so she has spent more time in North Dakota than Nebraska she has conducted research on approximately 20 different different crops but aliam crops have been most predominant during her 23 plus years at NDSU and I have a beautiful blooming bulb behind me right now that's quite fragrant so I'm looking forward to Spring and some of the bulbs that pop up so welcome harleen and I'll you can take it away okay so that is wonderful so today um the the topic is how to grow garlic and aliums and I only have about 45 minutes so I'm not going to touch on a lot of aliums um uh because there are way too many that uh it would take days to go and discuss them all uh but so today I'm just going to talk about three of them uh garlic dry bulb onions and leaks and those are the big three that we can really grow quite well here in North Dakota so with that I'm going to start with a little bit about um garlic well first I'll just talk about the the genus alium it is one of the largest flowering plant groups in the amarillis family and that's what Julie was talking about she probably has an amarillis that is what its common name is uh bulb flowering right now the family name is actually amarilla daier um and this consists of hundreds of wild and cultivated scented bulbus herbs and the three that I have talked about are um well known there's there's also a lot of chives for example is another one but there's even herbaceous ornamentals that um grow quite well in North Dakota that um Chinese garlic for one and ornamental onion uh that uh grow quite well and prolifically as herbaceous ornamentals but today we're going to talk about more of the culinary ones and and to start with um garlic you know it can be used for a whole bunch of different things um I have a graduate student that is looking at uh the cultivars and some of the information that I'm going to provide is from his trial to give you an idea of which Cult of Art do better in North Dakota than um other places but I also have a graduate student that is looking at aliums for their um Health attributes uh we know garlic has a lot of Health attributes and I'll talk about that in a little bit but she's looking at um how some of these other aliums leaks um green onions um dry ball bulb onions and boy now I lost my thought on the third one um it'll come to me probably when I get to the end but she's looking at more of the health attributes and that's because a lot of these uh aliums have these bioactive components in garlic it's alisin and Alin and actually Alin is the precursor to Al sin so um most of the um the health attributes has to do with this sulfur compound of alisin which is the most predominant in garlic but garlic also has a g glutamine sorry a mouthful and polyphenolics and we've been looking in collaboration with um Dr Kalita Shetty on um just the the health benefits of the polyphenolics um with type 2 diabetes so um cidra's whole research is looking at um the four aliums for that um as far as uh the amount of production of garlic the United Nations food and agricultural assoc organization has uh estimated that on an annual basis there's about 11 million tons of garlic produced and that's just on 2.5 million Acres um that's worldwide that isn't the United States actually in the United States we import a lot of our garlic and that's because of the uses and effectiveness of it treating uh many different Cancers and diseases and so the consumption has increased faster than actually the production has increased so in the United States especially we're really importing quite a bit of um forgot to start up my little thing well I'll look at time make sure I don't run over um importing much of the garlic so now let's go in a little bit get started on the production and management um garlic grows best in a a welld drained Sandy clay LOM soil so a little bit heavier soil and actually we have a study where we're um trying to see how these cultivars compare um at our horiculture research site which is more of a Sandy LOM and comparison to on campus here where we're in the Red River Valley we have a clay soil uh and so we're we're testing that uh we planted those last fall and we'll hopefully have some results come this uh kind of late July um period when we Harvest um soil pH is best around 6 to 6.8 uh but I know we have a little bit higher um pH out at the Horticulture research Farm it's more of a 72 maybe 7.4 and we haven't had any problems um with that so um one nice thing about garlic is it it's it's a very uh adaptable plant in most cases as far as nutrition you know we want to overall apply between 70 and 125 pounds of nitrogen 150 lbs of um phosphorus and a excuse me about 100 pounds of potassium now that will depend on your soil test and what previous crop you had a and uh so um but it's also important that we don't put all that nitrogen down at F at one time we really want to spoon feed the nitrogen um and so that should be split into approximately 25 lbs before planting and then side dress around 20 lb every 3 weeks and then we want to make sure we stop four to six weeks before Harvest um because we really want that plant not to keep trying to grow and produce it has to um you know it it's a rather long season the way it is we need that dry down we have to go and cure those uh um B um bulbs and and and it also helps if you shut that off so that you don't it in the preservation otherwise uh your bulbs will deteriorate quicker if we keep on fertilizing right to the end um as far as irrigation I think drip irrigation works the best with drip irrigation you can avoid some of those uh Leaf diseases that um all aliums can get uh and uh with drip irrigation then it's easy enough to um put on about an inch a week if it's getting um towards the end and the plants are bigger you might need to go and put two two inches a week when it's um some of those hot days especi like last year we had June weather no July weather was in June so it was really really hot we had a number of 100 degree days days um and aliam in general do not really like those hot days so it's best that we do whatever we can to go and and help them through those kind of periods now there are three different types of garlic you have your um elephant garlic uh softnet um garlic and hardnet garlic we in in the northern part um do best with hard neck cultivars and um so and but there's a lot of there's also then subgroups but hard neck by far are are the only ones that we grow in North Dakota so when do we get started well we're past that time already we needed to do that this last fall approximately 6 to eight weeks before that ground freezes um and we actually have another study where we're looking at you know what is the optimum time because there hasn't been any research on that for um garlic and and so I'd rather have us do some trial and air and figure out when's the best time uh to have um to go and uh transplant your cloves of garlic um than to have someone else go and and trial around and find out um that through more air than um anything else um spacing your rose spacing should be anywhere from 12 to um 36 in or 1 to 3 feet and then um between the cloves you want somewhere between 3 and 6 in they kind of like to be kind of close together but you need to go and give them enough room so that um they aren't pushing against each other and deforming each other so depth um is 3 to 4 in deep and and so you see the picture and in which they've just kind of marked out the row then they'll go and cover that with soil you can do that or you can go and just actually if you have a well tilled soil you can probably just push them down to that depth another way of looking at it is that the top of the clove has to be twice the depth of the clove height so if your clove was about 1 and2 in uh tall then you want 3 in um above that tip of that clove of course um we need to mulch in this uh climate that we have actually one time I was growing some and um I thought well the previous year generally we have plenty of snow and I said oh they'll be fine I won't have to go and and get some straw and mulch them and sure enough that was the fall that we had the really cold weather before we got the insulation from the snow and so the following spring um most of them did not emerge uh they in fact they just because of that cold injury they just rotted in the soil so you want four to six inches of straw and the nice thing about that is uh you know having that straw through the winter protecting it um you can then leave it there and it provides uh wheat control not allowing a lot of those annual weat needs to get enough sunlight to go and germinate so it it it provides weed control as well and that is always a a good thing um because there's not a lot of way um easy ways to go and for weed control usually it's by hand weeding uh the roots are rather shallow and you really don't want to go and disturb the roots so um uh the mainly it's been hand weeding for for especially for a homeowner I think if we were to have a big commercial grower then they would have put down their um pre-emergence herbicide um way before uh the uh garlic or the weeds emerged so let's go on okay more on the production and management so um garlic will flour and these uh that flowering stem is called escape and that must be removed because if you don't remove that and you allow the garlic to flour then it's taking away nutrition from that bulb and those cloves and putting it towards that flour stock and that flour so you you remove the Scapes and they can be consumed or you if you have a farmers market you can sell them you can make them into a whole bunch of different things I'm sure Julie has um all kinds of recipes for Scapes uh anything from a pesto to um just a pan uh frying them could be done um and so when you do that then the next sequence of what happens is it's time to go and harvest and you're going to go and harvest the them when there's about six brown leaves or 60% of those leaves turn brown I should say um unlike well they do like onions they'll actually that stem will Kink over uh but you generally want to do that before you don't want to wait that long because then that plant is also overmature and especially if you're going to go and try to you utilize any of those cloves to plant the following year or if you want some long storage um they're going to have poor quality so when 60% of the leaves turn brown uh you can either go and try to um pull and twist but I really think the best thing is to have a like the picture shows have some kind of a fork or shovel or something to help dig those because I have gone and um thought I could just pull them out and um no I'm missing part of the the bulb so um I just try to I use a shovel and help to help dig them up well after that um just like other aliums that you want to um maybe store or even if you were going to use them um shortly you need to do some curing and uh it's best if you avoid trying to cure these outside in full sun because a lot of times you can have problems with Suns scold on those so um indoor at a temperature around 75 80\u00b0 Fahrenheit and you can see as a picture they have them in these little netted bags so that they can have some air circulation uh and then well actually after one to two weeks then you cut off the stems and you can then continue to store them this way um and if you do in those kind of situations then they'll be able to go and be stored for one to two weeks if you want longer storage you need to have them at a refrigerated temperature with relatively low um relative humidity and then you can go and and store them um if you're a lot of garlic growers will go and um use their own cloves for next uh for the planting in the fall um and if you're going to do that you have to make sure that you um store those cloves that you're going to use for your seed at around 50\u00b0 fahit with that relatively low um relative humidity if you don't if you go at temperatures less than 5050 that hastens the breaking of dorcy so you're going to end up uh maybe having a longer shoot and it's really going I mean you don't want that shoot really above ground um in the fall so you're trying to plant it so that it gets a start but you don't want it above ground um and it's going to be difficult to do that when if it breaks dorcy early likewise if you go and uh store them at a much warmer temperature greater than 65 that actually will go and delay the sprouting and thus I'm going to also throw things out of whack because you really want to have those come up in the spring because they don't do really well in really hot hot temperatures that what um and so if you have that earlier emerg in the spring they'll get mature and you won't have to worry about that see you on my time okay so um now I'm going to just talk a little bit about some of the cultivar or the cultivar trial that Stephen is doing and so he's looked at these 29 cultivars and you'll see that some of them say 2021 and have the same name and and that's because we're actually TR um using the seed seed I guess the clothes that that we planted in 2021 seeing if there are certain cultivars that do better that um are more adapted to our um environmental conditions that would work better for someone who who is trying to go and use their own seed and continue to use their own seed or maybe sell um garlic and so that's why those say 2021 um as far as then results so this is the the results that Steph Got U from 2023 and he at initially he was looking at uh the number of leaves that are produced because um more Leaf production ction just means there's more photosynthates that go into that bulb so help that bulb um get larger and of course that's what we want and when you look at this this is 30 and 45 uh days after they emerged from the soil and we see here that you know we have a a number of them that are doing well both uh they are producing around six leaves um at 30 days and at 45 days they're right up around N9 days um one in particular went from only producing about five leaves um at 30 days and really shot up the leaf production that was Yukon Ukrainian red um and by um 45 days it was up to nine leaves when we looked at um then 60 and 80 Days after emergence um the order hasn't really changed too much uh there was you know they really didn't go and do a lot of lot more growth except for like Ukrainian red it um did quite well in that um it can you know continued to produce some leaves so that by 60 days it was at um 11 and just a little bit higher at 80 Days in in comparison to a lot of these others that stayed around that Nine area another one that was the Deerfield purple 2021 cloves and it again jumped up from having around nine to right up there to uh 10 10 and a half leaves so there was then a number of the that just you know they after 45 days they really didn't change much in in their Leaf production oops there we go as far as average scape length what we were seeing is that you know um the ones that were producing more Scapes or longer Scapes generally are more adapted to the environmental conditions that we have here in North Dakota um our best was Dakota white but statistically because these other letters also have an A or these other cultivars also have an A associated with them there was no statistical differences in uh the average scape length for those cultivars when we look at average scape weight again we had a few more so um there's a number of those that went and didn't have the longest skape length but they were probably thicker thus they had uh similar weights and you can see uh those seven right there that were um for average scape weight now this um average bulb diameter um again I I should have probably earlier talked about what the scale is here this is in millimeters but really the what I'm trying to get across is you can see how uh the diameter went from these which were all statistically the same having the largest diameter to those that had um were statist statistically the same for having a rather small diameter bulbs and that then when we look at average bulb weight which a lot of times um is is how they're sold uh we see here that we had three of them that had um the that had the heaviest weight um German White had by far the the heaviest weight but Georgian fire and music were statistically the same for weights in opposition to that we we now know that um or pretty sure we'll find out with our second year of data um this year when we Harvest but we have a a pretty good idea that uh um purple white spring chestnut red Yugoslavian Ukrainian red which is kind of unique well um that was 2021 spay Deerfield German red and Italian Lola can canono um really had now most of those had smaller bulbs but they also had very small weight for um for um garlic so in conclusion the average number of leaves um was similar for all these cultivars and until about 60 days after they emerged from the ground and then after that then Ukrainian red really took off and it produced the highest number of leaves however that wasn't associated with um with bulb diameter or bulb weight for that cultivar um when we're talking about Scapes Dakota white and German white produced the longest and heaviest scapes respectively while this Italian Lio Kono uh and white spring did not even produce Scapes when we're talking about um the bulbs then there was numerous cultivars that produced bulbs that had a diameter of approximately 2.4 2 and2 in but only German White had the bulbs that weighed over 2.5 o and so by far was the superior cultivar that we tested and we tried to find every cultivar around um that was available in the US through numerous uh uh Garden Supply cataloges and so um so German white appeared to be the most adapted to the North Dakota environmental conditions well um there was two that um were the least and were would not be worth the time to go and put into your garden okay so now we're going to go and move on to onion basics in a little bit I'm going to probably have to hurry up on this with onions um so Garlic's a perennial and if you didn't go and harvest your garlic it would come up again um and but that would would not go and and behoove you to go and and because it's not ornamental looking at all um a and so uh it also would then that all of those cloves would try to come in that one Bunch which would also defeat the purpose of growing garlic but onions on the other hand they're a banial and so they need two years before they flower which is important to know for for some aspects of why you have flowering um so they also have a these concentric swollen Leaf bases and that the the leaves emerge from the center so the oldest Leaf is here the newest Leaf is going to come from there and bulbing is is determined by the photo period and temperature and that's important because the bulb size and the rate of bulb development depends on the size of that plant when bulbing starts so you have a larger plant when it starts and you have good temperatures um then you'll have um really a good siiz onion bulb that you will harvest so some of um a little bit of information on you know these various veget vegetables that have storage organs and how they respond to photo period so we have some that are classified as day neutral they don't care what you know how long a day is or how short the day is and that's carrots beets turnips and radishes so they're classified as day neutral you plant them and when they get you know as they mature that storage organ will get bigger however onions and garlic are long day and and so they that is triggered by um their flowering or their storage their bulbing is actually triggered by long days there are some exceptions but it's still considered a long day and I'll talk to you a little bit about that um on the other hand we have short day um vegetables potato Poes sweet potatoes yams and cassavas that actually the the tubers um start to form in response to short days so just a little bit of more um information than maybe you wanted to know there are different onion types but I'm thinking I'm going to run out of time and so I'm going to kind of just pass over this um because really um you're going to order what's available in in a uh or what's available in the store or through a catalog and that's already been kind of um they've kind of tested these cultivars for various areas other classifications include um skin color of course you've probably seen that in the store where you can buy Reds whites or yellow um according to the mildness or pungent pungency um the yellows that we are accustomed to Growing for storage are much more pungent and um and usually the ones that do not store well are much more milder in taste um they can be categorized also according to their shapes now here's where you know I said they're a long day for that for the bulbing but within that um they this is so crazy you know they'll still go and say you have short day intermediate day and long days but they're all long days because you can see um the short day ones for bulbing is 12 to 13 hours of day length the intermediate need 13 to 14 hours and the long days need 14 to 16 hours before they start to bulb and you um you know those short and intermediate ones are are really for uh I I'd say probably Kansas on down and and the short ones are texus Florida area Okay sets versus seed you um really sets have higher Vig ger a and in especially in less favorable spring conditions so they're going to take off quicker um they also provide a more consistent sta stand establishment but with that they're you're they're more expensive in comparison to seed if you bought a dozen sets versus 12 seeds it's there's quite a difference there uh another thing about the sets is they're earlier at maturing and they require a shorter growing season because with the sets you generally already have um four to five leaves in that set and so you see this picture here and um the sets you can see are so much further ahead of the seed in North Dakota um commercially we generally uh plant uh just because of the cost of of the sets and um since I don't think anyone's going to be doing this and this is available in the handouts I'm just going to go and and kind of just go over um pass through this but you know Growers that are commercially growing onions they're going to try to plant as early as possible and they do it in these double rows as you can see in the picture because onions they kind of like to be by each other and do much better and they're really wimpy getting out of out of the ground so they need as much help as possible um some will do transplants but to go and get um put through transplants you need to start those 8 to nine weeks in a greenhouse or indoor with adequate lighting um and you have to really um be careful that you don't um have any vernalization occur and that's also true with those sets uh the and I think I I'll go over that in a little bit the sets are next Um this can be costly at one time the Growers uh were the there are some Growers that use actually transplants because you have they're already growing some other vegetables and they have a vegetable transplanter and so this works out quite well this also goes and gets them a a very early Market um because the transplants will be um just as early as sets so they you can get an earlier market and thus um get a better price or they'll do it for those late maturing Spanish types in more of these uh more northern states as far as sets if you're going to um use sets you want to have them be less than a half inch in diameter uh if you happen to go and have a few of those that are larger usually what they're what you can do is just use those for green onions and the reason I'm saying this is because um if they're larger than that/ inch diameter they've been put into a cooler and ship to wherever for these garden centers or box stores to go and sell and if they have if they're larger than that half inch diameter they probably have gone through the juvenile stage and thus can be vernalized to think they should flour so those larger ones are going to probably uh go and flower on you which is something that you don't want with onion so spacing um we kind of talked about that weed control uh in commercial it's um very rigorous onion are just like garlic they're just don't ever canopy so weed control is really really important but you know all the aliums have a very fibrous shallow root system so you you have to really be careful um so if you're pulling weeds you don't allow those weeds to get really really large because you'll if that are growing next to the um onions because that will actually um go and cause some injury and they may just kind of stop their growth for a while uh which know in our short growing season is is important not to have anything that uh slows things down um so watering you can see what that is fertility again just kind of like um The Garlic you want to more spoon feed the nitrogen you don't want to go and give too much up front and you don't want to go too long um with um fertilizing uh the the onion either uh generally you want to stop by July uh in your fertilization because if you go much uh go past you know into August um then you end up with onions that have really thick necks and those tend to be soft when they cure and you end to end up getting a lot of disease problems with that bulb rots because of that large neck that stays soft longer okay so we kind of talked about um bulbing uh and I think I mentioned that um it's controlled in onions um by that long day so location is important I said it was um day length and temperature so this is why um it's really important that we have the right kinds of cultivars those long day ones um anything really above uh Kansas this would be for long day um when we're going through that just because of the daylength and so here's a little uh table that kind of talks about you know how our days get longer and you can see here by um June 7th we have you know we're almost to 16 hours so if we didn't go and plant if we were going to go by seed um and we didn't get that planted until May you know they'd come up and they'd almost by that time be triggered into wanting to bulb and they wouldn't have hardly any they'd have just two leaves um and thus we'd end up with very small diameter onions here's another way of looking at it um so here's our day daylight and then we have uh our Dawn and here's our Dusk and you can see how that changes then when we get for daylight savings time and then in the fall again but you know June 20th then is our longest day H where we have day length from um almost 5:00 in the morning to 10:00 um at night so this is uh why I feel June is just the most fabulous month in the year in North Dakota oops okay getting almost oh I got to hurry so why do my onions flour I think I've talked about this um repeatedly uh and so um I'm going to go on to leaks because I only have a few more three more slides so growing leaks it really they're really pretty easy uh but they need a rather a real long time to to mature um they're rather slow growing and and so um most leaks need 120 to 150 days so you need to start them from seed indoors and then you transplant them early spring you can to go and you really want to to have this stock long and white this one's not really quite there I I mean they didn't have uh they didn't have these buried very long to do that you can either go and throw keep throwing soil up or you can plant them in a furl and then slowly fill in as that plant grows larger and larger um they the water is about the same as onion and garlic uh but they can Toler and actually onion and garlic can tolerate cold too um the problem is is um that you know what you can go what happens here is now different because you have this bulb only in onion and garlic you're you know you harvest end of July first part of August so I mean you can't even get to the cold temperatures there but with leaks because they're tolerant of cold you can actually let them and delay your Harvest or maybe just pick them as you need them um after that first Frost because a lot of times here in North Dakota we'll get that first Frost and then we have a month of really rather nice weather so the fact that they can tolerate that cold you can have fresh leaks for quite some time after that first Frost so start them indoors February March you transplant them when they're 10 to 15 weeks old you don't want to wait too much uh longer than that because then um they'll go through some kind of transplant shock and if you go less than 10 weeks old um they're just going to be so small very difficult to handle before you transplant them you want to acclimate them to the outside so about a week where you have them in kind of a protected area where they aren't just getting wind whipped all over the place but they're starting to adjust to the outdoor breezes more and um a lot more sunlight so acclimate them for about a week and then when we have um average daytime temperature of 45 degrees or above you can go and Transplant them um and I think you know you need you can't because two weeks ago we had above 45 for a few days you just don't go and do that um in North Dakota because all of a sudden we can have a blizzard again and so you know you want to wait until uh 30-year average is above 45\u00b0 for your location planting pretty much the same as uh the others and we fertilize so depending on on the cultivar you can have some shorter ones that are mature when that stem diameter the stem diameter is a half an inch and the larger ones you want to wait until that's about an inch in diameter and then you again I would dig these uh instead of trying to pull because they have quite a root system and I just pulling many times you're just going to pull off that bottom part so um one other thing is try to thoroughly clean before you use because know if you're filling that soil in from that furl you might get some soil down into those leaves and you can eat both the green leaves and this white stem that had turns white because of the soil around it and so with that uh just a little bit over sorry Julie that's great well thank you so much we have a number of questions so I'll quickly go through these um first two questions one's about hard neck and the other's about soft neck so why are hard neck varieties of garlic best in North Dakota um I I think they're they're harder so they you know with that straw covering they just uh do better and then we have a question asking about southern varieties I'll call them Zone Seven are soft neck varieties of garlic better for I guess warmer climates probably um they they actually store a lot longer than hard neck so if you can um see and that also depends so soft neck have more cloves in a bulb than hard necks so if you want you know if you're in zone seven I would think maybe you would go with the Elephant Garlic um also I uh soft neck are a little bit more milder than the hard necks but um but I I don't I've never lived well no I have never lived in zone s so I better not better not go and um talk to somebody who's an extension specialist in zone seven I'd say that's a that's a good answer uh what could you expect if you plant garlic in the spring okay so there are places that planted in the spring but um the fact that it doesn't you're going to have to give it you know they require those chill weeks so you're going to have it in your refrigerator so it accumulates those chills and and then they just never get as big so if you want larger bulbs then plant them in the fall uh couple of questions about Scapes how do you remove the Scapes do you cut them off yes just cut them off and make sure you cut them off before that um you can see the flower it's a little H it's like a candy kiss you want to get it before it gets much bigger and definitely before it opens um to go I could have darn it I should have put a picture of that I could have done that I never thought about that so and then a question about garlic leaves versus Garlic Scapes okay what's the difference um the scape will be round and the leaves are more flattened Hollow flattened leaves um and it will come up through the center and and so um it'll be and then it'll start to form what is that flower head and when that starts to form that's when you can cut it off and you'll just cut it as close to the uh plant as possible to the bottom to of the plant and I I will tell everyone that on our field of fork resources page if you go to garlic we have a garlic from garden to table that was first written by a previous horiculture specialist in me so you can also check that we have a lot of recipes there too um here's another question I want to leave garlic in the ground around my property will it naturalize you know I suppose but it's going to be these little clumps and then if you if you want something like that then go with the garlic chives herbaceous ornamental uh because they they're very naturalized they're an herbaceous ornamental uh and much more set up to I mean they actually have a a really unique pretty humble flower so yeah I would go with ornamental onions or ornamental chives or garlic chives they're have different names like that um common names but they aliums that are herbaceous ornamentals that are much more naturalized for a situation very good um the next person asks why people would want to grow shallots that was the fourth one I couldn't think of thank you for coming up with shallot um and they're they're a m a much more milder um onion and they can be grown uh but we haven't been able to there was only one of the four cultivars that cidra um used that actually had a sizable they're much smaller but you know some recipes just call for shallots because they want that much more milder they don't want that pungency of of the onion uh next question when do you pick winter onions I'm not really too familiar with winter onions and so that's okay we can go on to the next one that's a question for your local horiculture specialist if you're from another state uh if leaks are planted two to six inches apart in a row can you not have the row six inches apart I'm working in raised beds and it's the same true for garlic and onions so the difficulty with a raised bed you know so when with leaks you know you want to you want to have that stock that is white so you keep throwing soil what we did was we made furls and if it's really if you have six inch rows where you going to put that soil for your furls to go and slowly fill it in we had these Mounds on each side of the row that we then slowly filled it in to go and get you know you're hoping to get 68 Ines of of soil covering that so that's the whole part with leaks that would make uh in a raised bed having them so close together is unless you you know didn't care to have that much white and you want it to just have lot more green leaves um if you don't go and put that soil there then you know your Leaf your Leaf base is going to be right close to the you're not going to get much of the bulb part with it but with um onions you know we generally put them about 4 Ines apart because we're trying our aim is a 4 in diameter onion so if you have them closer together then they're going to start to compete and can actually um cause some deformity in the shape of the bulb let alone um probably compete more for nutrients and and water as well so next question what are some common insect pests that will feed on onions in a hom Garden setting well there is the onion maggot that will affect the seed and and that's the biggest I guess insect um that is a problem um otherwise there you know you don't have caterpillars or anything like that chomping on them uh but um yeah the and but there are some Leaf spots and then of course um some bacteria that if you have bruising that can cause problems but you know the biggest problem is you know if you fertilize too much and you get those with onions especially you get those larger necks that stay soft and they don't dry down so fast then you have a various fungi that get in and start causing neck rot problems all right so we'll take two more questions here can you eat onions that have flowered oh yes you can you can eat them um it's just you know that plant when it's flowering it's diverting a lot of those um carbohydrates that it's producing from photosynthesis to that flour so your bulb's going to be smaller and it's not going to store very long so all right so last question we'll take for today uh can you eat garlic chives they're not just ornamental right um so I've never I well I I suppose anything could be edible unless it's poisonous correct you but um garlic chives versus chives now see there's chives which you would eat the the hollow leaves and um and then garlic chives is just the ornamental aliam species um and it got that common name because the leaves are flat like garlic um but it's a different species and it it never hoods cloves it just stays as like a little green onion so um I've never eaten them I've never had the desire but I don't you know I would stick with the the known stuff I'm sure you could eat them but I don't think there's going to be much flavor to them okay well that's all the time we have today thank you so much harlene we really appreciate all your expertise and seeing the latest research that probably isn't even so you were the first all of you to see some of that research so thank you very much and we hope to see you next week I'm your presenter next week so um thank you again for joining us and please fill out the survey that will be in your inboxes in a couple minutes so thank you everyone",
