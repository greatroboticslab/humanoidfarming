00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,859
everybody this is Ross in today's video

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,540
I thought I'd give you guys a bit of a

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,360
seedling update show you guys how

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,269
they're doing what my plans are for

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,530
these seedlings here you can see

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,410
obviously now we've got them in the

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,760
greenhouse and then we'll show you guys

8
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,170
the cold frame because that's where

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,939
they're gonna be going I'm gonna be

10
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,000
planting them actually quite soon you

11
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:27,269
can see that the sugar snappies have

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,240
done exceptionally well I mean look how

13
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:33,809
beautiful they are I had pretty good

14
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:35,700
germination this year and then also you

15
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:36,960
can see over here that I have the the

16
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,440
broccoli and the Brussels sprouts

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,579
they're a bit lankier than I'd like

18
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,770
probably cuz of the lighting that we had

19
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,870
in inside the house when we we

20
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,180
germinated these but I figured because

21
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,629
we're getting you know this greenhouse

22
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,760
off to a head start this year

23
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:57,480
you know we've turned on the heater for

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,699
those of you guys who saw that video we

25
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,340
turned on the small space heater down

26
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,739
here in the greenhouse and that's

27
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,970
heating this we've also we took the the

28
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,480
tarp off the top

29
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:09,370
[Music]

30
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,960
so now we're letting some light come in

31
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:14,110
and you know it's heating up through the

32
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,320
day and it's also staying heated through

33
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:18,850
the night then also the fact that

34
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,610
there's just less stuff in here

35
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:24,820
then the normally is I have you know two

36
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:28,090
pots stacked high of fig trees but

37
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:29,740
normally we have like four or five so

38
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,460
there's almost like even double the

39
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:35,290
amount of trees in here or there's half

40
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:37,720
the amount of trees in here then there

41
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,850
normally is so I figure I have a lot of

42
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,320
room and I can actually do some seating

43
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,450
this year inside the greenhouse and I'm

44
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,420
like wow that's awesome I'm seeing a lot

45
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:49,120
of great benefits out of this obviously

46
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,860
you know it's a lot less work it's a lot

47
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,780
less hassle right and how to deal with

48
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,570
lights and the inside the house a lot to

49
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:58,060
do with making a mess inside the house

50
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:00,490
just obviously much better off doing it

51
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,050
this way I want to show you guys the

52
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,729
cold frame because we did beef it up a

53
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:06,670
lot of you guys had recommend it to me

54
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:08,590
when we showed you guys that video some

55
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,479
improvements and a lot of you were right

56
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,200
I made those improvements and it's

57
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,200
looking great

58
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,290
it's also really hot and really warm in

59
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:19,360
there because the greenhouse is actually

60
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:22,150
warming up pretty nicely but mostly

61
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,100
that's with the help of this heater but

62
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,269
you'd be surprised I think even without

63
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,269
the gear

64
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:31,810
how much during the day this cold frame

65
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:34,480
actually gets heated up and not only

66
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:37,660
that but the the soil is staying really

67
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,570
warm that's really been the key and I'm

68
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:42,250
able to transplant those those snap peas

69
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:45,070
and the broccoli and the brussel sprouts

70
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:47,920
as soon as they fill up those cells and

71
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:49,630
those trays I don't really see a you

72
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,360
know a time limit on all this I think

73
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,880
this thing's pretty much ready to go to

74
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,440
be planted into and you can see one of

75
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,170
the recommendations that some of you

76
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,720
guys had made was these kind of support

77
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,850
the the cold frame in the middle because

78
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,700
a lot of the water if it snows or if it

79
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,580
rains is gonna collect on top of this

80
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:12,690
and the plastic is gonna collapse and

81
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,160
actually believe it or not it did that I

82
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:17,110
think it was Rocco that recommended that

83
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,850
and one other person but it actually did

84
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,040
that literally the day after

85
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,560
and I was sick I couldn't come out here

86
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,640
and observe the thing and take care of

87
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,590
it

88
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,020
but you guys were right so I beefed it

89
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:32,170
up a bit hopefully that's enough I also

90
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:34,480
added some like support in the back here

91
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:38,020
to help lift the the plastic to give it

92
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,520
more of an angle and then I also want to

93
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:49,360
show you guys the insight here something

94
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:52,470
bare with me while I open this up we

95
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,400
also made an improvement on the inside

96
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:56,320
based off of another recommendation

97
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,260
which is obviously brilliant and

98
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,840
obviously how it should be but you can

99
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,430
see we've sort of wrapped the plastic

100
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,520
from the outside brought it on the

101
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,390
inside and then stapled it to the inside

102
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,940
of the frame

103
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:13,030
with a staple gun and then someone

104
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,610
recommended just get some trim and drill

105
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,790
the trim pressure-treated trim to the

106
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,230
plastic to give it some extra protection

107
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,440
that way this plastic isn't really

108
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:25,690
coming off the frame here or at least

109
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,420
it's quite difficult for it to come off

110
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:30,250
but you can obviously see I mean I've

111
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:33,310
been noticing quite a big difference in

112
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:36,310
just the last few days that I've had

113
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:37,690
this this cold frame altogether these

114
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,980
plants are really starting to take off

115
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:43,060
and it's really all in the soil

116
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:45,370
temperatures I put my hand in here touch

117
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,310
the ground even just a you know touching

118
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:51,490
it with my hand the difference is quite

119
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,810
extreme I have to get a thermometer to

120
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:56,410
know for sure but I would say it's a

121
00:04:52,810 --> 00:05:00,130
good 10 to 15 degree difference and just

122
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:01,900
soil temperatures alone so I'm pretty

123
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,250
excited you know that's that's really

124
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,910
what's gonna happen here is that we've

125
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,980
got the seedlings in there you know

126
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,630
everything that I want to start this

127
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,400
year in this cold frame is gonna get

128
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:16,360
started it's off to a good start I'm

129
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,750
pretty happy about that it's also sort

130
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,120
of got me thinking about potentially

131
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,620
what else can I do in this greenhouse

132
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,500
I'm thinking about doing some citrus

133
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:28,120
trees bringing them from you know inside

134
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,000
the house putting them in the greenhouse

135
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,529
or even next year I can get myself a

136
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,069
couple loquats

137
00:05:32,529 --> 00:05:39,129
I can get myself maybe a few more

138
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:42,129
tropical trees guys and really strongly

139
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:44,229
consider trying that again like the

140
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:47,289
citrus but even more tropical than that

141
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:48,879
and then having them fruit for me you

142
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:51,579
know earlier in the year is really the

143
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:54,249
goal things like the citrus can fruit

144
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:55,809
for me throughout the winter or even in

145
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:58,449
the spring and the very early spring

146
00:05:55,809 --> 00:06:00,879
maybe even the loquat the loquats can do

147
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:03,069
that as well so I'd be interested to see

148
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:05,019
if I can do that in the house for most

149
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:07,569
of the winter and then bring them out

150
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:10,659
when I take the cover off the greenhouse

151
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:12,969
put the heater on I think it'd be a fun

152
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:14,739
and interesting experiment and I'm sure

153
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:16,419
we'd have pretty decent success so I

154
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:18,519
want to thank you guys here for watching
