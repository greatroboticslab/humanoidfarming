  "text": "To successfully compete in a growing market, dairy farms are focused on production efficiency, a significant goal of which is digital technology. One farm that has successfully implemented digital technology is located in the Almaty region of southern Kazakhstan and has been operating since 2002. Digitalization arrived here only 11 years after its launch. Humans are not needed there. The operator only enters to ensure that the cow enters, and the rest is done by a robot. The milking process itself is handled by a robot. The total number of  head of milk is 2,020, of which 600 are dairy cows. The farm produces 20 tons of milk per day, or about 33 liters per cow. To service such a herd in the old-fashioned way, a large staff would be required: technicians, veterinarians, milkmaids, and cleaners. Today, the main work is done by equipment. The cow on the farm is surrounded by automated systems: water is supplied in an automatic drinker, manure is removed by a scraper unit, and combs are activated by touch. In addition, the animal is constantly under constant computer surveillance. The cows have collars on their legs and motion sensors that simplify the work.  The work of veterinarians turns out to be such a reason: we learn that a cow is walking, and the assemblator looks at the computer and can find out that the cow is walking and can be inseminated. All data on each animal in the herd is collected and analyzed in the herd management program. The company's management has already felt the benefits of introducing digital technologies: saving time and money. This can be seen in the example of feeding. When a cow approaches the robot,  separate feed is given to her, and it turns out that for each cow this is individual. For example, if this person were to give, he would not know. For example, how much feed to give this cow, since he does not know how much she is milking at the moment, and it turns out that the robot completely calculates this and gives her what she gives milk for, that is what they give her feed for. It turns out that if, for example, a cow is given 45-50 liters, yes, the amount of this feed should be two kilograms, if a little less, it turns out to be one and a half kilograms, thereby we benefit from not wasting feed just like that [music] on the opposite side of Kazakhstan in the northern Kazakhstan region since 2019, similar technologies have been introduced  Another dairy farm before approaching We traveled from Kazakhstan [music] We decided to build a modern automated garden management system on a dairy farm in many ways similar to another example, it also tracks all the herd indicators and controls, in particular, feeding, women make up almost half of the farm workers play an important role in managing the system and programs. This is all the information after feeding, it is transmitted via Wi-Fi to the main computer here I can already look at the reports, say for today or for yesterday, the data for each animal is stored in digital form, specialists know how much milk each cow produces and what she eats, this information is especially useful when making a decision about the fall, we have such a report on nesterus, these are the cows that have not been inseminated, although they should have already been inseminated, there are, let's say, those cows that have calved, she is already 74 days old, she should have been inseminated a long time ago, but she has not yet come into heat, that is, she either needs to be put on treatment or she needs to be looked at [music] at this dairy commodity company, they also appreciated the economic advantages of digital technologies, which are expressed in  There are no savings in staff time, consumables, wages, expenses, family expenses for effective insemination, that's more and more, there are fewer overruns in our herd, and this accordingly affects the lactation period, the lactation period, and accordingly, the economy as a whole, and so on, for dairy farmers to achieve success in today's world. That is why successful dairy farmers closely monitor the emergence of [music] [applause]",
