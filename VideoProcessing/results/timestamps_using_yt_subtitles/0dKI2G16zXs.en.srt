1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,120
ceilings have the tendency to be rather

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,359
boring

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,040
with lamps being the sole feature to

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,679
break the white monotony

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,679
let's change that how to jungle up your

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,449
ceiling

7
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:21,449
[Music]

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,119
to create such a green ceiling we

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,480
obviously

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:31,599
need a plant first epipremnum aureom

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,520
is truly the basic [ __ ] houseplant

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,079
originating from the french polynesia

13
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,800
region it is now found in many tropical

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,360
regions

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,320
and as a common houseplant around the

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,120
globe

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,719
in germany it is commonly referred to as

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,200
ifoytute

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,160
in the anglo-sphere it is listed under a

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,399
ton of names

21
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,520
with devil's ivy being my personal

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,520
favorite

23
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,280
in russian-speaking regions it goes by

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,480
its former scientific name

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,840
the latisti patos whilst in japan it is

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,640
simply referred to as

27
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,720
potosu devil's ivy belongs to the

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,280
arakaye family of plants

29
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,840
a family in part characterized by its

30
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,360
ability

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,080
to spawn flowers though thanks to a dna

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,880
defect

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,119
it is the sole member of its family that

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,720
doesn't actually goddamn flower

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,759
making it a basic [ __ ] houseplant or

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,520
shy flowering in scientific lingo the

37
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,680
only thing you should care about though

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,200
is that thanks in part to the plant's

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,799
excellent energy management

40
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,320
it is essentially immortal it thrives

41
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,479
both in direct sunlight

42
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,320
as well as dark corners and has a

43
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,079
straightforward water need

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,479
you actually have to try to kill it

45
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,439
so how do we even mount plants to the

46
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,000
ceiling

47
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,600
decorative vines meant for exteriors

48
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,240
like the boston ivy

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,119
mount themselves by a sticky fade for

50
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,439
the interior

51
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,200
this is a big no-no as that would leave

52
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,680
marks upon removal

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,079
so we will use a plant for vines without

54
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,479
the ability to stick or climb

55
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,960
wikipedia describes devil's ivy as

56
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,599
having the ability to climb via roots

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,120
which adhere to surfaces this is rather

58
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,440
imprecise wording

59
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,120
devil's ivy attempts to spawn a root

60
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,680
roughly once a centimeter

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,440
in between spawning leaves if the root

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,920
touches a moist surface

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,080
it will attempt to bore itself into it

64
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,239
yes indeed you heard right

65
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,239
moist if it's dry it's a no-go

66
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,319
so if you buy the plant with a coconut

67
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,720
fiber stem to glide onto it

68
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,800
it won't work unless you water the stem

69
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,239
itself as well there is a reason it's

70
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,200
made out of absorbent material like

71
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,800
coconut fiber

72
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,800
so guess what a photographer does on the

73
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,959
move to make an advertisement shot

74
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,800
he uses metal clips or similar for the

75
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,800
plants to hold onto the stem

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,400
jesus christ way to miss the point of

77
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,810
the whole goddamn plant

78
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:59,200
but i digress

79
00:02:52,810 --> 00:03:01,040
[Music]

80
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,159
if the spawning roots do not feel any

81
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,480
moisture they instantly stop growing so

82
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,000
devil's ivy will never attempt to cling

83
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,599
to a wall or ceiling

84
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,200
not that the roots could even do such a

85
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,159
thing on a hard surface

86
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,879
instead we will put the vines on a grit

87
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,920
or pattern

88
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,599
created by fishing line fishing line is

89
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,319
essentially invisible against the white

90
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,239
ceiling

91
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,519
and gives the appearance of floating

92
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,680
vines

93
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,640
bore and pack holes in uniform distance

94
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,879
from one another

95
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,799
around the room screw in hooks to the

96
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,440
pegs and stick to hooks

97
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,519
not eye screws because hooks allow you

98
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,680
to place part of the vine in it

99
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,040
using the hooks and fishing line create

100
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,680
a grit or a pattern

101
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,080
to lane the vines on top of i went with

102
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,879
a diamond pattern using a total of 12

103
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,799
hooks

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,440
it really doesn't matter what pattern

105
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,720
you choose as long as the empty space

106
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,200
between the fishing line

107
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,400
does not exceed one and a half meters so

108
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,319
a vine will actually

109
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,519
reach from line to line in a reasonable

110
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,080
time and

111
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,840
so that it won't sag from its own weight

112
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,879
you have to tighten the fishing line

113
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,239
by a lot to prevent sagging even if you

114
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,040
do it with a lot of force

115
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,720
there will always be sag no matter what

116
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,799
so make sure to mount the hooks

117
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,720
as high as possible to prevent the

118
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,239
plants from falling below the level of

119
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,079
your ceiling mounted lamp

120
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,440
which would cause your room to get a lot

121
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,680
darker

122
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,639
speaking of which make sure your fishing

123
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,680
line pattern

124
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,240
actually leaves the lamp area empty by

125
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,040
the way

126
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,199
it doesn't have to be fishing line go

127
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,240
with a rope made of coconut fiber or

128
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:36,400
similar for a more pronounced effect

129
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,639
if the plant is happy it takes six to

130
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,919
eight months for one vine to grow from

131
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,919
sealing to the floor

132
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,680
depending on the pot size and how much

133
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,759
water and nutrients it gets

134
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,000
there will be at least a couple vines

135
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,840
growing at that speed per pot

136
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,080
with new vines being spawned here and

137
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,120
there once the vines start interfering

138
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,199
with your daily life

139
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,720
and reach the floor it's time for the

140
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,280
bi-early cleanup

141
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,560
though i must admit it is kind of funny

142
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:11,840
having to swat away

143
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:11,840
vines from the monitor every week

144
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,360
at this point the biggest vines are

145
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,039
taken back to the ceiling

146
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,800
where they are spread evenly throughout

147
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,280
the grid after this

148
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,479
your ceiling greenery just got a great

149
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,919
deal dancer

150
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,320
the leaves are attached rather

151
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,000
delicately so be careful not to snag

152
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,720
leaves on the fishing line and tear them

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,880
off

154
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,360
no matter how careful you are though

155
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,400
this will always happen

156
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,880
but do not throw fallen leaves away

157
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,400
put them into a shot glass and change

158
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,560
the water once a week

159
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,680
oh damn it of course i broke too more

160
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,240
after filming this

161
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,720
off into the shot glass you go a leaf

162
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,240
has roughly a 50 50 chance to spawn a

163
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,240
root within two weeks

164
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,880
once the root is roughly a centimeter in

165
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:59,440
size transfer the leaf into a pot

166
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,600
once in the pot it has again a 50 50

167
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,479
chance to spawn a new vine within two

168
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,080
weeks

169
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,240
once this happened the plant will

170
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,840
continue to grow into a fully matured

171
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,680
vine network

172
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,960
this one took six months to get from

173
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,680
broken baby leaflet

174
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,160
to small sized wine once it's at that

175
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,400
size

176
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:21,280
it is ready to join my jungle harem

177
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,520
just look at those greedy roots devil's

178
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,759
ivy has an incredible appetite

179
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:34,000
so when choosing a pot always go bigger

180
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:36,400
than what you think you'll need

181
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,319
so how do you even care for the plant

182
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,800
when buying soil from a garden supply

183
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,440
store

184
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,360
it usually comes pre-fertilized on that

185
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,840
front you should be in the clear for at

186
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,800
least

187
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,600
two years otherwise look up any guide on

188
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,759
diy

189
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,960
potting soil more important is how you

190
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,639
deal with water

191
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,639
smaller pots need to be watered more

192
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,319
frequently whilst a bigger part gets

193
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,960
away with getting a larger amount of

194
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,000
water

195
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,560
at longer intervals all that biomass is

196
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,479
thirsty indeed i dump three quarters of

197
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,479
a liter per pot once a week

198
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,400
though to be honest you can't actually

199
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,560
over water devil's ivy

200
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,639
you heard me right the more the merrier

201
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,599
dump a whole water bomber into it if you

202
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,720
feel like it

203
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,199
as long as you have

204
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,039
proper drainage and the soil has the

205
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,160
chance to dry at least once a week

206
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,160
the pots have to drain properly and i

207
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,560
cannot overstate this

208
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,440
as long as excess water properly drains

209
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,720
out of the pot

210
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,120
you cannot over water devil's ivy if the

211
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,280
water does not properly drain however

212
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,240
best case scenario you'll get invisible

213
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,639
rod setting in

214
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,840
with a significantly weaker plant what's

215
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,520
more likely though

216
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,039
is that your pot will turn into a

217
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,120
massive insect grave

218
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,039
and if you are really lucky and really

219
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,960
hit the jackpot straight up mold

220
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,240
at which point you best just dump the

221
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,720
whole thing all together

222
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,240
to ensure proper drainage drill way more

223
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,280
holes into the parts than you think

224
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,919
you'll need

225
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,560
especially bigger pots often only have a

226
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,879
single

227
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,680
big hole in the middle this is not

228
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,400
enough

229
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,520
go ham and drill more than you think

230
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,840
you'll need

231
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,800
next off fill the bottom fifth of the

232
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,800
pot with coarse rocks or large gravel

233
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,160
this will ensure that compacted soil

234
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,080
does not clog the holes

235
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,199
which the water is supposed to drain out

236
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,400
of and

237
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,440
lastly actually test it sometimes it is

238
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,840
not obvious

239
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,879
and water decides to just stay in the

240
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,199
pot anyways

241
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,199
sometimes due to a flat tray which

242
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,200
creates a seal against the pot

243
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,240
here i dumped more water than usual into

244
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,320
the pot and it

245
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,240
instantly starts filling up the tray

246
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,240
this is how it's supposed to work

247
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,599
on the note of trays they never look

248
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,720
particularly great

249
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:47,200
but in this case they are a must

250
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,000
of course ceramic on the parts look

251
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,080
great

252
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,240
but once you have enough biomass or a

253
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,000
bigger pot you will not be able to

254
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,480
separate the outer part from the

255
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,680
inner part and water staying in the

256
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,120
outer part is not

257
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,040
any better than a straight up clog also

258
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,800
make sure that the tray can actually

259
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,720
hold some damn water

260
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,800
i know it doesn't look very appealing

261
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,519
having trace way bigger than the actual

262
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,279
part

263
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,920
but trays like these are just useless

264
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,240
oh they look great size matched and all

265
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,880
but cannot hold any reasonable amount of

266
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,680
water

267
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,120
also if you cannot move the pot which if

268
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,000
the pot is big enough you

269
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,399
won't be able to believe me you have to

270
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,720
remove excess water with fabric

271
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,240
so make sure that you can actually get

272
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,880
cloth into the tray

273
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,000
in the first place so again as long as

274
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,480
the potter drains

275
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,680
and the soil dries at least once a week

276
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,480
you're golden

277
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,640
go ham with water the more the merrier

278
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,839
while stella's ivy can overcome longer

279
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,640
periods of drought

280
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,000
as with many tropical plants ideally the

281
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,240
soil should always be

282
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,760
moist but since we are confined to a

283
00:09:52,240 --> 00:10:05,839
part in the interior

284
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:05,839
it has to dry at least once a week

285
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:12,560
[Music]

286
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,680
so now everything's going great and your

287
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,800
vines are growing

288
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,200
but oh dear suddenly the plant has

289
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,079
yellow leaves that go dry and fall out

290
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,720
don't worry

291
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,640
this is expected behavior and part of

292
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,959
the plant's energy management

293
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,959
a mature vine network will start

294
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,200
rejecting undesirable leaves

295
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,000
in favor of supplying new and younger

296
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,240
vines

297
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,480
even when the network has more than

298
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,480
ample supply for itself

299
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,600
look at this singular vine here the

300
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,600
leaves are healthy

301
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,880
whilst in the darker corner only half a

302
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,040
meter to the left

303
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,200
all leaves have dropped as the network

304
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,120
considered them to be undesirable

305
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,240
and yet again half a meter along the

306
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,959
vine a new

307
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,120
younger branch is growing this is normal

308
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,000
and a way for the vine to reclaim

309
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,800
energy spent once a leaf has started to

310
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,720
turn yellow

311
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,480
there is nothing you can do as it is

312
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,120
chemically marked for death

313
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,680
but don't remove yellow leaves the

314
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,399
leaves

315
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,839
don't actually straight up die just like

316
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,640
with hardwoods in autumn

317
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,279
the leaf turns chloroplasts in its cells

318
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,040
into chromoplasts to convert and siphon

319
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,920
energy upstream

320
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,880
as long as the leaf remains yellow it is

321
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,959
still a benefit to the plant as a whole

322
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,399
only once it is dried up should you

323
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,240
remove it

324
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,000
this behavior is not limited to leaves

325
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,480
by the way at some point

326
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,839
even whole branches get rejected though

327
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,680
this happens rarely

328
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,200
once branches are dried up you can

329
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,440
actually use them to support the grid

330
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,680
with new paths just like fishing line

331
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,640
if a singular vine has lost all of its

332
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,800
leaves but

333
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,760
not dried up yet do not remove them

334
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,600
either

335
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,519
naked branches are still used to

336
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,920
transport water and nutrients

337
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,800
just like with a hedge the inner part of

338
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,440
a hatch has

339
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,560
no leaves but it's still part of the

340
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,200
living plant

341
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,000
in a healthy plant the ratio of dying

342
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,639
biomass

343
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,079
should always be only a fraction of what

344
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,160
the network is growing

345
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,079
as long as a lot more biomass is

346
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,240
produced than is being reclaimed

347
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,480
you're golden this aggressive energy

348
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,639
management is also why devil's ivy can

349
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,639
go long stretches without water

350
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,279
during drought the plant will start to

351
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,839
reclaim more and more of its own biomass

352
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,079
to keep

353
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,440
pumping out new and younger branches in

354
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,519
search for water

355
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,040
two months without water will claim a

356
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,360
big chunk of the biomass

357
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,120
but resuming normal water supply should

358
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,200
have you reach the same levels of

359
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,079
biomass within half a year

360
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,560
this is in part why it's really hard to

361
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,880
actually

362
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,200
kill devil's ivy it's okay with little

363
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,519
water as well as lots of it

364
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,800
though if leaves do not turn yellow

365
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,760
before dying

366
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,240
something is definitely up like here the

367
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:53,120
green leaves turn straight up black

368
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,279
which means rot has sat in in this case

369
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,839
though this is traced back to simple

370
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,600
physical damage of the vine if you are

371
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,800
patient enough you can grow out the

372
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,040
vines from the floor

373
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,880
to the ceiling but ideally you should

374
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,800
place them high already

375
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,920
i used a bit of wood to create these

376
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,160
corner shelves

377
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,720
which were secured with overkill sized

378
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,040
pegs and screws for safety

379
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,639
since i actually sleep under a part and

380
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,560
don't want to end up like a watermelon

381
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,399
in those safety demonstrations

382
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,320
all is said and done how long will this

383
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,399
take you to get all that biomass

384
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,839
with a pot in each corner of the room

385
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,760
and under healthy conditions

386
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,440
the plant should produce enough biomass

387
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,000
to sparsely cover the ceiling

388
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,000
within two years the plant in my room

389
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,639
was actually gifted to her family as a

390
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,639
singular vine some 15 years ago though

391
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,880
my room doesn't actually even closely

392
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,880
represent 15 years worth of biomass

393
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,880
the wine network has been split multiple

394
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,360
times across multiple pots over the

395
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,279
years

396
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,199
then neglected for half a decade and

397
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,360
then survived being relocated

398
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,560
three separate times whilst losing

399
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,639
branches each time

400
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,160
it was moved in that sense you don't

401
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,839
even need to buy the plant

402
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,000
as getting a couple of leaves from a

403
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:03,839
donut plant already puts you on the path

404
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,839
to jungle them

405
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:13,360
[Music]

406
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,560
the original vine network still resides

407
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,720
within the spot

408
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,920
the oldest vine thought to be the

409
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,120
original gifted one

410
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,560
is nicknamed mother vine and is traced

411
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,040
out in red here

412
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,160
it's easily over 20 meters by now the

413
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,000
last time i moved

414
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,920
everything had to be carried by four

415
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,959
people so the vines wouldn't take too

416
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,279
much damage

417
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,120
as a last remark it is often stated that

418
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,040
when exposed to direct sunlight the

419
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,680
leaves get more of that white marble

420
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,480
pattern

421
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,040
this is only true to some extent these

422
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,720
leaves

423
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,639
in direct sunlight are definitely

424
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,560
brighter than the deep green coloring of

425
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,399
the leaves in the dark corners

426
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,920
this is also evident with the new

427
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,000
addition i just planted

428
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,240
this smaller vine walls in direct

429
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,040
sunlight since it was a broken baby

430
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,920
leaflet

431
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,320
however the degree of marble coloring

432
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,360
mostly depends on the color variation of

433
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,000
the plant

434
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,680
for instance this other devil's ivy

435
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,079
straight up has the marble pattern

436
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,959
everywhere even in the darkest corner of

437
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:11,360
the room

438
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,079
so if you're buying devil's ivy what you

439
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,000
see is

440
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,210
basically what you get even if

441
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:23,120
literature claims otherwise

442
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:25,600
[Music]

443
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,480
that's more than you would possibly ever

444
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,759
need to know

445
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:41,839
about my favorite basic [ __ ] houseplant

446
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:41,839
devil's ivy make papa proud will you

447
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:52,850
[Applause]

448
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,839
[Music]

449
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
wow
