  "text": "Well, good morning everyone and thank you uh for allowing me to be here today. Uh I'm going to talk to you a little bit about the five soil health principles. Um my name is Daryl Oswald and I manage the Berley County Soil Conservation District. I've been with the district for 25 plus years. Uh I am also a farmer and a rancher from northeast Berley County, a fourth generation rancher. Uh and uh near wing uh up there in the northeast corner and and uh this particular slide is to lead off as a picture of the Manoken farm. Uh some of you or maybe all of you are familiar uh with the uh Manoken farm. Uh it's our conservation demonstration farm owned owned and operated by the Berley County Soil Conservation District. Going to lead off uh of course we've talked about these a little bit in the past and and in our egg production model in general and and mine included on our farm and ranch uh which I'm going to relate to most today. We have to have some we have to identify our ecological or our excuse me our agricultural resource concerns and really these are symptoms of landscape simplification and you know leading off of course we have the wind and water erosion. Uh we still have that across uh North Dakota quite readily. Of course, uh we see it uh in Berley County and and every county across the state. Uh the salinity thing is really coming to to roost for us and and that's become troublesome. Uh our lack of plant diversity and cover. Uh we've really simplified the landscape and the crop rotations. We've taken a lot of livestock off the land and of course our animal in impact. Um and we can have a drought and a flood in the same year which tells me uh as a farmer and a rancher uh if I correlate that to Oswald Ranch it tells me that I don't have any resiliency in the system. And of course uh with that uh we had uh Lindsay talk about carbon and of course carbon drives the cycle or the system and of course exporting carbon off your farm and ranch. Uh again agriculture is an extraction business. That's going to happen. But we have to understand that we have to put more carbon back into the system than we take out. and that can lead to carbon deficient soils. This is a page out of the nature and properties of soils um that I use quite readily and again correlating back to my own farm and ranch. You look at the factors promoting the gains and and losses of organic matter in soils uh which helps drive the system. And of course the gains is when the soil health principles if you look down that list I won't read them all but uh as you look down that list you see that the principles that we're going to talk about uh really pertain to the factors promoting the gains and really have very little to do with any uh of the factors promoting the losses. And um the soil health principles again uh I won't read them off to you but you can see this slide has been around the world and back many times and it correlates to soil health and the soil health principles are universal. uh we were having a discussion here with the group uh this morning but you need to scope them to your particular farm and ranch and to your particular situation. The principles work on any scale large or small. [Music] Uh currently at the Manoken farm, uh our urban gardening and our outdoor gardening and our high tunnel gardening all employ the soil health principles and again working on a very large scale uh excuse me small scale and so they are very uh universal in that regard. We always lead off with the or at least I do I always lead off with armoring the soil uh as the number one principle. Uh I believe that again you can't really get the system going. You can't move it forward until you start protecting the soil. Uh this particular photo is off of Oswald Ranch. Uh, this is a cover crop that we did graze and I can assure you that armoring the soil doesn't look like that all the time at the ranch, but I thought it was pretty vindictive or uh in in a good indicator of where we like to be on our ranch when it comes to armoring the soil. And again, uh, this happens to be crop residue. And that's one way that you can achieve armor. And of course the other way would be by growing plants. U most of the carbon in this dead litter goes into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and of course uh the green plants gives us an inlet for carbon going into the soil. And uh again armor uh is very very important and uh is generally in my world is always led off as the first principle. Uh here I've shown an example again armor on our uh farm and ranch pertains a lot to how we graze. Uh we do we do do some farmland or crop land or some annual cropping. Uh but we do uh way more grazing. And this particular photo I think uh shows the armor on the native uh graze native range that we like to try to achieve and we're out there. Uh one of my mentors uh Jean Govin from Turtle Lake uh used to say that his goal was to capture every raindrop where it falls and uh we've kind of taken the same mantra but Oswald Ranch and we feel that this is the way that we can do this and again we're reducing our evaporation rates uh our soil temperatures uh we built more resiliency in the system uh during the drier periods because of the armor that we have on and uh we can reduce this the temperature. We're not uh evaporating the water uh per se and as Carlos stated this is generally a very very good provide great habitat for the soil food web and uh we think it's very important. So this is how we employ armor uh on our operation minimizing soil disturbance. Uh again I put an emphasis on physical disturbance because that is the thing that we generally relate the most to. Uh we do have to work I I believe uh across uh our production model in eliminating physical disturbance as much as we can. We know that tillage removes pore spaces and and uh slowly compresses the soil much like if we were building the road. Uh we talk about water infiltration and air movement and of course tillillage restricts all of that. And then of course it takes off any of the soil armor uh that we did have in our previous uh and first soil health principle. And I think someone said too that when we till or disturb we release a burst of carbon dioxide resulting in carbon loss. And of course we want to more carbon coming into the system than going out. Uh physical con disturbance can also or excuse me uh soil disturbance can also be related to I think uh too much uh chemical use uh pesticide use uh that scenario as well uh too much overg grazing I think that we uh we when we see seasonl long grazing uh we see soil disturbance in some places and not at others And so this the soil disturbance is important in again keeping the area intact for the soil food web and uh making the soil pore spaces stay intact. Continually growing uh living plants in the soil. Uh this gets stated many times but it can't be reiterated enough. Our soils were built with perennials with a huge root mass and of course we farm or in our current production model we tend to farm with annuals with a smaller root mass and uh that leads to some issues that we need to think about. uh a green plant uh continually growing is beneficial because again nature is a constant feed process. Uh agriculture is a extraction business. we're extracting something and we need to be thinking in terms of putting something back and of course a continual growing live plant in the soil does that and uh and continually uh builds soil aggregates and I'll show you a a slide coming up that pertains a little bit to that and of course uh talking today this is a cover crop summit and we know that cover crops can fill in what otherwise would be a period where nothing is growing and again gives us an opportunity to continue bringing carbon into the soil. This is a full season cool season cover crop uh that we raised at Oswalt uh that we planted and raised up at the ranch. Uh it's we we do different mixes uh periodically and u we do switch to full season cool season mixes uh at times and we find that uh they work very well during the middle of the grazing season uh right before our breeding season which tends to be a little bit later than than most operations. Uh but still the the philosophy is of course that we can have a high energy high nutrient uh mix in place where we can graze in late July, early August. And uh then of course we'll we'll we'll graze that by managing it much the way we do all of our perennials and our native and our tame grass. and and we're actually sometimes we're fortunate enough to actually get another grazing on it later in October or October and November uh if the season allows us to do that. But uh soil carbon again uh most cropping systems and most rotations cannot you cannot increase soil carbon without the use of cover crops. And we've seen that on our farm and ranch. And uh again when you think about these cool season cover crops uh the below ground carbon allocation is generally maximized during that first 4 to 8 weeks. And so a huge amount of biomass uh is not always required to be highly effective in building soil aggregates and and uh increasing carbon. And uh I I've got some slides too. Here's an example of a huge amount of biomass that we all like to see. Again, this is another full season warm season cover crop uh on the Oswald Ranch. Again, when I differentiate between cool seasons and warm seasons, uh the species listed in there, some of them are ve uh similar. Uh most of them are not in the fact that again when you look at the uh contents of this mix. Uh this contains a lot of warm season uh uh species and this uh particular mix generally is seated on our place from the very oh the last week in May until the middle of June. And our cool season uh mixes we try to get in uh you know midappril to you know maybe that first week in June. And so we're we're achieving different things. Uh again, you can see the large biomass. It's fun to hide in. Uh this is particular pictures of just my two daughters uh playing in the cover crop uh a while back. And again, diversity is the key. I think uh cover crops are all good, even the simple ones, but I the more diversity that we can get in there, I think that more the uh microbes and the soil food web, more of the soil food web we can feed because again, when we manage holistically or have that thought process, we're trying to mimic nature. And when you look back at the uh native population or the native grasses, uh there was a huge huge amount of diversity and that's what we're trying to do with each of these cover crops. Continually growing plants in the high tunnel. Uh I'm think Jay will t touch on this a little bit, but I wanted to show that uh again cover crops or continually growing plants in the high tunnel is important too. Uh not just uh during the garden season, but uh building soils in the high tunnel as long as possible and keeping a a green growing uh plant intact. uh plant diversity. I touched on this a little bit uh can be accomplished by growing all four crop types and I think we we miss that some of the time with your warm and cool season grasses and your warm and season warm and cool season broad leaves. uh most is most effective to have a rotation heavier in highcarbon plants uh crops such as wheat or corn, not low carbon crops like soybeans. uh some of the diversity issues that we deal with now are our corn and bean rotations and I think that there's some opportunity and we've shown that at the Manoken Farm and with some individual producers across the landscape in North Dakota that we can add more diversity into that rotation especially in with the soybean realm and I think that that's important and that kind of takes away that angst, if you will, of soybeans being a lowcarbon uh crop. Uh we know this that highcarbon plants build soils uh because again to reiterate this, it brings additional carbon into the soil profile and builds the resiliency that we want in our system. And the amount and quality of carbon from crop residue contributes to the amount of soil carbon. And it goes back to our individual uh beginning slides there with armor and uh having a green growing plant as much as possible and minimizing your disturbance. Again to reiterate the soil health principles are meant to be used in a system with a systems approach and and I think that that's important to remember. Uh every green plant is a carbon inlet. Again, we've harped on this quite a bit. Uh the most potent tool with which to build a healthy soil is a live plant. And uh I think Lindsay again said this that photosynthesis is the primary process that feeds the soil. And so when I look at myself as a manager of owner of Oswald Ranch, essentially I manage plants with photosynthesis and sunlight and and so uh and then of course I become a micro manager. Uh more importantly than actually the cattle that I raise and the crops I raise, I deal with photosynthesis and and managing microbes. And uh we know that a cropping system that creates these favorable habitats and the one that will capture the most energy from the sun will resto uh excuse me will restore soil health the quickest. And we often get this question a lot regarding the soil health principles. Uh you know how quickly can we turn things around? And my answer to them of course is always how much are you willing to how many principles are you willing to utilize? How many and how will you be managing the principles? Because again, they are universal, but they are very unique and must be adapted to your scenario. And that doesn't matter if you're a farmer, a rancher, a uh demonstration farm, a research farm, or any of that. They all have to be adapted uh to this to that situation. Uh finally, livestock integration, which is uh really uh one of my favorites or my favorite of course near and dear because of the livestock aspect and and the ranching heritage uh that we have. And again, we know that animals and the plants and the soils have been uh together since the beginning of time or forever. And of course uh livestock integration is important to balance those carbon to nitrogen ratios uh converting your highcarbon uh crops if you will into the lowcarbon organic material and livestock create the opportunity for even more soil carbon. Uh this particular photo is a actually out at the Manokan farm and we're grazing uh one of our f full season cover crops. But the simplification of the landscape and and the the taking away of the livestock I think uh is vitally important. How do we know if soil health is improving? Again, I won't list all those things there, but you can read them. And that's how we look at things on our farm and ranch. That's how we look at things at the Manoken farm. Uh are we increasing uh stability? Are we infiltrating water? Uh decades ago, growing up, uh our water cycle on our ranch, I believe, was severely impaired or broken. uh and of course I've worked to try to uh fix that and of course uh or organic matter increases are we seeing crop response uh are we reducing inputs and are we seeing an up upward trend this is a a simple version of a manoken farm from 2009 to 2020 on soil organic matter uh if you you know there's many things that help drive the system, but soil organic matter seems to be a popular one. And if you look across the graph again, you'll see that field six has the highest organic matter over time. And we see this is the one field that had the most crop diversity, uh, the most used of cover crops and most livestock integration. So that does answer your question, how quickly or it can be a a piece of the question or the answer to the question uh how quickly can we we change some things around and uh and we know that when we implement those principles of diversity uh and use the cover crops and livestock integration, we tend to see an upward trend in uh what in the positive soil attributes This is a soil organic matter on Oswald Ranch from 2023. Um, this was this particular field was a full season cover crop field that I've been experimenting with and I actually had a annual crop uh in there in 2024. Uh, you can see that there is some positive things that are occurring. uh this particular study was done by ECDIS and uh was fortunate enough to be part of of one of their studies and and I had two fields that uh participated in that and so I was pleasantly surprised to see that we're seeing a a positive trend uh upward and so we know that that things are improving. This is the uh water infiltration at Oswald Ranch again in milliliters per second. And you can see that we're able to infiltrate uh quite well. I I don't know or I haven't figured how that uh goes towards inches uh per hour, but uh we seem to have more severe uh rain events at home or more impactful if you will and we seem to be handling them uh better than we ever did as far as runoff. And again, the lighter events were able to capture uh all the moisture that we can. And and so uh you know, you probably heard the the the little funny that someone asked you how much it rained and you used to say, you know, well, half an inch or 20 hundreds or 3/4 of an inch. And now my reply generally is I captured all of it. Or how much did it rain? and I I got it all. So, uh which is a good thing. This is uh the corn crop on that particular field. Uh this is my youngest daughter Afton enjoying the day in the corn crop. Uh this is a cover crop field or a soil health field as I like to call it. Uh that we were able to raise 110 bushel corn on with uh very limited inputs. Uh uh actually uh it didn't have any fertility on it. I I do attribute it to again 2024 being a very good year as far as moisture and that. But uh we were able to net, you know, some pretty good profit off this field because of our lack of uh inputs on it. And this just kind of shows you uh this is the same field that was in 2023. the organic matter uh has gone down some. We we've used some of that storage in the tank and uh but uh we've got a plan to build it back up again and uh we like to take a swing at the ball every once in a while with these annual crops and see how far our system uh with using the soil health principles, how far can we push it, how far can we drive it. And of course with the armor on here and stuff uh we were able to limit our pesticide uh use as well. So we were pretty pleased about that. Again using the soil health principles and adapt them to your production model. Uh you know you can you can read through them and uh again keeping the soil covered minimizing disturbance. uh good things are going to happen if you can adapt them to your production model and uh we we've seen that uh over time at the Minoan farm at Oswald Ranch at other producers places again across the landscape and uh and and so again the soil health principles are are vital I believe going forward to to help mitigate some of these uh resource concerns that we have across the state. So, I think I'm pretty close to right on. I might be a minute over. I apologize for that. Uh but again, a little self-education uh slide uh wmanfarm.com. And we do have a YouTube channel and uh at Manokenfarm as well. And thank you uh for uh listening today. John, appreciate the presentation. Um, like you, I'm doing a lot of the similar stuff, grazing cattle. I've got my and I'm curious of your opinion and anybody else that wants to chime in on this. Um, I got myself into a situation this year where I've got some additional land for grazing and it was previously uh uh silage corn fields. Um, and I'm kind of being handed dead ground. Um they had uh harvested the corn off of it, put a very sparse winterkill cover crop on it when they were done and it sat bare all last season and now I'm coming into it now. Um if I had time during the winter, I may have, you know, round bail grazed it to get some armor on the soil or something. Um but now it doesn't have much of anything. Um, I have access to a lot of composted, mostly composted wood chips. Um, and I was thinking about spreading that on to get some armor on the soil, but the first thing that everybody says is that all your nitrogen is going to get locked up into it. Um, I thought about possibly mixing that with some poultry litter that I also have available to me to at the same time be putting nitrogen on it with that armor and carbon. Uh, curious of your guys' input. I I guess first off, I think the tie-up will depend on how composted your wood chips are. Uh, I think if they're a long way down the road, you you'll probably be just fine. Uh, you can put that on and proceed. Uh, I don't have much experience in poultry lure, Patrick, but uh, I think it would act like other manure when used uh, again, for lack of a better term, responsibly. I would try to get out there and get a cool season cover crop on that on that ground if you're able as quickly as possible and then manage graze it and then get some litter back on there and lay some of that carbon material on the ground on the surface and then get that covered up again. armor number one in in my book and and again I that it's just how I view things. But you need to get that protected and covered and you can add your compost if if you're in doubt. I guess too you could get it tested. Uh but you know, cool season uh cool season mix on there with uh with quite a bit of you know, cool season grass or something that'll get you some biomass. Uh you know, and then start working on your legume and you know, your more fragile peas and stuff later. Yeah. the uh this situation where because it was dead, there was no cover, there was no living root system for uh a year, um erosion took its toll and because there's nothing uh holding the ground together, you drive onto it uh with a truck or any piece of equipment and you kind of sink right away. Uh, unfortunately I got to wait for drier conditions before I could even get a look at drilling in anything to it. Okay. But yeah, I got myself into a heck of a project. Well, congratulations. I guess uh I mean you're going to make it better. No doubt. And and that landowner will will thank you. Uh again, maybe keeping the initial cover crop simple then if you're facing some challenges. Uh but again, try to get it in there when you can. Uh and and get it protected, I think, is the first thing. And then use the livestock to get get the biomass to the ground and and start building some biology in there.",
