  "text": "[Music] hello ladies from thailand today today's video is going to be an unboxing unboxing of a couple of solar-powered devices i'm convinced that solar power is the way to go now i've tried a few things with regard to solar and i think that the small items are probably the way to go so today i'm gonna unbox two items that i think it'll be very useful in the future and the first one is let's have a look i ordered these from lazada and they came today very very fast only three days for delivery now i've already done a few solar things i've got solar-powered light flood lights around the house and they'll last for 10 or 12 hours i'm very very impressed for the price of what they are and this is obviously a solar panel and a light fitting comes with the remote control as well [Applause] so this is the light fitting that i've got and the reason why i bought this is because you can easily change the batteries in these now there's pictures here of the flood lights that i've put around the house they're a little bit more difficult to change the batteries once they need to be changed because eventually the batteries will stop recharging and you need to replace them so i'm going to do a breakdown of this and see what how it works and how it fits together and um i think you'll be impressed and the battery is already in there so we'll have a lot for being able to replace the battery once it's it's worn out and it's past its usefulness [Applause] i was hitting safety in there so as far as being able to get access to the battery and replace it it's also simple very very simple for diy installation and that's all i'm dealing with is diy installation and those people that can actually do it themselves so i'll put it back together now and we'll see it when it's working two screws that's all it takes to be able to put it back together again plastic housing so waterproof and a remote control which helps everything along so i'm sort of impressed it's it's a cheap light fitting but we'll get some ideas to how good it is once we plug it in so the solar panel which charges it up well again i intend to extend the sort of paddle lead because it's never long enough to be able to to put it where you need to put it to be able to put the light up and i'm going to use these lights for outside that's what i'm intending to use them for so we'll be able to put these onto the roof or in some position where it will be able to charge everything up so the lead really isn't that long maybe it's a couple of meters long so what we're going to do i'm going to put it in the sun for now and then see how it charges up and see how good it charges it up because as it comes now it's probably uncharged so let's put this in the sun and see what we can do with it so let's put the light in this sun see if we can get it charged up so hopefully that should charge that up okay that's the first one unboxing done of what it is the light fit in some batteries some screws some raw plugs i say we'll deal with that when we come to fit it up i don't really know where i'm gonna put it yet but it will go somewhere and the second thing that i've got um now we use this particular item all the time in the house we have air conditioning but my wife doesn't like air conditioning so i let bought show you in the box well packed and so let's see what we've got it is a [Applause] solar powered fan as i said this comes with it's a 16 inch fan which is what this the same size that we use already but electric and the idea is with this is to see how much the battery lasts for for because we use the fan nearly all day and we certainly use the fan on the nighttime in the bedroom so we're going to see how long it lasts for even if we just be able to use it during the day it's some sort of saving of electricity now that's the size of the panel to charge the battery that comes with it now i'll leave some prices as to what i paid for these towards the end of the video so you can see exactly how much i appeared for these things and there's a 16 inch fan so here we go we're going to put it all together now the idea is this is because i like playing around with the electrics and things like that is that if this sort of [Music] brakes with the with the i don't expect it to last very long because it wasn't expensive but the idea is if the controls break we have 12 volt fan which can be controlled by the solar panels i've got now i've got some bigger solar panels now for those people who watched my programs before with regard to solar i had an inverter which was linked up to the to the grid system but unfortunately the gardener came around one day and the pebble dashed the the panel and and smashed all the glass on top of the solar panel and also there was a lightning storm and i think that blew up the diodes within the inverter so it wasn't worth replacing the inverter but i'm still a fan of solar panels and solar power is why i bought this because i want to see if this gives a return a quicker return than buying another solar panel and inverter so i'm going to put all this lot together [Music] [Applause] [Music] so let's go and plug it in and see what it does see if we can get it charged up so again just got a phone charger dc charger so let's go and see what it does and let's do the same with the fan put that in the sun and let's see if we can charge later's working it's working from the sun it's been a week now since i bought this this solar panel and light fitting and what do i think of it if you watch this video here you'll actually see how easy it was to fit to the roof without actually not fussing in it to the the tiles on the roof it's easy to do took less than 10 minutes to do and the results i'm not overly impressed now this light here only lasts for babies eight hours when it's fully charged up as these ones here last for the full 12 hours or so it might have something to do with the size of the battery i don't really know but they give an impressive light out for the eight hours that the that they're lit for but i'd want them to be up for 10 or 12 hours it gets dark here in thailand about six o'clock in the evening and it gets late again six o'clock in the morning so they need to be on for at least 12 hours for my um likability of it but eight hours it's better than nothing at all isn't it i suppose and it's free so eight hours it's not too bad for the price uh 450 baht i think there were so less than 10 pounds and it's free once it done so it's not too bad so what about this the fan the solar panel fan now again if you look at the box here it says three hours on fast speed um now again i've had it a week and i've had the solar panel going out in the sunshine for all day and it's fully charged up with the solar panel the best i can get out of it is two hours i can get three hours if the solar panel is in the sun whilst it's being operated during the day so with the battery and the solar panel you can get three hours but it doesn't say that the instructions are any of the literature that comes with it so again a little bit disappointing on the evening time that's what we're going to use it for two hours at the very very most and again on the box it says up to eight hours on on slow speed now impossible doesn't give you the full eight hours so again a little bit disappointing with that but for a thousand or just over a thousand baht what could you expect maybe as if i put a little bit bigger battery in it but i've got other ideas out how i can adapt this fan so it can be used with my bigger solar panels but this is all in the future with regard to solar panels i'm a big fan of solar power and i will make the solar power work in this house whilst i'm here so from this retired and living the dream in thailand until the next video bye for now",
