  "text": "should I walk run really fast like they do in the old time yes yes we planted this in 2013 it's a Gravenstein apples and it desperately needs pruning let's see what you can do in one minute [Music] [Music] [Music] I think that may have been the 45-second foe but it's okay can you tell us I can tell you why I did what I did okay because I only had 60 seconds that's why I did what I did okay so just for the quick and dirty you know we hadn't this Scot was getting what you called leggy it was getting too long the branches the fruit can break the branch right so what essentially what did you do what I guess I took out all the branches that were really low that may be when you mow and drive a tractor and I took all the branches going straight up and the ones that are going way out too far because this branch is way too long for its thickness okay so what I did is I found a side branch here that and I left the tip you always live to terminal bud oh and I left the tip there and that will become where the new branch goes out but it's not near as long it was so long that it was going to bend down like this when the fruit came on yeah and bent out of shape and then it would stop producing as well and for the top what I did it was about six feet taller yeah and so what I did is I took I found a branch that we could Bend like this so there's still one more thing needs to be done here okay I'm gonna put a stake up here Oh like you're gonna put a stake here yeah and you're gonna take this branch and you're gonna tie it with a piece of bamboo like this and this is the new top oh so it has a top and because the top still has a terminal bud that I didn't cut back yeah it would gives a message to all the other bud other branches to grow out and produce fruit if I would have cut that off yeah whenever you cut a terminal bud off a branch it puts out a bunch of side branches below that and we didn't want more branches so I made sure I didn't just cut it off like here I cut it off to a branch that we could tie up with a terminal bud and that's gonna be your new top and you've got to remember to put a little bamboo stake right up there and now your trees about five foot shorter and it has the branches going where they want okay is that something that we would never trim off later then that will always stay there no what's going to happen is this is going to grow way yeah and eventually it's gonna get way taller than you want and you're gonna do the same thing so imagine now instead of standing on the ground I've climbed up a ladder and this it's like 10 years from now and I'm like about safe five six feet off the ground and I'm up at the top of the tree it it's really tall like that I'm gonna look for a new branch like this one right here and I'm gonna cut everything off above there and this thing new one's going to become the top but I'm not going to tip it back I'm gonna let it stay and it'll become the new top and that's what you always keep doing it on your trees you make them shorter but you always keep a top by finding a less vigorous branch that's going upwards and that's well usually like in the winter and stuff we could probably could have found a branch that was going up enough we wouldn't a need even to stay give it okay it's kind of kind of a rule of thumb and you're thinning your fruit and it's a good time to do it what you want to do is put your hand out and wherever your thumb is and your your little finger that's about how far the fruit should be apart so you can do that now in just a second the other door so take these two off well you can leave one about here what about here is fine that's enough usually they're in a cluster of like five you picked the just one of them to keep out of the cluster so you go through your orchard and about this time of year when the fruit is roughly the size of a Super Bowl yeah and you start pulling that off mm-hmm and you can you can pull it or you can use a little pruners and turn it off but here is it so pretty much you got a figure about 35 leaves can support one fruit in general give you an idea but if you don't want to count leaves you could use the rule of thumb I really enjoyed editing this video and kind of just kind of was a reminder of what a wonderful time we had with with Sam and James from rain tree nursery that came out and helped us with us orchard or with our orchard I think this video is really important because it it really distills them I think it really simplifies for the you know for the common person kind of some basic things to help take care of our fruit trees that I have never really known how to do to be honest with you I've always been somewhat intimidated about cutting that I was afraid I was gonna do something wrong and I have never really known why we weren't getting a lot of fruit and just by adopting this rule of thumb and thinning the fruit out if you know in June or early summer and and the the simple tricks or instructions for pruning I feel confident to be able to go out and do this so I hope you enjoyed the video and again another very heartful thank you to to the folks at Raintree for coming out and putting this on and sharing this this vast knowledge with the rest of us also we have a coupon code Raintree nursery ships all over the country so we would like to support them and you want to get on the list now pre-order so you have will guarantee your shipments for your fruit next year and the coupon codes regular start so just go to regular star and tell them we said hello and we really appreciate appreciate everyone's support so thanks for watching don't forget to click the thumbs up and we'll see you guys on the next video",
