1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,840
my name's bev buckley

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,160
i've been growing vegetables and fruit

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,280
for about the last 14 or 15 years

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,119
organically and also i teach people how

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,920
to do this and we've taught hundreds of

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,800
people here on mount tambourine where we

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,199
live and also now further much further

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,680
afield through internet courses

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,119
and one of the things i've found is that

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,400
the people

11
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,440
people generally

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,320
are very frightened of taking on a new

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,480
challenge like growing things we've lost

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,760
the we've lost the

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,600
the ability

16
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,239
to grow because we've not learned it

17
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,920
from our parents or our grandparents and

18
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,600
this is one of the reasons why books

19
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,480
like annette's

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,840
and at wellsford's how to grow healthy

21
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,640
potatoes

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:57,120
is a really really valuable resource

23
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,760
because it teaches you everything you

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,520
need to know to grow that crop it

25
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,360
teaches you when to plant

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,360
how to plant what fertilizers to use

27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,760
what sort of pests to look out for that

28
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,880
are going to damage your crops

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,799
this is why i really really recommend

30
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,880
that if you're interested in growing

31
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,360
potatoes and of course they're a basic

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,560
staple crop that we all need

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,520
that you

34
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,520
read and at wellsford's

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,799
how to grow healthy potatoes because

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,360
that's a really really valuable resource

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,720
and it will set your mind at ease and

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,720
allow you to do it with confidence
