1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:04,960
one of the most important thing about

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:08,040
micronics is that you have the number of

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,320
chicken you have up there the ratio has

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,480
to match the number of uh uh fish down

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,720
there ABS today we be discussing with

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,520
you about micronics my name is mar John

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,439
I your host in betel Farm where the fish

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,000
are if you can look at it carefully we

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,880
have our M massive pump here our suive

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,519
pump is inside the water so from from

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,960
the water the submassive pump takes it

12
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,719
to to this filter here we build our

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,559
mechanical filter and from our

14
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,920
mechanical filter we have our biological

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,800
filter this is where all the bacteria

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:45,239
are formed after after the bacteria is

17
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,160
formed it runs through the PVC pipe down

18
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,719
to the grow beds and from the grow bed

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,760
that is where the plant absorb all the

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:57,160
nutrient that is taken from the pond the

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,079
fish pond and also after observing it it

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,920
sent it back you can see the water comes

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,920
back here as a clean water so that the

24
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,280
fish can have good oxygen one of the

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,720
most important thing about micronics is

26
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,799
that you have the number of chicken you

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:17,320
have up there the ratio has to match the

28
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,119
number of uh uh fish down there so if

29
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,759
you are putting if we put 10 chicken to

30
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:25,840
100 fish which is very important because

31
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:28,000
if you miss the ratio the amount of uh

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,799
the amount of chicken if you supersede

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,840
that of the fish then the water will

34
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,079
become so acidic and all your fish will

35
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,680
die so it's it's 10 chicken to at least

36
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,720
100 fish in the pond depending on the

37
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,759
number of uh depending on the size of

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,920
the pond you want to build so your ratio

39
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:49,799
has to be accurate about uh micronics so

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:55,000
here what we do is that this Pond right

41
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:59,159
here is uh 22 M by by 3

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,399
m and we put 10 chicken 10 chicken to

43
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,680
100 fish

44
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,039
so if we put two chicken 20 chickens

45
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,840
that means we have 200 fish there so

46
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,399
that is the ratio we use so that the

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,640
water will never be acidic because it's

48
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,959
very important that your water remain in

49
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,519
an alkaline form so that is very

50
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:20,319
important because from uh just as I said

51
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,360
from this place here from the pond it

52
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,959
goes to the mechanical filter from the

53
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,120
mechanical filter to the biological

54
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:29,640
filter and everything what the what the

55
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,400
chicken release to the fish and the fish

56
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,920
come consume it and whatever the fish

57
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,360
release it pass out to the plants and

58
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,239
the plant in return absorve all the

59
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,599
nutrients and in return send it back to

60
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,879
the fish as a clean water why do we do

61
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,840
this kind of farming is very important

62
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,200
micronics mimic natural ecosystem it

63
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,879
encourage the growth of both plant and

64
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,760
animal in a way that minimize

65
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:56,959
environmental impact it redu dependency

66
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,200
on large scale industrial agricultural

67
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,319
practice making it more sustainable

68
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,879
choice is for food security micronus can

69
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:08,280
be implemented in a small space making

70
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,120
it suitable for urban environment small

71
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,640
household or communities which is

72
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,840
limited to land resources this makes it

73
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,280
very valuable too for promoting local

74
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,799
food production and improving food

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,799
security particularly in urban areas or

76
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:25,200
region with limited agricultural land

77
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,319
yes so thank you so much this is our

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,159
topic today on micronics because I

79
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:30,680
wanted to educate you on more what we do

80
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,439
