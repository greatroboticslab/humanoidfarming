00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,270
hi guys it's Matt the stoned ape farmer

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,410
coming to you from farmer all and I just

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,590
wanted to talk to you a bit about

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,870
gardening without irrigation and if you

5
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,150
can see all this lovely corn behind me

6
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:18,210
but it's been grown without any

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,520
irrigation other than rainfall and I

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,990
want to talk to you a bit about some of

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,420
the techniques I used here and

10
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,119
throughout the garden to reduce or

11
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,740
eliminate my need to irrigate let's go

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:34,039
check it out

13
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:34,039
[Music]

14
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:45,539
[Music]

15
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:48,269
so here's a close-up of my corn it's

16
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,769
part of my three sisters bed and the

17
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:52,589
corns finally tall enough that I just

18
00:00:49,769 --> 00:00:55,190
planted my beans the other day and I

19
00:00:52,589 --> 00:00:57,420
haven't popped up yet

20
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:03,750
one of the things you might notice is a

21
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:06,210
little interesting is that this corn is

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,509
planted in a little depression and in

23
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:15,240
fact all of the corn plant in little

24
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:18,000
depressions and in the in-between

25
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,220
depressions it's filled with woodchips

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,050
and you can see you little squash

27
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:28,560
popping up right there what these

28
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:32,640
depressions do is capture any rainwater

29
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:39,409
that falls and forces them forces that

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:41,819
rain water towards the plants you see

31
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:45,360
water follows the basic rules of physics

32
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:48,869
if you put it on a high mound it's going

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,110
to roll off but if you capture it in a

34
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:57,509
basin it'll stay there and slowly sink

35
00:01:52,110 --> 00:02:00,840
in and because our summers are typically

36
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:03,090
3 to 4 months of drought during the

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,219
rainy season I want as much water as

38
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,519
possible to penetrate the ground right

39
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:13,650
here where I'm growing the corn now the

40
00:02:08,519 --> 00:02:16,859
reason I have wood chips in between all

41
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,480
these little pockets of corn is because

42
00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:23,250
those are placeholders where I'm going

43
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,260
to be planting my winter squash and the

44
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,930
wood chips do a couple of things first

45
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,640
of all they provide weed suppression

46
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,000
since there's nothing growing right

47
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:36,120
there now to block out weeds to shade

48
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,060
them out so what chips do that for me I

49
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:45,430
have a few little weeds yeah this guy

50
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:48,700
right here

51
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:53,900
couple of these guys right here

52
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:55,640
poro quick but for the most part I

53
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,130
haven't really had weeds coming up in

54
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:02,360
this does it read it we did really well

55
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:04,550
before I planted the corn and I put the

56
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:09,650
woodchips in to prevent weeds coming up

57
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:14,210
in between the corn but the other thing

58
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:20,360
that the woodchips do is they stop

59
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:32,900
evaporation if I come down here and open

60
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:36,680
this up what that is mind you this isn't

61
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,820
good soil this is this is mostly clay so

62
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,480
the woodchips are also gonna break down

63
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:43,430
and help make the soil a little bit

64
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,550
nicer than it is right now

65
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:49,070
now mulch and weed suppression are both

66
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:51,590
great because on the one hand you're

67
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:54,430
preventing evaporation and on the other

68
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:57,230
hand you're preventing transpiration

69
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,510
transpiration is actually according to

70
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:03,890
Steve Solomon who has done the most work

71
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:07,310
in dry farming at least in contemporary

72
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:08,630
times corn Steve Solomon most of the

73
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:11,180
water lost is actually through

74
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,890
transpiration and that's the water

75
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,140
evaporating off of the leaves of the

76
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:18,080
plants so wherever you can eliminate

77
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:21,560
weeds you're going to conserve a lot of

78
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:24,260
your water one of the other things

79
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:28,190
that's important for gardening without

80
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:31,280
irrigation is plant spacing now most

81
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:33,310
people are under the impression that the

82
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,200
wide spacing between rows that's

83
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:39,860
recommended on packets of seeds has to

84
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,890
do with farm equipment and being able to

85
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,920
get machinery between rows of plants

86
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:48,770
it's actually the other way around

87
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:51,350
before there was plumbing and pumped

88
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:56,330
water people didn't irrigate their crops

89
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:58,310
and the machinery was designed to work

90
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,280
with those spacings in mind

91
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,700
you see if you leave more spacing

92
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,230
between the plants that can put out

93
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:09,020
larger root systems without having to

94
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:12,370
compete with each other and then they

95
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:16,220
can mind their own nutrients and water

96
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:20,030
without having to have them provided

97
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:22,130
non-stop as you might be able to see

98
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:25,850
here if the corn isn't shading my

99
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:30,410
measuring tape my core plants are about

100
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:34,300
18 inches apart and that's up from the 8

101
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:37,220
to 12 inches that's usually recommended

102
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:40,910
generally you want about 50% more

103
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,710
spacing than the packets recommend in

104
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,590
order to go without irrigating your

105
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:48,200
crops and this is with pretty minimal

106
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:50,990
rainfall like I said we get three to

107
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:54,830
four months of drought throughout our

108
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:56,600
main growing season here and these corn

109
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:00,530
plants will not need to be irrigated at

110
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,790
all even with all of the drought you may

111
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:06,560
have noticed all of this rotting

112
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:10,190
firewood in the background this was all

113
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,680
from my landlady we had a bunch of

114
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,830
rotten firewood because of a leak in her

115
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:19,789
shed and she was just going to toss it

116
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,680
down a bank well I went and recovered

117
00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:25,970
all of it saved her the work of moving

118
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:29,000
it and this will be another part of my

119
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:34,430
water saving strategy let's go check

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:37,910
that out know if you'll take a look at

121
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,950
this hot mess on the other side of my

122
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,160
kale plants you see that my kale plants

123
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:44,539
are doing fine without irrigation

124
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,580
they've gotten regular temperatures into

125
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:51,860
the 90s although it's been a weird year

126
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,890
and we've been fluctuating between cool

127
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:59,630
temps and hot temps either doing fine

128
00:06:54,890 --> 00:07:00,740
because I've kept the wide spacing so

129
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,219
that they don't have to compete for

130
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,289
water

131
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:07,569
but the idea here is that I'll dig out

132
00:07:05,289 --> 00:07:11,919
all these paths and I'll fill them with

133
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:15,789
that rotted wood that you saw basically

134
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,349
I'm creating Hugo paths and many of you

135
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:20,080
are probably familiar with the idea of

136
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:22,330
Hugo culture at this point the idea that

137
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,550
you dig a trench or just lay wood on the

138
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,490
soil cover it with more soil and that

139
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,710
becomes your garden bed now as the wood

140
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:32,560
breaks down it acts like a sponge and

141
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:34,479
soaks up any excess rainwater and during

142
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:42,250
periods a drought it will release it

143
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:45,490
into your bed one of the things the Hugo

144
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:49,060
culture is intended to do is to because

145
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:51,729
it's a mound it'll shed excess water

146
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,189
like if it's way too much it'll shed

147
00:07:51,729 --> 00:07:57,939
that water to keep your bed from

148
00:07:54,189 --> 00:08:01,870
becoming waterlogged well I don't want

149
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:03,460
that because that is designed for areas

150
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,919
where the rain is pretty constant

151
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,020
throughout the year that is not the case

152
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,669
here we get three to four months of

153
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:14,949
drought during the main growing season

154
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:17,830
when I really need a lot of water so the

155
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:20,560
idea is I'll take out all of the paths

156
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:23,830
between the rows and the main kitchen

157
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,930
garden and I'll fill them with that

158
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:27,639
rotted wood and I'll cover it back over

159
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:31,389
with the soil you see there that I've

160
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:35,169
dug out but I'll leave a very slight

161
00:08:31,389 --> 00:08:37,899
depression over the path and that's

162
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:44,110
where the water will settle during the

163
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:45,880
rainy season well that'll seep in soak

164
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:47,760
into the wood and then when we get

165
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,769
around to our drought II season it can

166
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:55,630
kind of release back into the beds on

167
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:58,420
either side of course I'll cover the

168
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:01,899
pass with with woodchips so they don't

169
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:04,209
become muddy mess but then what I'm

170
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:07,060
doing is I'm actually storing all of

171
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:09,370
that water that would just run off with

172
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:13,759
traditional Hugo culture and I'm saving

173
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:18,449
it up for our dry season you can see

174
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:22,980
that might kill plants are a good two

175
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:28,350
feet apart in the row and about three

176
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:30,930
feet apart between the rows and I'm

177
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:34,920
hoping that once these Hugo paths are

178
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:37,769
good and established that what will

179
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,350
happen is I'll be able to plant things

180
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:42,660
much closer together and cram more stuff

181
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,490
in the same amount of space I still want

182
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:48,449
to maintain wide spacing it's easier to

183
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:52,160
weed it's easier to harvest and it still

184
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:56,009
gives you that protection from drought

185
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:59,759
but by adding this extra redundancy into

186
00:09:56,009 --> 00:10:03,839
my water saving I will be able to get a

187
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:06,209
little bit more production out while

188
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,139
still maintaining a complete lack of

189
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:15,660
irrigation now I've already talked about

190
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:17,490
mulch at least wood mulch but a lot of

191
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:20,519
people get hung up on what mulch they're

192
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:23,040
using it really isn't important what you

193
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:28,579
use as long as you're keeping the soil

194
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:31,019
covered so here's this beautiful cabbage

195
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:35,190
starting to get some size on it finally

196
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:39,660
and you'll notice that here I don't use

197
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:42,630
wood chips I could it wouldn't be my

198
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:46,470
first choice and I can't get enough of

199
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:47,930
them to use in my garden beds but I

200
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:50,420
don't need them

201
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:53,060
I have laws of space here that just

202
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,010
growing grass and weeds and I can go

203
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:58,220
through and clear it out and get this

204
00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:00,950
nice straw that I can put down and if I

205
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:05,030
pull it back you can see that the soil

206
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:07,960
is nice and moist here again this isn't

207
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:10,130
good soil this is this is terrible clay

208
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,170
there's there's a little bit of organic

209
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:18,140
matter on it but it's it's mostly just

210
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:20,180
garbage these plants don't care as long

211
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,640
as they've got a little bit of mulch a

212
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,080
little bit of organic matter so that the

213
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,180
microbes in the soil can start doing

214
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,680
their thing and as long as they're

215
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:32,330
getting the moisture which they are

216
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:35,480
because you know that mulch is keeping

217
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:41,120
the soil covered and protected I don't

218
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:45,320
care use whatever weeds grass clippings

219
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:48,470
woodchips heck I've seen some people use

220
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:50,540
rocks I'd really hate to have rocks in

221
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:56,390
my garden but there's a perennial

222
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:58,100
planting then sure maybe of course the

223
00:11:56,390 --> 00:12:00,680
one downside with something like rock is

224
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:04,040
that you're not getting the organic

225
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:06,050
matter which is why I would go for

226
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,930
really anything oh there's a random

227
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:12,590
stick here anything that's growing and

228
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:16,520
gets cut back can go in the garden or

229
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:18,140
put it on top don't mix it in because

230
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,740
that'll tie up nitrogen but if you leave

231
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:24,670
it on top worms and microbes and

232
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:27,920
everything will slowly break it down and

233
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:33,290
add nutrients to your soil well holding

234
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:36,790
in the moisture so like I said you can

235
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:38,690
use literally anything as a mulch and

236
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:42,680
one of the problems I'm having right now

237
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:46,240
is that the weed eaters broke and I

238
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:52,790
don't have access to all of that fresh

239
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:54,830
straw hay from chopping down all the

240
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:58,880
grass and weeds growing around the

241
00:12:54,830 --> 00:13:02,170
property but you can use anything one of

242
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,170
the other things that

243
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:08,809
Steve Solomon teaches is to use Dutch

244
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:12,410
best mulch he's actually very opposed to

245
00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:16,519
using deep mulch in the gardens which I

246
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:19,100
don't agree with but one of the great

247
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,689
things that he teaches if you don't have

248
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,049
enough organic matter to most a garden

249
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:27,499
with is to use a dust mulch it still

250
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:30,230
protects the soil even if it doesn't add

251
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:34,730
in organic matter and helps hold in

252
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:37,910
moisture so here's another row scores an

253
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:42,169
era and I'm surprised this many came up

254
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:45,439
because it was old seed but what you

255
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:50,839
might notice in between the rows is that

256
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:52,100
there is no mulch now you probably see

257
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:55,220
all this cracking right around the

258
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,470
plants that's what clay soil does when

259
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:01,399
it rains really hard and then it dries

260
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:06,559
out the surface dries out faster than

261
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:12,919
the lower soil and it cracks as it loses

262
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:16,549
the moisture and contracts so because I

263
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:19,220
haven't been able to get enough mulch to

264
00:14:16,549 --> 00:14:21,829
mulch this what I do is after a hard

265
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:24,759
rain I come through with a hoe and I

266
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:27,429
just break up this top layer and

267
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:31,879
although it doesn't add organic matter

268
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:33,649
into the soil it does act like a mulch

269
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:38,509
in the sense that it prevents

270
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:49,569
evaporation if I dig down here a little

271
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:49,569
bit get in to this terrible clay

272
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:56,240
and see that it's still nice and wet

273
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:58,820
garbage play but it's nice and wet

274
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,240
because it's protected under this dust

275
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:05,570
mulch and that's one of the things that

276
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:09,170
Steve Solomon teaches about dry

277
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:11,120
gardening just that well he's the posed

278
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:15,680
to mulch in general except for the

279
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:18,200
Deaf's mulch but a just mulch is just as

280
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,690
good if you can't get actual organic

281
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,760
matter to mulch your gardens with yeah

282
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,230
well add nutrients in like organic

283
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,839
matter well when it breaks down it won't

284
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:29,480
feed the soil working the soil organisms

285
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,520
like mulch will when it breaks down but

286
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:37,370
from a water conservation standpoint

287
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:40,760
it's just as good as organic matter now

288
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:42,620
one other thing that I don't really want

289
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:48,410
to show because plants haven't popped up

290
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:50,600
yet but this is one of the ways the

291
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:54,470
Native Americans taught settlers to

292
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:57,770
garden when they first got here the

293
00:15:54,470 --> 00:16:02,240
garden in Hills now a hill doesn't

294
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:06,040
necessarily mean that you have a pile of

295
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:11,180
soil that's raised up above ground level

296
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:13,339
it just refers to planting in clumps

297
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:21,550
with space in between them rather than

298
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:24,410
in rows so the idea here is that even on

299
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:29,450
completely virgin ground overgrown with

300
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:32,390
weeds as I've been worked at all you can

301
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:35,690
still start a garden bare out of space

302
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:39,380
it's about 18 inches plant your seeds

303
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:42,649
there go over four feet do another one

304
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:45,860
four feet do another one four feet do

305
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:48,710
another one four feet do another one

306
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:51,200
what you accomplish with this is that

307
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:54,200
you have your plants and in this case

308
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,660
yeah just like with the corn I made a

309
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,800
little depression so that it would

310
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:05,060
capture water plant seed in the middle

311
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:08,480
and because I'm leaving four feet of

312
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,860
spacing between they won't have to

313
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,020
compete with each other for water I

314
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:13,550
still need to go through and clear some

315
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:17,570
weeds out but they're pretty sparse to

316
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:19,700
begin with and I'll be able to drop all

317
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:21,589
these weeds down in between the plants

318
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:27,170
and any others that come up and there'll

319
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:30,230
be my mulch in between the plants this

320
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:31,900
is really the way to go if you need to

321
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:34,190
get a lot of plants in the ground and

322
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,200
you don't have a clear spot to put them

323
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:39,710
you don't need these nice nice and neat

324
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:43,580
little rows you don't need you know to

325
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:45,680
rototill you don't need to come clear a

326
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:49,460
bunch of weeds and stuff literally get a

327
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,500
hoe I like this big grub hoe here clear

328
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,590
little spot put your seeds in the ground

329
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:57,050
move to the next spot put them in which

330
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:59,060
is exactly why these ended up here this

331
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:06,770
was not my plan at the beginning of the

332
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:08,330
season but I had issues with my cucumber

333
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:12,740
seeds not germinating when I put them in

334
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:14,540
the ground I think this year was a weird

335
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,540
year and it's been way wetter than it

336
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:18,890
usually is and a lot of my seeds just

337
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,520
ended up rotting in the ground because

338
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:24,440
it was cold and wet so I pre germinated

339
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,350
some on paper towel and ended up with

340
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:30,650
way more than I need well I didn't want

341
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:32,120
them to go to waste so I ended up making

342
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:35,540
these little Hills at the edge of the

343
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,550
garden to put them in and they might end

344
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:40,670
up just being sacrificial plants for the

345
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:43,630
deer and that'll be okay if it keeps

346
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:43,630
them out of the main garden

347
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,360
now one more thing that I didn't mention

348
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:54,630
or mentioned only briefly with the

349
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,360
cucumbers in the Hills is that if I'm

350
00:18:54,630 --> 00:19:00,450
not expecting rain for a while and I

351
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:05,100
need to plant something I soaked or pre

352
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:07,380
germinate my seeds now that's what I did

353
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,170
with my beans I need to plant them in

354
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,650
around my corn and the three sisters bed

355
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:14,760
but we aren't expecting rain for a while

356
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:15,240
so I went ahead and sucked my beans

357
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,460
overnight

358
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:21,210
I didn't chit them or pre germinate them

359
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:22,590
like I did with the cucumbers but I did

360
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,760
soak them ahead of time so that they

361
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,820
would have plenty of moisture to

362
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,030
germinate that's one of the things you

363
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:32,420
can do if you're not expecting any rain

364
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:37,590
for a while to get things to germinate

365
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:39,150
outside of the rainy season I'll go

366
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,070
ahead and show you some okra seeds that

367
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,390
I have started to show you what it looks

368
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,160
like if you take them all the way to the

369
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:50,790
pre germination stage since I haven't

370
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:54,660
gotten those in the ground yet no okra

371
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:57,840
doesn't grow here quite famously because

372
00:19:54,660 --> 00:20:01,560
our nights are too cold and it just

373
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,630
doesn't like that but I got this variety

374
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,330
from a local seed supplier and it's

375
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:09,710
supposed to tolerate our cool weather

376
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:14,040
and start producing relatively fast food

377
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:16,530
so I thought I would give it a try you

378
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:19,920
can see that what I've done here is go

379
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:23,490
ahead and roll them up in a wet paper

380
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:27,390
towel and leave them in an open ziplock

381
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:28,770
bag overnight it's actually been a

382
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:32,700
couple of nights now but they started

383
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:35,190
sprouting last night and I just left

384
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,630
that bag in a sunny window check on them

385
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,010
every once awhile to see when these

386
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:39,390
little roots are starting to form and

387
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:41,190
that's when they're ready to go in the

388
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:43,650
ground I actually could have done it

389
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:45,660
last night because they already go then

390
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:48,480
and the roots wouldn't have been so long

391
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:51,930
and fragile but it was hot last night

392
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,410
and I didn't want to go out now this is

393
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:58,930
one way

394
00:20:53,410 --> 00:21:00,280
that you can eliminate watering when

395
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,580
you're trying to get things to germinate

396
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:08,170
just wrap them up in a moist paper towel

397
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:09,760
or even soak them overnight and let them

398
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:12,130
absorb all the water they need to

399
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,530
germinate before you ever even put them

400
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,540
in the ground that way you don't have to

401
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:19,570
irrigate while they're out there they

402
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:22,390
don't have the soil constantly being

403
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:26,860
cooled down because you're watering it

404
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:29,280
and they'll take off a lot better all

405
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,420
right guys that's it for this video hope

406
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,700
some of these tips help you out with

407
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:35,350
your gardening so that you don't have to

408
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,660
irrigate as much or you can go without

409
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:40,930
your getting at all again use

410
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:44,290
depressions when you can to help capture

411
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:47,470
extra rainfall plant your things further

412
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:50,680
apart about 50% more than the package

413
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:52,270
recommends use mulch wherever you can if

414
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:55,030
you can't get enough of mulch then use a

415
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:57,220
dust mulch just after heavy rain come

416
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:59,400
through with a hoe and just kind of

417
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:03,040
scratch the top inch or so of the soil I

418
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,690
mean I don't like doing that but given

419
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,570
my lack of mulch this year that's the

420
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:09,040
best way to do it incorporate organic

421
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,440
matter I already talked about that with

422
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,150
the mulch but compost is another great

423
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,500
way to do that it'll hold in extra

424
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:19,450
moisture and you know if you can do a

425
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,030
little bit of Hugo culture to really a

426
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,590
soak up some of that water then go ahead

427
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:28,390
and give that a try there are some other

428
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:30,850
tips that I have that I'll share you

429
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:33,910
know as I get around to it as I get good

430
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,860
examples of them going but those are the

431
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:39,760
big things for now and I hope it's

432
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:43,359
helpful and you guys have a good one
