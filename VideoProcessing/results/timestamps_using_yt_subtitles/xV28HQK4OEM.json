  "text": "Welcome to the Central Florida Gardening Show. Hello, my name is Ta. You're tuning in on the Central Florida Garden Show. Today we are learning about peanuts. This is a peanut. They're called runner peanuts. They called runner cuz they run around like watermelon. They grow in the south, Texas, Alabama, Georgia, and Florida. And today I'm going to show you how to plant them. These are worm castings from Sunside Hydroponics. And I'm going to show you how to amend the soil. [Applause] And that's how you plant peanuts. Bye-bye. Thanks for stopping in. We hope you come again. [Music]",
