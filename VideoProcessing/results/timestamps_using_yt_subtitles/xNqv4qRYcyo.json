  "text": "it might look like everyone knows how to start maze farming in Ghana okay but don't fall into that drop did you know that Ghana has the worst yield of maze in the whole world not too Pleasant to accept but that is the fact Ghana has an average yield of 1.7 metric tons per hectare compared to other countries on this same continent getting about 6 to 7 metric tons per hect amidst of that though it's actually possible to become rich with maze farming business in Ghana if you do things right people in Ghana following these Tech techniques are making over 22,000 GH cities of consistent profit from their two AC maze farm and I will teach you how to start yours today and get similar Ys also do you know why right now is the best time to start me farming well field experiments were conducted to determine the optimum time for planting maze in the various ecological zones and seasons of Ghana in order to achieve the best Ys it turns out made match and made planting give the best yield guys the best time is almost passing and that is why I making this video right now in Ghana maze is cultivated during two main growing Seasons from January to May and from June to late September it is found that every September October and February March demand for Maze goes extremely high and that is when farmers can potentially make huge money out of their maze farm this is obvious because during these periods maze is not grown due to the climate and at the end of this video I will show you how to use this to your advantage and double your revenue from your maze farm so now that you know this is the best time to start let's go ahead and talk about the best practices on how to start your maze farm and get the most out of it step by step for the marketing aspect I'll share my top four secret in selling my maze with E and get the optimum prices at the end of this video so smash that subscribe button and let's dive in the first step in maze farming in general is to acquire the best piece of land for your maze cultivation how large the size of land should be depends on you but I recommend getting a large piece of land if you really mean business however if you only have a small piece of land it shouldn't stop you from doing something preferably get a deep Bine structured well erated well drained Lomi soil type of land that are rich in organic matter this is proven to give the highest yeld R plantations okay choosing the land isn't difficult at all once you have settled on the land it's time to start preparing the land for cultivation one mistake people keep doing in their Farms is they jump straight to planting whatever they want to plant without preparing the soil first the well-being of your crops largely depends on the conditions under which they are cultivated taking one to two weeks to prepare the soil before planting will go a long way to improve the Y and health of your crops but how do you actually prepare the soil it is actually simple remember I mentioned the recommended soil requirement for Maze earlier a deep fine structured well erated well drained Lomi soil by soil preparation this is what you want to achieve start by tilling or plowing the soil this makes the soil lose and become fine structured well erated and well drained this ensures better growth and development of the seed into a mature plant if it is not raining often during the time of cultivation you should probably consider irrigating the soil for about 1 to 2 weeks before sewing the seeds remember regardless of the soil type and the land you secure for your business it should go through these same preparation stages once this is done you should go ahead and choose your preferred type of seed there are two main type of seeds that are grown in Ghana the hybrid or the yellow corn and the local seed or opv now if you mean business then I recommend the hybrid seats mainly because it has proven to give the highest yield in Ghana and it is drought resistant also which means that it can still thrive in the midst of our weird and unpredicted weather the hybrid cost around 300 to 500 cities per acre depending on where you find yourself within the country if you are going with a hybrid seat though you should never recycle the seats and new seats should be contained each year the reason is that these seeds are manufactured such that after you cultivate and harvest you can't grow the seeds again if you do it's either the seeds will rot in the soil or will germinate but cannot grow well you need to buy new seeds every year and once your seeds are ready and your land is prepared let's go ahead and learn how to sew the seeds in order to get the best yield plant your seeds at a depth of about 1.5 to 2 in in the soil now optimal density varies but it is is generally recommended to plant 18,000 to 30,000 plants per acre depending on the specific maze variety maze is a warm season crop plant seeds when the soil temperature reaches at least 50\u00b0 f for proper germination the best temperature for germination is 75\u00b0 F or 24\u00b0 C population of maze plants on a piece of land is also an important determiner of the plant Health adequate Road spacing is essential for proper air circulation and sunlight exposure the recommended spacing is typically between 30 to 40 in now let's talk about one of the most essential aspects of me farming that you should probably know if you want to make a difference you can't succeed in maze farming business today if you don't know about effective weed and Pest Control techniques the fall army worm is your greatest enemy in maze farming business this pest can cause you a loss of more than 50% in your business from studies the estimated mean National yield loss due to fall worm in Ghana was over 470,000 tons in 2018 with a monetary value of over 1.7 million us fori is a poly fagos and highly mobile migratory insect pest which was first detected in West Africa in early 2016 since its introduction this insect has significantly impacted livelihoods of small scale Farmers across the continent and in Ghana in particular you can actually plant like 10 acres of land in Ghana and get just half of it at the end because of these Devils it is possible to control them but expensive here is how you do it after 4 weeks of germination start visiting your F frequently and look for signs of infestation this ensures that you detect it early as it is key in preventing excessive loss once you see few plant infested there are three classes of pesticides that are proven to be very effective against fall am the first group is the spinos signs this class of insecticide work by disrupting the tinic acolin receptors of the insect's nervous system this mechanism of action makes this class of insecticide very selective in destroying the target insect and leaving the beneficial Predators this is very helpful as it doesn't kill all the microorganisms in the soil as part of the target insect phos science does not destroy only mature insects but also their lava and eggs some examples of spinos sign insecticides are entrust and success new we also have the tin Ben it works by penetrating the leaf tissues and forming Reservoir within treated leaves which provide residual activity against past that ingest the plant substance when feeding example of imin Benz you can use to control for L are affirm and proclaim the last class of insecticide I personally find effective against foram worm is the fantron Pro Group chanton Pro binds to a specific receptor in the muscles called the ryanodine receptor when the chemical binds to this receptor it causes muszle cells to leak calcium the musles stop working normally the insect is paralyzed and dies some examples of this group are alore and coragen once you have your insecticide figured out spray your farm at least once in 3 weeks depending on the particular insecticide you get this is essential because for Lami worm is very persistent and migrates so quickly from Farm to farm for instance if you treat your farm and there is a nearby Farm that is infested to well expect to see your farm infested again as soon as the chemical loses its power this is why you need to keep treating the farm until the plant start to Silk at this stage if your farm isn't heavily infested already the plant will be healthy until you harvest even without additional treatments maze takes about 12 to 16 weeks to reach maturity as you may need to spray the farm at least three times in 3 weeks interval depending on how persistent your farm gets infested no that I am unable to recommend any dosage of the chemical since I do not know what specific agrochemical you get I advise that you use it as prescribed by the chemist at the shop you buy it now with weed control if your farm can be weeded manually it is perfect as you would not need to worry about the effect of herbicides on your farm however if that's not possible depending on the size of your farm you may still have options like post emerence herbicides the last thing you would want to do is to sew your seats let let it germinate and ignore it to stay in the bushes maze hate weeds as it suppresses its growth and health weeds in your farm will also bring in several pests to make sure that your hard work is roomed so where your options if labor cost for weeding will be too much in your situation consider using a preemergence herbicides on the piece of land before sewing your seeds to prevent germinated weed seedlings from becoming established also consider using post Emer cze to control weed in your farm after they have already emerged from the soil there are postemergence herbicides specifically made for Maze and other narrow Le crops designed to Target and Destroy both grasses and broadlea weeds leaving all n Le plant healthy some examples of these abdes are Nico gold Amin spray and Mason now if you followed up till now and going to implement what you've learned so far I am confident that you are 80% more likely to succeed in this business the last step I will talk about before diving into the business aspect is fertilization as more and more plants and crops or even weeds grow on a piece of land the soil gradually loses its nutrients for example for every ton of whole plant corn Harvest we remove from the soil about 25 kg of nitrogen 5 kg of phosphorus and 20 kg of potassium that means if you want to regrow maze or anything on that land the coming years you would need to replace these lost nutrients in order to have a satisfactory corn yield for the years to come as a rule of thumb you may need to supplement about 100 kg of nitrogen 280 kg of phosphorus and 100 kg of potasium per hectar in order to achieve this however it's very important to understand which nutrients is necessary for the plant growth and at which stage otherwise if you apply a nutrient at the wrong time you may har your CR instead the two main fertilizers strategies you may want to consider for your maze Farm are the basal fertilization and folar fertilization basil application fertilizers are applied near the base of the sewn seed usually one day before or after sewing for Maze the most important nutrients necessary at this early stage is phosphorus therefore you may need to apply fertilizers with large amount of phosphorus and a little of both nitrogen and potach get for example a fertilizer with NPK value of 535 and varry about 5 to 10 G of this fertilizer 2 in below and 2 in beside each hole containing two seeds after this the next fertilization will be at the stem elongation stage this stage begins about 5 to 6 weeks after germination this corn grow stage can predict the number of grains that will develop in each given cup grow at this stage of the plant grow corn needs the most nitrogen along with plenty of water and other nutrients it is therefore important to this time apply a fertilizer with a higher n nitrogen content for example one with NPK value of 355 now note that this is not the only way to go about it you may have other ways you have done this and would love to know about it in the comment section what have taught you so far has proven to be effective and has been replicated by many farmers across the country I am confident it will give you same result if you follow it carefully now the sales or the marketing aspect the first question to ask is how is M used in GH research says that Ghana's M production mainly goes into livestock feed and household consumption with this in mind here are the four most effective ways to sell your maze with ease but before that if you have gained value in this video so far would you please help me by subscribing to the channel right now okay thank you for doing that number one is food processes have you thought about the fact that almost every Chop Bar and restaurant across all the regions in Ghana procur some amount of maze for their daily operations the only thing it takes to start working with these business entities is reaching an agreed price that works for both of you if you able to reach a better deal with them they will definitely turn their backs on all previous suppliers and start working with you this doesn't necessarily mean settling for low prices however compromising a little in your price and getting huge amount of sales will still bring that cash you want in your pocket the second way to sell your maze in Ghana is through local markets local markets and retail shops are another great way to get your maze into the market these are the places people T to when they need home staff and food staff urgently that is a good opportunity to showcase your produce to a lot of people who can potentially be customers that is as simple as that the third one though is livestock feed males as I mentioned earlier livestock feed is one major area the Ghan maze go into you should start by researching in your area or even other localities you can transport your ma to for livestock feed males and Petry feed males there are several of them in Kumasi such as ASV Agro limited Boris Farm Supplies Pria poultry and more a lot also in Acra such as aquaba feeds limited the lawin Farms limited amas Farms limited and more these meals are looking for best deals that will promote their businesses also go to them and reach an agreement with them and start supplying them your maze the last one and definitely not the least is exploring farming contract Arrangements this is where you enter into agreement with Buyers to supply a specific quantity of maze at a predetermined price regardless of the Season price fluctuations in the Maze industry is a real problem during the rainy season when maze is grown a lot the price of maze comes down and during the dry season when it is not grown a lot in the country the prices s so high this is a problem for the companies using maze for their Productions as they may need to also fluctuate their prices from season to season again remember every problem is an opportunity tap into this opportunity by reaching a standard price and quantity you are willing to supply them all the time regardless of the season and almost every company will be willing to work with you but if you can do all of these effectively it boils down to one thing effective planning watch this video on how to write and execute a business plan for your farm step by step",
