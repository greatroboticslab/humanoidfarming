1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:08,220
of the entomology graduate student
organization I'd like to introduce dr.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,070
David Pimentel first I want to thank all
the organizations that helped co-sponsor

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:20,060
dr. Pimentel visit including the ISU
lectures program the graduate college

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:25,320
the pesticide management and the
Environment Program the Leopold Center

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,630
for sustainable agriculture within the
Leopold Center the IPM that's integrated

6
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,430
pest management issued team the
bioethics program and the Center for

7
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,870
agricultural and rural development lots
of organizations we couldn't have done

8
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,090
it without all of them and this wide
range of organizations reflects dr.

9
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:51,030
Pimentel his wide range of interests to
describe dr. Pimentel to you I have to

10
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,129
start by describing his scientific
credentials which are pretty extensive

11
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:01,920
he's currently a professor of entomology
which is the study of insects at Cornell

12
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,280
University 50% of his appointment is in
the department of entomology

13
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,970
to accommodate his wide range of
interests the other 50% of his

14
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:20,159
appointment is as a professor at large
of Agricultural Sciences including such

15
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,530
things as energy use soil erosion this
is the only such appointment at Cornell

16
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:33,869
so someone with a unusually wide breadth
of interests he served as the chairman

17
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,570
of the animala G department at Cornell
for six years he has authored over 400

18
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,759
scientific and technical papers
including having written two books and

19
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:52,049
having helped edit another 14 books so
in other words this is someone who is

20
00:01:52,049 --> 00:02:00,740
really excelled in pretty much all the
ways in which scientists measure success

21
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,950
but that's not the main reason why the
entomology graduate student organization

22
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:11,039
invited him to speak tonight what really
distinguishes dr. Pimentel is his

23
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,819
willingness to take risks
and what I mean by that is his

24
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:20,190
willingness to take public stands on
controversial issues this is something

25
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,850
that not a lot of scientists will do
it's it's not necessarily the safest

26
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,080
road to professional recognition but
it's something that dr. Pimentel has

27
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,709
done consistently by his example dr.
Pimentel shows us that scientists have a

28
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,300
special responsibility to educate the
public because it's you the public

29
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,569
that's going to have to make the
decisions about where the balance lies

30
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:48,510
between the costs and the benefits of
pesticide use and we're very pleased to

31
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,110
have dr. Pimentel here tonight to give
you some of the information that you're

32
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,720
going to need to make those decisions
this topic tonight will be economic and

33
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,570
ecological benefits of sustainable
agriculture

34
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,550
thank you again for a very kind
introduction

35
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:20,750
I hope I'll live up to it I'm going to
take one aspect of sustainable

36
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:28,940
agriculture for emphasis and that's on
the subject of pest control and I will

37
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:35,810
have a few other things in there but I
think it well illustrates some of the

38
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:42,980
problems we have the challenges and also
some of the opportunities we have to

39
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:50,360
change the system and make agriculture
environmentally sound and I'm going to

40
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,330
try to keep this to about 45 minutes so
that we can have some time for questions

41
00:03:56,330 --> 00:04:04,450
I will be using slides to illustrate the
points that I hope to make if you could

42
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:12,560
turn those on then I put these this
first slide on to emphasize one point

43
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:22,070
that we have I think we can make out
with I think the side lights on it but

44
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:29,540
anyway it's that we one major problem
and challenge that we have is trying to

45
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:36,910
provide food for a rapidly growing
population and is that the one this

46
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:46,610
doesn't seem to work
can you either we're disconnected or did

47
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:54,770
you change it or I did okay anyway the
world population is 5.5 billion and

48
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:01,760
where we add a quarter of a million
people to the earth every 24 hours a

49
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,090
quarter of a million that have to be fed
and we already have a problem in feeding

50
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:14,720
the numbers that we already have 1.6
billion humans are malnourished on Earth

51
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:22,340
today with 2 billion living in poverty
but even the u.s. did

52
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:30,830
I do that a you did you did all right
thank you I'll rely on you now the

53
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:37,340
United States in 1850 had 23 million
people or less than the population of

54
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:45,650
New York State today in 1990 we went to
250 million and my must admit that my

55
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:51,229
number of 20 year 2070 is incorrect that
ought to be because the world population

56
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:56,780
says I made this the u.s. population so
I made this slide during the last three

57
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:03,080
years has increased its well do both due
to immigration and rate of reproduction

58
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:10,000
in the u.s. is now 1.1 percent per year
and so that should read now year 2050

59
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,590
that we will have a half a billion
humans in the United States assuming

60
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:24,160
they don't increase further next slide
now our goal accosted in is to produce

61
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:31,190
high-quality food in the US and
elsewhere to feed people and the next

62
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:40,490
slide a few people appreciate the fact
that the average American consumes 1,500

63
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,520
pounds of food per year and I've got the
calories in the so for three-quarters of

64
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:51,590
a ton of food per person per year in the
US and the next slide we should be

65
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,760
eating only about a thousand pounds of
food per year and this shows you where

66
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:03,070
that excess is going that's part of our
national strategic petroleum reserve

67
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:11,120
next slide now to focus a little bit on
on some of the pests and they do cause

68
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:18,490
an enormous loss to our food system not
only in the US but worldwide next slide

69
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:24,139
although they're attractive I suppose
sitting in your corn it's not a great

70
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:31,510
benefit if you want to save that corn
next slide worldwide there are about

71
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:37,700
67,000 pests that tried that che
share our food and that doesn't include

72
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:43,640
the rodents or the mammals and the birds
and the plant pathogens obviously

73
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:52,010
dominate the system next slide now to
try to control these pests and limit

74
00:07:52,010 --> 00:08:00,650
their destruction of our food enormous
amounts of pesticide are used next slide

75
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:10,720
2.5 million tons worldwide and the u.s.
uses about a half a million tons

76
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,820
pesticide in one way that we waste
pesticide is the way we apply the

77
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:22,370
material for example by aircraft if
you're spraying and I want to emphasize

78
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:27,350
now this is under ideal conditions and
very seldom do they apply pesticides

79
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:32,720
from aircraft fly under ideal conditions
only fifty percent gets into the target

80
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,650
area I'm not talking to the target pests
of the crop I'm talking in the target

81
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:42,290
area and the new technology that's being
adopted in aircraft application is

82
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:48,080
called ulv are also low volume and in
those cases only twenty five percent

83
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,790
gets into the target area and so the
rest of this goes drifting off into our

84
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:57,530
environment to cause problems that I'm
going to talk about in a moment next

85
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:05,360
slide now the actual amount of pesticide
that reaches target pests is less than

86
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,020
one tenth of one percent which means the
rest of it is again in our environment

87
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:17,210
although a lot of this is in the target
area but is still in our environment of

88
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:23,300
course some of that will move out of the
target area in addition next slide now

89
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:32,180
in general pesticides do have a benefit
we in the u.s. spend 4.1 billion dollars

90
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:38,690
annually in pesticides and it's
estimated we save about 16 billion

91
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:45,380
dollars in crops thus for every dollar
invested we get about four dollars in

92
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,080
return but I
I emphasize now that does not include

93
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,780
however the public health and
environmental costs of using pesticides

94
00:09:53,780 --> 00:10:00,060
these are the direct benefits and do not
include any of the costs social or

95
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,780
environmental that are involved in using
pesticides and I'm going to get into

96
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:12,180
that issue in a moment next slide now in
the US we lose in other words despite

97
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:21,990
the use of the 500,000 kilos the
pesticide that we use we lose 37% of all

98
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:29,880
potential production to insects diseases
and weeds and incidentally the world

99
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:37,470
figure is 35% now the reason in part we
use a large quantities of pesticide but

100
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:43,590
still lose on average slightly more than
the world is the difference in cosmetic

101
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:48,600
standards for example a lot of the
fruits and vegetables that you see on

102
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,600
the Guatemalan market or in India would
not be saleable in the US so this is all

103
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:01,980
based on saleable products and this is
in part why our losses are slightly

104
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:08,730
higher than the average in the world
next slide now some interesting data

105
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:14,670
that indicates some of the problems that
we're having and mismanage when I term

106
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:22,380
it is the crop losses due to insects and
these are USDA data in 1945 before we

107
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:28,140
started using the new synthetic
insecticides we were losing about seven

108
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:36,800
percent of our crops to insects and
today am i standing in the way of this

109
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:44,370
projector the law all right let me stand
over a little bit you can still hear me

110
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:50,870
okay all right they

111
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:59,980
sighs in 1945 when we we did not use any
synthetic insecticide that's when we

112
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:10,680
started and we were losing 7% of our
crops to insects in 1992 after

113
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:17,320
insecticide use it increased tenfold
crop losses according to the US

114
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:23,410
Department of Agriculture now 13 percent
in other words nearly a two-fold

115
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:29,560
increase in crop losses due to insects
with a tenfold increase in insecticide

116
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:37,690
use now you might say how the hell could
that happen well the reason is for the

117
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:43,630
most part changes in agricultural
technology some changes in cosmetic

118
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:50,760
standards and their pesticide resistance
and a few other problems next slide and

119
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:58,029
destruction of natural enemies and and
so forth the next slide also illustrates

120
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:03,640
a little bit better using corn as an
example related to the agricultural

121
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:11,140
changes in agricultural technology in
1945 for example almost zero insecticide

122
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:19,209
was used in in corn production and today
corn is the largest user of insecticides

123
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:30,209
in the nation VDOT cotton about 4 years
ago now next slide when we started with

124
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:35,140
1945 most of the corn was grown in
rotation and we didn't have a problem

125
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:41,649
with the corn rootworm complex of
insects and today about half the corn

126
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:50,290
has grown in rotation and half is not
next slide and now with corn being the

127
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:55,000
largest user of insecticides there's
been over a thousand fold increase in

128
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,420
insecticide use in corn production in
the US and again going back to you

129
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:08,620
da next slide the data that corn losses
to insects according to the USDA have

130
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:16,660
gone from 3.5 percent to 12 percent with
a thousandfold increase in insecticide

131
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,640
use and it's primarily due to a change
in agricultural technology that is

132
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:26,100
moving away from crop rotations next
slide

133
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:33,220
now our land is extremely important to
us and I wish I could have spent some

134
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:40,600
time on the on the soil degradation and
soil erosion problem but I'll leave that

135
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:48,400
for a another time but land is extreme
next slide if you people appreciate the

136
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:59,200
fact that 99% of the world's food comes
from the land less than 1% comes from

137
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:07,540
the oceans and freshwater aquatic
systems and so we should be very

138
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:17,290
concerned about the our soils and the
degradation of these soils by erosion

139
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:22,500
and various other means including

140
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,650
highway construction urbanization and so
forth

141
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:33,700
and you'd appreciate the problem in part
that during a 30-year period from 1945

142
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:42,580
in 1975 of just agricultural land from
highways and urbanization we blacktopped

143
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,680
over the equivalent area larger than the
state of Ohio

144
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,660
that's just highways and urbanization
and if you took all the areas that would

145
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,250
blacktop over over that period it would
be both Ohio and Pennsylvania but the

146
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:04,450
agricultural land alone was greater than
the state of Ohio next slide now when we

147
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:10,090
do apply pesticides as I mentioned by
aircraft and especially if they're near

148
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:16,160
housing areas and so forth you do have
the serious drift problem and the impact

149
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:25,390
of pesticides on the public is
significant next slide is world data

150
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:32,060
from w-h-o the total number of human
pesticide poisonings worldwide is or

151
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:39,620
about a million with 20,000 deaths in
the u.s. we also have a problem next

152
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:46,220
slide the human pesticide poisoning
sixty seven thousand it's more than

153
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:55,990
sixty seven thousand each year twenty
seven deaths and the estimated cancer

154
00:16:55,990 --> 00:17:02,060
associated with pesticides aprox list
about ten thousand per year so it is a

155
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:07,070
significant public health problem in the
u.s. not as severe in the rest of the

156
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:13,190
world but certainly it's it's it's
important next slide now we also when we

157
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:18,920
use pesticide in particular insecticides
we do destroy some of the natural

158
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:28,520
enemies and this costs us money the next
slide gives an estimate of the cost to

159
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:35,210
the nation that's us in the destruction
of natural enemies estimated to be five

160
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:40,150
hundred and twenty million or about a
half a billion dollars next slide and

161
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:45,620
then pesticide resistance these are
world figures about five hundred and

162
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:53,150
four species of insects that are
resistant and well close to 900 total

163
00:17:53,150 --> 00:18:00,860
species pests that have become resistant
and this is a very important problem in

164
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:06,380
the US as elsewhere in the world next
slide nope I guess I didn't have that

165
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:13,250
number but anyway the estimated cost of
resistance in the United States is 1.4

166
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:18,770
billion dollars annually John and this
is due to the extra pesticides as to

167
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:25,100
treatments increased crop losses due to
the resistance problem it's certainly a

168
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,870
major environmental
problem and then of course pesticides do

169
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:37,399
get into streams and lakes and destroy
fish and this is totally an under

170
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:42,740
estimate but it would be somewhere in
the neighborhood of thirty million the

171
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:49,669
realistic figure is probably three or
four times that next slide and then when

172
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:59,649
we do use insecticides in particular
honey bees and wild bees are killed and

173
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:06,649
that is a cost to the April culturalist
and it's also a cost to agriculture from

174
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:11,990
the point of view of reduced pollination
wild bees and honey bees are important

175
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:15,860
to pollinating about thirty billion
dollars worth of agricultural crops

176
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:25,159
annually and a conservative estimate is
that the impact of pesticides on tame or

177
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:30,850
honeybees and wild bees is about over
three hundred million dollars annually

178
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:37,010
next slide and then some other
interesting effects that you can get

179
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:42,529
when you're using pesticides is using if
you use an herbicide for example 2 4 D

180
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:49,490
on a crop such as corn that it creates
other pest problems that is it may help

181
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:54,529
control the weeds but you do create some
other pest problems and these are data

182
00:19:54,529 --> 00:20:01,970
on corn showing that with 2 4 d it
recommended dosages that the corn leaf

183
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:07,580
aphid population was nearly three times
on the treated corn that is treated with

184
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:14,450
herbicide than on the untreated and
another next slide the corn borers for

185
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:22,960
example were significantly more abundant
on the treated corn that is with 2 4 d

186
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:31,399
then the untreated and furthermore these
corn borers grew 33% larger on the 2 4 d

187
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:37,550
corn and produced 33% more eggs than the
corn borers

188
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:43,730
the untreated corn and we also checked
it out on to diseases corn leaf blight

189
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:49,610
and corn smut disease and both was
significantly increased

190
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,240
well actually the corn lost its
resistance the southern corn leaf blight

191
00:20:53,240 --> 00:21:00,920
when we exposed it to 240 and the corn
smut disease was 5 times larger on the

192
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,690
treated corn those are the only
organisms we looked at but it does show

193
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:12,470
you the significance of the interaction
of some of these pesticides in the

194
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:20,179
impact on pests next slide I'll skip
that's in part some of the changes that

195
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:28,990
we observe and then birds Osprey and
various other birds that do become

196
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:38,030
exposed to pesticides next slide the
estimate is that pesticides are causing

197
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:42,980
about two billion dollars worth of
damage to birds using a very

198
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:48,400
conservative estimate that I explained
to if you liked it some time next slide

199
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:56,540
and then groundwater and well water
contamination and I understand that it's

200
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:02,809
a serious problem here in Iowa also it's
estimated that if we did an adequate job

201
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:08,960
of monitoring well water and groundwater
for pesticides that it would cost a

202
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,840
nation 1.3 billion dollars annually I
remember that's strictly monitoring it's

203
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:22,010
not doing anything about the problem
next slide and then of course pesticides

204
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:29,300
do reduce species diversity and it's
estimated worldwide that it's not used

205
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,830
just due to pesticides but due to all
the factors such as removal of forests

206
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:42,320
that we're losing about 150 species per
day due to our various changes that

207
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:48,730
humans are causing next slide now the
total environmental cost

208
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:55,600
of using pesticides back to the United
States we estimate to be at least eight

209
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,549
billion or another way to put it more
than eight billion dollars annually so

210
00:23:00,549 --> 00:23:07,030
it is a significant cost now pesticides
still are benefi benefits in terms of

211
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:15,370
economics if you factor that in on the
cost benefit originally I told you that

212
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:20,140
you get $4 returned for dollar invested
well if you would factor even this 8

213
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,540
billion now I realize that this is a
conservative figure this 8 billion but

214
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:31,390
if you factor it in it still turns out
that pesticides are a net benefit for

215
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:38,410
the nation
now I'd learn a turn next slide to what

216
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:46,990
we can do in managing our pest control
technology to improve it and hopefully

217
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:54,760
make it more profitable next slide and
the basic principles that I have it

218
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:59,049
related to sustainable agriculture is
that we make maximum use of our

219
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:05,950
biological resources and to minimize our
energy inputs in the system in other

220
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:15,660
words actually minimizing our management
of these resources next slide and

221
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:22,330
related to sustainable agriculture in a
study that one study that we made it

222
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:27,309
does take more labor especially if
you're going to make use of livestock

223
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:32,559
manure and the recycling in the system
and that is one major problem in the

224
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:37,419
u.s. is that we're not making effective
use of that manure is polluting our

225
00:24:37,419 --> 00:24:45,640
water polluting our surface waters and
wasting a very valuable resource next

226
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:53,590
slide and we can confuse consumers
particular model situation related to

227
00:24:53,590 --> 00:25:00,010
corn we were able to buy some a being
selective of the tractors

228
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:07,210
and the equipment that we had reduced
the total fuel input from 115 litres per

229
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:16,290
hectare to 70 major well about 40%
reduction in fuel inputs next slide and

230
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:22,000
then our actual corn yield in this
particular system we are actually able

231
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,860
to increase the yield in the sustainable
system we were using a crop rotation

232
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:34,440
system here and so that we were able to
get a higher yield and with no

233
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,929
insecticide being used in this
particular system next slide now as far

234
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:47,919
as energy goes we were able to in fact
reduce the total energy inputs by 1/2

235
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:55,240
that is from seven point eight million
kilocalories per hectare to 3.7 million

236
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:00,370
Killa Killa calories per hectare reduce
soil erosion from 20 tons per hectare to

237
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:07,120
one and obviously reduce the water
runoff and reduce the amount of

238
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,500
pesticide being used in this particular
system next slide

239
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,840
now dollar-wise it was also the cost of
production were reduced from five

240
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,590
hundred and twenty three dollars per
hectare to three hundred and fifty two

241
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:27,100
dollars per hectare and that does
include the additional labor xx sorry 20

242
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,330
percent more labor that we had in that
system

243
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:42,510
next slide now related to pesticides for
countries if you include on a character

244
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:48,130
Ontario in Canada as a country I have
made the decision to reduce pesticide

245
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:58,510
use by 50 percent and Denmark was the
first country to do that and sweden ii

246
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:05,169
and sweden in 1992 or last year it
already achieved their 50 percent

247
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:12,380
reduction in pesticide use and this year
they've implemented another program to

248
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:23,090
another 50% reduction in pesticide use
well what we did at Cornell was to make

249
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:30,530
a study I think there's 40 different
crops and all of the non chemical

250
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:37,280
technologies that exist and then examine
aren't asked well two questions could we

251
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:43,460
in the United States implement a program
to reduce pesticide use by 50 percent

252
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:48,020
and how much would it cost and that's
what technologies we already have

253
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,309
available similar to course that Sweden
or Denmark or Netherlands are

254
00:27:52,309 --> 00:28:02,090
implementing next slide well skip next
one now what one of the things we want

255
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:07,039
to do a course in your trying to reduce
pesticide use is make better use of your

256
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:13,760
natural enemies such as this a fat lion
that you see here next slide

257
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:22,030
and that makes making judicious use of
pesticides this is the potato beetle and

258
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:28,460
using crop rotations and short season
potatoes anyway there are a lot of

259
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:34,190
different technologies that we can use
to deal with some of these serious pests

260
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:40,610
next slide and I'm not talking about
total elimination of pesticides I'm

261
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:49,000
talking about reducing the amounts that
are that have to be used through

262
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,980
implementation of non chemical controls
through the judicious use of pesticides

263
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:03,260
and crop rotations are a benefit not
only to insect control but diseases and

264
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:10,570
weeds and obviously help reduce soil
erosion and soil degradation next slide

265
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:19,580
and then because one weapon that we have
in pest control against insects is using

266
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:25,529
some of the diseases that affect them on
the slide here you see

267
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:31,049
the the one on your left the caterpillar
on your left is a healthy cabbage looper

268
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:38,580
the cabbage looper on your right is one
of the whitish one is full of virus

269
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:44,340
crystals and these virus crystals have
looked like pure crystals under the

270
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:52,799
microscope and that animal is totally
packed with virus crystals and it's a

271
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,649
highly pathogenic virus if you take two
caterpillars well such as the next slide

272
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:09,840
24 hours later this is the cat l and if
you just take two caterpillars like that

273
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:16,950
and you mix them in a hundred gallons of
water and spread it over an acre of land

274
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:24,269
you can kill 98% of the cabbage loopers
that are present there so it's a very

275
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:31,590
effective highly pathogenic organism
unfortunately even though every one of

276
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:37,769
us in this room was eaten the virus in
our coleslaw or lettuce and so forth and

277
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:43,889
not affected us or at least not that we
know APA is still not approved the use

278
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:52,830
of this virus yet next slide now there
are a lot of and I'm not going to go

279
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:56,580
through all the loads that's just a list
of some of the non chemical controls

280
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:04,159
that are available to us that we can use
and implement to reduce pesticide use

281
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:11,850
and you can't there isn't any one of
them that is perfect and what we should

282
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:18,210
be doing is being very selective and
using those that are most appropriate

283
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:25,409
and I guess that what Professor Pedigo
said is very appropriate there is no

284
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:30,120
silver bullet for pest control and we
ought to be using a combinations

285
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:35,429
depending on the particular situation
the pest and the environment the crop

286
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:40,500
and and so forth next
slide but it does illustrate the

287
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:47,880
complexity that we're dealing with and
this is a shot in Kansas that the lake

288
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:53,700
professor painter provided me showing
you wheat on the right here the

289
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:59,159
susceptible to the hessian fly and we on
your left that is resistant to the

290
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:05,240
hessian fly and so this is one more
technology that is available to us and

291
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:11,880
can be used effectively depending on the
crop depending on the pests and so forth

292
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:27,299
next slide now I'll skip that one the
next one that's well anyway I know what

293
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:33,389
the what I hope to be my last slide is
that that we could achieve a 50%

294
00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:41,389
reduction in pesticide use in the United
States you can turn the lights on and

295
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:49,620
without a reduction in yield without a
change in cosmetic standards and that we

296
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:57,029
could do this with an increase in food
prices of only 0.6% now what I also

297
00:32:57,029 --> 00:33:05,330
emphasize that this calculation of a
point six percent increase in food costs

298
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:12,299
implementing a 50% reduction in
pesticide use does not include the

299
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:19,260
benefits of public health of reducing
pesticides on public health or reducing

300
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:24,809
pesticides on the environment if you
take into consideration those benefits

301
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:33,210
Aventa costs I in general there should
be a net benefit to society by reducing

302
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:39,580
pesticide use by 50 percent and it can
be done as a

303
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:44,980
one country has already achieved their
50% reduction in three others are unwell

304
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,600
on their way to achieving this 50%
reduction so this is not something that

305
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:57,820
is pie in the sky I'd be happy to answer
questions very well I guess we got quite

306
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:21,820
a bit of time no way good
any comments a question I what are two

307
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:29,859
bits of information in Central America
where we were working on cotton because

308
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:34,419
the I was going to say the workers were
careless I should really put it the

309
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:38,050
other way around that is that the
managers of these firms were very

310
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:42,760
careless they sprayed these workers
while they were in there in the field

311
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,339
they allowed to fit their field workers
to go into the field to pick cotton or

312
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:54,310
weed right after the fields have been
treated and so that they were getting

313
00:34:54,310 --> 00:35:00,820
wet with the pesticide in there that of
course we don't do in the US but even in

314
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:05,800
the US right after DDT was banned and
there was an increase in paradigm and

315
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,540
several of these other more toxic
materials there was about a three-fold

316
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:19,510
increase in the number of deaths in the
u.s. now one has to say if we were

317
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:25,750
careful there shouldn't be these deaths
because we know how to handle it safely

318
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:33,730
and so forth but of course accidents do
do happen and in Central America we also

319
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:37,420
would know how to handle it but it's not
being done and I'm not just blaming

320
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:41,020
Central America there is the curse
that's where I mentioned Central America

321
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,609
only because we worked there for a while

322
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:47,730
yes

323
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:05,230
and of course you know that has problems
because I know I'm sweet in some of

324
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:19,720
these other countries some of these
toxic materials and so that's there's no

325
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:41,170
good way for we were using the same
materials or reducing the materials to

326
00:36:41,170 --> 00:37:10,060
achieve really amount of the frequency
and so forth is still there it's just

327
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:14,230
that yeah materials more active with
appeared oh that there was a reduction

328
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:19,750
when in corn we haven't talked to the
pyrethroids so really you know it's not

329
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:25,440
sure
yeah yeah that's a that's a good point

330
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:41,710
and by rejoyce have their problems in
viola yes to make the shift yeah you

331
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:48,280
couldn't do it overnight well I'd say in
general sustainable agriculture is more

332
00:37:48,280 --> 00:38:04,480
knowledge intensive so it takes more
knowledge now to do that of course it

333
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,730
means that you've got the training
people to use this new knowledge in new

334
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:17,760
approaches and that would take time to
achieve a sweet knitted in five years

335
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,620
some of the other countries are have
plans to do it in about 10 years but

336
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:31,120
it's not substituting alternative
technologies but chemicals will take

337
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:37,860
training ten dollars yes

338
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:01,090
there would be no increase fertilizer
use know we didn't decrease to fertilize

339
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:06,670
the use in that sustainable system that
we had there through use uh well first

340
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:13,450
of all keeping the soil in place that is
preventing 20 tons of soil being lost

341
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:19,780
from the land you know each ton of soil
has about four kilos of nitrogen plus

342
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:25,990
other nutrients but making use of
livestock manure in that particular

343
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:30,880
system not did cost us in labor of
course to do that but as far as reducing

344
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:49,810
the pesticide no there was no impact on
the fertilizer I would say we on corn

345
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:53,830
there was decreased energy but I
wouldn't want to say that for all the

346
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:59,680
other crops because we now know we have
to really look at that crop by crop in

347
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,900
general I would guess that it it
wouldn't increase the amount of energy

348
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,810
but I wouldn't want to say that a
decrease in either at this at this

349
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:15,119
moment yes

350
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:45,580
the question here is Sweden and Denmark
appear to be progressive and will we

351
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:53,050
ever in the United States achieve this
type of a change I think we will but if

352
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:59,650
I look for the DD banning DD T is the
model decision then I would say it takes

353
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:04,720
us 10 years after Sweden to get to the
point where we will make a similar

354
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:10,270
decision but I think the climate is
certainly coming and remember this

355
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:18,220
change in Sweden and Denmark did not
come from agriculture or entomologist it

356
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:23,860
came from the politicians listening to
the people now already in the United

357
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:31,030
States and the survey by Food and Drug
Administration I didn't know there was

358
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:37,360
97 and 96 percent some of that vicinity
all the public are concerned about

359
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:48,670
pesticides in their food today growing
concern in the credibility of EPA has

360
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:52,140
dropped significantly

361
00:41:53,040 --> 00:42:00,760
yes and so there is this climate and
pressure to trying to do something about

362
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:06,460
it in and certainly once we see the
success of Sweden and Denmark and Norway

363
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:09,820
- although they haven't passed
legislation that they certainly well on

364
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:15,310
their way and the Netherlands and the
province of Ontario incidentally in

365
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:23,980
Ontario the specialist who's in charge
of reducing as implementing the program

366
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:29,200
to reduce pesticide use
I thought the farmers would be resistant

367
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,960
to this and he talked about opposite he
said the Pirates are highly supportive

368
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,520
of this whole program to reduce
pesticide use and he said the three

369
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:46,990
reasons one pesticides cost of money -
they're the ones that are applying these

370
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:51,850
toxic materials and they're being
exposed their families being exposed and

371
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:57,940
three they also have a concern about the
environment I must admit I didn't expect

372
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:03,610
this talk about all three not just the
last one but they're really highly

373
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:10,390
supportive of this program out there I
don't know about Sweden and Denmark well

374
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:17,160
it never asked a question there someone
else had a question yes sir

375
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:25,090
herbicides insecticides and punishment
right and then the actual reduction that

376
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:29,710
we look at paper in achieving this
reduction we could achieve the greatest

377
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:37,170
reduction in herbicides second and
insecticides and lease fungicides

378
00:43:51,890 --> 00:44:17,670
and you know price supports is playing a
very important role in reducing crop

379
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:22,380
rotation and it's also played a very
important role in separating livestock

380
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:30,390
production from integrated with grain
production and so there's a whole array

381
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:34,589
and the marketing orders as far as
changing cosmetic standards not that

382
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:38,339
that's important in the brain so much
but there's been a whole array of

383
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:45,150
factors that the government I'm talking
about federal government has played a

384
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:51,410
very important role in encouraging soil
erosion and cryogen fertilizer use and

385
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:56,970
encouraging pesticide use and so one
first step would be to get the damn

386
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:01,890
government straightened out and
supportive of sustainable agriculture in

387
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:08,640
reducing our reliance on chemicals and
that would be the very first step and

388
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:15,960
let me yellow and indicate in I think we
could go beyond a 50% reduction if you

389
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:22,680
will allow changes in the price supports
and deficiency payments and marketing

390
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:29,339
orders and you'll also allow this to use
pesticides at dosages that are effective

391
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:34,950
instead of using the label dosages on
the pan and I indicated

392
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:40,530
mentioned this afternoon I have one of
my past students in Galway he's working

393
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:48,059
with true and he is demonstrated clearly
that in using certain insecticides that

394
00:45:48,059 --> 00:45:53,940
using one-fifth or one-tenth the dosage
is on the label he can get more

395
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:59,309
effective control and I want to imply
more effective control because he's a

396
00:45:59,309 --> 00:46:05,430
lot he can save the natural enemies and
make use of them in the pest control

397
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:11,700
system so now if you'll let me do some
research and determine the appropriate

398
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:18,359
dosages we could go further than that
reduction if you will allow me all those

399
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:23,849
changes combat extent his marketing
price apart and getting the proper

400
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:29,000
dosage I think we could go to a
seven-year
