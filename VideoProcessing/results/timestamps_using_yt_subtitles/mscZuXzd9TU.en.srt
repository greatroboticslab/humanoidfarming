00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
in Japan an Innovative approach to

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,359
watermelon cultivation has given rise to

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,400
a unique and fascinating phenomenon

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:09,840
square watermelons

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,240
unlike their traditional round

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,519
counterparts these watermelons are grown

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,139
inside square boxes resulting in their

8
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,600
distinctive shape

9
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,400
Japan known for its limited space sought

10
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,619
a solution to efficiently utilize

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,140
available storage areas

12
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,240
by growing watermelons in boxes farmers

13
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:30,300
can stack them neatly optimizing storage

14
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,099
capacity and transportation efficiency

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,200
the process involves placing young

16
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:36,180
watermelon fruits inside transparent

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,399
containers allowing them to grow and

18
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,440
assume the shape of the box

19
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,660
this meticulous cultivation technique

20
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,340
requires constant monitoring and precise

21
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,540
adjustments to ensure the desired

22
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,399
outcome

23
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,140
while the square watermelons do not

24
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,059
differ in taste or nutritional value

25
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,739
from their rounded Brethren they have

26
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,840
become a symbol of Ingenuity and

27
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:56,840
resourcefulness in Japanese agriculture
