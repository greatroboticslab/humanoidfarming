  "text": "soy beans or edamame are one of the tastiest beans you can grow in your garden in today's episode we will show you everything from planting soybeans and harvesting them as well as a delicious edamame recipe so there are two ways to start soybeans you can get seed packets from home depot or loaves and sow the seeds when the weather is warm enough for soybeans to grow spring summer and fall are the best times soybeans can grow very well in the summer heat here in southern california when starting from seeds you can sow six to eight seeds in one whiskey barrel container like you see here the soil we have is a mix of compost peat moss and perlite after sowing the seeds make sure you water well and now you're done sowing the seeds the other way to grow soy beans is to grow it from transplants you can buy six-pack starter plants at your local nurseries like the one you see here and then plant them buying transplants for soybean saves you a lot of time growing it from seeds once again we are growing this in a whiskey barrel container and we are planting six plants in one barrel this container is 22 inches wide and 15 inches tall holds about two and a half cubic feet of soil our planting mix already has a good mix of organic nutrients in the soil we will be using an organic liquid fertilizer every two weeks as the plant grows as well as some worm tea links to all these products will be provided in the video description once planted water well so that the roots can settle into their new home soybeans grow best in temperatures of 75 to 85 degrees fahrenheit in a few weeks from planting you can see two things the plant has problems with both insects and diseases caterpillars spider mites they all love the soybean plant making growing soybeans a challenging project in your garden and here you can see a fungal disease called rust which the soybean plant is very prone to it's a brown powder like fungal disease on the plant you can also see spider mite damage on the soybean plant in a very short span of time so what do you do well it's neem oil to the rescue neem oil is an insecticide to kill insects it's a fungicide to stop rust and it's also a miticide which means it can stop spider mites so a generous drenching of diluted neem oil will give some respite to these soybean plants spray both under and over the leaves and drench the plant completely repeat this weekly till you don't see any signs of insects or diseases and as you can see even after the weekly neem oil applications the rust and the spider mites have emerged stronger the plant still has some damage due to these however does this really affect production well we'll soon find out soybeans grow in full sun so choose a nice sunny spot with at least 6 to 8 hours of sunlight for your soybeans we are transplanting six more soybean plants into this raised bed which receives a lot of sunlight and here you can see the progress after a few days you can see that the rust and spider mites are still an issue here with these soybean plants growing on the raised bed so it's been about two months since we transplanted our seedlings and now you can see the soybeans forming pods and within these pods are the actual soybeans or edamame so it's the time to harvest when harvesting remove the entire pods and this is how soybeans look like they look pretty good and i really wish these plants were a little rust resistant but overall for the size of the plants we are getting a decent harvest so what's the biggest advantage of growing soybeans at home well they are non-gmo they are much better for your health than commercially grown soybeans and they are very delicious as well to get a good harvest of soy beans remember to fertilize your soybean plants with a good organic liquid fertilizer as well as worm tea for good results and here is a harvest as you can see we got a lot of soybeans for the size of the plants we had so i'm quite happy with the results if i had grown more plants i would have gotten more soybeans the soybean plants growing in our raised beds also gave us some soybeans but you can see the plant had no vigor despite us providing all the nutrients as well as protection from insects and diseases let's open up these soybean pods to show you how the soybean looks like inside the pods and these are the soy beans that you can eat raw or steamed or cooked once the plants have completed producing their pods for harvest you can go ahead and remove the plants what i wanted to show you here is to pay attention to the roots the soybean plant has roots that are relatively shallow which means that you can grow them in shallower containers as well like the one smaller than the whiskey barrel containers shown here soybean plants fix nitrogen in the soil they have bacteria in their roots that fix nitrogen from the air and make it available for the plant to use since these plants had fungal diseases like rust i will not be composting these plants but rather they will go into the yard waste bin and now let's look at a delicious recipe for our harvested soy beans or edamame we are preparing air fried edamame first we take the soy beans whole with the pods in a bowl then we add in some salt i usually use himalayan salt but this time i had sea salt so that's what we'll be using add in a little bit of oil remember that very little of this oil will be actually absorbed by the edamame but adding oil gives a very nice flavor to the pods when you're eating the edamame and that is quite amazing the oil also helps the salt to stick to the pods more evenly you can skip the oil if you do not want it you can preheat your air fryer if needed i did not add the soy bean pods or edamame to the airfryer set the airfryer to 375 degrees fahrenheit and cook for about 15-20 minutes tossing them around the halfway mark soybean dishes are actually called edamame because in japanese the term edamame means stem beans or the preparation where beans are still attached to the pod when cooking as you can see here the pods protect the soy beans from overcooking and these home grown soybeans will be one of the best tasting soy beans you will ever eat soy beans are packed with protein and are very important part of a healthy vegetarian or vegan diet you can also steam your soybeans and add a little salt for a delicious dish growing soybeans is one of the best summer treats from your garden so i highly recommend that you try growing soy beans this season so there we have it folks that was our episode on growing soybeans
