00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:12,000
When people come to the extension office asking
about pesticides, they oftentimes have questions

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,500
about the effectiveness or availability of
organic pesticide options.

3
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:23,730
Now, there are many options available that
are considered or labeled as organic and are

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,109
certified for organic production.

5
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:30,720
Despite the fact that a product may be labelled
as organic, it’s still important that we

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,710
take the proper precautions and use the appropriate
PPE, or personal protective equipment.

7
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:42,410
And this means, at a minimum, we should have
a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, shoes, socks,

8
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,550
chemical resistant gloves, and preferably
eye protection as well.

9
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,869
It’s also important to remember that these
products can also be toxic to beneficial insects,

10
00:00:51,869 --> 00:00:54,239
such as our pollinators, if used incorrectly.

11
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,080
So, it’s still very important that we open
the label, take the time to read it, and familiarize

12
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,030
yourself with the product, and understand
how to safely use that product.

13
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,220
Due to a limited availability, there’s not
always going to be an organic option for every

14
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:14,710
pest, so you may have to get creative or look
at other control measures in some cases.

15
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:18,729
Even if a product is listed as organic, it’s
still important that when using that product

16
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:21,920
that we take the proper precautions and treat
that as a chemical.

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,090
This has been Caleb Carter with the University
of Wyoming Extension, and you’re watching
